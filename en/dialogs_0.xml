<string name="222">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Dex 15+.
Required for: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting.
Specifics: When fighting with two weapons, this feat reduces the penalty of the off-hand weapon by 4.
Use: Used automatically when fighting with two weapons. Rangers receive this feat for free at level 1.
</string>
<string name="223">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Armor Proficiency (Light) and Armor Proficiency (Medium).
Specifics: This feat grants the knowledge to make effective use of heavy armor.
Use: Automatic. Fighters, paladins, and clerics receive this feat for free.
</string>
<string name="224">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Armor Proficiency (Light).
Required for: Armor Proficiency (Heavy).
Specifics: This feat grants the knowledge to make effective use of medium armor.
Use: Automatic. All classes except monks, rogues, sorcerers, and wizards have this feat for free.

Prerequisite: None.
Required for: Armor Proficiency (Medium).
Specifics: This feat grants the knowledge to make effective use of light armor.
Use: Automatic. All classes except monks, sorcerers, and wizards have this feat for free.
</string>
<string name="226">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Base attack bonus of +1 or higher.
Specifics: Grants the ability to make a potentially disabling attack against an opponent&apos;s arms or legs. Called shots are made at a -4 penalty, and must overcome the target&apos;s Discipline skill check. A successful called shot against the legs reduces the opponent&apos;s movement rate by 20% and gives them a -2 to their dexterity. A successful called shot against the arms applies a cumulative -2 penalty to the creature&apos;s attack rolls.
Use: Selected.</string>
<string name="227">Type of Feat: Metamagic
Prerequisite: Ability to cast 2nd-level spells.
Specifics: All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by 50%. For example, an empowered magic missile deals one and one-half times normal damage (1d4 + 1 multiplied by 1.5). Empowerment does not increase spell duration.
Use: An empowered spell occupies a spell slot two levels higher than normal. Saving throws and opposed rolls, such as those made when Dispel Magic is cast, are not affected.
</string>
<string name="228">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Proficiency with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +8 or higher.
Specifics: Combat ability doubles the critical threat range with a given weapon. A longsword that normally threatens a critical on a roll of 19-20 would now threaten a critical on a roll of 17-20.
Use: Automatic. The threat range of a Keen weapon is already doubled, increasing to triple with this feat. This feat can be selected multiple times, applying to a new weapon category each time.
Special: Halflings and Gnomes are small creatures and as such they can never use the following large weapons - dire mace, double bladed sword, doubleaxe, greataxe, greatsword, halberd, heavy flail, and scythe.</string>
<string name="229">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Int 13+, Disarm.
Specifics: A character with this feat has learned not to provoke an attack of opportunity when attempting a disarm. Success knocks the opponent&apos;s weapon from his hands. The penalty to make a disarm attempt is reduced to -4.
Use: Selected.
</string>
<string name="230">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite:  Int 13+, Knockdown, base attack bonus +7.
Specifics: A character with this feat counts as one size category larger when he makes a knockdown attack. All other knockdown conditions still apply. 
Use: Selected. Monks receive this feat for free at level 6.</string>
<string name="231">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Two-Weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity, base attack bonus +9 or higher.
Specifics: The character with this feat is able to get a second off-hand attack (at a penalty of -5 to his attack roll).
Use: Automatic. Rangers receive this feat at level 9, even if they don&apos;t meet the requirements.</string>
<string name="232">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: None.
Required for: Stunning Fist, Deflect Arrows.
Specifics: Armed opponents no longer get attacks of opportunity against the character when he attempts an unarmed attack.
Use: Automatic. Monks receive this feat for free at Level 1.</string>
<string name="233">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: None.
Required for: Rapid Shot.
Specifics: A character with this feat negates the -4 penalty for using missile weapons in melee, and gains an additional +1 to attack and damage with ranged weapons when the target is within 15 feet.
Use: Automatic.</string>
<string name="234">Type of Feat: Metamagic
Prerequisite: Ability to cast 4th-level spells.
Specifics: Quickened spells can be cast instantaneously, making them invulnerable to counterspells or interruption. A quickened spell is cast as a free action, and another action can be attempted within the same round, including the casting of another spell. Only one quickened spell can be cast per round.
Use: Quickened spells occupy spell slots four levels higher than normal.</string>
<string name="235">The OnDisturbed Event occurs when the object has been disturbed in some fashion, such as when its inventory is modified by another object.</string>
<string name="236">Type of Feat: Metamagic
Prerequisite: Ability to cast 1st-level spells.
Specifics: Silent spells are cast without a verbal component.
Use: A silenced spell occupies a spell slot one level higher than normal. </string>
<string name="237">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Ability to cast 1st-level spells.
Required for: Greater Spell Penetration.
Specifics: A spellcaster with this feat gains a +2 bonus to caster level checks to beat a creature&apos;s spell resistance.
Use: Automatic.</string>
<string name="238">Type of Feat: Metamagic
Prerequisite: Ability to cast 1st-level spells.
Specifics: Still spells are cast without a somatic component. Any penalties incurred from casting in armor do not apply to a spell prepared with this feat.
Use: A stilled spell occupies a spell slot one level higher than normal.
</string>
<string name="239">Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: None.
Required For: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting.
Specifics: A character with this feat reduces the penalties suffered when fighting with two weapons. The normal penalty of -6 to the primary hand and -10 to the off-hand becomes -4 for the primary hand and -8 for the off-hand. The Ambidexterity feat further reduces the attack penalty for the second weapon by 4 (to -4/-4). Best results are achieved if the off-hand weapon is light, further reducing the penalty for both the primary and off-hand by 2 (to -2/-2). Rangers receive this feat for free at level 1.
Use: This feat is used automatically during combat.</string>
<string name="240">Barbarians are brave, even reckless warriors, and their great strength and heartiness makes them well suited for adventure. Barbarians scornfully reject the fighter traditions of arms training and discipline, instead tapping into a powerful rage that makes them stronger, tougher, and better able to withstand attacks. They only have the energy for a few such displays per day, but it is usually sufficient. Constant exposure to danger also gives barbarians a sort of &quot;sixth sense,&quot; a preternatural ability to sense danger and dodge attacks, and their running stamina is legendary.

- Alignment Restrictions: Any nonlawful.
- Hit Die: d12.
- Proficiencies: All simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.
- Skill Points (Int Modifier * 4 at 1st level): 4 + Int Modifier.
- Ex-Barbarians: Barbarians are unable to progress in levels if their alignment ever becomes lawful.</string>
<string name="241">Bards often serve as negotiators, messengers, scouts, and spies. They love to accompany heroes (and villains) to witness heroic (or villainous) deeds firsthand, since a bard who can tell a story from personal experience earns renown among his fellows. A bard casts arcane spells without any advance preparation, much like a sorcerer. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions, and the bard can also play an inspiring song that strengthens him and his allies. Bards also share some specialized skills with rogues, and their knowledge of item lore is nearly unmatched. 

WARNING: To cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell&apos;s level. For example, to cast a 3rd-level spell, a bard must have a Charisma of 13.

Standard Abilities:
- Alignment Restrictions: Any nonlawful.
- Hit Die: d6.
- Proficiencies: Proficient with simple weapons. Also proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 4 + Int Modifier.
- Spellcasting: Arcane (Charisma-based, no spell preparation, spell failure from armor is a factor); Bards begin the game knowing all cantrips.
- Ex-Bards: Bards cannot gain levels of experience while they are of any lawful alignment.</string>
<string name="242">Clerics act as intermediaries between the earthly and the divine (or infernal) worlds. A good cleric helps those in need, while an evil cleric seeks to spread his patron&apos;s vision of evil across the world. All clerics can heal wounds and bring people back from the brink of death, and powerful clerics can even raise the dead. Likewise, all clerics have authority over undead creatures, and they can turn away or even destroy these creatures. Clerics are trained in the use of simple weapons, and can use all forms of armor and shields without penalty, since armor does not interfere with the casting of divine spells. In addition to his normal complement of spells, every cleric chooses to focus on two of his deity&apos;s domains. These domains grants the cleric special powers, and give him access to spells that he might otherwise never learn. 

WARNING: To cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell&apos;s level. For example, to cast a 2nd-level spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom of 12.

- Hit Die: d8.
- Proficiencies: All simple weapons, all armor, and shields.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 2 + Int Modifier.
- Spellcasting: Divine (Wisdom-based, spell failure from armor is ignored).
</string>
<string name="243">Druids are divine spellcasters who receive their spells from nature, not the gods. They strive to live in harmony with the natural world, and hate anything that is not part of the natural cycle, especially aberrations and undead creatures. As they gain experience, they learn to take the shapes of animals and eventually of more powerful creatures. The strict oaths taken by every druid prohibit using weapons and armor outside their tradition.

WARNING: To cast a spell, a druid must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell&apos;s level. For example, to cast a 4th-level spell, a druid must have a Wisdom of 14.

- Alignment Restrictions: Must be neutral good, lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral, or neutral evil.
- Hit Die: d8.
- Proficiencies: Proficient with druidic weapons, as well as light and medium armor and shields.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 4 + Int Modifier.
- Spellcasting: Divine (Wisdom-based, armor-related chance of spell failure is ignored).
- Ex-Druids: A druid who is no longer neutral cannot gain levels.</string>
<string name="244">Fighters can be many things, from soldiers to criminal enforcers. Some see adventure as a way to get rich, while others use their skills to protect the innocent. Fighters have the best all-around fighting capabilities of the PC classes, and they are trained to use all standard weapons and armor. A fighter&apos;s rigorous martial training grants him many bonus feats as he progresses, and high-level fighters have access to special melee maneuvers and exotic weapons not available to any other character.

- Hit Die: d10.
- Proficiencies: All simple and martial weapons, all armor, and shields.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 2 + Int Modifier.</string>
<string name="245">Monks are versatile warriors skilled at fighting without weapons or armor. Good-aligned monks serve as protectors of the people, while evil monks make ideal spies and assassins. Though they don&apos;t cast spells, monks channel a subtle energy, called ki. This energy allows them to perform amazing feats, such as healing themselves, catching arrows in flight, and dodging blows with lightning speed. Their mundane and ki-based abilities grow with experience, granting them more power over themselves and their environment. Monks suffer unique penalties to their abilities if they wear armor, as doing so violates their rigid oaths. A monk wearing armor loses their Wisdom and level based armor class bonuses, their movement speed, and their additional unarmed attacks per round.

- Alignment Restrictions: Any lawful.
- Hit Die: d8.
- Proficiencies: Proficient with monk weapons.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 4 + Int Modifier.</string>
<string name="246">Paladins take their adventures seriously, and even a mundane mission is, in the heart of the paladin, a personal test - an opportunity to demonstrate bravery, to learn tactics, and to do good in the world. Divine power protects these warriors of virtue, warding off harm, protecting them from disease, healing them and their allies, and guarding against fear. Divine power also guides their sword arms, making them among the most effective warriors against undead and evil outsiders. Many of the paladin&apos;s special abilities also benefit from a high Charisma score.

WARNING: To cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell&apos;s level. For example, to cast a 2nd-level spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom of 12.

- Alignment Restrictions: Lawful good only.
- Hit Die: d10.
- Proficiencies: All simple and martial weapons, all armor, and shields.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 2 + Int Modifier.
- Spellcasting: Paladin Spells. Divine (Wisdom based, armor-related chance of spell failure is ignored).
- Ex-Paladins: A paladin that is no longer lawful good cannot gain levels until their alignment is lawful good again.
</string>
<string name="247">Rangers are skilled stalkers and hunters who make their home in the woods. Their martial skill is nearly the equal of the fighter, but they lack the latter&apos;s dedication to the craft of fighting. Instead, the ranger focuses his skills and training on a specific enemy - a type of creature he bears a vengeful grudge against and hunts above all others. Rangers often accept the role of protector, aiding those who live in or travel through the woods. His skills allow him to move quietly and stick to the shadows, especially in natural settings, and he also has special knowledge of certain types of creatures. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw on natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does, and like a druid he is often accompanied by animal companions. 

WARNING: To cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell&apos;s level. For example, to cast a 3rd-level spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom of 13.

- Hit Die: d10.
- Proficiencies: All simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and shields.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 4 + Int Modifier.
- Spellcasting: Ranger Spells. Divine (Wisdom based, armor-related chance of spell failure is ignored).</string>
<string name="248">Rogues have little in common with each other. While some - maybe even the majority - are stealthy thieves, many serve as scouts, spies, investigators, diplomats, and simple thugs. Rogues are versatile, adaptable, and skilled at getting what others don&apos;t want them to get. While not equal to a fighter in combat, a rogue knows how to hit where it hurts, and a sneak attack can dish out a lot of damage. Rogues also seem to have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop nearly magical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks. In addition, while not capable of casting spells on their own, a rogue can sometimes &quot;fake it&quot; well enough to cast spells from scrolls, activate wands, and use just about any other magic item.

- Hit Die: d6.
- Proficiencies: Proficient with rogue weapons and light armor. Rogues are not proficient with shields.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 8 + Int Modifier.</string>
<string name="249">Sorcerers are arcane spellcasters who manipulate magic energy with imagination and talent rather than studious discipline. They have no books, no mentors, no theories - just raw power that they direct at will. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire them more slowly, but they can cast individual spells more often and have no need to prepare their incantations ahead of time. Also unlike wizards, sorcerers cannot specialize in a school of magic. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they have more time to learn fighting skills and are proficient with simple weapons.

WARNING: To cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score of 10 + the spell&apos;s level. For example, to cast a 9th-level spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma of 19.

- Hit Die: d4.
- Proficiencies: All simple weapons. Sorcerers are not proficient with armor or shields.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 2 + Intelligence Modifier.
- Spellcasting: Arcane (Charisma-based, no spell preparation, spell failure from armor is a factor).</string>
<string name="250">Wizards are arcane spellcasters who depend on intensive study to create their magic. To wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art. When they are prepared for battle, wizards can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. The wizard&apos;s strength is her spells; everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. A wizard can call a familiar: a small, magical, creature that serves her.

WARNING: To cast a spell, a wizard must have a Intelligence score of 10 + the spell&apos;s level. For example, to cast a 9th-level spell, a wizard must have a Intelligence of 19.

- Hit Die: d4.
- Proficiencies: Proficient with wizard weapons. Wizards are not proficient with armor or shields.
- Skill Points (*4 at 1st level): 2 + Int Modifier.
- Spellcasting: Arcane (Intelligence-based, spell preparation is required, spell failure from armor is a factor); wizards begin the game knowing all cantrips and four 1st-level spells.</string>

<string name="445">Male Help Text</string>
<string name="446">Female Help Text</string>
<string name="447">The choice of making your character Male or Female is purely an aesthetic one, as both are equally capable. In Neverwinter Nights, gender has no bearing on the ways in which skills or abilities are applied.</string>
<string name="448">A chaotic evil character does whatever his greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to do. He is hot-tempered, vicious, and unpredictable. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are poorly organized. Typically, chaotic evil people can only be made to work together by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him. The demented sorcerer pursuing mad schemes of vengeance and havoc is chaotic evil. Chaotic evil represents the destruction not only of beauty and life but of the order on which beauty and life depend.</string>
<string name="449">A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect. He believes in goodness and right, but has little use for laws and regulations. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society. A ranger who waylays the evil baron&apos;s tax collectors is chaotic good. Chaotic good combines a good heart with a free spirit. </string>
<string name="450">A chaotic neutral character is an individualist, resents restrictions, and challenges tradition. He does not intentionally promote anarchy, however, as that would require he be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make others suffer). A bard who wanders the land living by his wits is chaotic neutral. Chaotic neutral represents freedom both from society&apos;s restrictions and from a do-gooder&apos;s zeal, though a character of this alignment is not totally random in his actions. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.</string>
<string name="451">A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he wants within the limits of his code of conduct. He cares about tradition, loyalty, and order, but not about freedom, dignity, or life. He is loath to break laws or promises, partly because he depends on order to protect himself. Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing in cold blood, and imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled thugs. The scheming baron who exploits his people is lawful evil. Lawful evil represents methodical, intentional evil.</string>
<string name="452">A lawful good character has the commitment and discipline to oppose and fight evil relentlessly. She tells the truth, keeps her word, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished. A paladin who fights evil without mercy and who protects the innocent without hesitation is lawful good. Lawful good emphasizes honor and compassion.</string>
<string name="453">A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code direct her. She may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government. A monk who follows her discipline without being swayed by the demands of those in need nor by the temptations of evil is lawful neutral. Lawful neutral means that you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.</string>
<string name="454">A neutral evil villain does whatever she can get away with, shedding no tears for those she harms. She has no love of order and holds no illusion that following laws, traditions, or codes would make her any more noble. However, she doesn&apos;t have the restless nature or love of conflict that a chaotic evil villain has. The criminal who robs and murders to get what she wants is neutral evil. Neutral evil represents evil without honor and without variation.</string>
<string name="455">A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them. A cleric who helps others according to their needs is neutral good. Neutral good means doing what is good without bias toward or against order.</string>
<string name="456">A true neutral character doesn&apos;t feel strongly one way or the other about good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. She thinks good is better than evil - after all, she&apos;d rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones - but she&apos;s not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way. A wizard who devotes herself to her art and is bored by the semantics of moral debate is true neutral. Some true neutral characters, however, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as dangerous extremes. They advocate neutrality as the most balanced road in the long run. Neutral means you act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.
</string>
<string name="457">WARNING:
We strongly suggest that you make use of the &quot;Recommended&quot; button. This will optimize your attributes for the class that you have selected. You can still modify your stats after pressing the &quot;Recommended&quot; button. If you do not use the recommended statistics you may create a character that is significantly more difficult to play.

The basic statistics that define your character are divided among six ability scores. Each of these represents a particular aspect of your character, and skills that draw from these traits are modified depending on your score in them. Certain classes also favor one ability over others, and derive much of their strength from a high score in these areas.</string>
<string name="458">Alignment reflects how your character relates to the concepts of good and evil, law and chaos. It can affect how certain NPCs react within the game, and will occasionally determine whether an item can be used or not (some items have alignments of their own, and will not allow a conflict with their user). The main purpose of alignment, however, is to act as a guideline for consistent roleplaying, though it is not set in stone. The alignment of a character can change to match the style in which they are played, if deviation is consistent and serious. All of the nine alignments listed are viable choices for adventurers, though the &quot;evil&quot; variants are more often the domain of villains and monsters.</string>
<string name="459">Strength measures the muscle and physical power of your character. This ability is especially important for fighters, barbarians, paladins, rangers, and monks because it helps them prevail in combat.</string>
<string name="460">Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is most important for rogues, but also for characters who typically wear light or medium armor (barbarians and rangers) or none at all (monks, wizards, and sorcerers), or for any character who wants to be a skilled archer.</string>
<string name="461">Constitution represents the health and stamina of your character. High constitution increases the number of hit points a character has (affecting how much damage they can take), and this makes it important for everyone, but especially so for fighters. If constitution ever increases, hit points increase retroactively as well. Spell-casters also need strong constitution to keep their spells from being interrupted during combat.</string>
<string name="462">Wisdom describes a character&apos;s willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition, whereas Intelligence represents the ability to analyze information. An &quot;absent-minded professor&quot; has low Wisdom and high Intelligence. A simpleton with low Intelligence might nevertheless be very perceptive (have high Wisdom). Wisdom is important for clerics and druids, affecting the strength and number of their spells, and is also significant for paladins and rangers. It is very important for monks as well, modifying many of their abilities. The wise character is capable of intuitively understanding others, occasionally having insights into their motivations.</string>
<string name="463">WARNING: An Intelligence lower than 9 means that your character is unable to speak properly.

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. Intelligence is important for wizards because it affects how many spells they can cast, how hard their spells are to resist, and how powerful their spells can be. It is also important for any character who wants to have a strong assortment of skills, however increasing your Intelligence will not grant bonus skill points retroactively. NOTE: Sorcerers do not use Intelligence for any of their spellcasting - Charisma is used instead.

<string name="478">Charisma measures a character&apos;s force of personality, persuasiveness, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. It represents actual personal strength, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important for paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, as it affects their ability to turn undead. All characters benefit from having a high charisma when speaking with others in the world. Charisma affects an NPC&apos;s initial reaction to the player and it modifies the player&apos;s Persuasion skill checks. NOTE: Charisma influences bard/sorcerer spells NOT intelligence.</string>

In selecting what class is right for your character, keep in mind what base strengths you want her to have. The eleven basic selections can approximate most any character concept.</string>

Packages are for players who wish to jump in and play the game without building a character from scratch. A package represents an automatic selection of skills and feats, specially chosen for a character of the class and race you have chosen. It also includes an assortment of basic equipment. A package character is ready to begin adventuring immediately.

These packages do not give any special abilities to your character, they simply configure your skills and feats so you don&apos;t have to.</string>

<string name="1417">Damage Resistance: This property is similar to damage immunity, in that the owner is protected from certain forms of damage. However, instead of a base chance to avoid all damage, the player instead resists a certain amount of damage per attack. For example, the character may be able to resist the first 5 points of fire damage he receives from every attack.</string>
<string name="1418">Damage Reduction - Condition: This property reduces damage suffered from weapons. Once applied, the damage reduced ranges from 5 to 30. A weapon which has a high-enough Enhancement Bonus, or is made from a specific material such as silver or iron, can overcome this property</string>
<string name="1419">Damage Type - No Base Damage: This property should be added to an item when you have an explicit reason to not require damage. For example, a training staff for use in sparring might be an appropriate item to add this property to.</string>
<string name="1420">Damage Type - Melee: The item deals melee damage in combat. For example, a sword or an axe inflicts melee damage on a target.</string>
<string name="1421">Damage Type - Ranged: The item deals ranged damage in combat. For example, the arrows from a longbow inflict ranged damage to a target.</string>
<string name="1422">Improved Spell Resistance: This property grants the user the ability to resist spells more effectively.</string>
<string name="1423">Double Stack: This property allows items to be stacked in higher quantities. Arrows that are normally stacked in piles of 20 could be stacked in piles of 40 with this property.</string>
<string name="1424">Masterwork: This is an item of exceptional quality. Masterwork items are not magic items, but do have a nonmagical enhancement bonus of +1 to attack and damage. </string>
<string name="1425">Caster Level(s): Druid 2 
Innate Level: 2
School: Transmutation

Component(s): Verbal, Somatic

The caster enters a rage similar to that of a barbarian. The caster gains a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 bonus to Will saves, while suffering a -1 penalty to AC.</string>
<string name="1426">Haste: This property increases the wielder&apos;s attacks per round by one, as per the Haste spell.</string>

Barkskin makes a creature&apos;s skin as tough as bark. The effect grants a +3 natural armor bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +4 at 6th level and to +5 at 12th level and up. Since the AC bonus is a natural armor bonus, it does not stack with any natural armor the subject may already have.
</string>
<string name="1666">Slashing and Piercing</string>
<string name="1667">A basic but versatile weapon, the dagger consists of a double-edged piercing blade that typically ranges from about six to 24 inches in length.</string>
<string name="1668">The mace is a derivative of the basic club, consisting of a stone or metal head mounted on the end of a wooden shaft. The weight of the head greatly increases the force of impact.</string>
<string name="1669">The sickle is a farming implement used for cutting grass and grains. Like many other such tools, it was adapted for use as a weapon by the peasants familiar with it in their daily toils.</string>
<string name="1670">The club is a very basic weapon, usually consisting of nothing more than a tapered length of hardwood.</string>
<string name="1671">The morningstar is a derivative of the mace that includes a chain tether - similar to the flail - to add velocity when swinging its compact striking surface. Morningstars commonly have at least one formidable spike as an added feature of the head.</string>
<string name="1672">Another of history&apos;s most basic weapons, the spear is nevertheless a formidable weapon. Little more that a simple shaft topped with a sharpened head, the spear is the staple of many a militia.</string>
<string name="1673">Usually crafted of hardwood and occasionally shod with metal at either end, the quarterstaff is a humble weapon that almost anyone can learn to use effectively.</string>
<string name="1674">The crossbow resembles a bow laid crosswise on a wood or metal shaft, and is favored for its versatility. The light crossbow variant is durable and reasonably easy to conceal, but lacks some of the punch of its larger cousin.</string>
<string name="1675">Bolts or quarrels are the standard ammunition for all types of crossbows, varying in function depending on the shape of the head. </string>
<string name="1676">These missile weapons are close in size to a small dagger, and are hurled in combat toward their target.</string>
<string name="1677">The sling is an ancient weapon; a simple construction that is little more than a small pouch attached to a leather or fabric strip, and combined with suitable ammunition. </string>
<string name="1678">Sling bullets are smooth balls of metal that can produce severe bruising and even broken bones when launched effectively. </string>
<string name="1679">The heavy crossbow is the largest hand-held launcher of its type, and is favored by militia groups for its durability and ease of use. It is deadlier than its smaller cousin, but also more cumbersome. </string>
<string name="1680">The throwing axe bears little in common with the farm implement it is derived from. It has been carefully balanced for flight, sacrificing durability for precision.</string>
<string name="1681">The light hammer is derived from commonly used mining tools. It remains small enough to still be used in excavation, unlike the much heavier warhammer. </string>
<string name="1682">The handaxe is smaller than most axes used for combat, and is most often used as an off-hand weapon. </string>
<string name="1683">The sap or blackjack is a small leather bag filled with sand or some other dense material, and is used to knock out victims as quietly as possible. </string>
<string name="1684">One of the first types of sword to come into existence, the short sword is a double-edged weapon about two feet long. It is an economical weapon, and a favorite of archers and rogues.</string>
<string name="1685">The battleaxe consists of a single blade atop a three- or four-foot shaft. It is a versatile weapon, and remains a useful tool when not in combat.</string>
<string name="1686">Originally a farm implement for threshing grain, the light flail consists of a wooden shaft attached to a heavy or spiked head by a chain or hinge. The light flail is approximately two feet long.</string>
<string name="1687">The longsword is the weapon most commonly associated with knights and their ilk. There are many variations in the blade, but all are approximately 35 to 47 inches in length.</string>
<string name="1688">The rapier is a light, thrusting sword popular among nobles and swashbucklers. Often associated with dueling and sport fighting, rapiers are nonetheless deadly in trained hands.</string>
<string name="1689">The scimitar shares some similarities with the longsword and other slashing blades, but the severity and thickness of its curve clearly sets it apart. </string>
<string name="1690">Originally adapted from the tools of laborers and craftsmen, the warhammer is a far-heavier variant of the sledge and is no longer suitable for anything but combat.</string>
<string name="1691">Derived from a farm implement used for threshing grain, the heavy flail consists of a four-foot wooden shaft attached to a heavy or spiked head by a chain or hinge. </string>
<string name="1692">A favorite of barbarians, the greataxe is the largest of the weapons derived from the basic woodcutter&apos;s axe. The double-edged head is far more suited to cleaving opponents than trees. </string>
<string name="1693">The greatsword is an impressive weapon by any measure, and is held with two hands by all but the largest of creatures. </string>
<string name="1694">The halberd is the most common polearm, and could be called a cross between a spear and an axe. Such weapons are often mass-produced for militia, and serve well when defending against marauders. </string>
<string name="1695">A shortbow has a stave portion of about five feet in length. The shortbow was the first of such launchers to be developed, and it remains an effective weapon. </string>
<string name="1696">Arrows can vary in form and function, but most are 20 to 40 inches long and have some form of fletching (usually feathers) to provide stabilization. </string>
<string name="1697">The longbow is a refinement of the shortbow, designed to increase the range and power of an arrow strike. The stave portion of a longbow is nearly as tall as the archer, and can reach over six feet.</string>
<string name="1698">The composite longbow is the culmination of the bowyer&apos;s craft, combining multiple types of material within the bow&apos;s stave to greatly increase range and force of impact. </string>
<string name="1699">As with many weapons, the kama was adapted for combat by the peasants that used them as farming implements, often because they were forbidden from owning swords or the like. </string>

<string name="1701">Whatever can be said of the orc race, there is no doubting the impact they have had on warfare. The orc double axe is a perfect example, patterned after their &quot;One blade good, two blades better!&quot; wisdom.</string>
<string name="1702">The two-bladed sword is a marriage of concepts forged on the battlefield, combining the quickness and versatility of the quarterstaff with the edged effectiveness of two fearsome blades.</string>
<string name="1703">The dire mace is an attempt to combine the versatility of the quarterstaff with the striking power of the mace. </string>
<string name="1704">The katana is the pinnacle of the swordsmith&apos;s craft, combining grace and artful design with razor-edged efficiency. </string>
<string name="1705">Shuriken are light, easy to conceal, and while they do little damage individually, they can be thrown very quickly. </string>
<string name="1706">The repeating crossbow is a wonder of engineering, allowing the bearer to attack without the need to reload after each bolt is fired. However, replacing a clip of bolts takes a significant amount of time.</string>
<string name="1707">The wand is potentially a magically-charged item. Powers and effects vary greatly.</string>
<string name="1708">The rod is potentially a magically-charged item. Powers and effects vary greatly. </string>
<string name="1709">The staff is potentially a magically-charged item. Powers and effects vary greatly. </string>
<string name="1710">While offering no additional protection, helmets do come in a variety of styles.</string>
<string name="1711">Gauntlets and bracers are a part of most suits of armor, and do not increase their suit&apos;s protective abilities unless infused with magic.</string>
<string name="1712">Wearing gloves is usually just a matter of fashion, since they do not afford any protection unless infused with magic.</string>
<string name="1713">Boots come in a variety of forms and functions, but they do not add to the protection given by basic armor unless infused with magic.</string>
<string name="1714">Belts are worn about the midsection, but do not add to the protection given by basic armor unless infused with magic.</string>
<string name="1715">Amulets are necklaces with some form of large decoration or symbol. Most are ornamental, but some are potent magic items.</string>
<string name="1716">Rings are commonly worn on the fingers as ornamentation, but some are potent magic items.</string>
<string name="1717">The tower shield is a veritable wall of protection, though it can be quite cumbersome to carry on an adventure.</string>
<string name="1718">Spell scrolls bear magic runes and markings that enable them to store the magic of spells. A character who is able can use the scrolls or copy the spell for his own uses.</string>
<string name="1719">Potions store various spells, both beneficial and otherwise, until consumed.</string>
<string name="1720">A healer&apos;s kit contains various herbs, bandages, and salves, all of which can be used in conjunction with the Heal skill to heal wounds, cure poison, or remove diseases.</string>
<string name="1721">A trap kit contains various clamps, trip wires, and miscellaneous tools all designed to aid in setting traps. It is used in conjunction with the Set Traps skill to increase the chances of success.</string>
<string name="1722">A set of thieves&apos; tools includes skeleton keys, long metal picks, and assorted other tools that are all used in conjunction with the Open Lock skill to aid in the chances of success.</string>
<string name="1723">Keys come in a variety of shapes for all manner of locks. </string>
<string name="1724">A small leather or cloth container used for carrying miscellaneous objects.</string>
<string name="1725">Torches are little more than wooden rods topped by flax or cloth and soaked in tallow or some other flammable liquid. Very useful except when one wishes to be stealthy.</string>
<string name="1726">There are many unusual items in the game. This is one of them.</string>
<string name="1727">Piecemeal or complete armors of this grade are meager protection, no better than garments made of cloth or even rags. </string>

<string name="2693">Appraise</string>
<string name="2694">Ability: Intelligence.
Requires Training: No.
Classes: All.

The higher the character&apos;s skill the better the price received when selling or purchasing goods.

Check: The character makes an opposed roll against the merchant&apos;s Appraise skill. If the merchant wins, the characters pay more for the goods in the store. If the character wins, they pay less. The first time the player interacts with a merchant dictates the prices in that store until their Appraise skill improves.
Use: Automatic in stores.</string>
<string name="2695">Tumble</string>
<string name="2696">Ability: Dexterity.
Requires Training: Yes.
Classes: All.

The character with high tumbling is able to roll away from attacks during combat, positioning themselves safely at all times. Anytime the character might receive an attack of opportunity for moving past enemies, they will automatically attempt a tumble check against a DC of 15. If successful the attack is avoided. For every five ranks in this skill (not including Dexterity bonus) the character&apos;s armor class is also improved by +1.
Check: DC 15 to avoid attack of opportunity while moving.
Use: Automatic.</string>
<string name="2697">Craft Trap</string>

Requires Training: No.
Classes: All.

The character using this skill can combine raw components to form various trap kits. There is a 10% chance on any failed skill roll that the components are lost, even though a trap was not crafted.

Check: The DC is determined by the type of trap being created. The more powerful the trap, the more difficult it is to build and the more components it requires.

<string name="3360">You know what they say about the better part of valor? Time to exercise it. Let&apos;s get out of here!</string>
<string name="3361">I&apos;ve seen more impressive things than you on the underside of my boots. After mucking out a stable.</string>
<string name="3362">Somebody cover my back!</string>
<string name="3363">Hold it right there.</string>
<string name="3364">Oh, this isn&apos;t good... </string>
<string name="3365">Ugh. You know, I&apos;ve never been partial to poison.</string>
<string name="3366">Well, that didn&apos;t work.</string>
<string name="3367">So much for that weapon.</string>
<string name="3368">Don&apos;t just stand there, follow me!</string>
<string name="3369">Take a look over here, this is interesting.</string>
<string name="3370">All right, let&apos;s all gather &apos;round over here.</string>
<string name="3371">Shove over, will you?</string>
<string name="3372">Anybody here better than me at picking locks?</string>
<string name="3373">Keep a sharp lookout, see if there&apos;s anything to spot.</string>
<string name="3374">Keep it down! We need to get through here quietly.</string>
<string name="3375">Not a problem.</string>
<string name="3376">Not a chance in hell.</string>
<string name="3377">All done over here.</string>
<string name="3378">That straw that broke the camel&apos;s back? I think I just picked it up.</string>
<string name="3379">Hmm?</string>
<string name="3380">Pleasure to see you.</string>
<string name="3381">Sure.</string>
<string name="3382">And the answer to that would be... no.</string>
<string name="3383">Hey, hold on here a minute.</string>
<string name="3384">I&apos;m definitely feeling the need for some beauty sleep.</string>
<string name="3385">Anyone else getting tired of standing around here?</string>
<string name="3386">See you around.</string>
<string name="3387">Thanks, I appreciate it.</string>
<string name="3388">Well, that&apos;s just spectacular.</string>
<string name="3389">This calls for a celebration!</string>
<string name="3390">Hang on a minute; I&apos;ve got something I want to say.</string>
<string name="3391">Sounds fine to me.</string>
<string name="3392">Please tell me you&apos;re joking.</string>
<string name="3393">Do you really want to get into it with me?</string>
<string name="3394">Their time has come. Destroy them all!</string>
<string name="3395">Your end draws nigh.</string>
<string name="3396">I suggest you pray to whatever gods you worship.</string>
<string name="3397">Prepare to become one with eternity.</string>
<string name="3398">Healer, to my side! I require your services.</string>
<string name="3399">Allies, I call you to my side! I require assistance.</string>
<string name="3400">Well, look what we have here. Future corpses.</string>
<string name="3401">A strategic withdrawal is called for.</string>
<string name="3402">How very amusing. Should I be afraid?</string>
<string name="3403">Shield me from attack at once.</string>
<string name="3404">Stand your ground, there.</string>
<string name="3405">My life is ebbing...</string>
<string name="3406">I can feel venom coursing through my veins.</string>
<string name="3407">Strangely, my spell has failed.</string>
<string name="3408">My weapon will not serve here.</string>
<string name="3409">Fall in behind me here.</string>
<string name="3410">I believe this merits your attention.</string>
<string name="3411">I suggest we regroup here before continuing on.</string>
<string name="3412">Kindly get out of my way before I have to remove you by force.</string>
<string name="3413">This mechanism requires skilled manipulation.</string>
<string name="3414">Keep your eyes open and search the area carefully.</string>
<string name="3415">Stealth is called for here.</string>
<string name="3416">Yes, I can do that.</string>
<string name="3417">Sadly, I cannot do that.</string>
<string name="3418">I have completed this task.</string>
<string name="3419">I am over-burdened. Perhaps some of what I am carrying can be discarded.</string>
<string name="3420">What do you desire?</string>
<string name="3421">Greetings. A pleasure to meet you -- one hopes.</string>
<string name="3422">Very well.</string>
<string name="3423">Certainly not.</string>
<string name="3424">Halt here a moment.</string>
<string name="3425">Enough of this rushing about. I wish to stop and rest a while.</string>
<string name="3426">I trust we are going to move on eventually?</string>
<string name="3427">Until we meet again.</string>
<string name="3428">I thank you.</string>
<string name="3429">This is most... unfortunate.</string>
<string name="3430">We have been most successful.</string>
<string name="3431">Hold a moment. I wish to share my thoughts with you.</string>
<string name="3432">An excellent suggestion.</string>
<string name="3433">I hope you are not so foolish as to imagine that a good idea.</string>
<string name="3434">Defying me would be... unwise.</string>
<string name="3435">Show them... pain.</string>
<string name="3436">Your remains shall decorate my home.</string>
<string name="3437">I will destroy you before I kill you.</string>
<string name="3438">Pain. It&apos;s all you&apos;ll know from now on.</string>
<string name="3439">I require your... succor.</string>
<string name="3440">I have need of you.</string>
<string name="3441">There may be trouble ahead...</string>
<string name="3442">Time to go.</string>
<string name="3443">I see fear in your eyes. It&apos;s good to see that you appreciate your situation.</string>
<string name="3444">I need protection, if you would be so kind.</string>
<string name="3445">Cease your actions.</string>
<string name="3446">Ah, so this... is what it feels like...</string>
<string name="3447">I believe I am poisoned. Interesting sensation.</string>
<string name="3448">Well, now that comes as a surprise.</string>
<string name="3449">Ah, It seems that this will not work.</string>
<string name="3450">Please, follow me.</string>
<string name="3451">This should be of interest.</string>
<string name="3452">Let us gather together.</string>
<string name="3453">Step aside.</string>
<string name="3454">Open this, please.</string>
<string name="3455">I sense there is more here than meets the eye.</string>
<string name="3456">Let us walk on little cat&apos;s feet.</string>
<string name="3457">A favor?  Of course.</string>
<string name="3458">That I cannot do.</string>
<string name="3459">I have finished.</string>
<string name="3460">Such weight...</string>
<string name="3461">Yes?</string>
<string name="3462">Hello.</string>
<string name="3463">Yes.</string>
<string name="3464">No.</string>
<string name="3465">Do not move.</string>
<string name="3466">My mind is weary.</string>
<string name="3467">I&apos;m beginning to find you... dull.</string>
<string name="3468">We shall meet again.</string>
<string name="3469">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="3470">I feel my anger rising...</string>
<string name="3471">Ahhhhh...</string>
<string name="3472">Something to make note of...</string>
<string name="3473">You&apos;re thinking. That&apos;s good.</string>
<string name="3474">Such a waste of thought.</string>
<string name="3475">I could turn your suffering into art.</string>
<string name="3476">We have no choice. They must be eliminated.</string>
<string name="3477">Surrender or prepare to meet your end!</string>
<string name="3478">I will smite you down or fall in the attempt.</string>
<string name="3479">Once more into the breach!</string>
<string name="3480">My injuries are taxing my strength. Please heal me at once.</string>
<string name="3481">My friends, I call on you for help!</string>
<string name="3482">Be wary. There are hostile forces nearby.</string>
<string name="3483">Quickly, withdraw at once! We cannot succeed at this moment.</string>
<string name="3484">Your very presence in my sight is objectionable.</string>
<string name="3485">I must ask for your protection.</string>
<string name="3486">Stand your ground, friends!</string>
<string name="3487">May the gods have mercy upon my failing spirit!</string>
<string name="3488">I have been poisoned!</string>
<string name="3489">I fear my spell has failed.</string>
<string name="3490">My weapons will do me no good here.</string>
<string name="3491">I ask you to follow me now.</string>
<string name="3492">There is something of interest here.</string>
<string name="3493">Friends, gather round me here before we proceed on.</string>
<string name="3494">Kindly step out of my way.</string>
<string name="3495">Someone with more skill at undoing locks and traps must deal with this.</string>
<string name="3496">I believe there is a secret to uncover here. Let us go slowly and search all around.</string>
<string name="3497">Hush, now! We must move quietly through this area.</string>
<string name="3498">Yes, I can accomplish this task.</string>
<string name="3499">That I cannot do.</string>
<string name="3500">I have completed this undertaking.</string>
<string name="3501">I am weighted down too heavily, I fear.</string>
<string name="3502">Yes?</string>
<string name="3503">Hail and well-met.</string>
<string name="3504">Indeed.</string>
<string name="3505">I would have to say no.</string>
<string name="3506">Stop and wait a moment.</string>
<string name="3507">I am wearied with much toil. I must stop and rest a while.</string>
<string name="3508">Shall we not proceed onward?</string>
<string name="3509">Fare well, until our next meeting.</string>
<string name="3510">I am most grateful.</string>
<string name="3511">I am almost tempted to swear.</string>
<string name="3512">Let us congratulate ourselves!</string>
<string name="3513">Stand a moment and hear my words.</string>
<string name="3514">A wise proposal.</string>
<string name="3515">I think this inadvisable.</string>
<string name="3516">You would find the consequences of refusal most unpleasant.</string>
<string name="3517">Show them your steel!  Attack!</string>
<string name="3518">Let&apos;s show them what a true warrior looks like.</string>
<string name="3519">Make this fight count. It will be your last.</string>
<string name="3520">For honor and glory!</string>
<string name="3521">I need you to heal my wounds.</string>
<string name="3522">Come to my side. I need your aid.</string>
<string name="3523">I see our enemy near.</string>
<string name="3524">It&apos;s no good. We&apos;re going to have to fall back.</string>
<string name="3525">I&apos;m giving you one chance to flee. No mercy after that.</string>
<string name="3526">I need you to cover my flank.</string>
<string name="3527">Wait!  Hold for a second.</string>
<string name="3528">I... am nearly finished.</string>
<string name="3529">Poison. Should have known.</string>
<string name="3530">My magics have failed me.</string>
<string name="3531">This weapon won&apos;t work. </string>
<string name="3532">I shall lead the way. Fall in behind me.</string>
<string name="3533">Come, look at this.</string>
<string name="3534">Let us join together.</string>
<string name="3535">Step to the side.</string>
<string name="3536">I need you to open this.</string>
<string name="3537">Stay aware.</string>
<string name="3538">Into the shadows, quickly!</string>
<string name="3539">That, I can do.</string>
<string name="3540">I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s impossible.</string>
<string name="3541">I have finished.</string>
<string name="3542">I am carrying too much equipment.</string>
<string name="3543">Yes?</string>
<string name="3544">My greetings to you.</string>
<string name="3545">Yes</string>
<string name="3546">No</string>
<string name="3547">Wait.</string>
<string name="3548">We need rest. Now.</string>
<string name="3549">We are wasting valuable time.</string>
<string name="3550">Goodbye, and good luck.</string>
<string name="3551">My thanks.</string>
<string name="3552">Hah, hah!</string>
<string name="3553">May the nine hells take my soul!</string>
<string name="3554">Most excellent.</string>
<string name="3555">Listen, this is important.</string>
<string name="3556">Yes, that makes sense.</string>
<string name="3557">No, that is a terrible idea.</string>

<string name="4249">Come on, crew, the monsters are not going to kill themselves.</string>
<string name="4250">See you around.</string>
<string name="4251">Thanks, I appreciate it.</string>
<string name="4252">Well, that&apos;s just spectacular.</string>
<string name="4253">This calls for a celebration!</string>
<string name="4254">Hang on a minute, I&apos;ve got something I want to say.</string>
<string name="4255">Sounds fine to me.</string>
<string name="4256">Please tell me you&apos;re joking.</string>
<string name="4257">Do you really want to get into it with me?</string>
<string name="4258">Their time has come.  Destroy them all!</string>
<string name="4259">Your end draws nigh.</string>
<string name="4260">Pray to whatever gods you worship.</string>
<string name="4261">Prepare to become one with eternity.</string>
<string name="4262">Healer, to my side! I require your services.</string>
<string name="4263">Allies, I call you to my side! I require assistance.</string>
<string name="4264">Well, look what we have here. Future corpses.</string>
<string name="4265">I must withdraw -- cover my retreat!</string>
<string name="4266">How very amusing. Should I be afraid?</string>
<string name="4267">Shield me from attack at once.</string>
<string name="4268">Stand your ground, over there.</string>
<string name="4269">There!</string>
<string name="4270">Hah!</string>
<string name="4271">My life is ebbing...</string>
<string name="4272">I can feel venom coursing through my veins.</string>
<string name="4273">On second thought, I have recanted my spell. </string>
<string name="4274">My weapon will not serve here.</string>
<string name="4275">Fall in behind me here.</string>
<string name="4276">Find something to do with yourself while I attend to this important matter.</string>
<string name="4277">If the lot of you wish to blunder on and get yourselves killed, by all means go on without regrouping.</string>
<string name="4278">Stand out of my way before I remove you by force.</string>
<string name="4279">This mechanism evidently requires the manipulation of a skilled tradesman.</string>
<string name="4280">Search the area carefully and inform me of your findings.</string>
<string name="4281">In case it has escaped your attention, stealth is called for here. </string>
<string name="4282">That will require a mere fraction of my power.</string>
<string name="4283">I have better things to do.</string>
<string name="4284">I have completed this task.</string>
<string name="4285">I am over-burdened. Perhaps you should bear some of my load.</string>
<string name="4286">What? </string>
<string name="4287">Yes?</string>
<string name="4288">Very well.</string>
<string name="4289">Certainly not.</string>
<string name="4290">Halt here a moment.</string>
<string name="4291">Enough of this rushing about. I wish to stop and rest a while.</string>
<string name="4292">I trust we are going to move on eventually?</string>
<string name="4293">Until we meet again.</string>
<string name="4294"> I thank you.</string>
<string name="4295">This is most... unfortunate.</string>
<string name="4296">We have been most successful.</string>
<string name="4297">Hold a moment. I wish to share my thoughts with you.</string>
<string name="4298">An excellent suggestion. </string>
<string name="4299">Thank you for favoring us with that pearl of wisdom. </string>
<string name="4300"> Defying me would be... unwise.</string>
<string name="4301">Once more into the breach, my friends!</string>
<string name="4302">Stand still so I  can hit you!</string>
<string name="4303">Ha! A most palpable touch!</string>
<string name="4304">Ooh, that&apos;s liable to leave a scar!</string>
<string name="4305">Wait a minute! This is my blood!  Cleric!</string>
<string name="4306">I can&apos;t do this all myself! Lend me a hand!</string>
<string name="4307">Aha! There they are up ahead... I hope they like surprises.</string>
<string name="4308">Exit, pursued by a bear!</string>
<string name="4309">I could take you on blind-folded...</string>
<string name="4310">Here&apos;s the plan, you smite anyone who gets too close.</string>
<string name="4311">Okay, stand right here on this &apos;X&apos; I&apos;ve drawn on the floor.</string>
<string name="4312">Uh oh... better call a necromancer.</string>
<string name="4313">oops.</string>
<string name="4314">Ah... I don&apos;t feel so good...</string>
<string name="4315">Not sure that was supposed to go like that.</string>
<string name="4316">Ah! Foul sorcery has turned my weapon to rubber!</string>
<string name="4317">This way.  Come on, slowpoke... Keep up.</string>
<string name="4318">Oooooh... something shiny.</string>
<string name="4319">All right everyone! Gather &apos;round.</string>
<string name="4320">One side, please&#8230; coming through!</string>
<string name="4321">You know what works well for locks like this? A big hammer.</string>
<string name="4322">Not sure what we&apos;re looking for, but it&apos;s got to be around here somewhere.</string>
<string name="4323">Shush!  Let&apos;s creep up and catch &apos;em with their knickers down.</string>
<string name="4324">Of course I can!</string>
<string name="4325">Eh... Can&apos;t really do that.</string>
<string name="4326">There you go!  A beautiful job if I do say so myself.</string>
<string name="4327">This pack is heavier than I am.</string>
<string name="4328">Yes?</string>
<string name="4329">Greetings and well met.</string>
<string name="4330">yes, Yes, YES!</string>
<string name="4331">Nope, n&apos;uh-uh, definitely not.</string>
<string name="4332">Enough!</string>
<string name="4333">Phew! I&apos;m worn out.  Who&apos;s up for a nap?</string>
<string name="4334">Everyone in favor of moving along raise your hand!</string>
<string name="4335">And with that, I will take my leave.</string>
<string name="4336">Thank you ever so kindly.</string>
<string name="4337">Gadzooks!</string>
<string name="4338">Hurray for me!</string>
<string name="4339">That reminds me of a story...</string>
<string name="4340">That is an excellent idea!</string>
<string name="4341">I have never heard such a rotten idea.</string>
<string name="4342">Have you ever seen what one of these can do?</string>
<string name="4343">I want to see...suffering.</string>
<string name="4344">Your remains shall decorate my home.</string>
<string name="4345">I will take special pleasure in this! </string>
<string name="4346">I require your... succor.</string>
<string name="4347">I have need of you.</string>
<string name="4348">Look at them...little ducks, all in a row...  </string>
<string name="4349">Time to go.  </string>
<string name="4350">I see fear in your eyes. It&apos;s good you appreciate your situation.</string>
<string name="4351">I need protection, if you would be so kind.</string>
<string name="4352">Cease your actions.</string>
<string name="4353">Ah, so this... is what it feels like...</string>
<string name="4354">I believe I&apos;m poisoned. Interesting sensation.  </string>
<string name="4355">Well, now that comes as a surprise. </string>
<string name="4356">Ah, It seems that...this...will not work.  </string>
<string name="4357">Follow me.  I have such sights to show you...  </string>
<string name="4358">This should be of interest.</string>
<string name="4359">Let us gather together.  </string>
<string name="4360">Step aside.  </string>
<string name="4361">If you would be so kind as to open this?</string>
<string name="4362">I sense more here than meets the eye.</string>
<string name="4363">Let&apos;s be more quiet, shall we?</string>
<string name="4364">A favor?  Of course.</string>
<string name="4365">I&apos;m afraid not.</string>
<string name="4366">I have finished.</string>
<string name="4367">Such...weight...</string>
<string name="4368">Yes?</string>
<string name="4369">Hello.</string>
<string name="4370">Yes.</string>
<string name="4371">No.</string>
<string name="4372">Don&apos;t move - not a muscle. {Like you&apos;re about to set off a very bad trap}</string>
<string name="4373">My mind and body are weary.</string>
<string name="4374">I&apos;m beginning to find you... dull. </string>
<string name="4375">We shall meet again.</string>
<string name="4376">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="4377">hm hm hm.</string>
<string name="4378">Someone will pay for this!</string>
<string name="4379">Ahhhhh...</string>
<string name="4380">I have something for you to make note of.</string>
<string name="4381">You&apos;re thinking. That&apos;s good.</string>
<string name="4382">Such a waste of brain matter.</string>
<string name="4383">I could elevate your suffering to an artform!</string>
<string name="4384">We have no choice. They must be eliminated.</string>
<string name="4385">Surrender or prepare to meet your end!</string>
<string name="4386">I will strike you down or fall in the attempt.</string>
<string name="4387">You must fall for the greater good.</string>
<string name="4388">My injuries are taxing my strength. Please heal me at once.</string>
<string name="4389">My friends, I call on you for help!</string>
<string name="4390">Be wary. There are hostile forces nearby.</string>
<string name="4391">Quickly, withdraw at once! We cannot succeed at this moment.</string>
<string name="4392">Your very presence in my sight is objectionable.</string>
<string name="4393">I must ask for your protection.</string>
<string name="4394">Stand your ground, friends!</string>
<string name="4395">May the gods have mercy upon my failing spirit!</string>
<string name="4396">I have been poisoned!</string>
<string name="4397">I fear my spell has failed.</string>
<string name="4398">My weapons will do me no good here.</string>
<string name="4399">I ask you to follow me now.</string>
<string name="4400">There is something of interest here.</string>
<string name="4401">Friends, gather around me here before we proceed on.</string>
<string name="4402">Kindly step out of my way.</string>
<string name="4403">Someone with more skill at undoing locks and traps must deal with this.</string>
<string name="4404">I believe there is a secret to uncover here. Let us go slowly and search all around.</string>
<string name="4405">Hush, now! We must move quietly through this area.</string>
<string name="4406">Yes, I can accomplish this task.</string>
<string name="4407">That I cannot do.</string>
<string name="4408">I have completed this undertaking.</string>
<string name="4409">I am weighted down too heavily, I fear.</string>
<string name="4410">Yes?</string>
<string name="4411">Hail and well-met.</string>
<string name="4412">Indeed.</string>
<string name="4413">I would have to say no.</string>
<string name="4414">Stop and wait a moment.</string>
<string name="4415">I am wearied with much toil. I must stop and rest a while.</string>
<string name="4416">Shall we not proceed onward?</string>
<string name="4417">Fare well, until our next meeting.</string>
<string name="4418">I am most grateful.</string>
<string name="4419">I am almost tempted to swear.</string>
<string name="4420">Let us congratulate ourselves!</string>
<string name="4421">Stand a moment and hear my words.</string>
<string name="4422">A wise proposal.</string>
<string name="4423">I think this inadvisable.</string>
<string name="4424">You would find the consequences of refusal most unpleasant.</string>
<string name="4425">All right crew, let&apos;s take them down!</string>
<string name="4426">Ha! There&apos;s more where that came from!</string>
<string name="4427">This is too easy!</string>
<string name="4428">Ha-ha!</string>
<string name="4429">Ah! This isn&apos;t good... I need a healer, quick!</string>
<string name="4430">This is more than I bargained for... help me!</string>
<string name="4431">I think I spy some unsuspecting playmates ahead...</string>
<string name="4432">Perhaps we&apos;d better leave... Now!</string>
<string name="4433">Is that the best you can do?</string>
<string name="4434">I need you to watch my back... You won&apos;t mind that too much will you?</string>
<string name="4435">Now just wait right there, and don&apos;t move a muscle until I say.</string>
<string name="4436">It&apos;s not supposed to happen like this...</string>
<string name="4437">Oh it burns!  Poison!</string>
<string name="4438">My charms don&apos;t usually fall flat like that.</string>
<string name="4439">This... Usually... Works... Bah! I need a better weapon!</string>
<string name="4440">Epic Spell Penetration</string>
<string name="4441">Well bless my tarnished soul... Look at this!</string>
<string name="4442">All right, now everyone gather around me.</string>
<string name="4443">Why don&apos;t you let me squeeze through there.</string>
<string name="4444">Someone needs to give this lock a little expert attention.</string>
<string name="4445">Come on... Search! It&apos;s got to be here somewhere.</string>
<string name="4446">Hush! Don&apos;t let anyone hear us.</string>
<string name="4447">Well of course I can do that.</string>
<string name="4448">No, I&apos;m sorry.  Even I have my limits.</string>
<string name="4449">There you are... Finished.</string>
<string name="4450">No... I&apos;m carrying far too much useless garbage.  I&apos;m going to have to dump some of this.</string>
<string name="4451">Yes?</string>
<string name="4452">Why hello there.  Pleased to meet you.</string>
<string name="4453">Mmm...Yes.</string>
<string name="4454">No.</string>
<string name="4455">Stop!</string>
<string name="4456">Ok, that&apos;s enough for me... I need some rest.</string>
<string name="4457">Oh come on!  Let&apos;s move this along, people!</string>
<string name="4458">Well then, I&apos;ll see you later.  I promise.</string>
<string name="4459">Why how lovely... Thanks ever so much.</string>
<string name="4460">Blast!</string>
<string name="4461">Well hooray for us!</string>
<string name="4462">You better believe I have something to say about that.</string>
<string name="4463">I think that&apos;s a lovely idea.</string>
<string name="4464">Oh no, that&apos;s no good at all.</string>
<string name="4465">You&apos;re about to bite off more than you can chew, cur.</string>
<string name="4466">Show them your steel!  Attack!</string>
<string name="4467">Now see what a true warrior looks like!</string>
<string name="4468">Make this fight count. It will be your last.  </string>
<string name="4469">For honor and glory!</string>
<string name="4470">I need you to heal my wounds.</string>
<string name="4471">Come to my side. I need your aid.</string>
<string name="4472">I believe we have enemies drawing near.</string>
<string name="4473">It&apos;s no good. We&apos;re going to have to fall back.  </string>
<string name="4474">I&apos;m giving you one chance to flee. No mercy after that.</string>
<string name="4475">I need you to cover my flank.</string>
<string name="4476">Hold a moment.</string>
<string name="4477">I... am nearly finished.</string>
<string name="4478">Poison. Heh. Should have known. </string>
<string name="4479">Hmm.  Going to have to try something else.</string>
<string name="4480">This weapon won&apos;t work. </string>
<string name="4481">I shall lead the way. Fall in behind me. </string>
<string name="4482">Come, look at this.</string>
<string name="4483">Let us join together.</string>
<string name="4484">Step to the side.</string>
<string name="4485">Open this.  Please.</string>
<string name="4486">I sense something&apos;s not right here...search carefully.  </string>
<string name="4487">Into the shadows, quickly! </string>
<string name="4488">That, I can do.</string>
<string name="4489">I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s impossible.</string>
<string name="4490">I have finished.</string>
<string name="4491">Ugh!  I can&apos;t bear this much weight and keep up.</string>
<string name="4492">Yes?</string>
<string name="4493">My greetings to you.</string>
<string name="4494">Yes</string>
<string name="4495">No</string>
<string name="4496">Wait.</string>
<string name="4497">We need to rest. Now.</string>
<string name="4498">The day grows long...let us continue.  {Impatient}</string>
<string name="4499">Goodbye, and good luck.</string>
<string name="4500">My thanks.</string>
<string name="4501">May the nine hells take my soul!</string>
<string name="4502">Most excellent.</string>
<string name="4503">Listen, this is important.</string>
<string name="4504">Yes, that makes sense.</string>
<string name="4505">No, that is a terrible idea.</string>
<string name="4506">Do not make me angry. You would not like me when I am angry.</string>
<string name="4507">Attack!</string>
<string name="4508">For my people!</string>
<string name="4509">May the desert claim your bones!</string>
<string name="4510">I shall strike you down!</string>
<string name="4511">Please heal me, if you would be so kind.</string>
<string name="4512">I ask aid of you.</string>
<string name="4513">I see trouble ahead.</string>
<string name="4514">Our strength is not enough.</string>
<string name="4515">You have the personality of a camel!</string>
<string name="4516">Stand by my side.</string>
<string name="4517">Wait a moment.</string>
<string name="4518">I fear that I am near passing on.</string>
<string name="4519">I have been poisoned.</string>
<string name="4520">The Gods do not favor me.</string>
<string name="4521">This will not suffice.</string>
<string name="4522">I shall chart our path.</string>
<string name="4523">Look.</string>
<string name="4524">Let us gather.</string>
<string name="4525">Please step aside.</string>
<string name="4526">Please unlock this.</string>
<string name="4527">Hold a moment -- something is not right here. Let us search this area.</string>
<string name="4528">Silence is our best weapon now.</string>
<string name="4529">I shall make it so.</string>
<string name="4530">That is not possible.</string>
<string name="4531">It has been done.</string>
<string name="4532">I would not burden a camel with this load.</string>
<string name="4533">Yes?</string>
<string name="4534">My greetings.</string>
<string name="4535">Yes</string>
<string name="4536">No</string>
<string name="4537">Halt.</string>
<string name="4538">To a tired man, rest is more precious than gold.</string>
<string name="4539">Opportunities slide away like clouds.</string>
<string name="4540">Farewell. May you fight with honor and die well.</string>
<string name="4541">My humble thanks.</string>
<string name="4542">Thanks to the gods for our victory.</string>
<string name="4543">If I may&#8230;</string>
<string name="4544">Wise counsel.</string>
<string name="4545">That is bad counsel.</string>
<string name="4546">Do you wish to taste my steel?</string>
<string name="4547">Strike them down in Mystra&apos;s name!</string>
<string name="4548">For the greater glory of Mystra!</string>
<string name="4549">Lady of Magic, look with favor upon our struggle!</string>
<string name="4550">In the Lady&apos;s name!</string>
<string name="4551">Mystra, I beg your divine intervention!</string>
<string name="4552">Servants of Mystra, to my side!</string>
<string name="4553">I greet you in the name of Mystra.</string>
<string name="4554">Indeed.</string>
<string name="4555">I must say no.</string>
<string name="4556">May Mystra watch over you until our next meeting.</string>
<string name="4557">Glory to Mystra!</string>
<string name="4558">Attend me a moment, friend.</string>
<string name="4559">I warn you not to provoke my wrath!</string>
<string name="4560">Strike them down! Let their blood run swift and hot!</string>
<string name="4561">You shall suffer greatly!</string>
<string name="4562">Death to the outsiders!</string>
<string name="4563">The rage of the Saetung shall destroy you!</string>
<string name="4564">I must ask the spirits for healing!</string>
<string name="4565">Come to my aid!</string>
<string name="4566">Who comes this way?</string>
<string name="4567">Yessss.</string>
<string name="4568">No.</string>
<string name="4569">Go then. </string>
<string name="4570">Power to the Saetung!</string>
<string name="4571">Hear me well, outsider.</string>
<string name="4572">Think well before you provoke the wrath of the Saetung!</string>
<string name="4573">Then they charged into certain death!</string>
<string name="4574">He smote his enemy a terrible blow!</string>
<string name="4575">Steel crashed against steel!</string>
<string name="4576">There was much smashing of skulls and trodding of feet that day.</string>
<string name="4577">O tragedy!  The kobold companion was in dire need of the healer&apos;s art!</string>
<string name="4578">But the tiny skald was beset on all sides, he called for help!</string>
<string name="4579">They saw their enemy - hardly a spear throw ahead.</string>
<string name="4580">It was then they decided to confuse the enemy by running away!</string>
<string name="4581">Tell me your name, I want to make sure I get your epitaph right...</string>
<string name="4582">You&apos;ll keep me safe, won&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="4583">Wait here, I&apos;ll be right back!</string>
<string name="4584">But the little poet lay still as a corpse...</string>
<string name="4585">Too late he realized their cowardly foe had poisoned him...</string>
<string name="4586">And just then, their magic failed!</string>
<string name="4587">Then they realized the beast&apos;s foul hide could turn any blade wrought by man!</string>
<string name="4588">Come! Come! This way, follow me!</string>
<string name="4589">Oh! Oh! Here it is!</string>
<string name="4590">Come on, gather round!</string>
<string name="4591">Please, let me through! I can&apos;t see through your legs, you know.</string>
<string name="4592">A devious mechanism of unfathomable danger barred their way... Could anyone defeat it?</string>
<string name="4593">The heroes knew the object of their search was nearby, but could they find it?</string>
<string name="4594">They crept along like shadows in the night...</string>
<string name="4595">Yeah, sure, I can do that.</string>
<string name="4596">Uh, no, I don&apos;t think I can.</string>
<string name="4597">Huzzah! </string>
<string name="4598">I... Can&apos;t... Carry... All... This... Phew... We gotta get rid of some of that.</string>
<string name="4599">Yes?</string>
<string name="4600">Greetings, noble hero!</string>
<string name="4601">Absolutely!</string>
<string name="4602">Never!</string>
<string name="4603">Wait! Stop!</string>
<string name="4604">We&apos;ve got to rest for a moment so I can organize my notes.</string>
<string name="4605">This really isn&apos;t making for a good story... Could we go do something heroic, please?</string>
<string name="4606">Fare well, may your looting be plentiful.</string>
<string name="4607">Oh, thank you thank you thank you!</string>
<string name="4608">Oh by Kurtulmak&apos;s bloody fang!</string>
<string name="4609">And there was much rejoicing!</string>
<string name="4610">Wait! I have composed a short poem on that subject...</string>
<string name="4611">That would make an excellent stanza!</string>
<string name="4612">Er... I can&apos;t think of any good rhymes for that... Let&apos;s try something else.</string>
<string name="4613">You just keep that up, and I&apos;ll write you out of the saga entirely!</string>
<string name="4614">For the honor of the clan, Attack!</string>
<string name="4615">By the blood of the All-Father!</string>
<string name="4616">Doom awaits you!</string>

<string name="4632">Careful! this lock is probably trapped... It needs careful attention.</string>
<string name="4633">Look carefully, there is something hidden around here, and it&apos;s probably dangerous.</string>
<string name="4634">Hush! Go quietly, we must catch them unaware...</string>
<string name="4635">That is possible.</string>
<string name="4636">That is impossible.</string>
<string name="4637">I am finished here.</string>
<string name="4638">I can hardly move for all this weight... We have to leave some of this here.</string>

<string name="7274">The lighting in an Area is governed by the Ambient, Diffuse, and Fog Colors, by the Fog Amount, and by the presence or absence of Shadows. For each Area, you can set up the lighting for day and night independently. The following descriptions apply for both day and night.

The Ambient Color is present on all objects, and is the dominant color that is cast on surfaces in the shade.

The Diffuse Color is the color of the light source from which shadows are cast. In an exterior Area, the Diffuse Color is that of either the Sun or the Moon. In an interior Area, the Diffuse Color comes from an indeterminate source shining from above.The color cast on surfaces that are exposed to direct sunlight (or moonlight) will appear as a blend of the Ambient Color and the Diffuse Color.

The Fog Color is the color that all objects fade into as they recede into the distance.

The Fog Amount determines how closely the Fog Color wraps around the camera in the game. With a small Fog Amount, only objects near the edge of sight are touched by the Fog Color. With a large Fog Amount, even objects close the camera will have some Fog coloring.

You can specify whether objects cast shadows on the ground and on other objects.</string>

One or more sounds played individually: You can choose one or more sounds and adjust the playing options so that they play continuously, only once, in order, in random order, or with random or non-random pauses inbetween them.</string>
<string name="7640">There are two options for playing a single sound.

Continuously play sound (Single Continuous) - The sound is played, and then there is a pause corresponding to the Interval, and then the sound is played again, and so on forever. If the interval is zero, then the sound will loop with no breaks or pauses.

Play sound once (Single Once) - The sound is played once, and never again. This Sound Object will become inactive once the sound has played, but it may be reactivated by using the SoundObjectPlay() scripting command.</string>
<string name="7641">There are four options for playing multiple sounds.

Continuously choose a new random sound to play (Random Continuous) - A sound is randomly chosen from the sound list and played. Once it has played and the Interval period has passed, another sound is randomly picked from the list and played. The process repeats forever or until you call the SoundObjectStop() scripting function.

Play a randomly selected sound once (Random Once) - One sound is randomly chosen from the list and played. After that, this sound object becomes inactive and no more sounds are played. The sound object can be reactivated via the SoundObjectPlay() scripting function. This option is most useful if you turn off the Active checkbox, and manually trigger this sound object during the game by using a script.

Continuously play sounds in order (Sequential Continuous) - The first sound in the sound list is played, then there is a pause corresponding to the Interval, then the next sound is played, then there is a pause corresponding to the interval, and so on until all the sounds have played. This process repeats forever or until scripted to stop.

Play list in order once (Sequential Once) - The sounds are played in order with an Interval delay between them, and once all the sounds have played, the current sound object deactivates and does not play again. This option is most useful if you turn off the Active checkbox, and manually trigger this sound object during the game by using a script.</string>
<string name="7642">When playing a single sound or multiple sounds continuously (that is, over, and over), you can specify the delay between playing each sound. This delay is the Interval.

If the Interval Variation is zero, then the Interval will be the same all the time.

However, you can randomize the Interval giving it a non-zero Interval Variation. Each time a sound finishes playing, the Interval before playing the next sound will be equal to the Interval Value plus or minus a random number from zero up to the Interval Variation. If the resulting value is negative, then the Interval simply becomes zero.</string>
<string name="7643">A Sound Object can be placed in an area in one of three ways.

Plays everywhere in area (Area Wide) - Regardless of where a player is in the area, the sound object will play at the same volume, and it will not appear to come from any particular direction.

Plays from a random position each time it is played (Random Positional) - Each time a sound from the sound list plays, the sound object appears to come from a different location. The range of different locations is determined by the East-West and the North-South Random Ranges.

Plays from a specific position (Positional) - The sounds always play from the position of the Sound Object.</string>
<string name="7644">If a sound is Positional or Randomly Positional (that is, it plays from a specific position or a random position), then it may sound louder or quieter depending on how far away the listener is.

Beyond the Cutoff Distance (aka. Max Distance), the sound can&apos;t be heard at all.

Inside the Max Volume Distance (aka. Min Distance), the sound will play at maximum volume.

The Min Distance is always less than or equal to the Max Distance.</string>
<string name="7645">The Master Feats List displays all the available feats for this creature. 

Press the -&gt; button to assign the selected feat from the Master Feats List to this creature. 

Press the &lt;- button to remove the selected feat from the Assigned Feats List from this creature.
</string>
<string name="7646">If a sound object plays from a random position, then you can specify a rectangular range of locations in which it can randomly play.

The middle of this rectangular region is the location at which the sound object appears within the Toolset. The width of the rectangle is equal to the East-West random range, and the length of the rectangle is equal to the North-South random range.</string>
<string name="7647">Adjust the volume slider to set the volume that this Sound Object should play at.</string>
<string name="7648">Click one of the Day, Night, or Always radio buttons to set the times of day during which this Sound Object can play.</string>
<string name="7649">Check the Active checkbox to make this Sound Object become Active. When a Sound is Active, it will play. When it is not Active, it will not play.

If you make an inactive sound, you can activate it later during the game by calling the SoundObjectPlay() scripting function.</string>
<string name="7650">The Height of a Sound Object is the elevation above or below the ground that it plays from.

For example, to make a Sound Object that sounds as if it comes from inside a building, place the object on the roof of the building and give the Sound Object a negative Height.</string>
<string name="7651">Play during the day</string>
<string name="7652">Play at night</string>

Press the -&gt; button to assign the selected special ability from the Master Special Abilities List to this creature. 

Press the &lt;- button to remove the selected special ability from the Assigned Special Abilities List from this creature.
</string>
<string name="7658">Adjust the Volume Variation slider to determine how much the volume of the sound can vary when it plays.

If the Volume Variation is zero, then the sound will always play at the same volume.

If the Volume Variation is nonzero, then each time a sound is played from the sound list, its volume will be equal to its normal volume plus or minus a random number from zero up to the volume variation. If the result is negative, then the Volume is simply zero.

Note that Volume Variation has no effect on seamlessly looping sounds.</string>
<string name="7659">Specifying a faction for a creature determines how other creatures will relate to it. Members of factions that are hostile to each other will attack one another.

<string name="9027">Shifters</string>
<string name="9028">shifter</string>
<string name="9029">(PRESTIGE CLASS)
A shifter has no form they call their own. Instead, they cloth themselves in whatever shape is most expedient at the time. While others base their identities largely on their external forms, the shifter actually comes closer to their true self through all of their transformations. Of necessity, their sense of self is based not on their outward form, but on their soul, which is truly the only constant about them. It is the inner strength of that soul that enables them to take on any shape and remain themselves within.

<string name="9372">Watch my back.</string>
<string name="9373">Wait here a moment.</string>
<string name="9374">I can&apos;t hold out much longer.</string>
<string name="9375">Ah!  Venom!</string>
<string name="9376">Something interferes with my magic...</string>

<string name="9378">Stay close, and step where I step.</string>
<string name="9379">Ah&#8230; I think this may be just the thing.</string>
<string name="9380">Everyone, stay close...</string>
<string name="9381">Please, step aside.</string>
<string name="9382">Well, what have we here?  This lock shouldn&apos;t take long...</string>
<string name="9383">Search everything... but quietly.</string>
<string name="9384">Shhh... they must not spot us.</string>
<string name="9385">Yes, of course.</string>
<string name="9386">Not a chance.</string>

<string name="9398">Damn your eyes.</string>
<string name="9399">Well done.</string>
<string name="9400">Wait, hear me out.</string>
<string name="9401">I like the sound of that.</string>
<string name="9402">I don&apos;t think that&apos;s wise.</string>
<string name="9403">Perhaps you&apos;ll think differently with a foot of steel in your gut.</string>
<string name="9404">Meet fire with fire!&#160; Attack! </string>
<string name="9405">Your time on this plane is over! </string>
<string name="9406">I hope reincarnation treats you well! </string>
<string name="9407">The spirits demand a sacrifice! </string>
<string name="9408">I require your gentle ministrations. </string>
<string name="9409">Please aid me.</string>
<string name="9410">I sense... danger.  </string>
<string name="9411">The threat is too great.  We must go.  </string>
<string name="9412">You are unpleasant to look at, and no one likes you.  </string>
<string name="9413">I ask that you attempt to keep me from harm.</string>
<string name="9414">Please, stop a moment.</string>
<string name="9415">This world... fades...  </string>
<string name="9416">Poisons have defiled my body! </string>
<string name="9417">It seems&#8230; the spirits have not heard my call.  </string>
<string name="9418">This... object... is ineffective. </string>
<string name="9419">I shall lead the way.</string>
<string name="9420">Turn your attention this way.</string>
<string name="9421">Please, I request you group with me.</string>
<string name="9422">Please move aside.</string>
<string name="9423">Please remove this barrier.</string>
<string name="9424">Look for that which is hidden.</string>
<string name="9425">Let us ask the shadows to hide our passage.</string>
<string name="9426">Anything is possible. </string>
<string name="9427">That is not possible...in this world.</string>

<string name="9480">So ah, thanks and all.</string>
<string name="9481">HA! HA! HAAA! </string>
<string name="9482">Camp 2</string>
<string name="9483">Well alright! </string>
<string name="9484">Listen up.</string>
<string name="9485">Okay, finally, some good ideas!</string>
<string name="9486">What?  That&apos;s the worst idea I&apos;ve ever heard!</string>
<string name="9487">Know what your biggest problem is?  Me.  </string>
<string name="9488">Get &apos;em! Kick some ass!</string>
<string name="9489">Think you can take me?  Think again.</string>
<string name="9490">Bring it on!</string>
<string name="9491">Get ready to be beaten by a girl. </string>
<string name="9492">I&apos;m hurt. Can you help me out? </string>
<string name="9493">I need you here, now!</string>
<string name="9494">There&apos;s trouble ahead.</string>
<string name="9495">We need to go!   Now! </string>
<string name="9496">Look at you! I&apos;ve seen scarier things in old chamberpots! </string>
<string name="9497">I need cover over here!  </string>
<string name="9498">Hold on... </string>
<string name="9499">Oh... oh... Gods... </string>
<string name="9500">Agh, I think I&apos;m poisoned! </string>
<string name="9501">Hmph. Not my fault. </string>
<string name="9502">Bah!  This is useless!   </string>
<string name="9503">Follow my lead.</string>
<string name="9504">Wait!  What&apos;s this? </string>
<string name="9505">Everyone!  Over here!</string>
<string name="9506">One side!  Can&apos;t you see I need to get through? </string>
<string name="9507">Hey, open this, wouldja?</string>
<string name="9508">Look around.</string>
<string name="9509">Shh! Time to be quiet. </string>
<string name="9510">Sure.</string>
<string name="9511">I can&apos;t do that! </string>
<string name="9512">Consider it done.  &apos;Cause it is.  </string>
<string name="9513">Argh!  I&apos;m not a pack mule! </string>
<string name="9514">Mmmm?</string>
<string name="9515">Hey there!</string>
<string name="9516">Uh huh?</string>
<string name="9517">Nope.</string>
<string name="9518">Hey, hold it!</string>
<string name="9519">Okay, time to relax a bit.</string>
<string name="9520">See you soon.</string>
<string name="9521">You have my thanks.  </string>
<string name="9522">Ooo, that just makes me so MAD!  </string>
<string name="9523">Yes,  yes, YES! </string>
<string name="9524">Hey, you may want to hear this.</string>
<string name="9525">Mmm, yeah - I agree.</string>
<string name="9526">What?  No!  </string>
<string name="9527">I can&apos;t wait to see you squirming on the end of a long pointy stick. </string>
<string name="9528">Come on, it&apos;s time to take out the trash!</string>
<string name="9529">Hah! Take that!</string>
<string name="9530">Try this on for size!</string>
<string name="9531">Time to kick you back under your rock.</string>
<string name="9532">Some healing needed over here!  Anytime now.</string>
<string name="9533">I could use a hand right about now.</string>
<string name="9534">Look sharp, we have company coming.</string>
<string name="9535">You know about the better part of valor? Time to exercise it. Let&apos;s get out of here!</string>
<string name="9536">Who taught you how to fight? A dead lemur?</string>
<string name="9537">Somebody cover my back!</string>
<string name="9538">Hold it right there.</string>
<string name="9539">Oh, this isn&apos;t good... </string>
<string name="9540">Ugh. You know, I&apos;ve never been partial to poison.</string>
<string name="9541">Well, that didn&apos;t work.</string>
<string name="9542">So much for that weapon.</string>
<string name="9543">Don&apos;t just stand there, follow me!</string>
<string name="9544">Take a look over here, this is interesting.</string>
<string name="9545">All right, kids, time to form up.</string>
<string name="9546">Shove over, will you?</string>
<string name="9547">Anybody here better than me at picking locks?</string>
<string name="9548">Keep your eyes open, see if there&apos;s anything to spot.</string>
<string name="9549">Keep it down! We need to get through here quietly.</string>
<string name="9550">Not a problem.</string>
<string name="9551">Not a chance in hell.</string>
<string name="9552">All done over here.</string>
<string name="9553">That straw that broke the camel&apos;s back? I think I just picked it up.</string>
<string name="9554">Hmm?</string>
<string name="9555">Pleasure to see you.</string>
<string name="9556">Sure.</string>
<string name="9557">And the answer to that would be... no.</string>
<string name="9558">Hey, hold on here a minute.</string>
<string name="9559">I&apos;m definitely feeling the need for some beauty sleep.</string>
<string name="9560">Come on, crew, the monsters are not going to kill themselves.</string>
<string name="9561">See you around.</string>
<string name="9562">Thanks, I appreciate it.</string>
<string name="9563">Well, that&apos;s just spectacular.</string>
<string name="9564">This calls for a celebration!</string>
<string name="9565">Hang on a minute, I&apos;ve got something I want to say.</string>
<string name="9566">Sounds fine to me.</string>
<string name="9567">Please tell me you&apos;re joking.</string>
<string name="9568">Do you really want to get into it with me?</string>
<string name="9569">Their time has come.  Destroy them all!</string>
<string name="9570">Your end draws nigh.</string>
<string name="9571">Pray to whatever gods you worship.</string>
<string name="9572">Prepare to become one with eternity.</string>
<string name="9573">Healer, to my side! I require your services.</string>
<string name="9574">Allies, I call you to my side! I require assistance.</string>
<string name="9575">Well, look what we have here. Future corpses.</string>
<string name="9576">I must withdraw -- cover my retreat!</string>
<string name="9577">How very amusing. Should I be afraid?</string>
<string name="9578">Shield me from attack at once.</string>
<string name="9579">Stand your ground, over there.</string>
<string name="9580">There!</string>
<string name="9581">Hah!</string>
<string name="9582">My life is ebbing...</string>
<string name="9583">I can feel venom coursing through my veins.</string>
<string name="9584">On second thought, I have recanted my spell. </string>
<string name="9585">My weapon will not serve here.</string>
<string name="9586">Fall in behind me here.</string>
<string name="9587">Find something to do with yourself while I attend to this important matter.</string>
<string name="9588">If the lot of you wish to blunder on and get yourselves killed, by all means go on without regrouping.</string>
<string name="9589">Stand out of my way before I remove you by force.</string>
<string name="9590">This mechanism evidently requires the manipulation of a skilled tradesman.</string>
<string name="9591">Search the area carefully and inform me of your findings.</string>
<string name="9592">In case it has escaped your attention, stealth is called for here. </string>
<string name="9593">That will require a mere fraction of my power.</string>
<string name="9594">I have better things to do.</string>
<string name="9595">I have completed this task.</string>
<string name="9596">I am over-burdened. Perhaps you should bear some of my load.</string>
<string name="9597">What? </string>
<string name="9598">Yes?</string>
<string name="9599">Very well.</string>
<string name="9600">Certainly not.</string>
<string name="9601">Halt here a moment.</string>
<string name="9602">Enough of this rushing about. I wish to stop and rest a while.</string>
<string name="9603">I trust we are going to move on eventually?</string>
<string name="9604">Until we meet again.</string>
<string name="9605"> I thank you.</string>
<string name="9606">This is most... unfortunate.</string>
<string name="9607">We have been most successful.</string>
<string name="9608">Hold a moment. I wish to share my thoughts with you.</string>
<string name="9609">An excellent suggestion. </string>
<string name="9610">Thank you for favoring us with that pearl of wisdom. </string>
<string name="9611">Defying me would be... unwise.</string>
<string name="9612">Once more into the breach, my friends!</string>
<string name="9613">Stand still so I  can hit you!</string>
<string name="9614">Ha! A most palpable touch!</string>
<string name="9615">Ooh, that&apos;s liable to leave a scar!</string>
<string name="9616">Wait a minute! This is my blood!  Cleric!</string>
<string name="9617">I can&apos;t do this all myself! Lend me a hand!</string>
<string name="9618">Aha! There they are up ahead... I hope they like surprises.</string>
<string name="9619">Exit, pursued by a bear!</string>
<string name="9620">I could take you on blind-folded...</string>
<string name="9621">Here&apos;s the plan, you smite anyone who gets too close.</string>
<string name="9622">Okay, stand right here on this &apos;X&apos; I&apos;ve drawn on the floor.</string>
<string name="9623">Uh oh... better call a necromancer.</string>
<string name="9624">oops.</string>
<string name="9625">Ah... I don&apos;t feel so good...</string>
<string name="9626">Not sure that was supposed to go like that.</string>
<string name="9627">Ah! Foul sorcery has turned my weapon to rubber!</string>
<string name="9628">This way.  Come on, slowpoke... Keep up.</string>
<string name="9629">Oooooh... something shiny.</string>
<string name="9630">All right everyone! Gather &apos;round.</string>
<string name="9631">One side, please&#8230; coming through!</string>
<string name="9632">You know what works well for locks like this? A big hammer.</string>
<string name="9633">Not sure what we&apos;re looking for, but it&apos;s got to be around here somewhere.</string>
<string name="9634">Shush!  Let&apos;s creep up and catch &apos;em with their knickers down.</string>
<string name="9635">Of course I can!</string>
<string name="9636">Eh... Can&apos;t really do that.</string>
<string name="9637">There you go!  A beautiful job if I do say so myself.</string>
<string name="9638">This pack is heavier than I am.</string>
<string name="9639">Yes?</string>
<string name="9640">Greetings and well met.</string>
<string name="9641">yes, Yes, YES!</string>
<string name="9642">Nope, n&apos;uh-uh, definitely not.</string>
<string name="9643">Enough!</string>
<string name="9644">Phew! I&apos;m worn out.  Who&apos;s up for a nap?</string>
<string name="9645">Everyone in favor of moving along raise your hand!</string>
<string name="9646">And with that, I will take my leave.</string>
<string name="9647">Thank you ever so kindly.</string>
<string name="9648">Gadzooks!</string>
<string name="9649">Hurray for me!</string>
<string name="9650">That reminds me of a story...</string>
<string name="9651">That is an excellent idea!</string>
<string name="9652">I have never heard such a rotten idea.</string>
<string name="9653">Have you ever seen what one of these can do?</string>
<string name="9654">I want to see...suffering.</string>
<string name="9655">Your remains shall decorate my home.</string>
<string name="9656">I will take special pleasure in this! </string>
<string name="9657">I require your... succor.</string>
<string name="9658">I have need of you.</string>
<string name="9659">Look at them...little ducks, all in a row...  </string>
<string name="9660">Time to go.  </string>
<string name="9661">I see fear in your eyes. It&apos;s good you appreciate your situation.</string>
<string name="9662">I need protection, if you would be so kind.</string>
<string name="9663">Cease your actions.</string>
<string name="9664">Ah, so this... is what it feels like...</string>
<string name="9665">I believe I&apos;m poisoned. Interesting sensation.  </string>
<string name="9666">Well, now that comes as a surprise. </string>
<string name="9667">Ah, It seems that...this...will not work.  </string>
<string name="9668">Follow me.  I have such sights to show you...  </string>
<string name="9669">This should be of interest.</string>
<string name="9670">Let us gather together.  </string>
<string name="9671">Step aside.  </string>
<string name="9672">If you would be so kind as to open this?</string>
<string name="9673">I sense more here than meets the eye.</string>
<string name="9674">Let&apos;s be more quiet, shall we?</string>
<string name="9675">A favor?  Of course.</string>
<string name="9676">I&apos;m afraid not.</string>
<string name="9677">I have finished.</string>
<string name="9678">Such...weight...</string>
<string name="9679">Yes?</string>
<string name="9680">Hello.</string>
<string name="9681">Yes.</string>
<string name="9682">No.</string>
<string name="9683">Don&apos;t move - not a muscle.</string>
<string name="9684">My mind and body are weary.</string>
<string name="9685">I&apos;m beginning to find you... dull. </string>
<string name="9686">We shall meet again.</string>
<string name="9687">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="9688">hm hm hm.</string>
<string name="9689">Someone will pay for this!</string>
<string name="9690">Ahhhhh...</string>
<string name="9691">I have something for you to make note of.</string>
<string name="9692">You&apos;re thinking. That&apos;s good.</string>
<string name="9693">Such a waste of brain matter.</string>
<string name="9694">I could elevate your suffering to an artform!</string>
<string name="9695">We have no choice. They must be eliminated.</string>
<string name="9696">Surrender or prepare to meet your end!</string>
<string name="9697">I will strike you down or fall in the attempt.</string>
<string name="9698">You must fall for the greater good.</string>
<string name="9699">My injuries are taxing my strength. Please heal me at once.</string>
<string name="9700">My friends, I call on you for help!</string>
<string name="9701">Be wary. There are hostile forces nearby.</string>
<string name="9702">Quickly, withdraw at once! We cannot succeed at this moment.</string>
<string name="9703">Your very presence in my sight is objectionable.</string>
<string name="9704">I must ask for your protection.</string>
<string name="9705">Stand your ground, friends!</string>
<string name="9706">May the gods have mercy upon my failing spirit!</string>
<string name="9707">I have been poisoned!</string>
<string name="9708">I fear my spell has failed.</string>
<string name="9709">My weapons will do me no good here.</string>
<string name="9710">I ask you to follow me now.</string>
<string name="9711">There is something of interest here.</string>
<string name="9712">Friends, gather around me here before we proceed on.</string>
<string name="9713">Kindly step out of my way.</string>
<string name="9714">Someone with more skill at undoing locks and traps must deal with this.</string>
<string name="9715">I believe there is a secret to uncover here. Let us go slowly and search all around.</string>
<string name="9716">Hush, now! We must move quietly through this area.</string>
<string name="9717">Yes, I can accomplish this task.</string>
<string name="9718">That I cannot do.</string>
<string name="9719">I have completed this undertaking.</string>
<string name="9720">I am weighted down too heavily, I fear.</string>
<string name="9721">Yes?</string>
<string name="9722">Hail and well-met.</string>
<string name="9723">Indeed.</string>
<string name="9724">I would have to say no.</string>
<string name="9725">Stop and wait a moment.</string>
<string name="9726">I am wearied with much toil. I must stop and rest a while.</string>
<string name="9727">Shall we not proceed onward?</string>
<string name="9728">Fare well, until our next meeting.</string>
<string name="9729">I am most grateful.</string>
<string name="9730">I am almost tempted to swear.</string>
<string name="9731">Let us congratulate ourselves!</string>
<string name="9732">Stand a moment and hear my words.</string>
<string name="9733">A wise proposal.</string>
<string name="9734">I think this inadvisable.</string>
<string name="9735">You would find the consequences of refusal most unpleasant.</string>
<string name="9736">All right crew, let&apos;s take them down!</string>
<string name="9737">Ha! There&apos;s more where that came from!</string>
<string name="9738">This is too easy!</string>
<string name="9739">Ha-ha!</string>
<string name="9740">Ah! This isn&apos;t good... I need a healer, quick!</string>
<string name="9741">This is more than I bargained for... help me!</string>
<string name="9742">I think I spy some unsuspecting playmates ahead...</string>
<string name="9743">Perhaps we&apos;d better leave... Now!</string>
<string name="9744">Is that the best you can do?</string>
<string name="9745">I need you to watch my back... You won&apos;t mind that too much will you?</string>
<string name="9746">Now just wait right there, and don&apos;t move a muscle until I say.</string>
<string name="9747">It&apos;s not supposed to happen like this...</string>
<string name="9748">Oh it burns!  Poison!</string>
<string name="9749">My charms don&apos;t usually fall flat like that.</string>
<string name="9750">This... usually... works... Bah! I need a better weapon!</string>
<string name="9751">You just follow me and stay close.</string>
<string name="9752">Well bless my tarnished soul... Look at this!</string>
<string name="9753">All right, now everyone gather around me.</string>
<string name="9754">Why don&apos;t you let me squeeze through there.</string>
<string name="9755">Someone needs to give this lock a little expert attention.</string>
<string name="9756">Come on... Search! It&apos;s got to be here somewhere.</string>
<string name="9757">Hush! Don&apos;t let anyone hear us.</string>
<string name="9758">Well of course I can do that.</string>
<string name="9759">No, I&apos;m sorry.  Even I have my limits.</string>
<string name="9760">There you are... Finished.</string>
<string name="9761">No... I&apos;m carrying far too much useless garbage.  I&apos;m going to have to dump some of this.</string>
<string name="9762">Yes?</string>
<string name="9763">Why hello there.  Pleased to meet you.</string>
<string name="9764">Mmm...Yes.</string>
<string name="9765">No.</string>
<string name="9766">Stop!</string>
<string name="9767">Ok, that&apos;s enough for me... I need some rest.</string>
<string name="9768">Oh come on!  Let&apos;s move this along, people!</string>
<string name="9769">Well then, I&apos;ll see you later.  I promise.</string>
<string name="9770">Why how lovely... Thanks ever so much.</string>
<string name="9771">Blast!</string>
<string name="9772">Well hooray for us!</string>
<string name="9773">You better believe I have something to say about that.</string>
<string name="9774">I think that&apos;s a lovely idea.</string>
<string name="9775">Oh no, that&apos;s no good at all.</string>
<string name="9776">You&apos;re about to bite off more than you can chew, cur.</string>
<string name="9777">Show them your steel!  Attack!</string>
<string name="9778">Now see what a true warrior looks like!</string>
<string name="9779">Make this fight count. It will be your last.  </string>
<string name="9780">For honor and glory!</string>
<string name="9781">I need you to heal my wounds.</string>
<string name="9782">Come to my side. I need your aid.</string>
<string name="9783">I believe we have enemies drawing near.</string>
<string name="9784">It&apos;s no good. We&apos;re going to have to fall back.  </string>
<string name="9785">I&apos;m giving you one chance to flee. No mercy after that.</string>
<string name="9786">I need you to cover my flank.</string>
<string name="9787">Hold a moment.</string>
<string name="9788">I... am nearly finished.</string>
<string name="9789">Poison. Heh. Should have known. </string>
<string name="9790">Hmm.  Going to have to try something else.</string>
<string name="9791">This weapon won&apos;t work. </string>
<string name="9792">I shall lead the way. Fall in behind me. </string>
<string name="9793">Come, look at this.</string>
<string name="9794">Let us join together.</string>
<string name="9795">Step to the side.</string>
<string name="9796">Open this.  Please.</string>
<string name="9797">I sense something&apos;s not right here...search carefully.  </string>
<string name="9798">Into the shadows, quickly! </string>
<string name="9799">That, I can do.</string>
<string name="9800">I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s impossible.</string>
<string name="9801">I have finished.</string>
<string name="9802">Ugh!  I can&apos;t bear this much weight and keep up.</string>
<string name="9803">Yes?</string>
<string name="9804">My greetings to you.</string>
<string name="9805">Yes</string>
<string name="9806">No</string>
<string name="9807">Wait.</string>
<string name="9808">We need to rest. Now.</string>
<string name="9809">The day grows long...let us continue.  </string>
<string name="9810">Goodbye, and good luck.</string>
<string name="9811">My thanks.</string>
<string name="9812">May the nine hells take my soul!</string>
<string name="9813">Most excellent.</string>
<string name="9814">Listen, this is important.</string>
<string name="9815">Yes, that makes sense.</string>
<string name="9816">No, that is a terrible idea.</string>
<string name="9817">Do not make me angry. You would not like me when I am angry.</string>
<string name="9818">Attack!</string>
<string name="9819">For my people!</string>
<string name="9820">May the desert claim your bones!</string>
<string name="9821">I shall strike you down!</string>
<string name="9822">Please heal me, if you would be so kind.</string>
<string name="9823">I ask aid of you.</string>
<string name="9824">I see trouble ahead.</string>
<string name="9825">Our strength is not enough.</string>
<string name="9826">You have the personality of a camel!</string>
<string name="9827">Stand by my side.</string>
<string name="9828">Wait a moment.</string>
<string name="9829">I fear that I am near passing on.</string>
<string name="9830">I have been poisoned.</string>
<string name="9831">The Gods do not favor me.</string>
<string name="9832">This will not suffice.</string>
<string name="9833">I shall chart our path.</string>
<string name="9834">Look.</string>
<string name="9835">Let us gather.</string>
<string name="9836">Please step aside.</string>
<string name="9837">Please unlock this.</string>
<string name="9838">Hold a moment -- something is not right here. Let us search this area.</string>
<string name="9839">Silence is our best weapon now.</string>
<string name="9840">I shall make it so.</string>
<string name="9841">That is not possible.</string>
<string name="9842">It has been done.</string>
<string name="9843">I would not burden a camel with this load.</string>
<string name="9844">Yes?</string>
<string name="9845">My greetings.</string>
<string name="9846">Yes</string>
<string name="9847">No</string>
<string name="9848">Halt.</string>
<string name="9849">To a tired man, rest is more precious than gold.</string>
<string name="9850">Opportunities slide away like clouds.</string>
<string name="9851">Farewell. May you fight with honor and die well.</string>
<string name="9852">My humble thanks.</string>
<string name="9853">Thanks to the gods for our victory.</string>
<string name="9854">If I may&#8230;</string>
<string name="9855">Wise counsel.</string>
<string name="9856">That is bad counsel.</string>
<string name="9857">Do you wish to taste my steel?</string>
<string name="9858">Strike them down in Mystra&apos;s name!</string>
<string name="9859">For the greater glory of Mystra!</string>
<string name="9860">Lady of Magic, look with favor upon our struggle!</string>
<string name="9861">In the Lady&apos;s name!</string>
<string name="9862">Mystra, I beg your divine intervention!</string>
<string name="9863">Servants of Mystra, to my side!</string>
<string name="9864">I greet you in the name of Mystra.</string>
<string name="9865">Indeed.</string>
<string name="9866">I must say no.</string>
<string name="9867">May Mystra watch over you until our next meeting.</string>
<string name="9868">Glory to Mystra!</string>
<string name="9869">Attend me a moment, friend.</string>
<string name="9870">I warn you not to provoke my wrath!</string>
<string name="9871">Strike them down! Let their blood run swift and hot!</string>
<string name="9872">You shall suffer greatly!</string>
<string name="9873">Death to the outsiders!</string>
<string name="9874">The rage of the Saetung shall destroy you!</string>
<string name="9875">I must ask the spirits for healing!</string>
<string name="9876">Come to my aid!</string>
<string name="9877">Who comes this way?</string>
<string name="9878">Yessss.</string>
<string name="9879">No.</string>
<string name="9880">Go then. </string>
<string name="9881">Power to the Saetung!</string>
<string name="9882">Hear me well, outsider.</string>
<string name="9883">Think well before you provoke the wrath of the Saetung!</string>
<string name="9884">Then they charged into certain death!</string>
<string name="9885">He smote his enemy a terrible blow!</string>
<string name="9886">Steel crashed against steel!</string>
<string name="9887">There was much smashing of skulls and trodding of feet that day.</string>
<string name="9888">O tragedy!  The kobold companion was in dire need of the healer&apos;s art!</string>
<string name="9889">But the tiny skald was beset on all sides, he called for help!</string>
<string name="9890">They saw their enemy - hardly a spear throw ahead.</string>
<string name="9891">It was then they decided to confuse the enemy by running away!</string>
<string name="9892">Tell me your name, I want to make sure I get your epitaph right...</string>
<string name="9893">You&apos;ll keep me safe, won&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="9894">Wait here, I&apos;ll be right back!</string>
<string name="9895">But the little poet lay still as a corpse...</string>
<string name="9896">Too late he realized their cowardly foe had poisoned him...</string>
<string name="9897">And just then, their magic failed!</string>
<string name="9898">Then they realized the beast&apos;s foul hide could turn any blade wrought by man!</string>
<string name="9899">Come! Come! This way, follow me!</string>
<string name="9900">Oh! Oh! Here it is!</string>
<string name="9901">Come on, gather round!</string>
<string name="9902">Please, let me through! I can&apos;t see through your legs, you know.</string>
<string name="9903">A devious mechanism of unfathomable danger barred their way... Could anyone defeat it?</string>
<string name="9904">The heroes knew the object of their search was nearby, but could they find it?</string>
<string name="9905">They crept along like shadows in the night...</string>
<string name="9906">Yeah, sure, I can do that.</string>
<string name="9907">Uh, no, I don&apos;t think I can.</string>
<string name="9908">Huzzah! </string>
<string name="9909">I... Can&apos;t... Carry... All... This... Phew... We gotta get rid of some of that.</string>
<string name="9910">Yes?</string>
<string name="9911">Greetings, noble hero!</string>
<string name="9912">Absolutely!</string>
<string name="9913">Never!</string>
<string name="9914">Wait! Stop!</string>
<string name="9915">We&apos;ve got to rest for a moment so I can organize my notes.</string>
<string name="9916">This really isn&apos;t making for a good story... Could we go do something heroic, please?</string>
<string name="9917">Fare well, may your looting be plentiful.</string>
<string name="9918">Oh, thank you thank you thank you!</string>
<string name="9919">Oh by Kurtulmak&apos;s bloody fang!</string>
<string name="9920">And there was much rejoicing!</string>
<string name="9921">Wait! I have composed a short poem on that subject...</string>
<string name="9922">That would make an excellent stanza!</string>
<string name="9923">Er... I can&apos;t think of any good rhymes for that... Let&apos;s try something else.</string>
<string name="9924">You just keep that up, and I&apos;ll write you out of the saga entirely!</string>
<string name="9925">For the honor of the clan, Attack!</string>
<string name="9926">By the blood of the All-Father!</string>
<string name="9927">Doom awaits you!</string>
<string name="9928">Well, it wasn&apos;t immediately lethal... But I need a healer just the same.</string>
<string name="9929">Give me a hand here!</string>
<string name="9930">There, up ahead... I smell an ambush.</string>
<string name="9931">Run! Save yourself!  I&apos;ll hold them off.</string>
<string name="9932">Is that all you&apos;ve got?  Bring it here...</string>
<string name="9933">Guard me well, I haven&apos;t got eyes in the back of my head.</string>
<string name="9934">Stay here and don&apos;t move until I say it&apos;s safe.</string>
<string name="9935">Ahh... I knew this would happen...</string>
<string name="9936">Ah, Poison!  I should have known...</string>
<string name="9937">What? Now my magic is failing?</string>
<string name="9938">My weapon cannot hurt this one!</string>
<string name="9939">Follow me closely, there are traps everywhere.</string>
<string name="9940">Hmmm... Does this look dangerous to you?</string>
<string name="9941">Everyone! Stick together.</string>
<string name="9942">Please, let me through.</string>
<string name="9943">Careful! this lock is probably trapped... It needs careful attention.</string>
<string name="9944">Look carefully, there is something hidden around here, and it&apos;s probably dangerous.</string>
<string name="9945">Hush! Go quietly, we must catch them unaware...</string>
<string name="9946">That is possible.</string>
<string name="9947">That is impossible.</string>
<string name="9948">I am finished here.</string>
<string name="9949">I can hardly move for all this weight... We have to leave some of this here.</string>
<string name="9950">What now?</string>
<string name="9951">Well met.</string>
<string name="9952">Yes, of course.</string>
<string name="9953">Certainly not.</string>
<string name="9954">Stop right there!</string>
<string name="9955">We must rest soon, or I won&apos;t be able to hold my lockpicks steady.</string>
<string name="9956">I don&apos;t see what we&apos;re accomplishing sitting around like this.</string>
<string name="9957">Perhaps we&apos;ll meet again.</string>
<string name="9958">I appreciate that.</string>
<string name="9959">By Clangeddin&apos;s beard!</string>
<string name="9960">Lookit that, we&apos;re not quite dead.</string>
<string name="9961">Hold on a minute, I have a suggestion.</string>
<string name="9962">Hmm.. That may work.</string>
<string name="9963">That will probably get us killed.</string>
<string name="9964">Step aside, or Berronar help me, I&apos;ll strike you down where you stand.</string>
<string name="9965">All right crew! Get &apos;em!</string>
<string name="9966">Ah... Well struck.</string>
<string name="9967">May the Lady guide my hand!</string>
<string name="9968">You were always over-confident...</string>
<string name="9969">Don&apos;t just stand there, get some bandages... And try to find all the loose bits!</string>
<string name="9970">Get over here and give me a hand.</string>
<string name="9971">Ah, damn.</string>
<string name="9972">Well, hello there.</string>
<string name="9973">Yes.</string>
<string name="9974">No.</string>
<string name="9975">Fare well, and may the Lady watch over you.</string>
<string name="9976">Very well done!  Good work, you get a gold star.</string>
<string name="9977">Yeah, you think I might have something to say about that?</string>
<string name="9978">Your mouth better not start anything the rest of you can&apos;t finish.</string>
<string name="9979">Belpheron&apos;s power will strike you down!</string>
<string name="9980">Try, mortal.</string>
<string name="9981">Taste Belpheron&apos;s power!</string>
<string name="9982">Run, coward!</string>
<string name="9983">I require repair.</string>
<string name="9984">I require assistance to complete this task.</string>
<string name="9985">You are not the master.</string>
<string name="9986">Yes.</string>
<string name="9987">No.</string>
<string name="9988">Depart.</string>
<string name="9989">I have succeeded in my task.</string>
<string name="9990">Hear me.</string>
<string name="9991">Do not underestimate Belpheron&apos;s power. </string>
<string name="9992">Slaughter them like the useless vermin they are!</string>
<string name="9993">Tremble before my power!</string>
<string name="9994">I will see the flesh stripped from your bones!</string>
<string name="9995">You will never survive my wrath!</string>
<string name="9996">Servant, heal me at once!</string>
<string name="9997">You useless fools, aid me at once!</string>
<string name="9998">So...</string>
<string name="9999">Certainly.</string>
