<resources><string name="20000">Aye, if ye wish. I be in no hurry to continue me work.</string>
<string name="20001">Ahhh, it be far too many years gone by, &lt;boy/girl&gt;. The wizard&apos;s secrets are &apos;is own, and I be no more privy to them then anyone else here.</string>
<string name="20002">They say that Meldanen keeps a strange lot o&apos; creatures in his estate, though, and I don&apos;t doubt it none.</string>
<string name="20003">He were always fascinated by such. Even when he were young, he kept strange worms an&apos; a beastie bird that ate bloody meat. But I&apos;ll talk no more about that, no.</string>
<string name="20004">Oh, aye, that it does. Meldanen had a magic door put into me very own home which leads into his estate. It would open for me at midnight, ye see.</string>
<string name="20005">I keeps the door closed an&apos; shuttered, now. No idea if it even still opens none... I be hopin&apos; Meldanen&apos;s gone an&apos; forgotten about little me.</string>
<string name="20006">If ye wish to use it some, me home be on the north end o&apos; the district. Here be my key. Take it. Jus&apos; don&apos;t make a mess, mind you.</string>
<string name="20007">Thank you, me &lt;lord/lady&gt;... &apos;tis a fair amount of coin for a poor old woman to own. Ye&apos;re very kind.</string>

<string name="20010"></string>
<string name="20011"></string>
<string name="20012">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Your perceptions reveal something is troubling the dog. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Ask about it.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="20013">Ask about strange or unusual monsters in the district.</string>
<string name="20014">Ask the dog for any useful information it might have.</string>
<string name="20015">Ask about the first location.</string>
<string name="20016">Ask about the second location.</string>
<string name="20017">Give the dog a snack.</string>
<string name="20018">Ask about the Bad Place.</string>
<string name="20019">Ask about the old human man.</string>
<string name="20020">Send the dog on its way.</string>
<string name="20021">The dog responds gladly to your approach, excitedly wagging its tail and accepting your touch. Its friendly eyes look into yours expectantly.</string>
<string name="20022">The dog responds to your empathic communication with images from its mind. It does not feel overly threatened in this area of the city... though it is hungry.</string>
<string name="20023">The dog has some difficulty understanding what you might find useful... though it happily informs you of the best places in the district to beg for food.</string>
<string name="20024">As far as other creatures in the area, the dog only avoids two locations where it feels threatening monsters exist.</string>
<string name="20025">It does, however, tell you some recent news. Apparently, it tried to warn an old human man not to enter a Bad Place nearby. The human did not listen... and did not return.</string>
<string name="20026">Primal urges fill your consciousness, conjuring up images of an odd assortment of monsters... none stand out clearly enough for you to describe.</string>
<string name="20027">This query conjures up dark images in the dog&apos;s mind. There is a large house behind a great wall in the northwest part of the district... the dog avoids this area completely.</string>
<string name="20028">You fish into your pack for a few strips of dried meat. The dog gulps them down happily and wags its tail in thanks.</string>
<string name="20029">The dog whines a bit when you ask this. There is a large house in the northwest part of the district where the dogs do not go... it smells of danger and evil.</string>
<string name="20030">The dog conjures up an image of a pleasant human man of middle age. The association is a kind one... and from the uniform, you think it likely the man is a city guard.</string>
<string name="20031">The dog is aware that sometime recently another creature was in the district... not a threatening creature, however, more one strongly tied to natural forces.</string>
<string name="20032">At your command, the dog happily bounds off to return to its normal routine.</string>
<string name="20033">The dog looks at you curiously. It seems friendly enough.</string>
<string name="20034">The dog wags its tail but shies away from you.</string>
<string name="20035">The dog bares its teeth and growls, obviously alarmed by your approach.</string>
<string name="20036">The dog pictures all of these creatures behind bars... in cages or other types of captivity. All are located in a single area in the northeast part of the district.</string>
<string name="20037">In the dog&apos;s mind, this house is associated with terrible magic and evil smells. Its brethren who have ventured near there do not return.</string>
<string name="20038">The faint image you get leads you to believe what the dog sensed was actually a dryad. The dryad was in distress... but the dog does not know what happened to her.</string>
<string name="20039">The sorcerer has kept you prisoner here?</string>
<string name="20040">Stand back! I&apos;ll have no tricks out of you, dryad!</string>
<string name="20041">Calm down. I am here to free you.</string>
<string name="20042">Wizard keep you prisoner?</string>
<string name="20043">Stand back! No tricks, forest girl!!</string>
<string name="20044">Me here to free you. You calm down now.</string>
<string name="20045">And how would you reward me if I let you go?</string>
<string name="20046">Would you be able to find your way home on your own?</string>
<string name="20047">What reward if you let go?</string>
<string name="20048">You find way out on own?</string>
<string name="20049">Then you are free to go. The way behind me is clear.</string>
<string name="20050">Perhaps you should accompany me. It would be safer that way.</string>
<string name="20051">Then you free. Way behind is clear.</string>
<string name="20052">No, you come with me. Safer.</string>
<string name="20053">How have you survived away from your oak this long?</string>
<string name="20054">I ask that you first come to Aribeth and help cure the plague.</string>
<string name="20055">Me need yous to come to Aribeth for plague cure first.</string>
<string name="20056">Stay back! I&apos;ll not be charmed by you!</string>
<string name="20057">You back! Me not be charmed by you!</string>
<string name="20058">Forget it! I&apos;ll just take what is needed... off your corpse!</string>
<string name="20059">No! Me take what we needs... off yous when you dead!</string>
<string name="20060">You charmed the sorcerer? Is that how you ended up imprisoned here?</string>
<string name="20061">You charm wizard? That how you caged here?</string>
<string name="20062">Or what? You&apos;ll charm me?</string>
<string name="20063">Or you charm me, yeah?</string>
<string name="20064">That&apos;s all right. I could use a slave of my own.</string>
<string name="20065">Is okay. Me get nice dryad slave now.</string>
<string name="20066">No reward? Then you die.</string>
<string name="20067">No gold? You die, then, bye-bye.</string>
<string name="20068">You may get lost in the city. I&apos;ll take you to someone who can help.</string>
<string name="20069">You get lost in city. I take you to someone who help.</string>
<string name="20070">No, you can&apos;t go anywhere. I could use a good slave.</string>
<string name="20071">You go nowhere. Me like dryad slave.</string>
<string name="20072">I got what I needed. Now you die, creature.</string>
<string name="20073">Me got hair. You die now, bye-bye.</string>
<string name="20074">Oh, please let this servant of the oak be free at last! Are you kind, &lt;race&gt; one, or but another captor come to torment me?</string>
<string name="20075">Sadly, yes. This servant wandered the strange city after fleeing the horrid battle... I did not know where to turn and longed so for my oak.</string>
<string name="20076">I mean you no harm, &lt;race&gt; one, and shall not use my glamors to charm you, I swear it! It has brought me no end of grief with Meldanen! Please just let me go!</string>
<string name="20077">Oh! Blessed are you, kind &lt;race&gt; one! I have been lost and so frightened since that terrible battle! I fled into the streets, but everything was so strange here!</string>
<string name="20078">Alas, I have nothing with which to reward you. I am so far, so very far away from my oak and I have no wealth. I can only plead that you allow me to leave!</string>
<string name="20079">Yes... yes, I believe I could. I need only reach the nearest tree... the wizard who came to my grove said any tree would return me home.</string>
<string name="20080">I would surely only slow you down, &lt;race&gt; one, though you are most kind. I shall never forget you! If we meet again, I hope to reward you properly! Farewell!</string>
<string name="20081">Oh, be wary, stranger! Meldanen is somewhere near!</string>
<string name="20082">You... have a fearsome countenance, &lt;race&gt; one... have you come to free this servant of the oak? I beg you not to harm me!</string>
<string name="20083">I have prayed to the great oak for a savior! Are you &lt;he/she&gt;, &lt;race&gt; one? Shall I be freed at last to rejoin my tree?</string>
<string name="20084">Meldanen found me and brought me to this place. He meant to... to hurt me and make a cure for a great sickness. I did only what I could, and charmed him.</string>
<string name="20085">&apos;Twas almost worse, however, to bear his obsession. Please release me, &lt;race&gt; friend! I have been away from my oak far too long!</string>
<string name="20086">A great wizard of the humans came to my grove and said that part of my essence would aid in curing a great sickness amongst his people.</string>
<string name="20087">He did not know what part of my essence, however, and asked me to travel to this strange place so it could be discovered.</string>
<string name="20088">I have no wish for so many to perish, so I agreed, and the wizard placed a spell upon me that bid me to live. Oh, but I miss my oak so, &lt;race&gt; friend! Will you not release me?</string>
<string name="20089">You need not worry. All you have to do is take a lock of my hair to your Lady Aribeth. I give it gladly, &lt;race&gt; one. I had hoped I could do more, but I am very weak now.</string>
<string name="20090">It saddens me to see the sickness in your people... but now that you have my hair I am no longer really needed here. May this servant of the oak be allowed to leave? I miss my tree so... </string>
<string name="20091">No, no! Great oak defend your servant!!</string>
<string name="20092">No, no more! I cannot bear it! Great oak preserve me, I must flee!!</string>
<string name="20093">Thank you, kind &lt;race&gt; one. I shall not forget you. If we meet again, I hope I shall have the chance to reward you properly. Farewell!</string>
<string name="20094">You are most kind to offer, &lt;race&gt; one, but I need only reach the nearest tree. The wizard who came to my grove said a single tree would return me home.</string>
<string name="20095">I shall never forget you! If we meet again, I pray that I shall be able to reward you properly! Farewell!</string>
<string name="20096">Who, exactly, is your master?</string>
<string name="20097">Who master?</string>
<string name="20098">You&apos;re not exactly bright for a guard, are you?</string>
<string name="20099">Wizard hire dumb guard?</string>
<string name="20100">I am an intruder, obviously.</string>
<string name="20101">Me intruder, dummy.</string>
<string name="20102">My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;. Who are you?</string>
<string name="20103">Me &lt;FirstName&gt;. Who you?</string>
<string name="20104">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Err... I would be one of the master&apos;s friends. I&apos;m here to see him.</string>
<string name="20105">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Err... me master&apos;s friend. Here to see master.</string>
<string name="20106">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You don&apos;t need to challenge me. I wouldn&apos;t be here if I wasn&apos;t supposed to be, would I?</string>
<string name="20107">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; So how would you know what one looks like, then?</string>
<string name="20108">Nevermind that. I have some questions.</string>
<string name="20109">Not matter. Me have questions.</string>
<string name="20110">Just forget I was here. That should be easy.</string>
<string name="20111">You just not sees me, okay?</string>
<string name="20112">Now you&apos;re just too smart for your own good. Time to die.</string>
<string name="20113">You too smart! Now you dies!!</string>
<string name="20114">Where exactly can I find your master?</string>
<string name="20115">What&apos;s beyond the door on your right?</string>
<string name="20116">What&apos;s beyond the door on your left?</string>
<string name="20117">What sort of guardians are there here?</string>
<string name="20118">Where master?</string>
<string name="20119">What behind door on your right?</string>
<string name="20120">What behind door on your left?</string>
<string name="20121">Your master - what he have guarding place?</string>
<string name="20122">Why would your master keep prisoners?</string>
<string name="20123">Why master have prisoners?</string>
<string name="20124">I have some questions for you.</string>
<string name="20125">Nevermind. I&apos;ll leave you to your... er... thoughts.</string>
<string name="20126">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="20127">Is okay. Me leave you alone.</string>
<string name="20128">I just thought you should know your master is dead.</string>
<string name="20129">Me say your master is dead.</string>
<string name="20130">You! You, there! You&apos;se must be... uhh... eye-dent-ih-fide. Yuh, identified!</string>
<string name="20131">D&apos;oh! Nobody listen to Grommin... </string>
<string name="20132">Who you?! Master say he no want be disturbed! </string>
<string name="20133">No-ooo! Grommin stop you, he will!!</string>
<string name="20134">Master is Melad... Maldo... Meldanen. Is sorcerer, very scary. Not like visitors, none, &apos;cept friends maybe. Who you?</string>
<string name="20135">Master say he only let guard in house who not nosy. Grommin not nosy. Grommin supposed to only let in master&apos;s friends. Who you?</string>
<string name="20136">You talks big for a big, dumb &lt;race&gt; jerk.</string>
<string name="20137">Me Grommin. Grommin work as guard for master, keep out bad people. Let in master friends only. Easy job... never see master friend. Who you?</string>
<string name="20138">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, okay. Grommin open door for you. You go see him.</string>
<string name="20139">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; How Grommin know you friend? You no look like friend. Grommin never see friend of master before.</string>
<string name="20140">Uhhh... no, Grommin guess not. You smart like master. Grommin open door, you go see him, okay?</string>
<string name="20141">Uhhh... Grommin don&apos;t. You smart like master, must be master friend. Grommin open door, now, you go see him.</string>
<string name="20142">Okay. Grommin can do that. Grommin like easy job.</string>
<string name="20143">Grommin not do tests good, but Grommin try.</string>
<string name="20144">Master is downstairs, maybe. Grommin never be there, so Grommin not know. Master not like Grommin, much.</string>
<string name="20145">Uhhh... lots of rooms where master keeps things. Big room with many books, too... big books. Grommin not read, though.</string>
<string name="20146">Uhhh... Grommin not know. Grommin not allowed to go there. Grommin know master has prisoners, though... they go there, not come out.</string>
<string name="20147">Sometimes master get mad at someone, they go in there. Sometimes master catch thief, they go in there. Grommin hope master not get mad at Grommin.</string>
<string name="20148">Master have lots monsters. Sometimes he lets them run around, eat robbers. Master can talks to them, Grommin thinks.</string>
<string name="20149">Some Grommin sees, even. They looks like little peoples, but they has wings and are mean. Grommin no like them.</string>
<string name="20150">You come back? What you want from Grommin now?</string>
<string name="20151">Okay. Grommin like standing here, is good job. Grommin&apos;s mama be very proud.</string>
<string name="20152">Oh. Was good job for Grommin. Is too bad now.</string>
<string name="20153">I have Meldanen&apos;s silver tooth, taken from his head.</string>
<string name="20154">I have the key for Meldanen&apos;s warehouse.</string>
<string name="20155">Meldanen is dead, but I don&apos;t have his tooth. You can trust me.</string>
<string name="20156">No, I don&apos;t... and I don&apos;t intend to, either.</string>
<string name="20157">Not yet, but I&apos;m working on it.</string>
<string name="20158">Where do I find Meldanen&apos;s mansion?</string>
<string name="20159">Where wizard&apos;s place again?</string>
<string name="20160">Me have wizard&apos;s silver tooth.</string>
<string name="20161">Me have key for wizard&apos;s warehouse.</string>

<string name="20164">No, but me will soon.</string>
<string name="20165">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This was pretty risky. Couldn&apos;t you give a bit more gold?</string>
<string name="20166">No. Give me more or I&apos;ll see what *your* teeth are worth.</string>
<string name="20167">The reward will do nicely.</string>
<string name="20168">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me take big risk. Bigger reward is fairer, no?</string>
<string name="20169">Nope. You give more gold or me sell your teeth, maybe.</string>
<string name="20170">Is okay, I guess. Give me now.</string>
<string name="20171">Hah! Time for you to die, I guess!</string>
<string name="20172">Fine. Hand it over, then.</string>
<string name="20173">Hah!! NOW YOU DIE! RAAAGHHH!!</string>
<string name="20174">Give now, then, and I go.</string>
<string name="20175">I bring a gift from Meldanen, actually: your death!</string>
<string name="20176">Me have gift from wizard: you die!</string>
<string name="20177">Not really. I&apos;d rather take it all off your dead body.</string>
<string name="20178">Nah. Me take all gold from you dead body.</string>
<string name="20179">Who is this Meldanen?</string>
<string name="20180">Who are you?</string>
<string name="20181">Who this Meldanen?</string>
<string name="20182">Who you?</string>
<string name="20183">And who are you, then?</string>
<string name="20184">Who you, then?</string>
<string name="20185">How do you know there&apos;s an actual hoard?</string>
<string name="20186">No, I don&apos;t agree with you.</string>
<string name="20187">I agree with you, totally.</string>
<string name="20188">Leave me out of it, I say.</string>
<string name="20189">Regardless, I think you&apos;re making trouble and you should stop.</string>
<string name="20190">How you know &apos;bout hoard?</string>
<string name="20191">No, me not agree.</string>
<string name="20192">Me agrees with you.</string>
<string name="20193">You leaves me out of it.</string>
<string name="20194">You make trouble. Me say you stop, now.</string>
<string name="20195">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="20196">What, exactly, do you have in mind?</string>
<string name="20197">No, I have other obligations.</string>
<string name="20198">Forget it!</string>
<string name="20199">Me help how?</string>
<string name="20200">No, me must do other stuff.</string>
<string name="20201">Hah! You forget it!</string>
<string name="20202">Just how underhanded are we talking, here?</string>
<string name="20203">I have no problem with anything of that sort.</string>
<string name="20204">I wouldn&apos;t perform a task of that nature, no.</string>
<string name="20205">What you mean?</string>
<string name="20206">Me do task, not care what kind.</string>
<string name="20207">Me not do that, no.</string>
<string name="20208">With the right reward, nothing bothers me.</string>
<string name="20209">If me paid good, me not care.</string>
<string name="20210">Very well. I will do as you suggest.</string>
<string name="20211">I will steal the key, but I will not murder a man.</string>
<string name="20212">Perhaps you are right... so long as the reward is.</string>
<string name="20213">No. I won&apos;t do it.</string>
<string name="20214">Okay, me will help, then.</string>
<string name="20215">Me steal key, but me not murder nobody.</string>
<string name="20216">Okay... but only if me gets lots of coin.</string>
<string name="20217">No, me not do it.</string>
<string name="20218">Why don&apos;t you kill him, then?</string>
<string name="20219">Why you no kill him if you think it so great?</string>
<string name="20220">You will kill him or I will?</string>
<string name="20221">You killing or me killing?</string>
<string name="20222">I see Meldanen was right. Time for you to die, Formosa.</string>
<string name="20223">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Could I persuade you to give me some coin up front?</string>
<string name="20224">I want some coin now... or I&apos;ll expose you to the local nobles</string>
<string name="20225">Very well. I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="20226">I&apos;ve changed my mind. This doesn&apos;t interest me.</string>
<string name="20227">Me see Meldanen right. You die now, Formosa.</string>
<string name="20228">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe you give some coin now... to be nice, huh?</string>
<string name="20229">Me get coin now... or maybe me talk to other nobles, here. Talk lots.</string>
<string name="20230">Okay, me do it.</string>
<string name="20231">No, me has changed mind.</string>
<string name="20232">To kill you, obviously. Meldanen sends his regards.</string>
<string name="20233">I just want you to stop making trouble.</string>
<string name="20234">I&apos;m investigating the plague, and I have some questions.</string>
<string name="20235">I&apos;m looking for work, actually.</string>
<string name="20236">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="20237">Me here to kill you. Wizard says hello.</string>
<string name="20238">Me just wants you to stop making trouble.</string>
<string name="20239">Me look into plague, have questions.</string>
<string name="20240">Me look for work.</string>
<string name="20241">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="20242">No need to get angry. I&apos;ll help you if I can.</string>
<string name="20243">No be angry. Me help you if me can.</string>
<string name="20244">No, I don&apos;t trust you.</string>
<string name="20245">Nope, me not trust you.</string>
<string name="20246">Hah! Forget it.</string>
<string name="20247">No way! You forget it.</string>
<string name="20248">And you should die... or, at least, Meldanen thinks so.</string>
<string name="20249">And you should be dying. Meldanen says hello.</string>
<string name="20250">No, I&apos;m here to kill you, instead. Meldanen sends his regards.</string>
<string name="20251">Me kill you instead. Wizard says hello.</string>
<string name="20252">Yes, I do.</string>
<string name="20253">No, not yet.</string>
<string name="20254">No, and I don&apos;t intend to retrieve it, either.</string>
<string name="20255">Me has it.</string>
<string name="20256">No, me not have it.</string>
<string name="20257">No, and me not getting it, either.</string>
<string name="20258">Then I shall get it.</string>
<string name="20259">All right, but I want my reward for the tooth now.</string>
<string name="20260">Forget it. Give me the reward for the tooth.</string>
<string name="20261">Me go and get it.</string>
<string name="20262">Okay, but me want reward for tooth now.</string>
<string name="20263">No! Me just want reward for tooth!</string>
<string name="20264">Fine. Then I shall get it for you.</string>
<string name="20265">Then I&apos;ll take my reward from your dead body!</string>
<string name="20266">Fine! Then I gets it!</string>
<string name="20267">Then me takes reward from you dead body!</string>
<string name="20268">He is dead. I have his silver tooth, here.</string>
<string name="20269">He is dead, but I don&apos;t have his tooth.</string>
<string name="20270">He lives, though not for long.</string>
<string name="20271">He lives, and I do not intend to kill him.</string>
<string name="20272">Dead. Me have silver tooth.</string>
<string name="20273">Dead, but me not have silver tooth.</string>
<string name="20274">He not dead, but me change that soon.</string>
<string name="20275">He not dead, and me not going to kill him.</string>
<string name="20276">Very well. I will return with the tooth.</string>
<string name="20277">Forget it. Let&apos;s just have this done with.</string>
<string name="20278">Okay, me come back with tooth.</string>
<string name="20279">Forget it. Me want this done with.</string>
<string name="20280">I was glad to help, but I don&apos;t want a reward for killing someone.</string>
<string name="20281">Me glad to help, but me not want reward for killing.</string>
<string name="20282">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Getting the key was risky. Wouldn&apos;t some gold be fair?</string>
<string name="20283">No. Hand over more or I&apos;ll see how much *your* teeth are worth.</string>
<string name="20284">It will do nicely.</string>
<string name="20285">I was glad to help. The reward is not necessary.</string>
<string name="20286">No, but I&apos;ll take everything off your corpse anyway.</string>
<string name="20287">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me take big risk. Bigger reward is fairer, no?</string>
<string name="20288">Nope. You give gold or me sell your teeth, maybe.</string>
<string name="20289">Is okay, I guess.</string>
<string name="20290">Me glad to help. Not need reward.</string>
<string name="20291">Nah. Me take all gold from you dead body.</string>
<string name="20292">I don&apos;t recognize you... are you one of the nobles from here in Blacklake? Regardless, you do see that Meldanen should be forced to give up his stores, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="20293">Who are you? One of the city guard, I suppose. What do you say, &lt;sir/madam&gt;? Don&apos;t you think Meldanen should be forced to stop his hoarding and give up his stores?</string>
<string name="20294">Oh, my... well, I suppose you must be one of the city guard, though I hadn&apos;t realized they were so desperate for recruits.</string>
<string name="20295">So you have returned, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Do you have news?</string>
<string name="20296">It&apos;s in the northwest corner of Blacklake, quite a distance from here. You cannot mistake it... it is walled and will likely have several guards at its gate.</string>
<string name="20297">You may wish to find an alternate entrance, if there is one. Do not forget that the sorcerer no doubt has many protections within his home, as well.</string>
<string name="20298">You change your mind now? How typical. Fine, then... leave me be. If I have to do this myself, then I will.</string>
<string name="20299">Move swiftly, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. The longer you delay the more people suffer.</string>
<string name="20300">You shall have to forgive me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, if I insist on seeing the sorcerer&apos;s tooth before I believe that he is truly dead.</string>
<string name="20301">What you think was the sorcerer might have been an illusion or a simulacrum. Meldanen is cunning, I have little doubt. I am sorry, but I need to see the tooth before I reward you for the deed.</string>
<string name="20302">As promised, I will give you the necklace and 500 gold pieces. I know it isn&apos;t much, but I hope you can take satisfaction in knowing you have helped so many.</string>
<string name="20303">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... have a little more. It is true, however, you do deserve it. 650 gold pieces, then, but I have no more to give.</string>
<string name="20304">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I have nothing more to offer you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, except my gratitude.</string>
<string name="20305">I see. Threats, is it? This is how you respond to a reward, well-intended? Or do you simply look on this as some form of back-alley bargaining?</string>
<string name="20306">Regardless, I won&apos;t stand for it. I offered you a reward for your good service and I would hope that you&apos;d accept it gracefully.</string>
<string name="20307">Then here it is. Thank you again.</string>
<string name="20308">Thank you for your assistance.</string>
<string name="20309">Well, regardless, you do agree with me about Meldanen, don&apos;t you? He should be forced to end his hoarding and give up his stores!</string>
<string name="20310">You don&apos;t know about Meldanen? Well, you must not be from around here, that&apos;s for certain.</string>
<string name="20311">Meldanen is a vicious and evil little man. He does whatever he pleases in Blacklake because he has two things: magic and power.</string>
<string name="20312">He kidnaps people for his experiments and has all sorts of magical abominations in his estate, and all the other nobles pretend not to notice.</string>
<string name="20313">Well, I won&apos;t and I&apos;m not intimidated by him. His merchant house has been hoarding food and goods for years in this district, and he should give it up whether he likes it or not!</string>
<string name="20314">My name is Formosa Laitannen, daughter of a noble house. I may be shut in behind these walls along with the rest of the nobility, but that doesn&apos;t mean I think we don&apos;t have a responsibility to the city!</string>
<string name="20315">There are people starving out there. I would help them if I had food to offer, but only Meldanen has it... and having his hoard taken and given to the sick is the very least that Meldanen should suffer!</string>
<string name="20316">You talk like that&apos;s in question. Meldanen has never denied that fact, and everyone in Blacklake knows that it&apos;s true.</string>
<string name="20317">He keeps a warehouse near here, locked up so tight with spells and wards there&apos;s no hope of access without the proper key. Otherwise the city would have stormed it long ago, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="20318">Everyone&apos;s too frightened of Meldanen to do anything about it, however. So much easier to sit behind these walls and pretend there&apos;s no plague at all.</string>
<string name="20319">Leave you out of it. Everybody wants to be left out of it, it seems. Well, once the plague comes knocking on your doorstep, you won&apos;t want to be left out of it then!</string>
<string name="20320">Bah! What&apos;s the point? What do you want with me, then, &lt;race&gt; creature? Did you come to mock me with these others?</string>
<string name="20321">Bah! I would have hoped for something more from someone with elven blood. Why, I don&apos;t know. What do you want with me, then, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="20322">Of course not. It&apos;s Meldanen&apos;s property, and he can do with it as he pleases, right? Or is it that we shouldn&apos;t convict a man without a trial?</string>
<string name="20323">Or maybe you&apos;re a coward just like everyone else in Blacklake, afraid to give Meldanen what he deserves while helping the people who really need it.</string>
<string name="20324">Or maybe you just don&apos;t care. You don&apos;t live here, correct? I do, and these are my people dying.</string>
<string name="20325">So you&apos;re just going to let this continue? I can&apos;t believe it. Go on, then. Leave me to my task.</string>
<string name="20326">I&apos;d expect as much. Go on, then. Cower with the others.</string>
<string name="20327">I didn&apos;t expect any help from one such as you, anyway. Go on, run off. I shall find someone who will help me.</string>
<string name="20328">I should stop, should I? I should stop caring about the people beyond this wall? I should stop caring that there&apos;s a monster in our midst?</string>
<string name="20329">Well I won&apos;t stop. You can&apos;t make me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, and I spit at you for even suggesting it. Has everyone in the world gone mad?</string>
<string name="20330">Well that&apos;s good to hear. There&apos;s few enough people around here with some courage to know what&apos;s right and say it out loud.</string>
<string name="20331">The only question that remains is what&apos;s to be done about it. The city guard have their hands full just keeping order... and the chance of me stirring up these frightened pigeons to act is not good.</string>
<string name="20332">Something drastic needs to be done, and it needs to be done by those that have the ability and the conviction. Like you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Will you help me?</string>
<string name="20333">That depends. Are you averse to performing a task that some would consider... underhanded?</string>
<string name="20334">I am speaking of killing Meldanen, and taking from him the key to his warehouse.</string>
<string name="20335">You must acquire Meldanen&apos;s key, then, that allows access to his hoard. And Meldanen, himself, must be killed so no one need fear retribution from the monster.</string>
<string name="20336">No? You wouldn&apos;t steal a key that will give the city access to sorely-needed food for victims of the plague? You wouldn&apos;t kill a monstrous sorcerer that surely deserves his fate?</string>
<string name="20337">I do not treat what I am asking you as a trivial thing, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. But it is right and necessary, all the same.</string>
<string name="20338">I am no killer, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. If I were, I would have challenged the sorcerer long ago, and all this would be unnecessary.</string>
<string name="20339">As you wish. I suspect, however, that you will quickly change your mind once you discover the true nature of this man.</string>
<string name="20340">The key that allows access to his hoard is what is important, however. Bring me that. Should you happen to change your mind and give Meldanen his due, I&apos;ll not argue.</string>
<string name="20341">Meldanen lives in a walled mansion in the northwest corner of Blacklake. His gate is guarded well and there are other wards, but somehow you must gain entry.</string>
<string name="20342">I do not expect you to do this without reward, of course. Bring me the key and I will give you a magic necklace. For the sorcerer&apos;s silver tooth, I offer you 500 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="20343">That is all I can offer you... and it is a fair price for the service you will render.</string>
<string name="20344">So Meldanen finally takes action against me, does he? Well, I won&apos;t fall that easily! You&apos;re a fool to do his bidding!!</string>
<string name="20345">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose there&apos;s no harm in that, considering what I&apos;m asking of you. Here is 100 gp... all I have on me, at the moment. Good luck.</string>
<string name="20346">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Nonsense. You&apos;ve a task in front of you, and you&apos;ll get all I have when it&apos;s completed. Good luck to you.</string>
<string name="20347">Hush! Keep your voice down, fool! Hmph... extortion, is it? Here is 100 gold pieces, then... all I have on me right now. Just do what needs to be done.</string>
<string name="20348">Thank the gods that you came, then. Maybe some good can finally come out of all this. I look forward to your return.</string>
<string name="20349">You change your mind now? Fine, then. Go and leave me to do what needs to be done.</string>
<string name="20350">I won&apos;t stop doing what I think is right, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Do whatever you think you have to, and so will I.</string>
<string name="20351">I don&apos;t think you want to hear the directions I would give you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Go on and leave me be.</string>
<string name="20352">You are, are you? I can give you work, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Help me and I&apos;ll reward you, how does that sound?</string>
<string name="20353">I&apos;m not here to answer questions, but if it&apos;s the plague you&apos;re interested in, have you thought of investigating Meldanen?</string>
<string name="20354">I&apos;ve heard about those creatures from Waterdeep. It&apos;s entirely possible the sorcerer might have something to do with that, you know. He collects the oddest things and creates abominations.</string>
<string name="20355">If you&apos;re interested in doing what&apos;s right, why don&apos;t you help me? You may be helping yourself at the same time. What do you say?</string>
<string name="20356">So you&apos;re back, are you? Have you changed your mind, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? Will you help me get the key and end Meldanen&apos;s life?</string>
<string name="20357">The tooth... yes, that looks to be the one. I understand Meldanen took power from it and would not part with it willingly. So he is, indeed, dead.</string>
<string name="20358">Allow me to see it. Yes... this is the one, I can detect the counterspells on it. Bless you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, the city will be thanking the gods for you in the days to come.</string>
<string name="20359">What of Meldanen, himself? What happened with the sorcerer?</string>
<string name="20360">You have retrieved the key and slain the monster in his home. I am in debt to you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I hope what little reward I have to offer will suffice.</string>
<string name="20361">I am relieved. Far more important is the key, however. Do you have it?</string>
<string name="20362">Then I suggest you get it. While I am relieved to hear that Meldanen is dead, his death pales in importance next to retrieving that key.</string>
<string name="20363">What?! The whole purpose of this was to retrieve the warehouse key! Meldanen&apos;s death pales in importance next to it!</string>
<string name="20364">I am relieved to hear that. Keep the tooth and bring it back with the key. I hope to see you soon.</string>
<string name="20365">You shall get the reward when I have the key. No sooner. It is what is truly important, here.</string>
<string name="20366">This is an outrage! I shall fight you, blackguard!</string>
<string name="20367">If I am to reward you, I need proof of the sorcerer&apos;s death. You may have slain a simulacrum or an illusion... I cannot be sure, otherwise.</string>
<string name="20368">If you wish, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, keep the key and return with the sorcerer&apos;s tooth. Then I shall reward you for both.</string>
<string name="20369">As you wish, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. The people may fear Meldanen&apos;s retribution and fear to enter the warehouse... hopefully I can change their mind.</string>
<string name="20370">I am relieved to hear it. I shall await your return.</string>
<string name="20371">You have helped far more than I thought anyone would. Now I must go and collect others to enter the warehouse. Farewell, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="20372">Treacherous fool! I&apos;ll fight you if I must!!</string>
<string name="20373">You are very generous. Take the necklace, regardless... I will not see you completely unrewarded, despite what you say.</string>
<string name="20374">As promised, here is the necklace. I know it is not much, but hopefully it will suffice.</string>
<string name="20375">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you are correct. Here is 250 gold pieces, then... I trust that is fair enough?</string>
<string name="20376">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I will need what gold I have, thank you. You have earned the necklace... be grateful for that alone.</string>
<string name="20377">I see. Threats, is it? This is how you respond to a reward, well-intended? Or do you simply look on this as some form of back-alley bargaining?</string>
<string name="20378">Regardless, I won&apos;t stand for it. I offered you a reward for your good service and I would hope that you&apos;d accept it gracefully.</string>
<string name="20379">Then here it is. Thank you again.</string>
<string name="20380">Nonsense. Take it, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... you have earned it. Perhaps you can do some good with it elsewhere.</string>
<string name="20381">Oh, you must be one of those new guards, yes? Good luck to you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="20382">The Wailing Death has claimed so many lives. It&apos;s such a waste.</string>
<string name="20383">Stay away from me! You look like the sort who might carry the plague. </string>
<string name="20384">Why are you wearing no clothes? You look as foolish as Formosa acts.</string>
<string name="20385">Eh? Are you some naked clown the Formosa girl has hired?</string>
<string name="20386">Oh, look... someone&apos;s running about the square without their clothes on.</string>
<string name="20387">Oh, stop waving that about, will you? I won&apos;t be intimidated.</string>
<string name="20388">Must you walk about with your weapon flashing everywhere, hmm?</string>
<string name="20389">Oh, do put that away, will you?</string>
<string name="20390">You wouldn&apos;t happen to have any news from outside the district, my good &lt;man/woman&gt;, would you?</string>
<string name="20391">How do you do, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? I trust everything is well?</string>
<string name="20392">Hello. Is there something you need, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="20393">I can&apos;t wait until this whole plague business is done with.</string>
<string name="20394">Don&apos;t touch me! You&apos;re ugly enough to be one of the plague stricken.</string>
<string name="20395">Stand away from me, you, before I call the guard!</string>
<string name="20396">Oh, dear. Yet another &lt;race&gt; lout in Blacklake. Shameful.</string>
<string name="20397">The guards let more &lt;race&gt; kind into Blacklake, did they?</string>
<string name="20398">Oh, do go away. I&apos;ll not catch the plague from just any old &lt;race&gt; type, no sir.</string>
<string name="20399">I knew that Formosa girl was going to get herself into trouble with all that talk about the sorcerer. Tsk.</string>
<string name="20400">Well, they just better not let the poor into Blacklake, now, that&apos;s all I have to say!</string>
<string name="20401">I don&apos;t wish to end up like Formosa. No, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, not me.</string>
<string name="20402">Err... no, no, I have nothing against Meldanen. No need to ask me twice.</string>
<string name="20403">Take a word of advice: ignore Formosa and her ranting. She&apos;ll just get us all into trouble, she will.</string>
<string name="20404">I can&apos;t believe how she&apos;s going on about the sorcerer! She&apos;ll get us all killed!</string>
<string name="20405">Meldanen is not one to be trifled with. He&apos;s the wealthiest and most powerful noble in the district... and a sorcerer, too, I hear.</string>
<string name="20406">Foolish girl. Somebody should shut her up, I say!</string>
<string name="20407">Oh dear... this is just all going to bring the plague down upon us, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="20408">What does she want, anyway? To give all of the sorcerer&apos;s wealth to the poor? Ludicrous!</string>
<string name="20409">Meldanen dead! Have you heard? Unbelieveable!</string>
<string name="20410">You don&apos;t think that Formosa actually had something to do with the sorcerer&apos;s death, do you? No, no, that&apos;s too silly... </string>
<string name="20411">Well, I say good riddance! That Meldanen was a nuisance to us all!</string>
<string name="20412">I hear the sorcerer had all sorts of evil creatures in his home. I think it&apos;s high time someone killed him!</string>
<string name="20413">Formosa dead! Shocking!!</string>
<string name="20414">So... ahhh... Formosa is dead, is she? Err... good job, &lt;sir/madam&gt;... </string>
<string name="20415">Who&apos;s this Formosa? I have no idea who you&apos;re talking about.</string>
<string name="20416">I have no intention of sparing you, but all the pleading is quite amusing.</string>
<string name="20417">Make me an offer and I&apos;ll consider it.</string>
<string name="20418">I&apos;m here to free the dryad you stole, sorcerer.</string>
<string name="20419">Who this Formosa? Me not know.</string>
<string name="20420">Me kill you anyway, though begging sounds funny.</string>
<string name="20421">Me here to free dryad you steal, wizard.</string>
<string name="20422">Make me offer and me think about it, maybe.</string>
<string name="20423">To kill you, I suppose. And it&apos;s high time I got back to it.</string>
<string name="20424">I&apos;m simply here looking for some coin.</string>
<string name="20425">I meant no harm. You attacked me, remember?</string>
<string name="20426">Killing, mostly. Now me get back to it.</string>
<string name="20427">Me look for coin. Duh.</string>
<string name="20428">Me not here to kill you. You attack me, no?</string>
<string name="20429">What do you have in mind, exactly?</string>
<string name="20430">And what&apos;s to stop me from just taking all you own anyway?</string>
<string name="20431">Too much bother. I&apos;d rather kill you.</string>
<string name="20432">What task?</string>
<string name="20433">What stop me from taking all you gots anyway?</string>
<string name="20434">Is too much thinking. You die now.</string>
<string name="20435">And what&apos;s to stop me from taking your coin anyway?</string>
<string name="20436">I would need your silver tooth as well as the key to your warehouse.</string>
<string name="20437">Give me more and I&apos;ll deal with Formosa for you.</string>
<string name="20438">What stop me from robbing after you&apos;se dead?</string>
<string name="20439">Me need silver tooth... plus key for warehouse.</string>
<string name="20440">You give more gold and me kill Formosa for you, maybe.</string>
<string name="20441">No, just give me the dryad and your gold and I&apos;ll leave you be.</string>
<string name="20442">No, you give dryad and gold and you live. That my deal.</string>
<string name="20443">Give up the dryad, as well. Then I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="20444">No, I&apos;m not killing anyone... I came for the dryad. Just go.</string>
<string name="20445">Give dryad, too. Then me will do it.</string>
<string name="20446">No, me no kill anyone. Me come for dryad, you just go.</string>
<string name="20447">I doubt you even have more coin. Sorry, no deal.</string>
<string name="20448">Maybe you have no more gold. Is no deal.</string>
<string name="20449">Fine. I&apos;ll take them and your gold... and you flee before I change my mind.</string>
<string name="20450">Okay. Me take them and gold, and you run away.</string>
<string name="20451">Nevermind, then. I may spare you... but I need your silver tooth and the warehouse key.</string>
<string name="20452">No, no. Is no good. Maybe me spare you, but me needs silver tooth and warehouse key.</string>
<string name="20453">You know, I don&apos;t have to do this. Pay me more and I&apos;ll take care of Formosa for you.</string>
<string name="20454">You pay me more coin, you knows, and I could kills Formosa.</string>
<string name="20455">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Don&apos;t you think saving your life is worth a little more gold than that?</string>
<string name="20456">You better dig a little deeper... your life is on the line, fool.</string>
<string name="20457">It will have to do, then.</string>
<string name="20458">It doesn&apos;t matter... I won&apos;t let you live, regardless.</string>
<string name="20459">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You no think saving your life worth more?</string>
<string name="20460">You pay more or me getting very angry.</string>
<string name="20461">Me take it.</string>
<string name="20462">It no matter... me kill you, anyways.</string>
<string name="20463">I was only kidding. Your gold will do.</string>
<string name="20464">I bet you have more than you&apos;re saying. I&apos;ll just search your corpse!</string>
<string name="20465">Because I enjoy it, of course.</string>
<string name="20466">Me only kidding. Ha ha! Gold is good.</string>
<string name="20467">Me bet you have more gold. Me search corpse!</string>
<string name="20468">Me enjoys killing! Raaaauuugh!!</string>
<string name="20469">Hmmm. You must have magic, seeing as you&apos;re a sorcerer.</string>
<string name="20470">You gots magic stuff?</string>
<string name="20471">I want the key to your warehouse, as well. You can live.</string>
<string name="20472">Me want warehouse key, too. You live.</string>
<string name="20473">That&apos;s right. Give me the dryad and you can go.</string>
<string name="20474">Yes. Give dryad and you go.</string>
<string name="20475">Sounds like this Formosa wants to kill you. Pay me more and I&apos;ll deal with her for you.</string>
<string name="20476">This Formosa want you dead? Pay more and I kill her for you.</string>
<string name="20477">So you have the dryad, then? Unbelievable!</string>
<string name="20478">You have dryad here?! Me cannot believe it!</string>
<string name="20479">Well... there is the matter of the dryad in the cage.</string>
<string name="20480">There is matter of dryad in cage, there.</string>
<string name="20481">No, Formosa did send me, actually. Now you die.</string>
<string name="20482">No, Formosa send me. Now you die.</string>
<string name="20483">Just gold? You&apos;re a sorcerer... you must have magic.</string>
<string name="20484">Gold? You wizard, you have magic, no?</string>
<string name="20485">No, I&apos;d rather kill you.</string>
<string name="20486">No, me rather kill you.</string>
<string name="20487">Forget it. The dryad is all that&apos;s important... just leave.</string>
<string name="20488">No... dryad is all that important. You just go.</string>
<string name="20489">Just give me the tooth and key. Keep your gold and run.</string>
<string name="20490">Just give tooth and key. Keep gold and go.</string>
<string name="20491">Nevermind the tooth. Just the key and your gold will do.</string>
<string name="20492">No tooth. Just give key and gold.</string>
<string name="20493">Fine. The gold and the dryad, and you go free.</string>
<string name="20494">Okay. Gold and dryad, and you lives.</string>
<string name="20495"></string>
<string name="20496">You believe you can just invade my home, do you?! I am not so easily assassinated!</string>
<string name="20497">Formosa sent you to kill me, didn&apos;t she?! Didn&apos;t she?! Why are you here?!</string>
<string name="20498">That fool elven woman didn&apos;t send you? Then why are you here?</string>
<string name="20499">No! I will kill you, fool, I will!!</string>
<string name="20500">I did not steal her! I found her wandering the streets and took her in. It was my plan originally to concoct a cure for this plague from her and sell it to the highest bidder.</string>
<string name="20501">Since then, however, her... charms... have weakened my judgment and prevented my research. Bah! No doubt it is best she is taken, or I could not rid myself of her influence.</string>
<string name="20502">Spare my life and I&apos;ll give you 500 gp. It is all I have... and surely more than Formosa could possibly have paid you.</string>
<string name="20503">My estate is well-guarded. You expect me to believe you came here simply by accident? Your type seeks coin and treasure, yes?</string>
<string name="20504">Well if it&apos;s coin you seek, I have plenty. I am more than willing to offer it to you in exchange for a task, perhaps?</string>
<string name="20505">I have 500 gold pieces now... take that and kill Formosa before she convinces some other fool to try to kill me. When you return, I&apos;ll pay you another 500 gp.</string>
<string name="20506">Nothing. I have little doubt you have looted my home already. But... if you kill Formosa for me I can give you even more gold later... gold you won&apos;t get any other way.</string>
<string name="20507">N-nothing. It... is all the coin I have here, however. Please, I beg you for mercy!</string>
<string name="20508">So the wench did send you. Bah! Fine... I shall rip out my silver tooth and give you both it and the key. I am not above purchasing my life.</string>
<string name="20509">I can give you the 500 gold pieces now. If you deal with Formosa and return, I can get another 500 gold pieces by then and pay you that as well.</string>
<string name="20510">As you wish. You&apos;ll find the elven wench preaching in the square in the southeast part of the district. I truly wish I could see the look on her face!</string>
<string name="20511">As you wish. I am not above buying my life and fleeing my home, after all.</string>
<string name="20512">You are... unexpectedly merciful. I suppose I should be grateful. Here is the key to the dryad&apos;s cage... take her. I will hope not to see you again.</string>
<string name="20513">Here is the 500 gold pieces and the key to the dryad&apos;s cage. You will get the rest of your gold when I am certain that Formosa is dead. I shall see you then.</string>
<string name="20514">I suppose I shall take what mercy you will give. Very well... AGGGHHK!... h-here... is my tooth... and the key to the warehouse as well.</string>
<string name="20515">No! Don&apos;t kill me, please! I&apos;ll give you anything!!</string>
<string name="20516">I am leaving. Now begone.</string>
<string name="20517">Here is 500 gp, which is all I have... and the key to the dryad&apos;s cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.</string>
<string name="20518">It has come to my attention that Formosa is, indeed, dead as we agreed. Well done.</string>
<string name="20519">You are a companion of &lt;CUSTOM1003&gt;, then? Yes, so it must be.</string>
<string name="20520">I have heard that the elven wench has been permanently and thankfully silenced, and I am very relieved... and grateful to &lt;CUSTOM1003&gt;, of course.</string>
<string name="20521">Here is the 500 gold pieces that I promised, though it was not easy to acquire. This is sufficient, I hope.</string>
<string name="20522">What? But... I have nothing else of value! Why would you do this?!</string>
<string name="20523">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Err... yes, of course... but this is simply all the wealth I can obtain. I could get no more even if I tried.</string>
<string name="20524">I... I... I have no more coin. Please... just take the gold and leave, I beg you!</string>
<string name="20525">Here it is. Now leave... I hope I will not see you again.</string>
<string name="20526">Some. I devote most of my time to research, however, and not creating magic trinkets. No doubt you&apos;ve helped yourself to what I own.</string>
<string name="20527">But I have gold you won&apos;t find here in my home. Yes, and magic too. What do you say to that?</string>
<string name="20528">So... are you saying, then, that Formosa did not send you? You... you will spare me if I give you the key to the Dryad&apos;s cage?</string>
<string name="20529">You are... here for the dryad? Yes... yes, I found her wandering the streets and took her in. At first it was my plan to use her to find a cure for the plague and sell it to the highest bidder.</string>
<string name="20530">You... you have come for the dryad, not for me? So she is indeed one of the Waterdhavian beasts, as I suspected.</string>
<string name="20531">I had thought at first to use her to formulate a cure for the plague, and then sell it to the highest bidder and make a fortune.</string>
<string name="20532">Some, yes, but you have without a doubt helped yourself to what little I possess. I spend most of my time in research.</string>
<string name="20533">Or did the elven wench not tell you that before she hired you? Regardless, while I have no items to offer, gold I have plenty of.</string>
<string name="20534">So the elven wench did send you, after all... just not to kill me. Or is that your doing? Regardless, I suppose I should be thankful for your mercy.</string>
<string name="20535">Here is the key to the warehouse. It also unlocks the dryad&apos;s cage... take her. Now I shall flee before someone more ruthless than you breaks into my home.</string>
<string name="20536">And here is my ransom: 500 gold pieces. The warehouse key also opens the dryad&apos;s cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.</string>
<string name="20537">I suppose I shall take what mercy you will give. Very well... AGGGHHK!... h-here... is my tooth... a-and the key to the warehouse.</string>
<string name="20538">As for the dryad... the warehouse key also opens her cage. Take it... and take her and get out. I hope I shall not see you again.</string>
<string name="20539">I suppose I should be thankful at your mercy. Here... take the key that the wench wants. Just take it.</string>
<string name="20540">Th-thank you, then, for your mercy... such as it is. I shall have to repay the wench someday soon for this indignity.</string>

<string name="20637">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="20638">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="20639">Are you aware of any strange creatures in the area?</string>
<string name="20640">Have you heard any rumors concerning the plague?</string>
<string name="20641">Do you know of anything interesting going on in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="20642">You know &apos;bout strange creatures around?</string>
<string name="20643">You hear plague rumors, maybe?</string>
<string name="20644">You know &apos;bout weird stuff here?</string>
<string name="20645">So there&apos;s been nothing odd about the zoo, then?</string>
<string name="20646">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is it possible that some creatures might have gained access to the zoo, somehow?</string>
<string name="20647">Nothing weird about zoo?</string>
<string name="20648">Anything peculiar that you can think of?</string>
<string name="20649">I&apos;d be interested in work, if you know of anything.</string>
<string name="20650">Any places in Blacklake you think I should visit?</string>
<string name="20651">Any weird stuff?</string>
<string name="20652">Me want work.</string>
<string name="20653">Places in Blacklake I should go to?</string>
<string name="20654">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="20655">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="20656">I&apos;m investigating the plague. Perhaps you can help me?</string>
<string name="20657">Me look into plague. Maybe you help?</string>
<string name="20658">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="20659">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="20660">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="20661">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="20662">Where is the nearest inn?</string>
<string name="20663">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="20664">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="20665">Me look for place to sleep.</string>
<string name="20666">Me look for temple.</string>
<string name="20667">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="20668">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="20669">No, me have other question.</string>
<string name="20670">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m with the city guard, I don&apos;t mean any harm.</string>
<string name="20671"></string>
<string name="20672">Get out of my way! I&apos;ll go where I please!</string>
<string name="20673">I was just leaving.</string>
<string name="20674">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me city guard. Mean no harm.</string>
<string name="20675"></string>
<string name="20676">You get out of way! Me goes where me want!!</string>
<string name="20677">Me is going, now.</string>
<string name="20678">My dear, dear lady, are you sure you couldn&apos;t tell me?</string>
<string name="20679">Gee, pretty lady, you sure you not say? Me curious... </string>
<string name="20680">Back again, are you? Something you need?</string>
<string name="20681">Fare you well, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="20682">I&apos;m sure you know the way out.</string>
<string name="20683">Yes, leave me be.</string>
<string name="20684">Ah. This should be interesting.</string>
<string name="20685">Oh, I suppose there&apos;s no harm. I haven&apos;t seen a soul for days with all that&apos;s going on.</string>
<string name="20686">Well... it&apos;s not like you have the plague or anything. Go on, then.</string>
<string name="20687">Oh, all right. (sigh) It&apos;s not like there&apos;s much else going on, with the plague and all.</string>
<string name="20688">Merciful heavens, no. Well... there are the creatures at the zoo, of course. They have all been there since before the plague, however.</string>
<string name="20689">Nothing that you wouldn&apos;t have heard elsewhere, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. To be honest, what little chat I&apos;ve had with the neighbours has been about anything *but* the plague.</string>
<string name="20690">We nobles have been keeping to ourselves, mostly, but I do try to keep up on the latest gossip, if that&apos;s what you mean.</string>
<string name="20691">Well... there is the business with Meldanen. But talking about him is never a good idea.</string>
<string name="20692">Well, that girl Formosa is looking for people who will listen to her. She&apos;s down in the southeast square trying to stir up folks against Meldanen.</string>
<string name="20693">I don&apos;t know. That tavern, the Board Laid Bare? It has quite a scandalous reputation, I hear.</string>
<string name="20694">I&apos;m looking for a housekeeper. Mine died of the plague, I hear. No good?</string>
<string name="20695">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="20696">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose there&apos;s no way for the wizard to know, is there? Well... word is that Meldanen recently accquired a young woman for his amusement.</string>
<string name="20697">He won&apos;t let her out, and the rumors say that she&apos;s rather strange... perhaps not quite human. The gods only know what he wants with her. Rather sordid business, no?</string>
<string name="20698">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; It would do more harm than you know. Meldanen&apos;s a fearsome man... I wouldn&apos;t mind if he turned up dead one day, myself.</string>
<string name="20699">Not that I&apos;ve heard. Mind you, we nobles have been keeping to ourselves, lately. The zoo&apos;s in the northeast if you want to see for yourself.</string>
<string name="20700">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="20701">Err... perhaps, I don&apos;t know. Sureshot... or, that is, Lord Montgomery... is in charge of the zoo and I haven&apos;t heard a peep from him since the whole plague business began.</string>
<string name="20702">Perhaps you might want to speak to him. The zoo&apos;s in the northeast part of the district if you haven&apos;t already been.</string>
<string name="20703"></string>
<string name="20704"></string>
<string name="20705">I am no expert on the plague, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. There is no plague in Blacklake, after all. But I will answer what I can.</string>
<string name="20706">What were you looking for, then?</string>
<string name="20707">I can show you the way out. (sigh) Oh, go ahead.</string>
<string name="20708">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="20709">That much is obvious.</string>
<string name="20710">Hmph. Angling for an invitation, are we? Well you can&apos;t stay here. The Board Laid Bare by the south gate is the nearest place.</string>
<string name="20711">I&apos;m afraid there isn&apos;t one in the area. We were trying to raise coin for a temple devoted to Sune... but I&apos;m sure you&apos;re not interested in that.</string>
<string name="20712">No. But you can buy equipment at the Board Laid Bare, I hear. It&apos;s by the south gate.</string>
<string name="20713">Is there something else?</string>
<string name="20714">Why have you intruded? Get out! Out! Evil dog!</string>
<string name="20715"></string>
<string name="20716"></string>
<string name="20717">Not one step closer or I shall scream! Why have you invaded my home?!</string>
<string name="20718">What is this? Has the city fallen apart, now? Get out of here this instant!</string>
<string name="20719">Get out of my home! Thief! Vagrant! Where is the watch when you need them?!</string>
<string name="20720">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... suppose you can be trusted. A woman on her own in these dangerous times has to be cautious, you understand.</string>
<string name="20721">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t trust the look of you! Get out this instant!!</string>
<string name="20722"></string>
<string name="20723">Get out, before I call the watch on you!</string>
<string name="20724">What was it you wanted, then, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="20725">Around *here*? Oh... you mean around the district.</string>
<string name="20726">It was bound to happen. (sigh)</string>
<string name="20727">At any rate, if you want you can see for yourself. Meldanen&apos;s estate is in the northwest. I wouldn&apos;t advise going there, though... he won&apos;t see you.</string>
<string name="20728">I never said that, however. His mansion is in the northwest part of the district... but I&apos;d avoid it like the plague.</string>
<string name="20729">We&apos;d all like to see the wizard gone, but what are *we* supposed to do about it? Perhaps you&apos;d like to help her, I don&apos;t know.</string>

<string name="20828">I don&apos;t trust you. Time to die!</string>
<string name="20829">No believe! Die! Die!!</string>
<string name="20830">Yes, I could use some information.</string>
<string name="20831">You&apos;re of no use to me. Get lost.</string>
<string name="20832">Yes, tell me. That good.</string>
<string name="20833">You no use to me, then. Go.</string>
<string name="20834">Then go. The way behind me is clear.</string>
<string name="20835">Perhaps you should accompany me. It would be safer that way.</string>
<string name="20836">Then go. Way behind is clear.</string>
<string name="20837">No, you come with me. Safer.</string>
<string name="20838">Just how did you end up prisoner here?</string>
<string name="20839">What do you know about this place?</string>
<string name="20840">All right. I&apos;m done with you now.</string>
<string name="20841">How you end up in prison?</string>
<string name="20842">What you know of this place?</string>
<string name="20843">Me done with you.</string>
<string name="20844">But why would he keep you prisoner? A member of city guard?</string>
<string name="20845">Do you know where Meldanen could be found?</string>
<string name="20846">Why he keep you? You city guard.</string>
<string name="20847">Me look for Meldanen.</string>
<string name="20848">You&apos;re Samuel? Captain Thurin sent me to look for you.</string>
<string name="20849">You Samuel? Captain Thurin sends me.</string>
<string name="20850">What&apos;s this? Am I finally to be rescued, or are you another of the wizard&apos;s servants?</string>
<string name="20851">You... you aren&apos;t another of the wizard&apos;s servants, are you? Is this another of his tricks?</string>
<string name="20852">Don&apos;t... don&apos;t hurt me! Please! I haven&apos;t tried to escape the wizard&apos;s damned prison, I haven&apos;t!</string>
<string name="20853">I am. My name is Samuel... an inspector for the city guard, until that mad wizard took me prisoner.</string>
<string name="20854">I am unarmed and no threat to you, I&apos;m sure. My name is Samuel... an inspector from the city guard... and a prisoner of the wizard, unfortunately.</string>
<string name="20855">That&apos;s a relief. My name is Samuel... an inspector for the city guard. I was beginning to think no one would ever free me.</string>
<string name="20856">You mean... I can just go? Just like that?</string>
<string name="20857">Of course. I&apos;ll tell you whatever I know, though it probably isn&apos;t much.</string>
<string name="20858">I&apos;ve no reason to lie to you. I&apos;ve no weapons... I&apos;m completely at your mercy, in fact. If you would release me, I&apos;m sure my captain would even reward you.</string>
<string name="20859">I&apos;ve no money of my own... but my captain might reward you. Otherwise all I can offer you is some information about this place.</string>
<string name="20860">Yes... yes, I believe I could. I&apos;d try to, at least.</string>
<string name="20861">Lying? About what? Oh... about being a prisoner.</string>
<string name="20862">Ahhhh!! Help me, someone!</string>
<string name="20863">Thank you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I&apos;m sure I can find my way out of here. I only wish I could take revenge on that damnable wizard!</string>
<string name="20864">That&apos;s not necessary, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, though I appreciate the offer. I would only slow you down, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="20865">*Sigh* I was just poking around the estate, actually, looking into some rumors I&apos;d heard of Meldanen acting even more strangely than usual.</string>
<string name="20866">I don&apos;t remember much. The west wing, here, seems to be used mainly for Meldanen&apos;s experiments and storage. I think he lives below.</string>
<string name="20867">I don&apos;t know. Meldanen wouldn&apos;t ordinarily do this... lots of other things, perhaps, but not take a guard hostage. I don&apos;t know what he&apos;s up to.</string>
<string name="20868">I think the way to the lower floor is at the end of the hall, through a room on the right. That&apos;s where Meldanen went, at any rate.</string>
<string name="20869">Once you leave this place, seek out Captain Thurin. I&apos;m sure he will want to thank you for finding me. Fare you well!</string>
<string name="20870">I didn&apos;t find anything, but it appears I was correct. Meldanen captured me and ranted on about how I was trying to steal something from him.</string>
<string name="20871">I&apos;ve no idea what he was talking about... but he seemed convinced that I was up to no good and wouldn&apos;t let me go.</string>
<string name="20872">He did? It&apos;s good to know he didn&apos;t abandon me... I was almost afraid that, well... nevermind. Thank you for coming to release me.</string>
<string name="20873">Help me! Get me out of here!</string>
<string name="20874">Meldanen and his kind are a scourge.</string>
<string name="20875">Today he experiments on magical creatures. Tomorrow he will experiment on your children.</string>
<string name="20876">Our bellies are empty while Meldanen hoards food.</string>
<string name="20877">If he denies us bread, we should deny him breath.</string>
<string name="20878">Is the plague not enough? Need we starve as well? Meldanen thinks so.</string>
<string name="20879">This is what happens when farmers become sorcerers and sorcerers become farmers. It isn&apos;t natural.</string>
<string name="20880">Every man, elf, and dwarf deserves to eat, not just the rich.</string>
<string name="20881">You have the power to do something about it. Rise up, rise up and share your power.</string>
<string name="20882">He became rich from our labor. It&apos;s only fair that we should not be left to starve.</string>
<string name="20883">Meldanen has locked himself away, playing with his magical beasts. It&apos;s time for him to come out and pay his due. Pay it with his hide!</string>
<string name="20884">Might I ask your name, friend?</string>
<string name="20885">May I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="20886">Who are you?</string>
<string name="20887">I would ask a question of you.</string>
<string name="20888">Tell me who you are.</string>
<string name="20889">Yeah, whatever. I have a question.</string>
<string name="20890">Who you?</string>
<string name="20891">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="20892">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="20893">I am called &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="20894">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. Pleased to meet you, Captain Thurin.</string>
<string name="20895">You don&apos;t need to know who I am.</string>
<string name="20896">Me is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="20897">Me called &lt;FullName&gt;. Is nice to meet you.</string>
<string name="20898">You no need know me.</string>
<string name="20899">What kind of problems are you referring to?</string>
<string name="20900">I&apos;m looking for work, if you know of anything.</string>
<string name="20901">I have some questions about the plague.</string>
<string name="20902">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="20903">Me have questions about plague.</string>
<string name="20904">Me look for work.</string>
<string name="20905">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="20906">What problems?</string>
<string name="20907">Perhaps you could tell me who you are?</string>
<string name="20908">Who you?</string>
<string name="20909">Do you have any idea where he could be?</string>
<string name="20910">Have you had your men search for him?</string>
<string name="20911">Do you know where he was last seen?</string>
<string name="20912">What would the reward be if he was found?</string>
<string name="20913">I could look for him.</string>
<string name="20914">Sorry, but I&apos;m not interested in this.</string>
<string name="20915">Think where he be, maybe?</string>
<string name="20916">You have guard look around?</string>
<string name="20917">You knows where he seen last?</string>
<string name="20918">What reward for finding, maybe?</string>
<string name="20919">Me could looks for him.</string>
<string name="20920">Me have no interest. Too busy.</string>
<string name="20921">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; All right... but don&apos;t you think I should get some coin up front for my trouble?</string>
<string name="20922">Fine. But I want some coin now... or your friend might be dead when I find him.</string>
<string name="20923">I&apos;ll find him if I can.</string>
<string name="20924">I&apos;ll find Samuel and return him safely, I promise.</string>
<string name="20925">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me think some coin for trouble good idea, no?</string>
<string name="20926">You give some coin now. Or friend not be healthy when me finds him.</string>
<string name="20927">Me do that.</string>
<string name="20928">Me finds Samuel, me promise.</string>
<string name="20929">No. Have you heard anything more of Samuel, yet?</string>
<string name="20930">I&apos;m sorry, but... I&apos;m afraid that Samuel died when he was being freed from Meldanen&apos;s prison.</string>
<string name="20931">He was in Meldanen&apos;s prison, but he was killed. Them&apos;s the breaks.</string>
<string name="20932">Not yet, but I&apos;m working on it.</string>
<string name="20933">Yeah, yeah, I&apos;ll get around to it eventually.</string>
<string name="20934">No. Maybe you hears something new?</string>
<string name="20935">Me sorry... but he die when me freeing him from Meldanen prison... </string>
<string name="20936">Me free him from Meldanen prison, but he die on way. (belch!) Oh well.</string>
<string name="20937">No, but me working on it.</string>
<string name="20938">Me get around to it sometime, maybe.</string>
<string name="20939">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Are you sure you can&apos;t afford more? This is your friend I found, after all.</string>
<string name="20940">This is hardly a reward. You had better dig deeper, or else... </string>
<string name="20941">Thank you. That will be fine.</string>
<string name="20942">No, there&apos;s no need for the reward. I was happy to do it.</string>
<string name="20943">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me thinks you afford more. Samuel you friend, no?</string>
<string name="20944">No good reward. Me thinks you dig deeper or me gets angry... </string>
<string name="20945">This is okay.</string>
<string name="20946">No, me no need reward. Me happy to help.</string>
<string name="20947">Has there been anything odd happening in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="20948">Are you aware of any strange creatures in the area?</string>
<string name="20949">Any weird stuff in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="20950">You know &apos;bout monsters &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="20951">Go ahead.</string>
<string name="20952">No, let me ask you something else.</string>
<string name="20953">Yuh. You tells me.</string>
<string name="20954">Me ask something else.</string>
<string name="20955">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s not a threat. Just an encouragement to keep him alive should he be injured when I find him.</string>
<string name="20956">If you had the manpower to do that, you wouldn&apos;t need me in the first place.</string>
<string name="20957">Nevermind, then. I&apos;ll look for him.</string>
<string name="20958">You can tries, if you likes.</string>
<string name="20959">Okay, me looks for him, then.</string>
<string name="20960">Greetings, citizen.</string>
<string name="20961">Farewell, my good &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="20962">Farewell.</string>
<string name="20963">As you wish.</string>
<string name="20964">I am Thurin, captain of the guard here in Blacklake, good &lt;man/woman&gt;... and you are?</string>
<string name="20965">I am Thurin, captain of the guard in the Blacklake district, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Might I know who is asking?</string>
<string name="20966">The name is Thurin, captain of the guard here in Blacklake, if you must know. Are you going to tell me who you are, then?</string>
<string name="20967">Pleased to meet you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. (sigh) You&apos;ll have to forgive my mood. I am beset by problems, it seems. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="20968">Then introductions are over with. I have my own problems, &lt;FirstName&gt;... is there something that you wanted?</string>
<string name="20969">You as well, &lt;FullName&gt;. (sigh) If only I were not beset by problems, that is. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="20970">Thank you. I have plenty of problems I must contend with today, &lt;FullName&gt;... what can I do for you?</string>
<string name="20971">I am beset by enough problems, so I suppose it really doesn&apos;t matter. What would you have of me, stranger?</string>
<string name="20972">I am in no mood to play games, especially today. I trust you have no immediate need for the guard, correct? Then good day.</string>
<string name="20973">Certainly, though I have plenty of problems to deal with today and very little time to chat. What do you wish to know?</string>
<string name="20974">If you must. I have my own problems, however, and I am not very talkative. What do you wish to know?</string>
<string name="20975">Considering that I have my own problems, that hardly makes me feel any more charitable. Ask, if you must.</string>
<string name="20976">There&apos;s not much I can tell you about the plague, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. It&apos;s all we can do, currently, to keep Blacklake cordoned off from the rest of the city.</string>
<string name="20977">I&apos;m sure someone else can provide you with directions. As I said, I have my own problems.</string>
<string name="20978">Well, beyond trying to keep the plague out of the district, one of my men seems to have disappeared without a trace.</string>
<string name="20979">Work? If you&apos;re looking for work, perhaps you could be of assistance.</string>
<string name="20980">I don&apos;t even think you would understand. Oh, why not?</string>
<string name="20981">Some of my men seem to think Samuel is drunk in some gutter, somewhere. The old man drank, certainly... but he&apos;s never disappeared. It would take something more to do that.</string>
<string name="20982">I don&apos;t have the manpower. Right now, it&apos;s all I can do to hold down the gates and keep Blacklake calm. I&apos;ve told my men to keep on the lookout... but nothing so far.</string>
<string name="20983">Samuel was one of my inspectors... my best one, in fact. He may have been looking into something, but if he was he never told anyone what he was doing.</string>
<string name="20984">I would gladly pay 300 gold pieces if someone found Samuel and he was returned, unharmed. That is all I can afford, however.</string>
<string name="20985">I see. (sigh) I truly didn&apos;t expect any help, at any rate. I suppose Samuel will turn up at some point, eventually.</string>
<string name="20986">Thank you at any rate. Now, if you will excuse me, I have other matters to attend to.</string>
<string name="20987">Now, then... leave me be, if you cannot be of any service.</string>
<string name="20988">Would you? I suppose, at this point, I can&apos;t be too picky about whom I ask for help. If you could look for Samuel, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, it would be quite a relief.</string>
<string name="20989">If you do find him, tell him to return if he can. At the very least, I would like to be certain of his fate.</string>
<string name="20990">Greetings again, &lt;CUSTOM1005&gt;. Have you had any progress? Have you found Samuel?</string>
<string name="20991">Greetings. You must be with &lt;CUSTOM1005&gt;, correct?</string>
<string name="20992">Thank you, thank you! Godspeed, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;!</string>
<string name="20993">Thank you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I can only hope that you find him safe.</string>
<string name="20994">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... suppose that would be expected. I shall simply have to hope that you live up to your word. Here you go, then... and good luck in your search.</string>
<string name="20995">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I have no guarantee that you will even look for Samuel at all once we part ways. You will see the reward when I see him, and that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="20996">I see. Now tell me why I shouldn&apos;t have you arrested for threatening an officer of the law.</string>
<string name="20997">I certainly hope that you find Samuel soon.</string>
<string name="20998">With that kind of attitude, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, Samuel may very well never be found.</string>
<string name="20999">Unfortunately not. Neither I nor any of my men have anything new to report. I remain confident, however, that he will turn up eventually.</string>
<string name="21000">Ah, I see. Meldanen, was it? That explains much. Thank you for the attempt... it is good to know what happened, even if the news was the worst.</string>
<string name="21001">Dead?! Ah, I see how you work. Everything neatly points to Meldanen. How convenient. I&apos;ll follow the evidence, but if it turns out you were involved, I&apos;ll see you hang.</string>
<string name="21002">I shall have to see about dealing with the sorcerer, himself, then. Meldanen will not get away with this!</string>
<string name="21003">And you appear very upset by it. Hmph. At any rate, it appears that Meldanen is the real culprit, here.</string>
<string name="21004">I see that &lt;CUSTOM1005&gt; has given you my ring. Does that mean the task is yours, now? Tell me, then, have you any news of Samuel?</string>
<string name="21005">I suppose it&apos;s only natural that additional help is needed to find Samuel. Tell me, has there been any progress?</string>
<string name="21006">Samuel has already made it back to the barracks. I was quite surprised to hear what had happened to him... I didn&apos;t think the sorcerer had the gall in him.</string>
<string name="21007">Here is the 300 gold pieces reward. It&apos;s a bit more than the guard can afford right now, obviously, but you&apos;ve certainly earned it. Samuel is a close friend, after all.</string>
<string name="21008">Is that supposed to be intimidating? Considering that you&apos;ve helped me greatly, I&apos;ll just forget that threat. Here is your 300 gp... take it and go.</string>
<string name="21009">Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, there&apos;s still much for me to deal with today.</string>
<string name="21010">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; True. I can add a bit of my own gold... 375 gp, then. But that is all I can afford.</string>
<string name="21011">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I am far from wealthy, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, and as I said that is all the guard can spare.</string>
<string name="21012">Thank you once again... you&apos;ve helped far more than I would have hoped. Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, there&apos;s still much for me to deal with today.</string>
<string name="21013">Take it, then. I wish I could pay you more.</string>
<string name="21014">You are far too kind, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I shall make sure the guard knows of your service. </string>
<string name="21015">I&apos;m sorry, but I really must be leaving. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="21016">I can&apos;t say that I feel good about it... all those poor souls desperate to get into this area, not even caring that they would spread the disease here.</string>
<string name="21017">I wish I could do something more and not sit here safely... but I suppose I have enough problems of my own.</string>
<string name="21018">Besides the local nobles getting paranoid enough to turn on each other, nothing truly odd, no.</string>
<string name="21019">Well, now, I suppose that&apos;s not exactly true. There is something odd that happened, if you want to hear about it.</string>
<string name="21020">No. There are some odd creatures at the zoo, but nothing running about loose. I&apos;m sure my men would have reported that.</string>
<string name="21021">What do you wish to know?</string>
<string name="21022">I suppose that in itself wouldn&apos;t be so odd, considering the times, but I know this man too well. He&apos;s an old friend of mine named Samuel... and he wouldn&apos;t just leave.</string>
<string name="21023">I know where he&apos;s not. He hasn&apos;t reported back to his barracks, and his family hasn&apos;t seen him. He also hasn&apos;t left Blacklake... not by the gates, anyway.</string>
<string name="21024">Would you? I would be more than happy to have the aid of someone trustworthy in finding Samuel. Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="21025">Fine. Here&apos;s 100 gp. I want my friend back: alive. Don&apos;t disappoint.</string>
<string name="21026">You don&apos;t want to test that, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Just find him... if he&apos;s harmed, I&apos;ll hold you responsible, is that understood? Go, then.</string>
<string name="21027">I hear that the sorcerer is dead. I shall have to take some men and make certain for myself. Farewell, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="21028">I hear that the sorcerer is dead. I shall have to take some men and make certain for myself. You, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, I hope not to see again.</string>
<string name="21029">I am a member of the city guard under Aribeth. I think I can enter.</string>
<string name="21030">Me city guard. Aribeth my boss. Me can go in.</string>
<string name="21031">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="21032">Who lives here?</string>
<string name="21033">Who live here?</string>
<string name="21034">You&apos;ll stand aside and let me enter, or it&apos;s your head.</string>
<string name="21035">You move and me go in, or me get angry.</string>
<string name="21036">Fine. Can I ask you some questions, then?</string>
<string name="21037">Okay. Me ask you questions?</string>
<string name="21038">How about 200 gp? Would that change your mind?</string>
<string name="21039">We&apos;re both &lt;race&gt;, how about 100 gp? Would that change your mind?</string>
<string name="21040">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Strength]&lt;/Start&gt; You don&apos;t want trouble with me, fool. Think very carefully.</string>
<string name="21041">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I SAID that I serve Lady Aribeth! You risk her wrath if you don&apos;t stand aside! Meldanen be damned, think of yourself!</string>
<string name="21042">Then I&apos;ll have to do this the hard way. Time to die, fool.</string>
<string name="21043">Me give 200 gp. That change mind?</string>
<string name="21044">We both &lt;race&gt; kind. Me give 100 gp. That change mind?</string>
<string name="21045">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Strength]&lt;/Start&gt; You no want trouble with me. You think, now.</string>
<string name="21046">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me SAY me serve Aribeth! She lay beatings on you if you not move! Damn Meldanen, cover yer own big butt!</string>
<string name="21047">Then me do this hard way. Now you die!!</string>
<string name="21048">Let me ask you something else, then.</string>
<string name="21049">Me ask something else, then.</string>
<string name="21050">Is there some way I could arrange to meet with Meldanen?</string>
<string name="21051">Maybe me could meets with Meldanen?</string>
<string name="21052">Perhaps I could arrange a meeting with the owner?</string>
<string name="21053">Maybe me could meets with owner?</string>
<string name="21054">Have you heard anything about strange creatures hereabouts?</string>
<string name="21055">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Have you been feeling any symptoms of the plague, yet? If not, you will soon.</string>
<string name="21056">What exactly goes on here?</string>
<string name="21057">What will it take for me to get inside?</string>
<string name="21058">What go on here?</string>
<string name="21059">You hear about weird creatures &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="21060">What it take for me to get in?</string>
<string name="21061">Maybe he acquired some new creature very recently?</string>
<string name="21062">Maybe he get new monster lately?</string>
<string name="21063">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; No, no, I want to hear this. Is this creature dangerous?</string>
<string name="21064">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; No, no, me want to hear this. Is monster dangerous?</string>
<string name="21065">Tell me now. I won&apos;t ask you twice.</string>
<string name="21066">Tell now. Me won&apos;t ask twice.</string>
<string name="21067">That&apos;s it. You&apos;ve been asking for this... time to die!</string>
<string name="21068">Now you done it. Time to die!!</string>
<string name="21069">Is this... guest... of Meldanen&apos;s still here?</string>
<string name="21070">She still here?</string>
<string name="21071">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade/Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; Not yet. You&apos;re in danger, however. That&apos;s why I came.</string>
<string name="21072">Of course not. Forgive me... let me ask you something else.</string>
<string name="21073">Are you sure? Let me open you up and find out... </string>
<string name="21074">Sorry, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Nobody is allowed into the residence. Very strict orders, you understand.</string>
<string name="21075">Yes, move along, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="21076">On your way.</string>
<string name="21077">Get moving before I help you along!</string>
<string name="21078">Sorry, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, but I can&apos;t let you in. My employer likes his privacy.</string>
<string name="21079">Go on, get out of here, you! You certainly won&apos;t be allowed in here.</string>
<string name="21080">This is none other than the home of the noble Meldanen, one of the greatest sorcerers in the city!</string>
<string name="21081">The man enjoys his privacy, as well, so you&apos;ll do well to just keep on walking. You don&apos;t bother him, he won&apos;t bother you, heh.</string>
<string name="21082">I don&apos;t care if you&apos;re Lord Bloody Nasher, himself, and neither would Lord Meldanen. You&apos;re not getting in.</string>
<string name="21083">Oh yeah? How about you just slink back to the castle and I&apos;ll forget you said that, little &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="21084">Oh? Who wants to know? The town simpleton, is it?</string>
<string name="21085">You think you can put a question together? Ha ha!</string>
<string name="21086">Oh, fine, fine. Go ahead and ask what you like.</string>
<string name="21087">Don&apos;t take all day. My time is valuable.</string>
<string name="21088">Hah! Like I&apos;m afraid of some &lt;race&gt; rabble. That&apos;ll be the day. Just move along, little &lt;boy/girl&gt;, ha ha!</string>
<string name="21089">What?! Attack the fool!!</string>
<string name="21090">Hmmm, yes, that would do nicely. Don&apos;t really care what happens to the rich fool, personally.</string>
<string name="21091">Go on in, then. I&apos;ll pretend I didn&apos;t see anything.</string>
<string name="21092">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. Well, I... ah, that is... I suppose one shouldn&apos;t (cough!) impede the city guard. No, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="21093">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hah! I&apos;m sorry, but... are you trying to *intimidate* me? Ha ha ha ha!! Oh, that&apos;s rich.</string>
<string name="21094">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Lady Aribeth has far more important things to worry about than my lecherous employer. At least I hope she does. Nobody gets in. Get lost.</string>
<string name="21095">No. He doesn&apos;t meet with anyone. And before you ask, he doesn&apos;t have visitors... period. Now go.</string>
<string name="21096">You think a smart guy like him would want to meet with a moron like you? You think you&apos;d have something to discuss? Hah!</string>
<string name="21097">(sigh) If that&apos;s all you&apos;re wondering about, you may as well forget it. Lord Meldanen sees no one except a select few friends.</string>
<string name="21098">And they don&apos;t even come through the front gate. So that makes my job very easy. I don&apos;t let anyone in... period.</string>
<string name="21099">Lord Meldanen lives here, of course. He&apos;s one of them sorcerer types, so some strangeness is expected. Lots of it, actually.</string>
<string name="21100">But that&apos;s okay. We don&apos;t go inside the mansion... well, except for that dunce, Grommin... so the strangeness can just stay in there for all we care.</string>
<string name="21101">Beyond that, it&apos;s nothing you need concern yourself about. Local folks are just superstitious, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="21102">Lord Meldanen has lots of strange creatures. It&apos;s sort of his hobby, or something. You&apos;d have to be more specific.</string>
<string name="21103">W-what do you mean? There&apos;s no plague in Blacklake!</string>
<string name="21104">Well, no, no creatures that I can think of. Though there is that... uh, but I shouldn&apos;t really mention that. Nevermind.</string>
<string name="21105">I don&apos;t care how many times you ask me. You can&apos;t bully me around, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
<string name="21106">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; No, not dangerous. I wouldn&apos;t even call her a creature, really. She&apos;s quite pretty... just, I don&apos;t know... odd.</string>
<string name="21107">No idea what Lord Meldanen might want with her... heh, besides the obvious. I guess even a sorcerer gets lonely, eh?</string>
<string name="21108">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Never you mind. I ain&apos;t discussing Lord Meldanen&apos;s business.</string>
<string name="21109">I don&apos;t know. I think so. We haven&apos;t seen her leave, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
<string name="21110">Uh... er, yes, of course... </string>
<string name="21111">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; It... it&apos;s that sorcerer&apos;s magics, ain&apos;t it? I just knew it! He&apos;s gone an&apos; given us the plague!!</string>
<string name="21112">I ain&apos;t going to stand around to die! I&apos;m getting out of here!! Run, ruuuunnnn!!</string>
<string name="21113">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t believe a word of it. What do you take me for, a fool? You&apos;re not getting in.</string>
<string name="21114">Go on in. Isn&apos;t that what you wanted?</string>
<string name="21115">Aiiieee!! Get away from me!!</string>
<string name="21116">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; L-look, I don&apos;t want any trouble from her Ladyship. This just isn&apos;t worth the risk. I have to work in this city. I&apos;ll allow you to enter.</string>
<string name="21117">I am a member of the city guard under Aribeth&apos;s command.</string>
<string name="21118">Me is member of city guard.</string>
<string name="21119">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="21120">Have you heard any rumors about where they might be?</string>
<string name="21121">Have you heard anything at all about the creatures?</string>
<string name="21122">Anything of interest I should know about in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="21123">Do you hear stuff about where monsters is? </string>
<string name="21124">You hears anything about creatures, maybe?</string>
<string name="21125">Something goin&apos; on in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="21126">So, none of the nobles have reported seeing anything strange?</string>
<string name="21127">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe you have heard of someone who might know more? Someone who&apos;s acting strangely.</string>
<string name="21128">So, nobody see strange stuff? </string>
<string name="21129">Who is Meldanen?</string>
<string name="21130">Anyone you know of in the Blacklake district who needs help?</string>
<string name="21131">Are there any places of interest in the Blacklake district that I should visit?</string>
<string name="21132">Meldanen? Who Meldanen?</string>
<string name="21133">Me city guard. Anyone need help from city guard?</string>
<string name="21134">You know good places to go here?</string>
<string name="21135">Have you heard any leads on who might have been responsible for the &apos;accident&apos;?</string>
<string name="21136">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Don&apos;t you find it sort of strange that the &apos;accident&apos; happened as soon as the creatures made it into the city?</string>
<string name="21137">You know maybe who set monsters free?</string>
<string name="21138">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="21139">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="21140">I&apos;ve been commanded to find the Waterdhavian creatures. Have you heard anything about them?</string>
<string name="21141">Me supposed to find Waterdeep monsters. You hear something?</string>
<string name="21142">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="21143">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="21144">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="21145">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="21146">Where is the nearest tavern?</string>
<string name="21147">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="21148">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="21149">Are there any places of interest in the Blacklake district that I should visit?</string>
<string name="21150">Me look for place to drink.</string>
<string name="21151">Me look for temple.</string>
<string name="21152">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="21153">Any place that has fun stuff?</string>
<string name="21154">Why is it closed off?</string>
<string name="21155">Why it closed?</string>
<string name="21156">You will let me pass or I&apos;ll get very angry, fool.</string>
<string name="21157">Me pass or me gets very mad with you.</string>
<string name="21158">Seeing as I am under Aribeth&apos;s personal command, you may want to re-think that tone.</string>
<string name="21159">Me under Aribeth&apos;s personal command, you. Speak nice.</string>
<string name="21160">Fine, I&apos;m going.</string>
<string name="21161">Okay, me go.</string>
<string name="21162">That&apos;s right.</string>
<string name="21163">Yeah? So?</string>
<string name="21164">Let me through the gate, then.</string>
<string name="21165">Lets me through gate.</string>
<string name="21166">Who&apos;s Samuel?</string>
<string name="21167">Who Samuel?</string>
<string name="21168">Greetings citizen. The Blacklake district has been cordoned off to everyone but the city guard and the nobility. </string>
<string name="21169">Fare you well. Perhaps we&apos;ll speak again.</string>
<string name="21170">Yes, yes. On your way, then.</string>
<string name="21171">Begone and good riddance.</string>
<string name="21172">Sorry about that. I think I have heard about you, after all. The city guard has so many new recruits that it&apos;s all but impossible to keep track.</string>
<string name="21173">Hmmph. The city guard has so many new recruits, I can&apos;t even keep up. I think I heard of you, though.</string>
<string name="21174">So you&apos;re one of those mercenaries under Aribeth? And they expect me to keep all these new recruits straight. Ahhhh, fine, fine, I guess you can pass.</string>
<string name="21175">Sorry. No tales of monsters running about the district. Not that I&apos;ve heard, anyway. </string>
<string name="21176">Only that there was some accident when they were brought in, and now they&apos;re fled or lost or something. We aren&apos;t supposed to panic people by talking about that, though. </string>
<string name="21177">Well, there&apos;s that whole situation with Meldanen. Glad he isn&apos;t my problem. He&apos;s a strange one.</string>
<string name="21178">Do you have a speech impediment? Oh, nevermind.</string>
<string name="21179">He&apos;s one of the noblemen, supposedly a wizard. Scary reputation. I, uh... probably shouldn&apos;t say much more than that, though.</string>
<string name="21180">Hmph. It&apos;s just a district of rich nobles who aren&apos;t even suffering from the plague like the rest of the city. I wouldn&apos;t worry too much about them, myself.</string>
<string name="21181">You could always visit the zoo. It&apos;s run by some of the nobility and there is quite a selection of exotic animals. </string>
<string name="21182">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; All right, I guess there&apos;s no harm. It&apos;s not like I&apos;m going to be struck by a lightning bolt or anything, heh.</string>
<string name="21183">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but I&apos;m not risking that sorcerer finding out I&apos;ve been chatting about him. Better a quiet mouse than a loud toad, you know.</string>
<string name="21184">Well, it&apos;s not as if they come out to the gate to gossip with me and have tea, you know. Most of them are huddled in their big mansions terrified that the plague&apos;s going to enter Blacklake regardless of what we do.</string>
<string name="21185">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="21186">Acting strangely? Well... I suppose Meldanen would certainly qualify, although acting strange is nothing new for him. He&apos;s a wizard, they say... sort of an odd bird amongst the nobility.</string>
<string name="21187">People have been saying that Meldanen&apos;s hoarding food. Some think that he should share some of it with the common folk. I don&apos;t know. I wouldn&apos;t go messing with Meldanen, myself. </string>
<string name="21188">I&apos;m not really privy to that kind of information. I haven&apos;t a clue.</string>
<string name="21189">Something else?</string>
<string name="21190">Yeah, sure, but what does that mean to me? That all happened in the City Core, long ways from here.</string>
<string name="21191">I don&apos;t really want to talk about this anymore. It&apos;s not really my business. </string>
<string name="21192">Stop right where you are, citizen. Commoners are not allowed to enter the Blacklake district. </string>
<string name="21193">Move along, you! The Blacklake district is off limits to all commoners. Especially filth like you.</string>
<string name="21194">I suppose it wouldn&apos;t hurt to tell someone. Especially a pretty lass like yourself... Sune knows I don&apos;t, uh... well, nevermind.</string>
<string name="21195">I just heard that they&apos;re supposed to cure the plague or somesuch. I think it&apos;d be a desperate fool who&apos;d believe that. Monsters don&apos;t cure plagues.</string>
<string name="21196">Where do you need to go?</string>
<string name="21197">Make it quick.</string>
<string name="21198">What else do you want to know?</string>
<string name="21199">I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if you got lost often. Oh, nevermind.</string>
<string name="21200">Try the Board Laid Bare. It&apos;s just north of here and should have everything you need. </string>
<string name="21201">There are no temples in the Blacklake district. Nobility doesn&apos;t have time to be pious. </string>
<string name="21202">Not many shops in the area. Err... I guess you could try the Board Laid Bare. It&apos;s a tavern just north of here. </string>
<string name="21203">You could always visit the zoo. It&apos;s run by some of the nobility and there is quite a selection of exotic animals. </string>
<string name="21204">Is there something else?</string>
<string name="21205">Did you not hear what I said? Only guards and nobles are allowed into the Blacklake area. Period. Now begone.</string>
<string name="21206">To keep the plague from reaching Neverwinter&apos;s most prominent citizens. So far we&apos;ve been successful.</string>
<string name="21207">That will change, of course, if we start letting every peasant that approaches the gate through. So return whence you came.</string>
<string name="21208">(sigh) How do I explain this in the simplest fashion?</string>
<string name="21209">You must be pulling my leg. You&apos;re *&lt;race&gt;*... </string>
<string name="21210">Right. Sorry to hold you up, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="21211">Keep your tunic on, already.</string>
<string name="21212">Fine. Just don&apos;t make any trouble in the district.</string>
<string name="21213">But no... like I said, I&apos;ve heard no stories of any strange monsters in Blacklake.</string>
<string name="21214">Fact is, Meldanen&apos;s been hoarding food. Or so claims Formosa, one of the louder noblewomen in Blacklake.</string>
<string name="21215">She says the food should be used to feed the city, wants to force the sorcerer to give it up. She&apos;s been stirring up quite a bit of trouble over it.</string>
<string name="21216">If you want to know more about it, you should talk to Formosa. You&apos;ll hear her screeching soon enough, I&apos;d think, if you go near the district&apos;s main square. I wouldn&apos;t mind someone trying to rein her in, myself. </string>
<string name="21217">Anything else you needed to know?</string>
<string name="21218">Although I did hear tell that old Samuel went missing last week. No trace of him. Poor sod probably fell into the lake.</string>
<string name="21219">Oh, just one of the older guards. I hear Thurin&apos;s been looking for him, though. If you&apos;re really interested you could talk to him... he&apos;ll be patrolling about, no doubt.</string>
<string name="21220">I am acting as a guard. I need information.</string>
<string name="21221">Me like a guard. Me gots questions.</string>
<string name="21222">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="21223">Any places here that is interesting?</string>
<string name="21224">How widespread is the plague here?</string>
<string name="21225">I need infomation about the Docks district.</string>
<string name="21226">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="21227">How big is plague spread here?</string>
<string name="21228">Me wants information about Docks.</string>
<string name="21229">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="21230">What do you know about attempts at a cure?</string>
<string name="21231">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="21232">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="21233">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="21234">Any locations of interest in this district?</string>
<string name="21235">A place to get supplies.</string>
<string name="21236">Important places. Anything like that?</string>
<string name="21237">Who are the important people in this district?</string>
<string name="21238">Who run this place? You know about them?</string>
<string name="21239">A tavern or inn.</string>
<string name="21240">I just need to ask a few questions.</string>
<string name="21241">Me just wants ask few questions.</string>
<string name="21242">Don&apos;t tell me where to go. I do what I want.</string>
<string name="21243">You shut up. Me goes whatever me want!</string>
<string name="21244">I will leave.</string>
<string name="21245">Me leave.</string>
<string name="21246">Back to my other questions about locations.</string>
<string name="21247">Back to other stuff in the area.</string>
<string name="21248">Who are the Bloodsailors?</string>
<string name="21249">Bloodsailors? Who that?</string>
<string name="21250">So they are pirates?</string>
<string name="21251">So they just pirates?</string>
<string name="21252">Who is their leader now?</string>
<string name="21253">Who lead them now?</string>
<string name="21254">Where would he hide?</string>
<string name="21255">Where me find him?</string>
<string name="21256">His men can&apos;t like that kind of attention.</string>
<string name="21257">Pirates not like attention like that.</string>
<string name="21258">Vengaul is putting on a show?</string>
<string name="21259">Vengaul put on show? What you mean? Juggling?</string>
<string name="21260">You don&apos;t want to hang around here, friend. The plague was here, and damned if I know who it&apos;ll take next.</string>
<string name="21261">Who are you? Bandits? City Guard? Doesn&apos;t matter. Plague treats us the same. You don&apos;t want to stay here, friend.</string>
<string name="21262">What are you, another mugger? You stay here and the plague will take your kind just like mine. There&apos;s comfort in that, I guess.</string>
<string name="21263">You&apos;ve got questions? Well, so do I. What good are you, guard, when everyone around me is dying of plague? Answer me that.</string>
<string name="21264">How wide does it look? I&apos;ve already said how it affected me and my home. What more do you want? Should we go count corpses?</string>
<string name="21265">The Helmites claim their blessings are a cure. Bunch of crap. Everyone I know is dying, or will be.</string>
<string name="21266">Farewell. Please leave my home as you found it.</string>
<string name="21267">What is it you want to know? Couldn&apos;t you just stumble around on your own?</string>
<string name="21268">Well, if plague is your interest, it&apos;s pretty much everywhere. Really, I&apos;m not sure what you are looking for. A tavern? A shop?</string>
<string name="21269">Maybe... look, I don&apos;t want to talk out of turn. I really shouldn&apos;t... and what does it matter... we&apos;re all going to die, anyway.</string>
<string name="21270">I guess there&apos;s Jim Seedy&apos;s place, the Seedy Tavern. It&apos;s in the north end of the district. Good luck getting past the bouncer.</string>
<string name="21271">I suppose you would be looking for the Twenty in a Quiver in the center of the district. It&apos;s always well stocked.</string>
<string name="21272">That&apos;s for the best. I&apos;ve got mourning to do, and I don&apos;t need more people dropping dead while I do it.</string>
<string name="21273">I&apos;ve got no time for questions. What point is there in my answers, I&apos;ll be dead in a week. Just like everyone else.</string>
<string name="21274">Frankly, I don&apos;t care. Push your way through plague-infested homes if you want. I hope you rot like you deserve.</string>
<string name="21275">Just get out! Like I should be scared of burglars when we&apos;re all going to die of plague anyway!</string>
<string name="21276">Not sure why you are here. I said my piece. Now I&apos;m just waiting for the plague to take what little I have left in this world.</string>
<string name="21277">Not anymore. The plague has shut everything down. No ships are allowed in or out, and port offices are closed. Too many have died... </string>
<string name="21278">What else did you want to ask about? It&apos;s not the largest of districts.</string>
<string name="21279">Important people? How would I know? I&apos;m just some guy waiting to die. I&apos;m a long way from whoever the Bloodsailors are calling boss this week.</string>
<string name="21280">Who are the... ? Wow, you must be new. The Bloodsailors run the docks. Any ship that travels without their okay doesn&apos;t get far.</string>
<string name="21281">What answers do you expect from me? Are you so stupid that you think any of this matters? We&apos;ll all be dead soon enough.</string>
<string name="21282">I lost my mother... she rotted away from the inside as I watched. The plague left her mindless at the end... </string>
<string name="21283">I&apos;ve lost a brother and countless friends. They became hollow shells of themselves. Mindless... They were healthy and they were young... </string>
<string name="21284">My father just died. At the end, his eyes were dead... nothing... The plague kills who you are, not just your body.</string>
<string name="21285">My sisters... all of them... dead. What chance did they have? The first infected the others as they tried to comfort her.</string>
<string name="21286">I see all my friends either dying or in mourning for someone who died. The plague kills outright, but it&apos;s almost worse for the survivors.</string>
<string name="21287">My children... all dead. Why should I live when everything that mattered to me is gone? They just withered away... </string>
<string name="21288">So you see, I don&apos;t think I have much use for a guard. If you have questions, go ahead. I suppose you have reports to file, or something.</string>
<string name="21289">I don&apos;t know why they stay open with the threat of plague around but... well... I don&apos;t put much stock in rumors.</string>
<string name="21290">Most legitimate business is done in the City Core, anyway. This area is left for whatever petty criminal wants to set up shop. </string>
<string name="21291">I guess. They don&apos;t seem to make much of a secret about it. Their leader is pretty open about that stuff. If he&apos;s still leader.</string>
<string name="21292">Their namesake, Vengaul Bloodsail. He&apos;s the reason they are allowed to operate. I think he used to know Lord Nasher, of all people!</string>
<string name="21293">He keeps them from being just a band of cutthroats. I think he prefers to think himself a dashing rogue. Seems a little old for it.</string>
<string name="21294">I wouldn&apos;t know. Maybe... no, I don&apos;t put much stock in rumors... </string>
<string name="21295">I suppose I might as well say, though I don&apos;t know much. I hear there&apos;s some kind of infighting going on with the Bloodsailors.</string>
<string name="21296">I don&apos;t much like you. You want answers, go find them yourself. I hear there&apos;s something happening at the Seedy Tavern. I don&apos;t want to know what.</string>
<string name="21297">Now, if we are through, maybe you could get out of my house.</string>
<string name="21298">There have been notices of some sort of auction at the Seedy Tavern. Vengaul Bloodsail himself is putting on some sort of show, or something.</string>
<string name="21299">I know. There&apos;s talk of... well, you can guess what angering pirates will get you. I overheard a man named Callik in the Golden Apple tavern... well... </string>
<string name="21300">I think that&apos;s all I&apos;m going to say about that. I may be going to die of plague, but I want to do it with my legs intact.</string>
<string name="21301">Uh, noooooo, I don&apos;t mean juggling, you idiot. I think it&apos;s an auction. It&apos;s caused a lot of fuss. A lot of people want gold for it.</string>
<string name="21302">He likes to do things flashy. I think it&apos;s an auction or something. I guess it&apos;s caused a lot of fuss. Lots of people want gold for it.</string>
<string name="21303">Someone said it had something to do with the plague, but everything seems like it has something to do with the plague. People are scared.</string>
<string name="21304">I am acting as a guard. I need information.</string>
<string name="21305">Me like a guard. Me got&apos;s questions.</string>
<string name="21306">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="21307">Any places here that is interesting?</string>
<string name="21308">How widespread is the plague here?</string>
<string name="21309">I need infomation about the Docks district.</string>
<string name="21310">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="21311">How big is plague spread here?</string>
<string name="21312">Me wants information about Docks.</string>
<string name="21313">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="21314">What do you know about attempts at a cure?</string>
<string name="21315">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="21316">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="21317">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="21318">Any locations of interest in this district?</string>
<string name="21319">A place to get supplies.</string>
<string name="21320">Important places. Anything like that?</string>
<string name="21321">Who are the important people in this district?</string>
<string name="21322">Who run this place? You know about them?</string>
<string name="21323">A tavern or inn.</string>
<string name="21324">I just need to ask a few questions.</string>
<string name="21325">Me just wants ask few questions.</string>
<string name="21326">Don&apos;t tell me where to go. I do what I want.</string>
<string name="21327">You shut up. Me goes whatever me want!</string>
<string name="21328">I will leave.</string>
<string name="21329">Me leave.</string>
<string name="21330">Back to my other questions about locations.</string>
<string name="21331">Back to other stuff in the area.</string>
<string name="21332">Who are the Bloodsailors?</string>
<string name="21333">Bloodsailors? Who that?</string>
<string name="21334">So they are pirates?</string>
<string name="21335">So they just pirates?</string>
<string name="21336">Who is their leader now?</string>
<string name="21337">Who lead them now?</string>
<string name="21338">Where would this Vengaul hide?</string>
<string name="21339">Where me find him this Vengaul?</string>
<string name="21340">His men can&apos;t like that kind of attention.</string>
<string name="21341">Pirates not like attention like that.</string>
<string name="21342">Vengaul is putting on a show?</string>
<string name="21343">Vengaul put on show? What you mean? He spin plates?</string>
<string name="21344">Greetings to you. May I ask what you expect to find here? I don&apos;t want to be rude, but I would like to be alone with my sorrow.</string>
<string name="21345">Why are you here? Unless you want to join in my mourning, I doubt you will find anything of use in my home.</string>
<string name="21346">What gives you the right to enter my home? You won&apos;t find anything here except people waiting to die.</string>
<string name="21347">You are a guard? Is that supposed to impress me? What can you do? You can&apos;t lock up the plague. You can&apos;t tell me why it&apos;s happening.</string>
<string name="21348">There are dead everywhere. So many that you start to forget names. There&apos;s so much... So many people gone... </string>
<string name="21349">I know there isn&apos;t one. The guards... Nasher... they just watch us die. Only the Helmites bother to try anything... worthless though it seems... </string>
<string name="21350">Farewell. Please leave my home as you found it.</string>
<string name="21351">Information about the Docks, hmm? What do you want to know? Where the best places to lay down and die are?</string>
<string name="21352">I can name the exact spots where a dozen or so people fell as I watched. Other than that, what are you looking for?</string>
<string name="21353">What does it matter? I mean, you ask these things like they mean something, and I just can&apos;t... </string>
<string name="21354">If you are the type they let in, Jim Seedy&apos;s tavern is in the north central area. It&apos;s always busy with people I don&apos;t want to know.</string>
<string name="21355">Twenty in a Quiver. I think they are still open. I don&apos;t have much use for what they sell, though. Not anymore.</string>
<string name="21356">Good. The less people I have around, the less I have to cry for when they die.</string>
<string name="21357">Why should I care about your questions? People are dying all around and I should entertain the burglars in my home?</string>
<string name="21358">I can&apos;t stop you... but why you bother to threaten when we&apos;re all going to die anyway, I just don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="21359">Please, just leave me. We&apos;re all going to die anyway. You don&apos;t need to hurt me.</string>
<string name="21360">Why are you back? What could I possibly tell you? I&apos;m just another person waiting to die of the plague.</string>
<string name="21361">The plague has closed most things. So many dead... No ships can leave, port offices are closed... </string>
<string name="21362">What else do you want? I really don&apos;t have much interest in your problems right now.</string>
<string name="21363">The important people are the ones still alive. Beyond that, I don&apos;t give a damn who the Bloodsailors are calling boss this week.</string>
<string name="21364">Some guard you are, not knowing who the biggest bunch of criminals in the district are. The Bloodsailors run the docks. All ships go through them.</string>
<string name="21365">I don&apos;t have much patience for dullards right now. I&apos;ll be dead soon enough and I don&apos;t want to spend my time coddling you.</string>
<string name="21366">My mother... dead. The plague killed her from the inside out. Her eyes went dark long before she stopped breathing... </string>
<string name="21367">My brothers... gone. Dead to this damned plague. Their bodies burned to stop the spread. They may as well have never existed....</string>
<string name="21368">My father... gone. He fought it, but that just made it all the more sad when he didn&apos;t know who I was anymore. He just rotted away... </string>
<string name="21369">My sister and her child... gone. Nothing I could do except comfort them and hope I didn&apos;t get it too. Now I wish I had.</string>
<string name="21370">Friends... their families... dying all around me. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll live to see my own folks again... I don&apos;t know... </string>
<string name="21371">My child... my beautiful child... taken while I watched. I couldn&apos;t do anything except cry. It took her... she&apos;s gone... </string>
<string name="21372">So, I really don&apos;t think I need a guard. If you have questions, get them over with. Then go arrest some copperthief or something.</string>
<string name="21373">Most places have shut down, but the Seedy Tavern... well, I&apos;m not one to talk about rumors.</string>
<string name="21374">Even the guards have pretty much given up on this area to thieves. You are the first I&apos;ve seen, and I&apos;m not suitably impressed.</string>
<string name="21375">They aren&apos;t as cutthroat as they could be, I guess. I don&apos;t think it fits the style of their leader. If a criminal can have style.</string>
<string name="21376">The Bloodsailors were formed by Vengaul Bloodsail. I heard he used to know Lord Nasher. I don&apos;t believe a word of it.</string>
<string name="21377">He does keep a tight leash on his thugs. I&apos;ve never seen a Bloodsailor in a mugging. Not in uniform, anyway.</string>
<string name="21378">I couldn&apos;t tell you. I only know what gets passed as rumor and, frankly, I don&apos;t care that much anymore.</string>
<string name="21379">I&apos;m sorry. Maybe there&apos;s a point to some of what I heard... I don&apos;t know. Something about fighting amongst the Bloodsailors.</string>
<string name="21380">I think that&apos;s all I can take. Maybe there&apos;s something happening at the Seedy Tavern, but I don&apos;t like you enough to care.</string>
<string name="21381">If that&apos;s all, please just leave me to mourn.</string>
<string name="21382">Vengaul Bloodsail is advertising some sort of show, and he isn&apos;t being subtle. Even I heard about it.</string>
<string name="21383">There was a man... Callik was his name. He was in the Golden Apple, and he was mad about it. He was saying he would... well... </string>
<string name="21384">He was talking about violence, like there isn&apos;t enough death around. I&apos;m not saying anything more about him. I&apos;ll die soon enough anyway.</string>
<string name="21385">No, not spinning plates, you ass. I think it&apos;s an auction, and he&apos;s been so flashy, you&apos;d almost think he wants the guards to know about it.</string>
<string name="21386">At the Seedy Tavern. An auction, maybe? He does things flashy. It&apos;s almost like he wants the guards to hear about it.</string>
<string name="21387">There&apos;s lots of people scrambling for gold, so whatever is there, it&apos;s big. Might have something to do with the plague, but I couldn&apos;t say.</string>
<string name="21388">I like your uniform. Can&apos;t leave until I get one.</string>
<string name="21389">Let&apos;s have at it, Bloodsailor! Let&apos;s see how well you fight!</string>
<string name="21390">All right, all right, I&apos;m going.</string>
<string name="21391">What do you Bloodsailors do? Anything illegal?</string>
<string name="21392">Nice uniforms. Where can I get one?</string>
<string name="21393">We should trade. Give me a uniform and I don&apos;t call the guards.</string>
<string name="21394">So how do I join?</string>
<string name="21395">I&apos;m willing to help you on that. Come on!</string>
<string name="21396">I go where I please. Will you try and stop me?</string>
<string name="21397">Sorry to have bothered you. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="21398">Yeah, yeah, now get ready to fight!</string>
<string name="21399">Sorry for bothering. Bye.</string>
<string name="21400">Me go where me want. You stop me?</string>
<string name="21401">Uniform nice. Where me get one?</string>
<string name="21402">What Bloodsailors do? Illegal stuff?</string>
<string name="21403">Me help you die! Come on!</string>
<string name="21404">So how me join?</string>
<string name="21405">We trade. Get me uniform and me not call guards.</string>
<string name="21406">Me go, me go.</string>
<string name="21407">Let&apos;s go, Bloodsailor! You and me fight!</string>
<string name="21408">Me like uniform. Not leave until me get one.</string>
<string name="21409">Whatever. Now we fight!</string>
<string name="21410">I&apos;ve had enough of tourists. Get lost, or every pirate in a Bloodsailor uniform will kick your tail back to the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="21411">I&apos;ll warn you once. We are not wandering thugs or underfed bandits. You want a Bloodsailor in battle, you&apos;d better be ready.</string>
<string name="21412">What are you doing bothering me, then? Turn yourself around and walk the other way.</string>
<string name="21413">Nothing that would concern you. How about you just move along. You wouldn&apos;t want to accidentally end up dead.</string>
<string name="21414">You can&apos;t. Simple as that. A Bloodsailor gets his uniform when he joins, and only gives it up when he dies.</string>
<string name="21415">HAHA! The guards know better than to wander the docks! No, nobody&apos;s gonna help you if you keep pushing me.</string>
<string name="21416">This isn&apos;t a social club, and we don&apos;t take just any old fool. Now get lost, before you make me angry.</string>
<string name="21417">This is Bloodsailor territory, at least for a day or two more. Come near the ship and you&apos;ll be killed. Simple enough?</string>
<string name="21418">Then die like a dog!</string>
<string name="21419">Who are you?</string>
<string name="21420">Who am you?</string>
<string name="21421">What happened here?</string>
<string name="21422">What happen here?</string>
<string name="21423">Farewell.</string>
<string name="21424">Me go now.</string>
<string name="21425">You burned down your own home?</string>
<string name="21426">You burn own home? You stupid?</string>
<string name="21427">Is there anything I can do for you?</string>
<string name="21428">Me do anything for yous?</string>
<string name="21429">That&apos;s tough luck, all right.</string>
<string name="21430">Oh well. That too bad, me guess.</string>
<string name="21431">Gone... all gone... There&apos;s nothing left.</string>
<string name="21432">There&apos;s nothing left here... all gone... </string>
<string name="21433">Does my name matter? I was Jace, but I&apos;m nothing now. It&apos;s all gone. My home, my family. They burned it.</string>
<string name="21434">They were sick, you see. They got the Wailing. I took every precaution, but they still got it. I couldn&apos;t do anything to help.</string>
<string name="21435">My children. My wife. All dead. My home? Diseased. What could I do? I burned it. I burned it all.</string>
<string name="21436">Yes, that&apos;s what I get. Indifference. Who cares about my life... my family, when the whole city is plagued. The Wailing... it&apos;s everywhere.</string>
<string name="21437">This is nothing... we&apos;re all nothing. What is my suffering compared to that? It means nothing.</string>
<string name="21438">Should I sleep in the bed they died in? Live in the walls that saw them wither? I don&apos;t know much about plagues, but I know they spread.</string>
<string name="21439">We stayed sheltered, gave all the proper offerings, and my family still died. It got in somehow. How could I live there?</string>
<string name="21440">No... I don&apos;t know. Cure the Wailing Death? How about that? Heh... wouldn&apos;t that be something... if it were cured now... too late.</string>
<string name="21441">Even if I didn&apos;t get it... I saw my family in every shadow. How could I live there now?</string>
<string name="21442">No, you can&apos;t do anything for me. I&apos;ve nothing left.</string>
<string name="21443">I&apos;ll consider that. Thanks.</string>
<string name="21444">Aribeth would not want the area abandoned.</string>
<string name="21445">Any word on the cause of the unrest?</string>
<string name="21446">Aribeth probably not want area left alone.</string>
<string name="21447">What cause unrest?</string>
<string name="21448">Me consider that. Bye.</string>
<string name="21449">Have you heard anything about some strange creatures?</string>
<string name="21450">You hear about strange creature things?</string>
<string name="21451">From what I&apos;ve heard, the Docks district is almost settled down, even with the plague still a concern for most.</string>
<string name="21452">Still no change in the condition of the Docks district.</string>
<string name="21453">You are &lt;FullName&gt;, aren&apos;t you? I&apos;ve heard of the work you&apos;ve already done for Neverwinter. Impressive, but I wouldn&apos;t go charging ahead.</string>
<string name="21454">I&apos;m advising that everyone stay clear of the Docks district. Not that other areas of the city are any friendlier.</string>
<string name="21455">You&apos;re one of the new recruits I was expecting, right? Well, travel in the Docks district is not recommended.</string>
<string name="21456">Word is that the area is barely under rule of law. I&apos;d stay in the City Core, if I were you.</string>
<string name="21457">Plague, obviously. It&apos;s just like riots in other areas. I don&apos;t see a need to endanger my men by looking deeper than that.</string>
<string name="21458">My job is to keep the flow of people down. If you or she want to go walk with the plagued, that&apos;s your business.</string>
<string name="21459">It&apos;s your risk to take. More power to you if you can help in there, I guess.</string>
<string name="21460">Good to see someone making a difference. Gods know, we need all the help we can get.</string>
<string name="21461">I assume you mean the Waterdhavian beasts that were lost? I have heard nothing, and I have been told nothing. What more can I say?</string>
<string name="21462">There was some rumor about someone like you finding something, but if the Neverwinter Nine don&apos;t see fit to brief me, it ain&apos;t my business.</string>
<string name="21463">I don&apos;t have the men to search for them, and I wouldn&apos;t know what to do if I found them. Dump them on Aribeth, I suppose.</string>
<string name="21464">Why is this area so dangerous?</string>
<string name="21465">Any way I can help out?</string>
<string name="21466">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="21467">Why this area bad?</string>
<string name="21468">Me help somehow?</string>
<string name="21469">Bye.</string>
<string name="21470">Have you seen any strange creatures?</string>
<string name="21471">You see strange animal things at all?</string>
<string name="21472">What in the hells are you doing here? Not that I don&apos;t mind the help, but I thought we were locked down tight.</string>
<string name="21473">Patrol where you want and see where you get. Nothing but animals trapped in here. Stinking thieving peasant animals.</string>
<string name="21474">Damned if I know what settled them down, but I ain&apos;t seen any trouble for a while now.</string>
<string name="21475">This is the docks. Don&apos;t go blabbing it, but everyone knows that the docks are controlled by pretty shifty characters.</string>
<string name="21476">With the chaos of the plague, everyone seems to be acting like animals. The streets are thick with thieves. Thick!</string>
<string name="21477">Just don&apos;t attract attention to us here. I don&apos;t want a mob killing me before the plague can, after all.</string>
<string name="21478">You want to play hero, fine with me, but as far as I&apos;m concerned, the animals in this district can have each other.</string>
<string name="21479">Careful in the Docks. There&apos;s lots of lowlife thugs. Should just barricade the lot of them.</string>
<string name="21480">Whatever was getting the locals all worked up seems to be over, I guess. No trouble here at all besides the plague.</string>
<string name="21481">Citizen, identify yourself!</string>
<string name="21482">Wait. You a new recruit? Aribeth saddle you with this job? Well, good luck if you&apos;re supposed to patrol in here. You&apos;ll need it.</string>
<string name="21483">What, you think a grunt like me might have found Aribeth&apos;s precious Waterdhavian things? That&apos;s what you are asking, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="21484">Bah! I got a briefing about those, all right, and then I was stuck here! Why tell me about them if I&apos;m not gonna be looking?!</string>
<string name="21485">The only thing I&apos;ll see while I&apos;m standing here is more blasted thieves. Let &apos;em all rot, I says.</string>
<string name="21486">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="21487">I will have a blessing.</string>
<string name="21488">What good do your blessings do?</string>
<string name="21489">Has there been any sign of a break in the plague?</string>
<string name="21490">What can you tell me about the Seedy Tavern?</string>
<string name="21491">You know about Seedy Tavern at all?</string>
<string name="21492">There any break in plague?</string>
<string name="21493">What your blessings do?</string>
<string name="21494">Me have blessing, I guess.</string>
<string name="21495">Bye.</string>
<string name="21496">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; But the body still dies. How does that give hope?</string>
<string name="21497">Greetings. Are you in need of a blessing? I would not travel the docks without it, lest you tempt the fates.</string>
<string name="21498">Another time, then. I will be here, as will all of the devout under Desther and Helm.</string>
<string name="21499">Very good. Let your mind be at ease and know that tomorrow will bring a cure.</string>
<string name="21500">If this plague is a spiritual one, which Desther strongly suspects, then the healing must begin with the soul.</string>
<string name="21501">The worth of the blessings is immeasurable. Even as the Wailing takes the body, the mind knows there is hope.</string>
<string name="21502">The Wailing continues to take lives, but Desther has decreed that we brothers shall not rest while the city is in crisis.</string>
<string name="21503">If the spirit is willing, Neverwinter will survive. People must believe and have hope, and so our blessings will continue.</string>
<string name="21504">It is a den of corruption. I would not trust the word of any who frequent there. Lies and false hopes are their playground.</string>
<string name="21505">Graciously, they keep to themselves, only allowing entry to uniformed members and those willing to part with their ill-gotten coins.</string>
<string name="21506">Another time, my slow-witted friend. I will be here, as will the devout under Desther and Helm.</string>
<string name="21507">Very good. It may be redundant to say, but let your mind be clear of thought. Hope will bring a cure.</string>
<string name="21508">Well... it&apos;s complex. Even in death people must realize that... that there is purpose to all things.</string>
<string name="21509">You seem strong in your faith. You understand how important belief is, and how reaffirming it will be when our blessings beat the plague.</string>
<string name="21510">I can&apos;t expect you to understand, but just imagine how reaffirming it will be when our blessings beat the plague.</string>
<string name="21511">What seems to be the trouble?</string>
<string name="21512">What wrong?</string>
<string name="21513">I&apos;ve no time for this. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="21514">Me not have time. Bye.</string>
<string name="21515">Who was this man?</string>
<string name="21516">Who the man?</string>
<string name="21517">You paid with an amulet?</string>
<string name="21518">You pay with neck thing?</string>
<string name="21519">I suppose I could look into it for you.</string>
<string name="21520">Maybe me look into it.</string>
<string name="21521">How valuable is &quot;valuable?&quot;</string>
<string name="21522">How valuable you mean?</string>
<string name="21523">Masterson? I believe I have an amulet of yours.</string>
<string name="21524">You Masterson? Me have your amulet.</string>
<string name="21525">What do you know about the docks?</string>
<string name="21526">What you know about docks?</string>
<string name="21527">I have your amulet here.</string>
<string name="21528">Me find your amulet.</string>
<string name="21529">I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="21530">Maybe me find it. Me look.</string>
<string name="21531">I need you to repeat some things.</string>
<string name="21532">You maybe repeat some things?</string>
<string name="21533">Here you go. I am pleased to return it.</string>
<string name="21534">Take it. Me glad to give it back.</string>
<string name="21535">I&apos;d like a reward for returning it.</string>
<string name="21536">Me want reward for giving it back.</string>
<string name="21537">Now, let&apos;s talk about adequate payment, fool.</string>
<string name="21538">Now we talk payment. Big payment.</string>
<string name="21539">Actually, I think I&apos;ll keep it.</string>
<string name="21540">Maybe me just keep it.</string>
<string name="21541">That will be fine. Thank you.</string>
<string name="21542">That good enough. </string>
<string name="21543">I want more. Don&apos;t make me angry.</string>
<string name="21544">You give more or me get violent!</string>
<string name="21545">Me worth more, don&apos;t you think?</string>
<string name="21546">You must agree I am worth more?</string>
<string name="21547">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, you know I&apos;ll use it well.</string>
<string name="21548">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You know me use it good. Come on.</string>
<string name="21549">Give it to me or die! I won&apos;t ask again!</string>
<string name="21550">Give me the amulet or me hurt you! Now!</string>
<string name="21551">I meant no harm. I&apos;ll leave.</string>
<string name="21552">Me not want to scare. Me leave.</string>
<string name="21553">I won&apos;t help for free.</string>
<string name="21554">Me not help for free.</string>
<string name="21555">We&apos;ll be all right. Bad things don&apos;t happen to our class of people.</string>
<string name="21556">Ah, yes, hello there. I am, eh, Hemmel Masterson. This is my wife Agnes, and our manservent Morden.</string>
<string name="21557">I wonder, by chance, if you&apos;ve seen a man named Callik? He has an amulet of mine and he, ah, seems to have forgotten us.</string>
<string name="21558">Forgotten? I TOLD you he was not to be trusted.</string>
<string name="21559">I&apos;m quite aware of what you said, my dear. Now, if you will just let me speak to this nice &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="21560">Well, it&apos;s embarrassing. You see, we were led to believe that passage out of Neverwinter could be had here. We were fleeing the quarantine.</string>
<string name="21561">I arranged for transport that would leave from the docks. I traded an heirloom amulet to a man who swore he was honest.</string>
<string name="21562">Hemmel, I can swear that you are competent, but that doesn&apos;t make it true.</string>
<string name="21563">A strapping gent. Callik was his name. He said he was soon to come into his own ship.</string>
<string name="21564">Probably stealing that as well. Honestly, Hemmel, you can be such a fool.</string>
<string name="21565">My dear, he seemed honest enough. He may yet return. It has only been... a day... </string>
<string name="21566">That amulet was a valuable heirloom. It was a high price, but for the safety of my loved ones, I decided not to quibble.</string>
<string name="21567">I told you it was a ruse. This Callik made vague promises and you handed over everything.</string>
<string name="21568">Nothing is proven, dear. Still, I would like assurances. It was a valuable amulet, after all. Passed down by my forefathers.</string>
<string name="21569">I don&apos;t expect someone like you to understand. That amulet was a valuable heirloom. It was a sacrifice, but I was concerned for my family.</string>
<string name="21570">Eh, yes, very well. Goodbye. We&apos;ll just... wait here for mister Callik then. Yes. That&apos;s what we&apos;ll do.</string>
<string name="21571">Oh, well done Hemmel. That shall be your stirring farewell to the Masterson family amulet.</string>
<string name="21572">My dear, do shut up.</string>
<string name="21573">Hello again, &lt;CUSTOM400&gt;. I hope you have good news for me? I&apos;ve seen no sign of Callik or my amulet.</string>
<string name="21574">Well, I should perhaps say that its value is primarily sentimental. It has been on our mantel for generations.</string>
<string name="21575">Only because you are too much the coward to take it up, Hemmel.</string>
<string name="21576">Well, I suppose the thing has some other uses, but it&apos;s been years since a Masterson has stooped to dungeon delving.</string>
<string name="21577">I would be most appreciative if you could. Mr Callik does appear to be... taking an inordinate amount of time. </string>
<string name="21578">Not to strain your limited faculties, but I would appreciate your assistance. Mr Callik does seem to be... taking his time.</string>
<string name="21579">He said he would ready a ship, but when he left he went inland. He did drop some sort of auction notice.</string>
<string name="21580">You&apos;ve probably got one already, knowing the area as you must. It doesn&apos;t do me much good... I&apos;m a stranger here.</string>
<string name="21581">Here, you can have it. I&apos;m not familiar with the area so it does me no good anyway.</string>
<string name="21582">Please, return my amulet if you find it. It will have the Masterson crest. I&apos;ve given up on breaking quarantine; I just want back what&apos;s mine.</string>
<string name="21583">Are you with &lt;CUSTOM400&gt;? I hope so. I&apos;ve seen no sign of Callik or my amulet and I need help.</string>
<string name="21584">I guess I don&apos;t have much choice... I can&apos;t fight. I suppose it was foolish to risk our lives for it.</string>
<string name="21585">Very little, I&apos;m afraid. I came here... well... I came here hoping to circumvent the quarantine on Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="21586">If you need, though I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s anything else I can add.</string>
<string name="21587">Wonderful! Snatched from fate and returned to family Masterson! You see, Agnes? We Mastersons get things done!</string>
<string name="21588">And I am happy to take it. Here, some gold for your trouble. You may even live to spend it.</string>
<string name="21589">Now, I just have to get out of here. We can&apos;t break quarantine, but if we barricade the manor... </string>
<string name="21590">A... reward. Well, I suppose that would be fair. It&apos;s better than not getting it back at all, I guess.</string>
<string name="21591">I will give you 500 gold. I think that is more than sufficient. That Mr. Callik didn&apos;t look too tough.</string>
<string name="21592">I... I can&apos;t do anything about that... I&apos;m no fighter, as Agnes will attest. I can only ask that you reconsider.</string>
<string name="21593">I will be here... I&apos;ve nowhere else to go, really. I cannot even know if you really have it.</string>
<string name="21594">Yes, that&apos;s it. You&apos;re joking with your ribald middleclass wit. Very good. Now please... return my amulet when you find it.</string>
<string name="21595">You look reasonable, and we &lt;race&gt; folk have to help each another. Here. 500 gold and something from the Masterson armory.</string>
<string name="21596">I suppose I could be convinced to pay a fair price. Here, take this 500 gold and something from the Masterson armory.</string>
<string name="21597">Here, I&apos;ll give you 200 gold. Please, just take it and go.</string>
<string name="21598">Allow me to express my thanks, and my relief. Now, if you don&apos;t mind, we&apos;re off to barricade the manor.</string>
<string name="21599">I am more that willing to agree that you are worth more but I really don&apos;t have much else with me.</string>
<string name="21600">That is debatable, but the point is irrelevant. I don&apos;t have much else with me to give you.</string>
<string name="21601">Please! There&apos;s no point! I don&apos;t have much. I don&apos;t carry a bank with me! I don&apos;t have much more!</string>
<string name="21602">Unless... well... The amulet. I have the amulet. Please, don&apos;t make me give it up.</string>
<string name="21603">Hemmel, just give the nice thug whatever &lt;he/she&gt; wants and we can go home.</string>
<string name="21604">You are NOT helping, dear!</string>
<string name="21605">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose... I guess you might as well take it. I guess it was foolish to risk our lives for it... </string>
<string name="21606">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; But... no. No, I can&apos;t. I may not be an adventurer, and I may not use it, but it&apos;s mine!</string>
<string name="21607">Let&apos;s just go, Hemmel. You have more toys at home.</string>
<string name="21608">Hemmel, don&apos;t antagonize the nice thug!</string>
<string name="21609">The glaring eyes of my wife wish to remind me that she did say the man was not to be trusted, but perhaps he is only delayed.</string>
<string name="21610">I beg of you, please find some measure of kindness within you.</string>
<string name="21611">My wife may disagree with my appraisal of him, but he swore he would return.</string>
<string name="21612">I mean, he seemed honest. It has only been... a day... </string>
<string name="21613">The suspicions of my wife have alarmed me. I would like assurances that he is returning. The amulet is valuable to me, after all.</string>
<string name="21614">That is, if I can suffer the glares of my wife. As if losing the Masterson family amulet wasn&apos;t enough... </string>
<string name="21615">I hope... I hope you understand.</string>
<string name="21616">Take it then. I will make do... </string>
<string name="21617">I suppose I could manage some form of payment. I&apos;ll have to see the amulet first, of course. I&apos;ve already been swindled once. Will you help?</string>
<string name="21618">Hemmel is such a boy. He&apos;d have us stand here for ages thinking his precious heirloom will return. Hmph!</string>
<string name="21619">Hemmel, the locals are pestering me. Could we please leave!</string>
<string name="21620">The Master is very attached to his... things.</string>
<string name="21621">Don&apos;t go drawing attention to me. Can&apos;t keep a coin in your purse for all the thieves out today.</string>
<string name="21622">Plague and thieves... if the city weren&apos;t in quarantine I&apos;d have fled long ago.</string>
<string name="21623">Feh! Don&apos;t tell ME there&apos;s a cure in the works. Just letting us peasants die, they are!</string>
<string name="21624">That Desther and his bunch, they talk a lot, but I&apos;ve yet to see their blessings help anyone.</string>
<string name="21625">I suppose things could be worse. Not sure HOW exactly, but I&apos;m sure they could be.</string>
<string name="21626">That Nasher, I&apos;ve heard he&apos;s working day and night on a cure for the Wailing. Gives me hope.</string>
<string name="21627">I know there will be a cure. Know why? Because nobles have the Wailing too.</string>
<string name="21628">Don&apos;t know why there&apos;s been so much crime lately. It&apos;s not like they can steal a cure, eh?</string>
<string name="21629">Things are settling down. Don&apos;t know what happend, but I&apos;m glad my purse is safe now.</string>
<string name="21630">Things are calmer now. There&apos;s still the plague, of course, but the Helmites will take care of that.</string>
<string name="21631">You just stroll somewhere else.</string>
<string name="21632">Do I look like a fool? I could see you casing me.</string>
<string name="21633">This for the auction at Seedy Tavern?</string>
<string name="21634">I don&apos;t like stalkers. You&apos;d better start running.</string>
<string name="21635">What can you tell me about the auction?</string>
<string name="21636">What do you need gold for?</string>
<string name="21637">You&apos;ll stroll into a grave! Why are you following people!</string>
<string name="21638">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="21639">What&apos;s your name?</string>
<string name="21640">Know why thieves are so thick in this area?</string>
<string name="21641">Why thieves everywhere here?</string>
<string name="21642">What your name?</string>
<string name="21643">Bye.</string>
<string name="21644">You stroll to grave! Why you follow people?</string>
<string name="21645">Me no fool. Me see you watching to rob!</string>
<string name="21646">You stroll and walk somewheres else.</string>
<string name="21647">What you need gold for?</string>
<string name="21648">This for Seedy Tavern auction? What you know?</string>
<string name="21649">Me not like stalkers! You start running!</string>
<string name="21650">What you know about auction.</string>
<string name="21651">I&apos;ve already warned you about following me.</string>
<string name="21652">Me already warn you about following.</string>
<string name="21653">You stop following! Me not warn again!</string>
<string name="21654">You will stop following me. I won&apos;t warn you again!</string>
<string name="21655">Tell me about Vengaul and the Bloodsailors.</string>
<string name="21656">You tells about Vengaul and Bloodsailors.</string>
<string name="21657">What do you know about the Seedy Tavern?</string>
<string name="21658">Whats you know about Seedy Tavern?</string>
<string name="21659">Mostly? What do you mean by that?</string>
<string name="21660">What you mean, mostly?</string>
<string name="21661">What? I ain&apos;t following nobody... just... uh... strolling. Yeah, that&apos;s it.</string>
<string name="21662">Oh, no problem. Don&apos;t you worry. I&apos;ll just be on my way then. Yes, on my way... Nice stuff you got there... </string>
<string name="21663">I wasn&apos;t... I didn&apos;t mean... Blast it! I&apos;ll never make the gold at this rate!</string>
<string name="21664">Look, I don&apos;t want any trouble. I was just looking for an easy mark. Obviously that ain&apos;t you, so I&apos;ll just be going.</string>
<string name="21665">You know about that? Nobody&apos;s supposed to know. Everybody does though. Like it was leaked out or something.</string>
<string name="21666">I don&apos;t know, I just heard that a plague cure was coming up for auction in the Seedy Tavern. Just let me get back to work... </string>
<string name="21667">I&apos;ll never be able to afford it at this rate. Could steal the whole district and not have enough, I bet.</string>
<string name="21668">Just trying to stay alive! Just trying!</string>
<string name="21669">Who, me? I don&apos;t know much about it. It&apos;s at the Seedy Tavern. It&apos;s funded by Bloodsailors... that means Vengaul is involved somehow.</string>
<string name="21670">I ain&apos;t doing nothing, friend. Just sitting on the corner... </string>
<string name="21671">Don&apos;t have one. Nope. Just some nameless guy on the corner. Nothing to get concerned about... </string>
<string name="21672">Don&apos;t know anything about anything... just standing on a corner.</string>
<string name="21673">Just you move along, hmm... I ain&apos;t got time for paupers... I need some high rollers... </string>
<string name="21674">You should, ah, be careful with that gear of yours... looks expensive... worth a bit... yeah.</string>
<string name="21675">Gotta wait for the moment... should I... they look pretty tough... I don&apos;t know... </string>
<string name="21676">That&apos;s a fine looking weapon there... worth a lot, I bet... better keep an eye on it.</string>
<string name="21677">Evening... mighty fine gear you have there... got to be worth a pretty penny, I imagine... </string>
<string name="21678">Get along, you pauper... gotta find someone with the stuff... expensive stuff... </string>
<string name="21679">Gotta find a mark... come to daddy... </string>
<string name="21680">Here, I&apos;ll give you my copy of the notice. I can&apos;t afford to go anyway. Just don&apos;t hurt me.</string>
<string name="21681">What? I never... I mean... aw, I&apos;m sorry. I just gotta get some gold together... I wasn&apos;t going to do anything to you.</string>
<string name="21682">Nothing anyone else couldn&apos;t tell you. It&apos;s in the north central of the district, and it&apos;s where the black market usually is.</string>
<string name="21683">Well, anyone that stays around here for long hears about Vengaul Bloodsail. He&apos;s flashy, and he likes showing off. The bloodsailors are his... pirates, mostly.</string>
<string name="21684">A guy like me can&apos;t even get in there. They&apos;ve got a brick wall of a bouncer that won&apos;t let anyone in that isn&apos;t a Bloodsailor.</string>
<string name="21685">Them uniforms is hard to come by. Of course, maybe if I got enough gold together, she might say different. I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="21686">Well, it&apos;s a big group. One guy can&apos;t run the whole thing. Vengaul, he&apos;s a showman, but he needs some organizers too. </string>
<string name="21687">I hear that his first lieutenant is hot under the collar right now. Callik&apos;s his name... but I ain&apos;t saying anything else... I don&apos;t know anything else.</string>
<string name="21688"></string>
<string name="21689">The Seedy Tavern</string>
<string name="21690">I&apos;ll take a look at your normal items.</string>
<string name="21691">Me just look at normal stuff.</string>
<string name="21692">Let&apos;s have a look at some of your special items.</string>
<string name="21693">Me want to see special things.</string>
<string name="21694">Why is the auction not going ahead?</string>
<string name="21695">Why auction not on?</string>
<string name="21696">Another time, perhaps.</string>
<string name="21697">Maybe laters.</string>
<string name="21698">Weapons.</string>
<string name="21699">Armor.</string>
<string name="21700">Miscellaneous.</string>
<string name="21701">Miscel... Miscsca... uh... Other things!</string>
<string name="21702">Show me your assorted stuff.</string>
<string name="21703">Show me your selection of armor.</string>
<string name="21704">Show me your miscellaneous items.</string>
<string name="21705">You show me your armor stuff.</string>
<string name="21706">&lt;StartAction&gt;Purchase the magic longsword for 10 coins.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="21707">&lt;StartAction&gt;Purchase the magic morning star for 5 coins.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="21708">&lt;StartAction&gt;Purchase the magic double axe for 15 coins.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="21709">&lt;StartAction&gt;Purchase the magical breastplate for 15 coins.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="21710">&lt;StartAction&gt;Purchase the magical shield for 9 coins.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="21711">&lt;StartAction&gt;Purchase magical leather armor for 5 coins.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="21712">Show me what weapons you have.</string>
<string name="21713">Show me weapon stuffs.</string>
<string name="21714">&lt;StartAction&gt;Purchase the magical cloak for 14 coins.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="21715">&lt;StartAction&gt;Purchase magical sash for 6 coins.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="21716"></string>
<string name="21717">Blasted Vengaul! I&apos;ve paid good money for some of these things, and now he&apos;s late getting the show going!</string>
<string name="21718">Come on, people! I&apos;ve stuff to sell! Don&apos;t make me carry it all home! There&apos;s not going to be an auction.</string>
<string name="21719">Would you know a &quot;special item&quot; if you saw one? Ah, what do I care? If you have the coins, I&apos;ll sell to ya.</string>
<string name="21720">I&apos;ve a number of things. Would you like weapons, armor, or my miscellaneous goods?</string>
<string name="21721">No time for me. I&apos;ve got to move this stuff out and go restock. I won&apos;t be here forever.</string>
<string name="21722">Ah, heck with it. Anyone want to buy some things? I&apos;ve got Smugglers&apos; Coin specials.</string>
<string name="21723">Because my premier item isn&apos;t here. Vengaul said he had a great showpiece item for sale, and now he&apos;s not here.</string>
<string name="21724">It just isn&apos;t worth the fuss of an auction if I don&apos;t have something to excite people and drive prices up. </string>
<string name="21725">I&apos;ve got to recover costs, so Vengaul can just sit on his &quot;integral to the plague cure&quot; item, for all I care.</string>
<string name="21726">I have a magical breastplate. It&apos;s medium armor for 15 Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="21727">I&apos;ve a magic double axe. It&apos;s an exotic weapon. It&apos;s very nice. It&apos;s 15 Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="21728">I&apos;ve a magical cloak, which was made by the nymphs and a steal at 14 Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="21729">I&apos;ve a magic longsword. It&apos;s a martial weapon, and is very nice. It&apos;s 10 Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="21730">I&apos;ve a magic morning star. It&apos;s a simple weapon and is quite nice. It&apos;s 5 Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="21731">So, would you like to make a purchase?</string>
<string name="21732">I&apos;ve no weapons left. Something else, perhaps?</string>
<string name="21733">Excellent. Would you like something else?</string>
<string name="21734">I have no armor left. Something else, perhaps?</string>
<string name="21735">I have a magical shield for 9 Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="21736">I have a suit of magical leather, which is a lovely suit of light armor for 5 Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="21737">So, what would you like?</string>
<string name="21738">I&apos;ve a magical sash, look at it shimmer. It&apos;s a good deal at 6 Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="21739"></string>
<string name="21740">So, what will you have?</string>
<string name="21741">Nothing left in my miscellaneous box. Something else perhaps?</string>
<string name="21742">Great. Do you want something else?</string>
<string name="21743">Thank you. What else will you have?</string>
<string name="21744">I&apos;ll make it worth your while to let me in.</string>
<string name="21745">What if I join a group you let in?</string>
<string name="21746">How about five Smugglers&apos; Coins. Not too shabby.</string>
<string name="21747">I&apos;ve a few Smugglers&apos; Coins, the currency of the black market.</string>
<string name="21748">My dear lady, I&apos;m sure we can come to some... agreement. </string>
<string name="21749">My services, in any way you see fit to use them.</string>
<string name="21750">I can offer gold.</string>
<string name="21751">Let me in! Aribeth decreed I must keep the peace!</string>
<string name="21752">Is this a black market tavern?</string>
<string name="21753">How can I join one of these groups if you don&apos;t let me in?</string>
<string name="21754">Who do I have to be to get in?</string>
<string name="21755">What me have to do to get in?</string>
<string name="21756">This black market tavern?</string>
<string name="21757">You let me in! Me keep the peace!</string>
<string name="21758">Me make it worth your while. </string>
<string name="21759">How me join if you not let me in?</string>
<string name="21760">Me give gold?</string>
<string name="21761">Maybe me work for yous?</string>
<string name="21762">Well, me pretty studly. Maybe we make... agreement?</string>
<string name="21763">Me have some Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="21764">Me got five Smugglers&apos; Coins. That good?</string>
<string name="21765">Me not have much. How me join group?</string>
<string name="21766">What is it now? More rabble trying to crash the tavern? Let&apos;s have a look at you.</string>
<string name="21767">You with that other one? Or was it you? Ah, I don&apos;t care any more. Door&apos;s open.</string>
<string name="21768">Look, like I said before, either join a group we let in, or pony up some Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="21769">Step up to the door and let&apos;s have a look at you, shall we?</string>
<string name="21770">I don&apos;t recognize you, do I? No, I don&apos;t. No admittance to nonmembers.</string>
<string name="21771">Worth my while, eh? Do you even know what that means? Pony up, and let&apos;s see what you can offer.</string>
<string name="21772">Fair enough. The door is open to you and yours. Just don&apos;t make trouble.</string>
<string name="21773">Hmmm... you&apos;re putting one over on me. Get lost, and don&apos;t come back unless you&apos;ve joined a group I let in.</string>
<string name="21774">I don&apos;t risk my neck for less than five Smugglers&apos; Coins. Get them or join a group allowed in. Beat it.</string>
<string name="21775">I have better men than you doing my laundry. Give me Smugglers&apos; Coins or join a group allowed in. Meanwhile, get lost.</string>
<string name="21776">I have no need of lackeys. Find some Smugglers&apos; Coin or join a group I let in. Now beat it.</string>
<string name="21777">Sorry, I only take black market Smugglers&apos; Coins. Find some or join a group allowed in. Good luck, and get lost.</string>
<string name="21778">Well you can just keep it out there. She and her city guard mercenaries aren&apos;t thought of too highly here.</string>
<string name="21779">If you have to ask, then you aren&apos;t welcome. This is a private establishment. Members or members of like-minded groups only.</string>
<string name="21780">None of my business. Either you get a uniform I recognize, or... maybe slip me a few Smugglers&apos; Coins. Now beat it.</string>
<string name="21781">Hmm, I sees a Bloodsailor uniform. Good enough, but watch yourself. You or any friends make trouble and out you go.</string>
<string name="21782">Look, I&apos;ve about had it with fools trying my patience. No more slack. Get a uniform or get lost.</string>
<string name="21783">Is it busy in here tonight?</string>
<string name="21784">Have you heard about anything odd happening?</string>
<string name="21785">Farewell.</string>
<string name="21786">Busy in here?</string>
<string name="21787">You hear anything odd happen?</string>
<string name="21788">Bye.</string>
<string name="21789">I don&apos;t want any trouble in here. We&apos;ll bounce you out without a second thought.</string>
<string name="21790">You behave in here. Things are rough enough without bringing the chaos on the streets in here.</string>
<string name="21791">Boy howdy, you don&apos;t know how busy! I&apos;m run off my feet! Everybody is desperate to get in, for some reason.</string>
<string name="21792">Nothing yet, and they always warn the person working the door. Just supposed to be an auction tonight.</string>
<string name="21793">Must be something good on the block for so many people to show up, though.</string>
<string name="21794">Keep it quiet while you&apos;re here, hmm? Don&apos;t need any trouble.</string>
<string name="21795">Not much happening here now. Auction never happened and the crowds are going home.</string>
<string name="21796">I don&apos;t give out charity.</string>
<string name="21797">None of your business, fool.</string>
<string name="21798">Why is this district so dangerous?</string>
<string name="21799">Do you know how to enter the Seedy Tavern?</string>
<string name="21800">I am here to keep order. I can say no more.</string>
<string name="21801">I cannot afford to give you anything. I am sorry.</string>
<string name="21802">Here&apos;s a couple gold for you.</string>
<string name="21803">Here, you take a few gold.</string>
<string name="21804">Me can&apos;t afford to give you golds.</string>
<string name="21805">Me not give out charity.</string>
<string name="21806">Me here to keep order. That all me will say.</string>
<string name="21807">How me get in Seedy Tavern black market?</string>
<string name="21808">Why this district so dangerous?</string>
<string name="21809">Not your business fool.</string>
<string name="21810">Back again to Festiliard? I am popular tonight. Do you seek knowledge from the beggar about the path ahead?</string>
<string name="21811">I was treated rudely, so I will say little. Bridges have been burned with me.</string>
<string name="21812">Spare a coin, friend?</string>
<string name="21813">Ah, you waste nothing on those that don&apos;t serve, but how can you know my worth, hmm? Perhaps I know things... </string>
<string name="21814">I&apos;m not really interested in coin, but I&apos;m interested in you. What do you need here? This isn&apos;t a friendly place.</string>
<string name="21815">But my business is the streets. I keep low to them, and hear much. A pity you do not value this.</string>
<string name="21816">Very well, I say nothing and do nothing. But... </string>
<string name="21817">To walk amongst pirates you must look the part. How to do that? Well, you are big and strong. Go ask them.</string>
<string name="21818">Ah, you need the cure, and the auction is what you seek. The streets are mine from the underside. I know things... </string>
<string name="21819">Ah, but how will you keep that order? Will you kill, or bully... or cure? Yes, you would want a cure... </string>
<string name="21820">Have you the currency of thieves? Or the garb of a guild? Old Seedy&apos;s tavern will not open without.</string>
<string name="21821">But what do I know of these things? Merchants quiver with currency, and pirates keep their uniforms as close as their ships.</string>
<string name="21822">I am but a beggar among kings... and in the service of both. Good day to you.</string>
<string name="21823">Ah, I don&apos;t know if you can afford it or not, but your rebuff was polite. You treat knowledgeable strangers well.</string>
<string name="21824">Ah, you are generous. Someone that knows the value of a coin to a stranger. A stranger that might know something.</string>
<string name="21825">A show, a challenge, but the players are in revolt. You willl want to attend. The market holds what you seek.</string>
<string name="21826">Tell me where he is or me kill you!</string>
<string name="21827">Tell me where he is or I will kill you!</string>
<string name="21828">I want to find him. I can&apos;t promise he&apos;ll be safe.</string>
<string name="21829">If you help me find him, I will spare his life.</string>
<string name="21830">Idiot! He was playing with people&apos;s lives!</string>
<string name="21831">Lord Nasher? Why would he come?</string>
<string name="21832">Why he think Nasher come here?</string>
<string name="21833">He play with lives like toys!</string>
<string name="21834">This game not so funny to Vengaul&apos;s men, I bets.</string>
<string name="21835">Help me find, and me spare him.</string>
<string name="21836">Me want find him, but me not promise he be okay.</string>
<string name="21837">Calm down. I&apos;m not going to hurt you.</string>
<string name="21838">Me not going to hurt yous.</string>
<string name="21839">And I don&apos;t know you. Should I care?</string>
<string name="21840">Me not know you too. Why me care?</string>
<string name="21841">You&apos;ll die if you need to.</string>
<string name="21842">You die if me say you die.</string>
<string name="21843">I want to ask about you.</string>
<string name="21844">Me ask about you.</string>
<string name="21845">I want to ask about Vengaul.</string>
<string name="21846">Me ask about Vengaul.</string>
<string name="21847">What do you know about the auction?</string>
<string name="21848">What you know of this auction?</string>
<string name="21849">I am acting as a guard under Aribeth and Nasher.</string>
<string name="21850">Me act as guard under Aribeth and Nasher.</string>
<string name="21851">That is none of your business.</string>
<string name="21852">That my business, lady, not yours.</string>
<string name="21853">Perhaps I&apos;m here to kill you. Perhaps I haven&apos;t decided yet.</string>
<string name="21854">Maybe me here to kill you. Maybe me not decide yet.</string>
<string name="21855">Why were you imprisoned here?</string>
<string name="21856">Why you trapped here?</string>
<string name="21857">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="21858">Why have the Bloodsailors mutinied?</string>
<string name="21859">Why Bloodsailors not follow anymore?</string>
<string name="21860">Where is Vengaul Bloodsail now?</string>
<string name="21861">Where Vengaul now?</string>
<string name="21862">Back to my previous questions.</string>
<string name="21863">We go back to other questions?</string>
<string name="21864">Is there one in particular who is guiding this revolt?</string>
<string name="21865">There someone leading the traitor sailors?</string>
<string name="21866">Where is Callik?</string>
<string name="21867">Where Callik now?</string>
<string name="21868">What creature do you mean?</string>
<string name="21869">What creature you mean?</string>
<string name="21870">This game of his would not have pleased his Bloodsailors.</string>
<string name="21871">Who is it now? More people to threaten me? I shouldn&apos;t have said anything. I just hoped someone would help... but I can&apos;t trust anyone with Vengaul gone!</string>
<string name="21872">You have returned. What more can I tell you? What more do you think I know?</string>
<string name="21873">Thank you for saving me... if that is indeed what you have done. I do not know you, or your motives.</string>
<string name="21874">Vengaul is on the run, so he&apos;ll go to where he thinks he&apos;s safe. He&apos;ll either go to the Silver Sails or the Aqueducts. I think both places lead to an underground cache of his.</string>
<string name="21875">If you are the type to do something like that, you&apos;ll probably kill me anyway! I won&apos;t doom my beloved Vengaul too!</string>
<string name="21876">I don&apos;t know how to enter the Aqueducts and I won&apos;t give you my k... I mean, I won&apos;t help you get into the Silver Sails!</string>
<string name="21877">So you hope to entice me by saying you may or may not kill him? I suppose it is the only honesty I have seen today.</string>
<string name="21878">Take this locket. It was a present from him. He said it was a key, and it would let me enter the Silver Sails if I needed to find him.</string>
<string name="21879">The Silver Sails is in the west central area of the Docks. There&apos;s a passage inside. Vengaul said it is safe... for him, at least.</string>
<string name="21880">I want to believe. He really did mean for his auction to help... he just wanted the right amount of flash as well. Very well... find him. </string>
<string name="21881">He plays with lives all the time, as does Nasher. That&apos;s what rulers do. The stakes were just a bit too high this time.</string>
<string name="21882">The two of them are old rivals. They were always looking for ways to show up the other. Vengaul figured Nasher couldn&apos;t get out of this one.</string>
<string name="21883">I can&apos;t fight you any more than I could my previous captors. At least they had reason to hold me. I know very little about you.</string>
<string name="21884">It is good to hear a kind voice. These men have not been gentle, and I fear their questions were growing ever more insistent.</string>
<string name="21885">I have no answer. You have me at a disadvantage, though, and I must trust that you will not harm me.</string>
<string name="21886">I am Dara&apos;nei, and I am at your mercy. I&apos;d hoped you were sent by Vengaul, but I haven&apos;t heard from him. His auction was called off.</string>
<string name="21887">I have a question first, if you don&apos;t mind? Who do you serve? I won&apos;t say anything if you intend to use it against people I care about.</string>
<string name="21888">Very well. As I said, my name is Dara&apos;nei. I am... in service to Vengaul Bloodsail, the Scarlet Blade and foil of Lord Nasher Alagondar.</string>
<string name="21889">Vengaul Bloodsail, the Scarlet Blade. He is the former leader of the mutinous Bloodsailors, and he is my betrothed. We have been apart for far too long.</string>
<string name="21890">More than I care to, at this point. I wish Vengaul had never found that creature. It has caused no end of trouble.</string>
<string name="21891">How can I trust you when you when you won&apos;t do me this simple courtesy? Is it so much to ask?</string>
<string name="21892">If that is your attitude then I refuse to say any more. I cannot allow my petty life to endanger my beloved Vengaul.</string>
<string name="21893">They why would you bother to save me? Perhaps you don&apos;t even know the answer, but I cannot trust someone so openly threatening.</string>
<string name="21894">I see. I begin to understand what your interest in Vengaul and his Bloodsailors may be. Ask your questions. I will try to answer.</string>
<string name="21895">Farewell. I will remain here. Vengaul will find me when the time is right to do so. If his game doesn&apos;t get even further out of hand... </string>
<string name="21896">These were Callik&apos;s men. He was Vengaul&apos;s Lieutenant, and he wanted them to interrogate me and find out where Vengaul is hiding.</string>
<string name="21897">It would seem that Callik is no longer willing to follow my Vengaul, but I certainly didn&apos;t think he would stoop to this.</string>
<string name="21898">I will answer if I am able.</string>
<string name="21899">It would appear that they have grown tired of Vengaul. His methods of doing things are sometimes... difficult to understand.</string>
<string name="21900">They don&apos;t respect his grandiose plans like they used to. He has always stressed how things should be done with style, but now they just want profit.</string>
<string name="21901">Callik, Vengaul&apos;s lieutenant. He didn&apos;t approve of this auction, so now he&apos;s trying to seize the Bloodsailors for his own. He doesn&apos;t appreciate artful schemes.</string>
<string name="21902">Callik will kill Vengaul if he finds him. The Bloodsailors will become a much more vicious group under him. Vengaul always maintained some civility.</string>
<string name="21903">He couldn&apos;t wait for his men to finish with me. He&apos;s probably made a guess as to where Vengaul is, and has gone to try and find him.</string>
<string name="21904">I can&apos;t say for certain, but he is an old pirate and set in his ways. He said I would know where to find him, and I have a few ideas.</string>
<string name="21905">I have already given you my locket. Vengaul said it was a key, and it would let me enter the Silver Sails if I needed to find him.</string>
<string name="21906">Vengaul gave me a locket. He said it was a key for the Silver Sails, and that I should go there if I needed him.</string>
<string name="21907">I have already given out my locket to &lt;CUSTOM427&gt;. Find that person and you&apos;ll have found my locket.</string>
<string name="21908">Look for Vengaul yourself. I won&apos;t help you find him and I won&apos;t give you my k... I mean, I won&apos;t help you enter the Silver Sails!</string>
<string name="21909">Vengaul said it was a Cockatrice brought from Waterdeep and that it had a connection to the plague. He even claimed it was part of a cure.</string>
<string name="21910">He found it in the streets while the city guards were busy with the plague and whatever mess happened at the Academy. It would have been lost if not for him.</string>
<string name="21911">He was going to make sure it was returned to the appropriate city officials, but first he would invite Lord Nasher to this &quot;auction.&quot; It was a game to Vengaul.</string>
<string name="21912">See, Vengaul wanted Nasher to have to come to this stupid little tavern and admit in front of everyone that he had been outdone, that he needed Vengaul.</string>
<string name="21913">He would have just given the Cockatrice back after that. It was all about the game to him.</string>
<string name="21914">No, his game with Nasher has become a bit more serious than he would have liked. The stakes were too high this time.</string>
<string name="21915">See, Vengaul&apos;s men never sent the message to Lord Nasher. Instead, his most trusted lieutenant plotted to kill him. It&apos;s all a mess now.</string>
<string name="21916">Vengaul would have given the creature back. He&apos;s not the kind to let innocents suffer. It just got out of hand.</string>
<string name="21917">Seen anything strange? Found anything odd?</string>
<string name="21918">Tell me where you got it! Now!</string>
<string name="21919">Sorry to have bothered you.</string>
<string name="21920">Callik and Vengaul are probably filthy pirates I&apos;ll end up killing.</string>
<string name="21921">Do you know where I could find Callik or Vengaul?</string>
<string name="21922">Where did you get it?</string>
<string name="21923">Could I have the coin, please?</string>
<string name="21924">Ever heard of a Cockatrice?</string>
<string name="21925">What do you know of the area?</string>
<string name="21926">Any interesting places around here?</string>
<string name="21927">Why is going out more dangerous?</string>
<string name="21928">You know anything strange? Find any odd things?</string>
<string name="21929">Have you every heard of a Cockatrice?</string>
<string name="21930">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="21931">What you know of area?</string>
<string name="21932">You ever see a Cockatrice?</string>
<string name="21933">You ever see a Cockatrice?</string>
<string name="21934">Bye.</string>
<string name="21935">Why it get dangerous to go out?</string>
<string name="21936">Anywhere neat around here?</string>
<string name="21937">You know where me find this Callik or Vengaul?</string>
<string name="21938">Me bet Callik and Vengaul is pirates. Me probably kill them.</string>
<string name="21939">Sorry to bother. Bye.</string>
<string name="21940">Could me have coin, maybe?</string>
<string name="21941">Where you get it?</string>
<string name="21942">Tell me where you get it!</string>
<string name="21943">Could I buy it?</string>
<string name="21944">Could me buy it?</string>
<string name="21945">Give me the damn coin. I won&apos;t ask nicely again!</string>
<string name="21946">Give coin! Me not be gentle if me must ask again!</string>
<string name="21947">Who is this Jerol? Where can I find him?</string>
<string name="21948">Who Jerol? Where me find him?</string>
<string name="21949">Who is Jerol? Where might I find him?</string>
<string name="21950">Who Jerol guy? Where me find him?</string>
<string name="21951">Who is Jerol. Where can I find him?</string>
<string name="21952">Who Jerol? Where me find him at?</string>
<string name="21953">What do you mean by &quot;all business?&quot;</string>
<string name="21954">What you mean, &quot;all business?&quot;</string>
<string name="21955">Where is the Seedy Tavern?</string>
<string name="21956">Where this Seedy Tavern be?</string>
<string name="21957">Sorry, but the kitchen is closed tonight. Not much business, what with the plague and all.</string>
<string name="21958">Well, yes, actually. A Smugglers&apos; Coin, I think it&apos;s called. I get them from time to time. Odd looking things. </string>
<string name="21959">Don&apos;t be rude. Callik and Vengaul bring them in once in a while. Nice boys, those two.</string>
<string name="21960">No trouble. No trouble.</string>
<string name="21961">Oh, no. Callik is a gentleman. Keeps a clean house right near the northeast corner of the district.</string>
<string name="21962">Don&apos;t know. Callik has a house in the northeast corner of the district, if you want to call on him. I&apos;m quite busy.</string>
<string name="21963">That nice Callik leaves them once in a while. Nice boys, him and Vengaul.</string>
<string name="21964">I suppose. Jerol usually gets them anyway. I get them occasionally from Callik and Vengaul. Nice boys.</string>
<string name="21965">Don&apos;t be talking filth on my shift! Oh! Such language!</string>
<string name="21966">Oh, I don&apos;t get out much now. It&apos;s too dangerous. Wasn&apos;t always like this though.</string>
<string name="21967">There&apos;s old Jim Seedy&apos;s tavern, but I&apos;ve never been inside. I prefer a good neighborhood pub, and they are all business.</string>
<string name="21968">Don&apos;t know. People really seem to be desperate for money, though. I&apos;m mostly concerned about the plague, myself.</string>
<string name="21969">Looks like things may be picking up. People seem a little less desperate for money, and are spending a little too.</string>
<string name="21970">Don&apos;t be talking filth on my shift! Oh! Such language!</string>
<string name="21971">Mmm, no, I give them to Jerol in the Twenty in a Quiver. Callik and Vengaul don&apos;t leave them very often.</string>
<string name="21972">Oh, I couldn&apos;t take gold from you. I just give them to Jerol. He quite likes them, I guess.</string>
<string name="21973">Again, Callik and Vengaul don&apos;t leave them very often, so I kind of want to hang on to it for now.</string>
<string name="21974">I... I guess I don&apos;t have much choice. I&apos;m not a fighter. If you want anything else, you get it your own damn self.</string>
<string name="21975">Oh no, Ive been threatened once already tonight. I&apos;m not talking to anyone else. You want something, get it yourself.</string>
<string name="21976">He&apos;s the owner of the Twenty in a Quiver market. You&apos;ll find it east of here, on the way to the other side of the district.</string>
<string name="21977">He owns the Twenty in a Quiver market. It&apos;s east of here, closer to the other side of the Docks district.</string>
<string name="21978">He owns the Twenty in a Quiver store. It&apos;s east of here, closer to the other side of the Docks district.</string>
<string name="21979">Oh, it ain&apos;t for me to say, but it just seems like it&apos;s more for meetings than social things. They have auctions there too, now and then.</string>
<string name="21980">Oh, it&apos;s on the north edge of the Docks. Right in the middle of the north edge. You can&apos;t miss it.</string>
<string name="21981">Intruders! Get them!</string>
<string name="21982">Why do you protect him? He&apos;s probably dead of plague already!</string>
<string name="21983">Vengaul is gone! Tell me where he hid it!</string>
<string name="21984">Look, you had better get used to the way things are now. Vengaul was too old and foolish!</string>
<string name="21985">Where is he! You will tell me! Callik must know!</string>
<string name="21986">Save your posturing. Just show me what you have.</string>
<string name="21987">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; How will you know if you don&apos;t show me? Come on.</string>
<string name="21988">That is an insane price! There must be a cheaper way!</string>
<string name="21989">Where can I get more if I need them?</string>
<string name="21990">Very well, I will purchase three.</string>
<string name="21991">Very well, I will purchase two.</string>
<string name="21992">Very well, I will purchase one.</string>
<string name="21993">Thank you for your time, then.</string>
<string name="21994">Just show me your standard fare.</string>
<string name="21995">Of course. Have you got anything interesting?</string>
<string name="21996">Another time. Goodbye</string>
<string name="21997">What you got? Anything good?</string>
<string name="21998">Shut up and show what you have.</string>
<string name="21999">Just show me normal stuff.</string>
<string name="22000">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe you show and me decide. Come on.</string>
<string name="22001">Maybe later. Bye.</string>
<string name="22002">Bye then.</string>
<string name="22003">Me buy one.</string>
<string name="22004">Me buy two.</string>
<string name="22005">Me buy three.</string>
<string name="22006">Where can me get more?</string>
<string name="22007">That too much! Can they be cheaper?</string>
<string name="22008">Well, in case I want to do that, where is the Seedy Tavern?</string>
<string name="22009">Whatever. So, where Seedy Tavern at?</string>
<string name="22010">More business! I am certainly busy this day, even with the streets so dangerous.</string>
<string name="22011">Welcome to my humble store. Before we continue, I draw your attention to my guards, and my many warning devices.</string>
<string name="22012">I hold nothing against those that make their living as thieves, but I will not be a target. I need to make a living too.</string>
<string name="22013">I have the standard selection of gear. I have other things as well, but they are probably not of interest to you. You are a guard, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="22014">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The majority of my special stock is in the market facilities of Seedy Tavern... if you have the right coins to pay. Smugglers&apos; Coins.</string>
<string name="22015">I happen to have a small supply. 150 gold per coin. Steep, I know, but if you need them, you&apos;ll pay.</string>
<string name="22016">They are in short supply, but... perhaps you will do me a favor some day, hmm? I shall tell you a possibility.</string>
<string name="22017">Gilda at the Golden Apple. I get the occasional coin from her. She does not know what they are, bless her.</string>
<string name="22018">There you might get one... or two... My price will not lower, but I will help you this way. Good luck.</string>
<string name="22019">A pleasure doing business. Do come back again.</string>
<string name="22020">But I am out of these special items. I have no more. I am sorry.</string>
<string name="22021">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I really don&apos;t think you&apos;d be interested. Guards like you don&apos;t usually enter the Seedy Tavern as customers. Your type usually kicks in the door and raises hell.</string>
<string name="22022">The building is no secret. It&apos;s in the center of the northern edge of this district. Anything in there, however, is no business of yours.</string>
<string name="22023">Where&apos;s the auction going to be?</string>
<string name="22024">Straighten up, I am here at the behest of Aribeth and Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="22025">What have you heard about the auction, friend?</string>
<string name="22026">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22027">You were saying something about a man named Callik?</string>
<string name="22028">What you hear about auction?</string>
<string name="22029">You show respect. Me here from Aribeth and Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="22030">Where the auction gonna be?</string>
<string name="22031">Bye.</string>
<string name="22032">What you say about Callik person?</string>
<string name="22033">Eh? Go on, I got nothing wo-(hic)-worth stealin&apos;. Just here to drink... not the auction.</string>
<string name="22034">You... you here looking for the auction? That&apos;s right here... if it&apos;s gonna be on... I don&apos;t know... </string>
<string name="22035">Wooo... you in the wrong place. Wait... then so am I... Haaaaaaaahaha &lt;StartAction&gt;(cough)&lt;/Start&gt;.</string>
<string name="22036">Supposed to be for a plague cure... or something. Vengaul wouldn&apos;t say... being his normal flashy self... </string>
<string name="22037">That ain&apos;t sitting too well with the crowd, though. Callik near... uh... near had a fit. I think there&apos;s gonna be somethin.... uh... </string>
<string name="22038">Was I saying something?</string>
<string name="22039">Lieutenant Callik. Thinks Vengaul is too old... too flashy. No respect for tradition, that man. I... I ain&apos;t saying anything more... except... </string>
<string name="22040">Shhhh.... They took her... you know? Dara&apos;nei? That&apos;s Vengaul&apos;s woman. They took her downstairs... I think... </string>
<string name="22041">Bye and good luck... yah... &lt;StartAction&gt;(hic)&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="22042">uh... I gotta sit down....</string>
<string name="22043">I have questions about you.</string>
<string name="22044">Fine, sorry to bother you.</string>
<string name="22045">Aribeth and Lord Nasher compel me to investigate here.</string>
<string name="22046">I just need some information about the auction.</string>
<string name="22047">Me just want info about the auction.</string>
<string name="22048">But me investigate for Aribeth and Nasher.</string>
<string name="22049">Then me go. Bye.</string>
<string name="22050">Me gots questions about you.</string>
<string name="22051">I have questions about this place.</string>
<string name="22052">Me have questions about this place.</string>
<string name="22053">I need to ask about the Bloodsailors and Vengaul.</string>
<string name="22054">Me gots to ask about Bloodsailors and Vengaul.</string>
<string name="22055">I have to go.</string>
<string name="22056">Me gots to leave.</string>
<string name="22057">Who are you? Why are you here?</string>
<string name="22058">Who is you? Why am you here?</string>
<string name="22059">Why are you nervous about who you speak to?</string>
<string name="22060">Why you scared of talking to some people?</string>
<string name="22061">Back to my other general questions.</string>
<string name="22062">Me ask general stuff from before.</string>
<string name="22063">Is the Seedy Tavern well guarded?</string>
<string name="22064">Seedy Tavern have plenty guards?</string>
<string name="22065">Why are so many people here?</string>
<string name="22066">Why so many people here?</string>
<string name="22067">If Vengaul is their leader, where is he?</string>
<string name="22068">If Vengaul leader of sailors, where he be?</string>
<string name="22069">Do the Bloodsailors approve of this public auction?</string>
<string name="22070">Bloodsailors say okay to this noisy auction stuff?</string>
<string name="22071">You are talking about a revolt.</string>
<string name="22072">You mean his men maybe fight him?</string>
<string name="22073">You think he deliberately spread word of it?</string>
<string name="22074">He want people to hear about it?</string>
<string name="22075">Hello. I&apos;ve said too much already, but I suppose I can risk answering a few questions if you really need the information.</string>
<string name="22076">That was quite the display with Jalek. He&apos;s a bit off, even for a Bloodsailor, but he&apos;s a good man. Smarter than he seems, too.</string>
<string name="22077">You&apos;ve gained his confidence, though, and that means I can risk talking to you, but keep your questions quiet, all right? Vengaul&apos;s absence has everyone on edge.</string>
<string name="22078">Hmm? Leave me be, I got nothing to say. Can&apos;t be seen with the likes of you. </string>
<string name="22079">I said I can&apos;t be seen speaking with you. Get lost.</string>
<string name="22080">Look, you moron, I&apos;ll say it slow. I cannot be seen with you. Go away.</string>
<string name="22081">Looks like things are settling down. There&apos;s no reason for you to talk to me. Good job, but please leave.</string>
<string name="22082">You with that person that went toe to toe with Jalek? A strange display, but it gained Jalek&apos;s confidence. Now I can risk speaking with you.</string>
<string name="22083">There a problem with this person, Christov? You want I should set them straight?</string>
<string name="22084">Thanks Jalek, but I&apos;m fine. They were just leaving.</string>
<string name="22085">Now look, you&apos;ve got Jalek thinking I know you. Move along, before he starts asking questions.</string>
<string name="22086">Jalek is violent, but smarter than he looks, so I couldn&apos;t be seen talking to anyone he didn&apos;t know. Vengaul&apos;s absence has everyone on edge.</string>
<string name="22087">Very well, but take this key to get downstairs. It is the only copy I have. You&apos;ll still have to get by the Chef, though.</string>
<string name="22088">I&apos;m sure you do. I won&apos;t be able to answer most of them, but you may ask.</string>
<string name="22089">Ask what you will, though you have probably already figured out most of what I might say.</string>
<string name="22090">My mission within the Bloodsailors is not focused on what you seek, but I will try to answer.</string>
<string name="22091">Reasonable questions, if we keep our answers hushed. I am Christov, and I am here for the same reason you are: investigating the Bloodsailors.</string>
<string name="22092">In truth, I&apos;m not from Neverwinter, and the group I represent is hoping to locate some old allies of the Bloodsailors. Longterm goals.</string>
<string name="22093">Jalek has been assigned to be my watchman, meaning he watches me and everything I do. It is part of the initiation into the Bloodsailors.</string>
<string name="22094">If I struck up a conversation with someone he didn&apos;t recognize, he would have to determine how I knew the other person. He would not ask gently.</string>
<string name="22095">I worry for others, mostly. I know you don&apos;t want any undue attention. I certainly don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="22096">Your concerns are more immediate, and I will attempt to not get in your way, if you do the same for me.</string>
<string name="22097">Ask what you will, but do not speak too loudly.</string>
<string name="22098">Well enough. I think you will be fine in the main area here, but if you go downstairs Bloodsailor guards will attack on sight.</string>
<string name="22099">Nobody is allowed downstairs now. There is much going on. Perhaps we should speak more of this.</string>
<string name="22100">Most of the people here came for the auction that was supposed to happen. Vengaul apparently spread rumors that he had part of a plague cure. </string>
<string name="22101">Looks like it&apos;s been cancelled, and I think I know why. You&apos;ll have to get downstairs to find out more. It&apos;s Bloodsailor business.</string>
<string name="22102">Vengaul has not arrived, and I doubt that he will. He might have meant to cause some suspense, but he rarely lets a crowd grow impatient.</string>
<string name="22103">Vengaul is a showman. He does not like to disappoint, especially after taking such pains to make sure the auction was well-known.</string>
<string name="22104">Vengaul is an old style swashbuckler. He prefers the glory of a well-constructed spectacle. A few of his men disapprove vigorously.</string>
<string name="22105">You see, some of them feel that they could be far more effective if they stopped worrying about public opinion and such.</string>
<string name="22106">Perhaps. If the rumor was true and he really has some kind of cure, he might draw attention to it in order to increase bidding on it.</string>
<string name="22107">That, or maybe he wanted someone very important to hear of it. He&apos;s had a long history of trying to bait Lord Nasher into action.</string>
<string name="22108">Regardless, it appears his plans have been changed. I do not think Vengaul is fully in control of the situation any more.</string>
<string name="22109">I don&apos;t know. I have heard rumblings... His lieutenant Callik is an impatient and greedy man... I can&apos;t say much more about this.</string>
<string name="22110">There may have been some... steps taken to try and oust the old man. You should seek your answers downstairs. I&apos;m sorry, I can&apos;t say anymore.</string>
<string name="22111">Very well. I&apos;ve already given out the key I had for downstairs. If you don&apos;t have it, you&apos;ll have to find another way past the door, and deal with Chef.</string>
<string name="22112">I&apos;ll pass. I&apos;m not looking for trouble.</string>
<string name="22113">I&apos;m just looking for information. I&apos;ll gladly pay.</string>
<string name="22114">I&apos;ll match you drink for drink, no problem!</string>
<string name="22115">Ehh, I&apos;ve changed my mind.</string>
<string name="22116">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; Bottoms up!</string>
<string name="22117">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; Bring it on!</string>
<string name="22118">Me match you drinking! No problem! </string>
<string name="22119">Me just want information. Me pay.</string>
<string name="22120">Me don&apos;t want troubles. </string>
<string name="22121">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; Bottom up and stuff!</string>
<string name="22122">Me change mind.</string>
<string name="22123">What is going on in here?</string>
<string name="22124">What happening in here?</string>
<string name="22125">Where Vengaul be?</string>
<string name="22126">Thanks for your oh so important approval.</string>
<string name="22127">Vengaul? Where would he be?</string>
<string name="22128">Who is Callik?</string>
<string name="22129">Who Callik?</string>
<string name="22130">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Not long. I replaced a plague victim.</string>
<string name="22131">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Not long. Me replace plague-dead guy.</string>
<string name="22132">I&apos;m just looking for information. That&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="22133">Me just wants information.</string>
<string name="22134">I&apos;m no Bloodsailor. I&apos;m acting as a city guard.</string>
<string name="22135">Me not Bloodsailor. Me here as city guard.</string>
<string name="22136">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; Let&apos;s go! You me!</string>
<string name="22137">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; No problem at all!</string>
<string name="22138">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; This easy. Let&apos;s go!</string>
<string name="22139">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; Cheers!</string>
<string name="22140">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; Cheers!</string>
<string name="22141">Thanks. Maybe I&apos;ll just sit down for a bit, now.</string>
<string name="22142">Urp. Thanks. Maybe me sit for a bit now.</string>
<string name="22143">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; You and me! Let&apos;s do it!</string>
<string name="22144">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; That right! You and me, drink it back!</string>
<string name="22145">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; I am just fine! Swig it back!</string>
<string name="22146">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; Me just fine! Swig it!</string>
<string name="22147">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;re not stopping are you? Swig it!</string>
<string name="22148">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; No stop yet, you! Swig it!</string>
<string name="22149">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; Bah! Nothing but water! Tip it back!</string>
<string name="22150">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s watery! Tip it good!</string>
<string name="22151">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; Through the lips and over the gums!</string>
<string name="22152">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt; Chug-a-lugg-a! Whooo!</string>
<string name="22153">What is in Scurrd?</string>
<string name="22154">What in Scurrd?</string>
<string name="22155">I had some questions.</string>
<string name="22156">Me gots questions.</string>
<string name="22157">Your approval mean so much.</string>
<string name="22158">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22159">Who is Christov?</string>
<string name="22160">Who Christov?</string>
<string name="22161">Why are you here? What do you do?</string>
<string name="22162">Why you here? What do you do?</string>
<string name="22163">Back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="22164">Back to other questions, okay?</string>
<string name="22165">Damnedest thing I ever saw. You are okay with me and Christov. You bet.</string>
<string name="22166">Well, more nosey little people in my business. You want to try your luck? Drink for drink? Earn my respect?!</string>
<string name="22167">Who are you, fool? Don&apos;t you know not to go bothering a Bloodsailor while he&apos;s drinking?</string>
<string name="22168">You are in the wrong neighborhood. City officials ain&apos;t popular with us. Unless you prove your worth drink for drink! Up for it?</string>
<string name="22169">I thought so. All bluff and no stuff. Come back when you&apos;ve got a spine.</string>
<string name="22170">All right then! Let&apos;s start off with a little Neverwintan Sailor Spirit. A bathtub special here at the Seedy Tavern. Go!</string>
<string name="22171">Ah, that&apos;s pretty good. You&apos;re not so flimsy after all. How about some Dockside Dunn&apos;s, a rank bit of swill if I ever had some!</string>
<string name="22172">Whoa! All right! That&apos;s not too bad. Round three then! Orc Blood Brew, and no plugging your nose!</string>
<string name="22173">Eh, should&apos;a sat down when you had the chance. You just aren&apos;t up to snuff, as far as I&apos;m concerned.</string>
<string name="22174">You&apos;re with that &lt;CUSTOM401&gt;, aren&apos;t you? I tell you, that was one tough nut. Damndest thing I ever saw. Right, Christov?</string>
<string name="22175">Party is pretty much over in here. Not much point in sticking around.</string>
<string name="22176">You bet you will, but deep pockets don&apos;t get you much here. We respect strength. Can you go drink for drink or not?!</string>
<string name="22177">There&apos;s supposed to be an auction, but I don&apos;t know much about it. Who knows what Vengaul has planned?</string>
<string name="22178">Nobody said it would come easy. </string>
<string name="22179">Don&apos;t know. He&apos;s late, I think. Callik went to talk to him, or something. He didn&apos;t look pleased.</string>
<string name="22180">Callik is the second in command of the Bloodsailors. He&apos;s not as friendly as Vengaul. Yeah, that&apos;s for certain.</string>
<string name="22181">Hmm... do I know you? You wear the uniform, but I don&apos;t recognize your face. How long you been a Bloodsailor, &lt;boy/girl&gt;?</string>
<string name="22182">So should you be in that uniform or not? I don&apos;t think you&apos;re up to our standards, not unless you match me drink for drink! Up for it?</string>
<string name="22183">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; All right then, I suppose you are okay... but do you have what it takes, I wonder?</string>
<string name="22184">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I don&apos;t think so. I think you&apos;re just some thug who hopes to join up. Are you up to our standards?!</string>
<string name="22185">Care to go drink for drink? My respect is what&apos;s on the line!</string>
<string name="22186">Ha! Down after one! What kind of &lt;man/woman&gt; are you? Pathetic. You just aren&apos;t worthy of my time.</string>
<string name="22187">I thought as much. Take a walk, fool. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s some porcelain for you to kiss around here somewhere.</string>
<string name="22188">All right, but now it gets tough! How about... a little Dwarven Red Eye! It&apos;ll make you feel like you&apos;re under a pile of stone!</string>
<string name="22189">Well how about that! You got it down! I guess you&apos;re all right. I don&apos;t care who you are, if you can drink like that, you&apos;re okay by me.</string>
<string name="22190">Now, how about some... oh... Thayvian Fire Juice? Burns in ways you don&apos;t want to know! Are you crazy enough to play?!</string>
<string name="22191">Well I&apos;ll be a... How about that?! So... you want to keep going with some... Catoblepas Death Cheese Wine?! Or have you had enough?</string>
<string name="22192">Well, I guess you should have sat down. Still, you&apos;ve proven yourself to me. Everything after Dwarven Red Eye was just to see how crazy you are.</string>
<string name="22193">Well... looks like we&apos;re getting... serious. All right then, from the bowels of the earth, a downright poisonous brew... Dark Elven T&apos;Keela.</string>
<string name="22194">Okay... Not that I&apos;m queasy... but do you want to quit... or try a... a Screaming Harpy! You can&apos;t imagine... the horror... </string>
<string name="22195">Yeah, I think you&apos;ve proven yourself to me. I mean, everything after the Dwarven Red Eye was just to see how crazy you are.</string>
<string name="22196">Nope, I don&apos;t have to worry about you one bit. Hey, you should talk to my buddy Christov. Show him how to loosen up. He&apos;s too serious.</string>
<string name="22197">And, uh, to tell you the truth, I wasn&apos;t looking forward to some of what was coming next. Ugh. Nobody should touch any of that stuff.</string>
<string name="22198">Oh hell... okay... you want to play games... *hic*... okay... The meanest... the foulest... black bile of the earth... A bottle... of Scurrd.</string>
<string name="22199">Son of a... </string>
<string name="22200">What is in Scurrd? What, indeed. Scurrd... just seems to find its way... to where it can do the most harm. It&apos;s truly vicious.</string>
<string name="22201">It cannot be smelled by the elderly... it cannot be held by small children... It is Scurrd, and woe be to ye that take it to your tongue.</string>
<string name="22202">Heh... I knew you couldn&apos;t... uh... </string>
<string name="22203">I don&apos;t bother worrying about much, friend, but I&apos;ll answer if I can.</string>
<string name="22204">A good &lt;day/night&gt; to you.</string>
<string name="22205">I&apos;m just a Bloodsailor, friend. I take care of a little business now and then, and I watch over new charges on occasion. Like Christov here.</string>
<string name="22206">He&apos;s a new recruit. I&apos;ve got to keep my eye on him... maybe question people he talks to. That part is easy. He doesn&apos;t say much to anyone.</string>
<string name="22207">You might want to talk to him. Maybe try and loosen him up a bit. I have no worries about you, not after that show of stamina.</string>
<string name="22208">The auction has been delayed twice... What the hell. If there&apos;s a cure, I want it NOW!</string>
<string name="22209">You know... there&apos;s not a single Vengaul loyalist in the room... I wonder if he&apos;s even here.</string>
<string name="22210">Callik ain&apos;t here, is he? He doesn&apos;t like this one bit, I hear. Must be getting tired of being in Vengaul&apos;s shadow.</string>
<string name="22211">I heard Vengaul&apos;s on the way out. Too flashy. Wants everything to be a grand adventure. Glory hound.</string>
<string name="22212">Last I saw Vengaul he was carrying some kinda cage. Why&apos;s he walking his pets when there&apos;s business to be done?</string>
<string name="22213">I heard it&apos;s just part of a cure. Gotta have the means to process it. Some thug buys it and it&apos;ll go to waste.</string>
<string name="22214">I bet there ain&apos;t no cure. I mean, how did Vengaul get a cure when Nasher and them can&apos;t?</string>
<string name="22215">Vengaul better not be telling his damned stories again. You don&apos;t jerk around a city full of the dying.</string>
<string name="22216">I sold everything. All of it. This better be a cure. I&apos;m ruined if it isn&apos;t. I&apos;m dead if it isn&apos;t.</string>
<string name="22217">I wish the damn thing would start. Have they got the goods or not?</string>
<string name="22218">Auction turned out to be a bust. Guess us simple thugs are stuck to die of the plague.</string>
<string name="22219">Callik is gone. Looks like Vengaul is sticking around as leader after all. Never had my doubts... no sir... </string>
<string name="22220">Who are you? What do you do?</string>
<string name="22221">Who is you? What you do?</string>
<string name="22222">You wish a password?</string>
<string name="22223">You want password?</string>
<string name="22224">Can I ask about the Tavern and what&apos;s below it?</string>
<string name="22225">Me maybe ask about Tavern and what&apos;s under it?</string>
<string name="22226">The password is &quot;Cornerstone.&quot;</string>
<string name="22227">Password is &quot;Cornerstone,&quot; or something.</string>
<string name="22228">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; If you don&apos;t care, how about just forgetting it?</string>
<string name="22229">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; If you think this silly, how about we just forget it?</string>
<string name="22230">Well, handsome, maybe we can... work something out?</string>
<string name="22231">Aw, come on handsome. Pretty please let me through?</string>
<string name="22232">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22233">Will some gold make you forget you need a password?</string>
<string name="22234">Maybe you take gold and forget you need password?</string>
<string name="22235">You&apos;ll let me pass or I&apos;ll feed you your spine!</string>
<string name="22236">You let me pass or me kill you!</string>
<string name="22237">I don&apos;t know the password.</string>
<string name="22238">Me not know password. </string>
<string name="22239">How about 50 gold to look the other way?</string>
<string name="22240">You take 50 gold to forget me?</string>
<string name="22241">How about 100 gold to look the other way?</string>
<string name="22242">You take 100 gold to forget me?</string>
<string name="22243">200 gold should get you to forget me, hmm?</string>
<string name="22244">You forget me for 200 gold, maybe?</string>
<string name="22245">I was only testing. I meant nothing by it.</string>
<string name="22246">Me just kidding. Me a kidder.</string>
<string name="22247">All right, someone better tell me why that door&apos;s been opened, or so help me, I&apos;ll have the guards in here real fast!</string>
<string name="22248">Now don&apos;t go bothering me. I didn&apos;t want this job and I don&apos;t need this job. Just say the password and get moving, like all the rest.</string>
<string name="22249">Right, so who opened that door? I can&apos;t let anyone through without the password, whether they have a key or not.</string>
<string name="22250">Don&apos;t bother me, all right? I did my part with the door and I don&apos;t care who goes through now.</string>
<string name="22251">Of course, it&apos;s not like I care that much. Why they got the chef to guard this stupid door, I&apos;ll never know.</string>
<string name="22252">Who, me? I&apos;m the chef, and these Bloodsailors have me guarding the door because they&apos;ve lost too many regular members to the plague.</string>
<string name="22253">None of it matters to me. I&apos;d rather be cooking. Now, if you have the password, you&apos;d better spit it out.</string>
<string name="22254">Yes, fool, a password. If that door gets opened before I&apos;ve heard a password, I&apos;m supposed to call the guards. Now, out with it.</string>
<string name="22255">Don&apos;t bother me again. It&apos;s bad enough I have to stand around here all day.</string>
<string name="22256">Look, I&apos;m just the chef. I&apos;m replacing a Bloodsailor that died of plague. If you have business downstairs, fine. Just give me the password and go.</string>
<string name="22257">And don&apos;t ask me about any key or whatnot. If you know the password then you&apos;ll have your own damn key. I don&apos;t have one.</string>
<string name="22258">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You know, I think you are right. To hell with this password crap. I&apos;m no guard! I&apos;m no doorman!</string>
<string name="22259">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I don&apos;t think that would be the best thing for me to do. I&apos;m no guard, but these Bloodsailors are rough customers.</string>
<string name="22260">Right, good enough for me. In fact, that&apos;s good enough for the night. Anyone else with you, they can go on in as well.</string>
<string name="22261">I&apos;m done with caring about their stupid door. I did my part, and now I&apos;m done.</string>
<string name="22262">You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I&apos;ll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.</string>
<string name="22263">What? No thank you! I&apos;m not fighting over this! Guards! Guards!</string>
<string name="22264">They can watch their own bloody doors. Damn right.</string>
<string name="22265">Of course, you&apos;ll still need to open the door. I don&apos;t know nothing about that. If you should be down there, you probably have your own key.</string>
<string name="22266">Then you are... not supposed to be here? Son of a... ! Guards! I was just supposed to watch the door! I&apos;m not fighting anyone!</string>
<string name="22267">Then get lost, and don&apos;t bother me again. If you don&apos;t know the password, then you aren&apos;t supposed to be here.</string>
<string name="22268">I don&apos;t know about that. The fact that you need to ask means you shouldn&apos;t be here.</string>
<string name="22269">Does that mean you know the password or not?</string>
<string name="22270">Well now, I&apos;ve never been able to say no to a pretty face. Ah, what the hell. I&apos;m no guard. Why did they even ask me to do this?</string>
<string name="22271">No offense, madam, but... I work around food a lot and I can&apos;t afford to lose my appetite.</string>
<string name="22272">I don&apos;t like you much. In fact, I think that offer is an insult... can you do better?</string>
<string name="22273">I guess that would be all right. I kind of like you, and what am I doing guarding a door anyway? I&apos;m a chef!</string>
<string name="22274">You know, since that door is already open, you are probably in a lot of trouble if you don&apos;t know the password.</string>
<string name="22275">No, I don&apos;t think I want to risk my neck for that amount. I don&apos;t much like you. Can you do better?</string>
<string name="22276">I think that would suffice. I mean, why are they asking me to guard the door anyway? I&apos;m a chef. A chef!</string>
<string name="22277">You have a deal, you unsightly thug! What the hell are they doing asking me to guard the door anyway? I&apos;m a chef!</string>
<string name="22278">I think that would be a good deal. I mean, why are they asking me to guard the door, anyway? I&apos;m a chef!</string>
<string name="22279">I think your offer should get a lot better. Yes, I think this is worth a lot more to you.</string>
<string name="22280">I think that&apos;s a little low. I&apos;m getting the feeling that you shouldn&apos;t be here, and my looking away is worth more than that.</string>
<string name="22281">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="22282">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="22283">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22284">Anything odd happening here?</string>
<string name="22285">You know odd things about here?</string>
<string name="22286">I want to ask about the Bloodsailors.</string>
<string name="22287">I want to ask about the auction.</string>
<string name="22288">Me ask about Bloodsailor guys.</string>
<string name="22289">Me ask about auction.</string>
<string name="22290">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="22291">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You tell me and it okay. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="22292">Know anything about the plague?</string>
<string name="22293">You knows stuff about plague?</string>
<string name="22294">What locations are important in the Docks district?</string>
<string name="22295">Where important places in Docks?</string>
<string name="22296">Tell me about the Seedy Tavern.</string>
<string name="22297">Tell me about the Golden Apple.</string>
<string name="22298">Tell me about the Twenty in a Quiver.</string>
<string name="22299">I&apos;m looking for basic services. General stuff.</string>
<string name="22300">What you know about Seedy place?</string>
<string name="22301">You tells about Golden Apple.</string>
<string name="22302">You tells about Twenty in the Quiver.</string>
<string name="22303">Me look for all kinds of stuff. Service stuff.</string>
<string name="22304">I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="22305">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="22306">Back to my questions about locations.</string>
<string name="22307">Back to stuff about places.</string>
<string name="22308">What do you mean when you say &quot;strange?&quot;</string>
<string name="22309">What you mean, &quot;strange?&quot;</string>
<string name="22310">We both have &lt;race&gt; blood. Why not give me a break?</string>
<string name="22311">Me &lt;race&gt; blood like you. You tell me, okay?</string>
<string name="22312">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; You tell me, okay, nice man? You really nice man.</string>
<string name="22313">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, handsome. You can tell me, can&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="22314">Tell me about Vengaul.</string>
<string name="22315">You tell about Vengaul.</string>
<string name="22316">Tell me about Callik.</string>
<string name="22317">You tell about Callik.</string>
<string name="22318">Is that why he&apos;s not here tonight?</string>
<string name="22319">That why Vengaul not here?</string>
<string name="22320">Does he have the backing to do that?</string>
<string name="22321">He gots support for that? That a big fight.</string>
<string name="22322">Where is his house?</string>
<string name="22323">Where Callik&apos;s house be?</string>
<string name="22324">Well met, friend. Fine night in the inn, eh. Right busy, it is.</string>
<string name="22325">Good on you. See you around.</string>
<string name="22326">All right then. Farewell.</string>
<string name="22327">Good riddance to bad rubbish.</string>
<string name="22328">Can you understand my answers? You seem a bit slow.</string>
<string name="22329">I&apos;ve the time, sure enough. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="22330">Eh, if you make it quick.</string>
<string name="22331">Bah, make it quick and get lost.</string>
<string name="22332">Well, just look around you. Bloodsailors looking all rough, some auction thing taking too long, and damned if I have seen any Bloodsailor brass here all night.</string>
<string name="22333">Their business ain&apos;t my concern, especially their infighting... I really shouldn&apos;t say any more. I don&apos;t swim well, especially in a sack filled with rocks.</string>
<string name="22334">Nobody seems to know what was going to happen here. Vengaul Bloodsail himself was organizing it, but he&apos;s late. It may be cancelled.</string>
<string name="22335">Well, concentrate hard and maybe you&apos;ll remember what I say.</string>
<string name="22336">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you&apos;re right. They are probably too busy to worry about me telling tales anyway.</string>
<string name="22337">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but I&apos;m just not getting involved. Callik wants to challenge Vengaul, that&apos;s his business, not mine and not yours.</string>
<string name="22338">What do you want? Come on now, I&apos;ve got time if you&apos;re quick.</string>
<string name="22339">Go on, why are you bothering me? I&apos;ve no interest in you.</string>
<string name="22340">No, and I don&apos;t care to. I ain&apos;t even thinking about it. Of course, I guess I showed up here... well, we&apos;re all here for strange reasons.</string>
<string name="22341">Ain&apos;t much anywhere now. Plague shut most things down. I suppose you can ask, but there ain&apos;t much I can tell you.</string>
<string name="22342">Will my answers help? You sound like you would get lost a lot.</string>
<string name="22343">The Golden Apple? A fine little tavern. Not much happens there, though. The Seedy Tavern is where you want to be for action.</string>
<string name="22344">Eh, it&apos;s the only place that&apos;s doing any business now. Lots of this and that, though most of the black market stuff there ends up here. </string>
<string name="22345">Eh, you&apos;ll be stuck shopping here or the Twenty in a Quiver. Most other places are gone because of the plague.</string>
<string name="22346">This place? This is where everything happens. It&apos;s where they usually set up the black market, but things are a little strange right now.</string>
<string name="22347">There&apos;s still the Golden Apple and the Twenty in a Quiver. A couple other places, I guess. I just stay here at the Seedy, myself.</string>
<string name="22348">All right. Where did you want to ask about?</string>
<string name="22349">The Golden Apple is in the northwest of the district if you are interested. That puts it southwest of here.</string>
<string name="22350">It&apos;s a little southeast of the Seedy Tavern here. Kinda middle northeast of the district, I guess.</string>
<string name="22351">You&apos;ll have to go to the City Core if you are looking for things like temples and mage towers.</string>
<string name="22352">Well, I suppose there&apos;s not really any harm in me talking with you. I can just lay low a while if I get myself in trouble.</string>
<string name="22353">Ugh... no thank you, madam, I really am not interested in... discussing this with you. If Callik wants to challenge Vengaul, that&apos;s his business.</string>
<string name="22354">I suppose I could say a few things. I&apos;ll just lay low for a while after so I don&apos;t get in trouble.</string>
<string name="22355">You are a pretty one, aren&apos;t you. Not the brightest star in the sky, but still a sparkler. I&apos;ll talk with you a while.</string>
<string name="22356">The Bloodsailors weren&apos;t always a rough group to deal with, but things have changed. Callik isn&apos;t letting Vengaul&apos;s decisions go unchallenged anymore.</string>
<string name="22357">I heard that there was a plague cure for sale. Rumors were all over, and I think some people were afraid the guards would hear.</string>
<string name="22358">I don&apos;t know how they didn&apos;t. It was like Vengaul wanted them to know. He&apos;s flashy. A risk taker. Some of his men don&apos;t like it.</string>
<string name="22359">All of his plans usually involve getting as much notice as possible. He&apos;s more concerned with image than profit. That doesn&apos;t please some of his men.</string>
<string name="22360">Ah, the well-loved leader and founder of the Bloodsailors. Well, not so well-loved these days, I hear. See, he likes to show off.</string>
<string name="22361">I hear he&apos;s been getting some trouble from his officers. They want to be a little more rough, and a lot less flashy.</string>
<string name="22362">Callik... well, Callik is not a nice man. He&apos;s much more concerned with gold than he is with any show of bravado or style.</string>
<string name="22363">He&apos;s very efficient getting gold out of his victims, but he&apos;s a hard man to work for. If not for Vengaul, he&apos;d be even worse.</string>
<string name="22364">Some of the Bloodsailors prefer working for him, and I think it&apos;s getting to the point where he&apos;s going to challenge Vengaul.</string>
<string name="22365">Oh, the Vengaul I know likes confrontation. He wouldn&apos;t run from a fight. I think whatever was supposed to happen up here has been changed.</string>
<string name="22366">Ain&apos;t my business, like I said, but I saw some of Callik&apos;s boys going downstairs, and now the basement is locked up tight.</string>
<string name="22367"> Something is going on... I just don&apos;t know what.</string>
<string name="22368">Callik is pretty powerful right now. A lot of the Bloodsailors wouldn&apos;t mind making a little more profit instead of playing for show.</string>
<string name="22369">In fact, Callik has taken over running the black market. He&apos;s one of the few guys I&apos;ve seen with a key to get downstairs.</string>
<string name="22370">I thought he&apos;d be here. Not like him to sit in his house while something is happening. He&apos;d really like to embarrass Vengaul.</string>
<string name="22371">Hmm? I think it was in the far northeast corner of the district. I wouldn&apos;t go poking around there, though. Not unless you want trouble.</string>
<string name="22372">Can I ask questions about who you are?</string>
<string name="22373">Me ask about who you am?</string>
<string name="22374">Could I ask you something about this tavern?</string>
<string name="22375">Me ask something about this bar place?</string>
<string name="22376">I&apos;ll be leaving.</string>
<string name="22377">Me go now.</string>
<string name="22378">Who are you?</string>
<string name="22379">Who is you?</string>
<string name="22380">What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="22381">What you doing here?</string>
<string name="22382">What was that about the Bloodsailors?</string>
<string name="22383">What about Bloodsailors?</string>
<string name="22384">Do you know what is planned for downstairs?</string>
<string name="22385">What happening downstairs?</string>
<string name="22386">Have you noticed anything odd around here?</string>
<string name="22387">You seen strange stuff around here?</string>
<string name="22388">Back to the inn... anything strange?</string>
<string name="22389">Back to inn stuff. Anything strange here?</string>
<string name="22390">Why is that so bad? What&apos;s in Scurrd?</string>
<string name="22391">Why that bad? What in Scurrd stuff?</string>
<string name="22392">Why not?</string>
<string name="22393">What not make sense?</string>
<string name="22394">The auction won&apos;t go ahead?</string>
<string name="22395">Auction not happening?</string>
<string name="22396">How do I get down there?</string>
<string name="22397">How me get down there?</string>
<string name="22398">Thanks. Er, how did you know all of this?</string>
<string name="22399">Thanks and stuff. Hey, how you know this, anyway?</string>
<string name="22400">Greetings and well met. Come to sit a bit in the heat, have you? Good for the skin.</string>
<string name="22401">A shame. I hope the &lt;day/night&gt; treats you well. Come back anytime.</string>
<string name="22402">Oh, by all means. I&apos;d like that.</string>
<string name="22403">I suppose. I spend most of my time here, now. Waiting out the plague, you see. Could be in worse places, I wager.</string>
<string name="22404">Ulfnog is my given name. It is unremarkable to your ears, no doubt, but I quite like it. It serves me well.</string>
<string name="22405">Enjoying the heat, as I said. And the dark. It is quite pleasant in here once the door is closed. It shuts out the world.</string>
<string name="22406">I don&apos;t much like the bustle downstairs. Them Bloodsailors are far too serious these days. They used to be... well, I&apos;m droning on.</string>
<string name="22407">I am a traveler. Unfortunately I happened to be in Neverwinter when the plague began. I haven&apos;t stepped outside this inn for weeks.</string>
<string name="22408">Well, it&apos;s just that they used to be more fun. They had a right nonsensical bent to them that kept you on your toes.</string>
<string name="22409">I know the plague probably has something to do with that, but there&apos;s more. It&apos;s like their leaders are taking them in a new direction.</string>
<string name="22410">Ah, I&apos;ve just had too much time to dwell on it, stuck here hiding from the plague. What do I care how uptight they get?</string>
<string name="22411">Hello again. The heat draw you back? It keeps me here and happy, let me tell you.</string>
<string name="22412">You realize you are asking a half-naked dwarf in a hot-room what he thinks is strange, don&apos;t you? My answer could be hopelessly skewed.</string>
<string name="22413">Hmm? Some fool auction, I think. I even heard there was some part of a cure on the block. Doesn&apos;t make sense, though... </string>
<string name="22414">Odd or strange? Well, them Bloodsailors have an unwholesome attachment to their ale. Not good dwarven ale, mind you, but foul and perverse mixings.</string>
<string name="22415">Not that you could appreciate what I mean. Hell, you&apos;re the crazy fool that drank the Scurrd. Gods help anyone who willingly drinks the Scurrd.</string>
<string name="22416">I mean, they actually convinced someone to drink Scurrd. Scurrd! That&apos;ll take the tar off their shingles!</string>
<string name="22417">I&apos;d stay away from that Jalek down there, myself. He likes the hard stuff, and I mean hard to take.</string>
<string name="22418">If I won&apos;t drink it, what makes you think I&apos;ll sully my mouth discussing it? Scurrd is Scurrd. That&apos;s all that should need be said.</string>
<string name="22419">Changes... shakeups... the Bloodsailors are upside-down. Some are allowed in the basement now, and some aren&apos;t. Almost like they&apos;ve split in two.</string>
<string name="22420">Well, why is the auction here? Something like that would command a huge price. Why bother with the thugs that gathered their coppers?</string>
<string name="22421">I mean, if you expect a big bidder, the only reason to have the auction here is to have all the people see who that bidder is.</string>
<string name="22422">I think someone was trying to show off, and now it looks like the show has been cancelled.</string>
<string name="22423">Don&apos;t think so. Vengaul Bloodsail himself was supposedly behind it, and he&apos;s late. Very late... and there&apos;s some other odd things... </string>
<string name="22424">I think there&apos;s been a shift in power. Vengaul hasn&apos;t been seen for a bit and... well, there&apos;s some questionable things happening in the basement.</string>
<string name="22425">Do they still have their poor chef guarding the door? I bet he doesn&apos;t appreciate his pantry being locked up any more than I do.</string>
<string name="22426">Not a lot happening in the tavern now, what with the shakeup in the Bloodsailors over. Nice and quiet in the dark.</string>
<string name="22427">I overheard the password to get by him. You&apos;ll still need a key or some stout picks, though. They don&apos;t even let him open the door himself.</string>
<string name="22428">The password is &quot;Cornerstone.&quot; At least it ain&apos;t some maryweather pompous nickname or somebody&apos;s dog. I hate it when thugs get cute like that.</string>
<string name="22429">You can learn a lot in a small dark room. Don&apos;t let anyone tell you different.</string>
<string name="22430">The current is too strong to return the way you came.</string>

<string name="22478">What&apos;s the big problem? You were going to auction the thing yourself!</string>
<string name="22479">I won&apos;t let you squander this opportunity! That thing is worth a fortune!</string>
<string name="22480">Cur! Bounder! You are not half the man your father was!</string>
<string name="22481">There is a great commotion from the passage ahead. The sounds of a battle ring loud against the stone.</string>
<string name="22482">Don&apos;t you start with that, old man! This is just about business!</string>
<string name="22483">Life is measured by more than wealth, my boy. A well schemed plot keeps your name in the history books!</string>
<string name="22484">That was showmanship. Make them think the prize is lost and they respect you all the more when they get it.</string>
<string name="22485">What is this, Vengaul? More of your old guard? Loyalists?</string>
<string name="22486">Er... yes! Yes, this is my second wave, come to fight you! Adventurers all, we will defeat you!</string>
<string name="22487">I don&apos;t care who they are! Your foolish rule is over tonight!</string>
<string name="22488">Who the devil are you?</string>
<string name="22489">At them! Yes, that&apos;s the spirit!</string>
<string name="22490">Vengaul Bloodsail has got your back! Arrows away!</string>
<string name="22491">Let nothing stop you! Callik is a whelp of a man!</string>
<string name="22492">Yes, fight with all your skill!</string>
<string name="22493">Yes.</string>
<string name="22494">No.</string>
<string name="22495">Take the boat downstream?</string>
<string name="22496">Your actions caused no end of chaos!</string>
<string name="22497">You&apos;ll be paying a high price this time. I can&apos;t let you live.</string>
<string name="22498">Just trying to intimidate you a bit. No harm meant.</string>
<string name="22499">You&apos;ve hurt too many people with this. </string>
<string name="22500">Sounds like Nasher would appreciate you being dead.</string>
<string name="22501">Just for a laugh, really.</string>
<string name="22502">I demand you give me the Waterdhavian creature! And your weapons!</string>
<string name="22503">Now you&apos;ll hand it over for the good of everyone.</string>
<string name="22504">You have something that doesn&apos;t belong to you.</string>
<string name="22505">I&apos;ve come for the Cockatrice, Vengaul.</string>
<string name="22506">Very well. Get going then.</string>
<string name="22507">Me want the cocka... the cuckoo... the birdy!</string>
<string name="22508">You have something not yours!</string>
<string name="22509">You cause trouble fooling around!</string>
<string name="22510">Best for everyone if you hand it over now!</string>
<string name="22511">You give me Waterdhavi-creature! And your weapons!</string>
<string name="22512">I not let you live this time.</string>
<string name="22513">Just joking, really.</string>
<string name="22514">Maybe Nasher like you dead.</string>
<string name="22515">You hurt too many with this!</string>
<string name="22516">Me just toy with you. No harm meant.</string>
<string name="22517">Okay. You get going then.</string>
<string name="22518">Well fought! You have proven quite the force, defeating Callik like that. The lad was giving me trouble. No sense of style.</string>
<string name="22519">Still, I gather from your well-fortified self that I am in further trouble, am I not?</string>
<string name="22520">Nonsense. I merely issued a statement or two. How people choose to react to that is not my concern.</string>
<string name="22521">I stumbled upon the remains of a fine little bird that Nasher and his lackeys carelessly lost. Imagine my surprise at seeing some dog in the street carrying it. I merely wished to put it to good use.</string>
<string name="22522">That&apos;s a blanketing statement. Why, may I ask, do you deem it necessary to kill me?</string>
<string name="22523">Well, a great deal of harm was taken. I&apos;ll just take my leave. You&apos;ll find what you need in my absence, I am sure.</string>
<string name="22524">That wasn&apos;t my doing. Desperate people do desperate things. Would you kill the baker if they rioted over bread?</string>
<string name="22525">You&apos;ll pardon me if I just leave? My lieutenants will more than oblige your bloodlust. The spoils of victory to the winners!</string>
<string name="22526">You don&apos;t know the old boy like I do. We&apos;ve been at each other&apos;s throats for years. He&apos;d not want me caged or dead.</string>
<string name="22527">This whole thing would have been an insult, to be sure, but deep inside, Nasher likes these little confrontations</string>
<string name="22528">&quot;Just for a laugh&quot; then, I&apos;ll do my best to escape. I&apos;ve no reason to die here. Not when I would&apos;ve returned the beast anyway.</string>
<string name="22529">The remains of the creature are in a crate. Send it to Nasher with my regards, though I doubt he&apos;ll have time for a scoundrel like you.</string>
<string name="22530">My weapons? You are certainly intent on making this a conflict. Very well, my friend, a fight you shall have.</string>
<string name="22531">Of course I will. Oh, don&apos;t look so surprised. What am I going to do with some mangy bird? Besides, I know full well how important the feathers of this beast are.</string>
<string name="22532">My fun was in making Nasher want it. Since he won&apos;t play and my men have largely abandoned me, the ruse is over.</string>
<string name="22533">The remains of the beast are in a crate. Take the feathers, and my blessings. I have friends suffering from the plague too, you know. Nasher knows who I mean.</string>
<string name="22534">I suppose from your perspective you are correct. Since you are the dominant force in the room, I bow to your wisdom.</string>
<string name="22535">Of course, of course. I expected as much, though I was also hoping that Nasher would make an appearance. </string>
<string name="22536">As you will. Farewell, my friend. Our paths will cross again, I am sure.</string>
<string name="22537"></string>
<string name="22538"></string>
<string name="22539"></string>
<string name="22540"></string>
<string name="22541"></string>
<string name="22542"></string>
<string name="22543">I&apos;m keeping my eye on you.</string>
<string name="22544">The Silver Sails Trading Company. No Entry! Vermin Infestation.</string>
<string name="22545">Is Lord Nasher well?</string>
<string name="22546">What needs to be done?</string>
<string name="22547">Farewell for now.</string>
<string name="22548">Spare me your lies. He is either deathly ill or dead.</string>
<string name="22549">I suppose I am still restricted from entering the castle?</string>
<string name="22550">Tell Lord Nasher that I wish him a speedy recovery.</string>
<string name="22551">I have another Waterdhavian creature. Do you want it?</string>
<string name="22552">Nasher has shown no interest in me. He remains hidden.</string>
<string name="22553">Farewell, then.</string>
<string name="22554">Perhaps I could speak with Lord Nasher?</string>
<string name="22555">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is Lord Nasher not well?</string>
<string name="22556">I found a Waterdhavian creature. Where should I take this?</string>
<string name="22557">Can you tell me anything about the plague?</string>
<string name="22558">Does he fear the plague so much?</string>
<string name="22559">I have just joined his service under Aribeth.</string>
<string name="22560">Me serve! Lemme in!</string>
<string name="22561">Scaredy-cat. Worry &apos;bout plague like baby.</string>
<string name="22562">Me need ask about sick. </string>
<string name="22563">Me find thingy! Water-whosian animal! Where does me take it?</string>
<string name="22564">Me gots another Water-whosian animal! You want?</string>
<string name="22565">Me speak with Big Nasher?</string>
<string name="22566">Bah! Nasher no-show!</string>
<string name="22567">I go bye bye thens.</string>
<string name="22568">Give him wishes to gets better.</string>
<string name="22569">Now let me enter big castle?</string>
<string name="22570">He probably dead. You big liar.</string>
<string name="22571">What left to do?</string>
<string name="22572">Nasher still sick or better?</string>
<string name="22573">I goodbye now.</string>
<string name="22574">The four creatures! All four of the Waterdhavian creatures have been returned! Aribeth has them now! If this was your doing, we owe you a great debt!</string>
<string name="22575">Please, don&apos;t waste time speaking with me. Return to Aribeth as soon as you are ready to proceed. The cure awaits!</string>
<string name="22576">I don&apos;t know... he was so weak. I know they were working on the cure, but I didn&apos;t hear how it turned out.</string>
<string name="22577">That&apos;s when all the hells broke loose. I hope they are all right.</string>
<string name="22578">You need to go speak to Aribeth. Honestly, I don&apos;t know how you can stand around here delaying the cure after spending so much effort collecting the components!</string>
<string name="22579">I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to get anxious, but we are so close. Please, go to Aribeth as soon as you are ready.</string>
<string name="22580">You have done much for Neverwinter. Please see this through.</string>
<string name="22581">Three of the Waterdhavian creatures have been returned to Aribeth. Fenthick and Desther assure us that we are close to a cure!</string>
<string name="22582">Lord Nasher will be among the first to sample it, of course. His rejuvenation will inspire people... They need inspiring.</string>
<string name="22583">I will not waste your time, &lt;FullName&gt;. Lord Nasher feels you have proven too valuable to harass with idle chatter. </string>
<string name="22584">For his health, and for everyone in Neverwinter... please continue your efforts.</string>
<string name="22585"></string>
<string name="22586">Hello. Word of your deeds has spread. Nasher might have even stooped to meeting with you, but he is... under the weather.</string>
<string name="22587">As I have indicated, it must remain closed for fear of the plague. This is for your safety, and others... </string>
<string name="22588">As you may have gathered, we do not fear the plague getting in, so much as... getting out.</string>
<string name="22589">Of course. Your efforts mean we are closer than ever to a cure... not that Lord Nasher has the... </string>
<string name="22590">*sigh* Only the closest to him know the extent of his sickness. If the people knew... </string>
<string name="22591">He wishes that the people not see him in this... condition. You understand, I hope? They have enough to fear.</string>
<string name="22592">Continue your efforts, please. We need all the help we can get in these dark times.</string>
<string name="22593"></string>
<string name="22594">I know of you. You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, and your actions have helped Neverwinter. Strange that your manner is so unpleasant. </string>
<string name="22595">Lord Nasher appreciates your efforts. He would tell you himself, if he were able. You&apos;ll just have to accept my word.</string>
<string name="22596">I have not been instructed as to the proper handling of such things. Aribeth is who you should talk to. </string>
<string name="22597">I assure you that Lord Nasher would like nothing more than to greet all those that have entered his service.</string>
<string name="22598">Unfortunately, matters of state keep him isolated, for now. He is very involved in the search for a cure.</string>
<string name="22599">Keep up the good work. Perhaps... perhaps you will become one of our more trusted allies yet.</string>
<string name="22600">That&apos;s not possible. The castle must remain quaran... eh... that is, Lord Nasher is very involved in the search for a cure.</string>
<string name="22601">Lord Nasher is... otherwise occupied with plague matters. I&apos;m sorry, but I can&apos;t say any more than that for now.</string>
<string name="22602">As I have said, only the proven allies of Neverwinter will have access to the castle in this dark time.</string>
<string name="22603">Back! Castle Never is closed by order of Lord Nasher. Not like you rabble would be graced with an audience anyway.</string>
<string name="22604">To protect the castle against plague it is closed to all but Lady Aribeth. That is all I can say.</string>
<string name="22605">I doubt you have such a thing. Aribeth and Desther are organizing the search for the beasts. Take it to her.</string>
<string name="22606">I can&apos;t say anything more. To ease panic, only our proven allies are kept briefed on the state of affairs.</string>
<string name="22607">Stand down, citizen. Castle Never is sealed by order of Lord Nasher. No one is allowed within.</string>
<string name="22608">On Lord Nasher&apos;s behalf I welcome you to the gates of Castle Never. Unfortunately, however, I cannot allow you entry.</string>
<string name="22609">I doubt YOU would have such a thing. Take whatever mongrel beast you&apos;ve found to Aribeth and Desther. They will know what to do with it.</string>
<string name="22610">By the gods, you sound dim! Look, I&apos;ll say this slowly and unnecessarily loud: ONLY TRUSTED PEOPLE ALLOWED IN.</string>
<string name="22611">Greetings to you! I have heard well of you, &lt;FullName&gt;. Your actions help Neverwinter no end.</string>
<string name="22612">Hmm... &lt;FullName&gt;, isn&apos;t it? Word on the street is you have been helping Neverwinter through this crisis.</string>
<string name="22613">Can you even grasp our situation? The plague is already in the castle. Nasher has proven just as vulnerable as everyone else.</string>
<string name="22614">Er, yes, you leave. Keep up the good work and... try not to forget how to breathe or something.</string>
<string name="22615">Greetings. Nasher would offer thanks to you in person if he were able, but he is... under the weather.</string>
<string name="22616">&lt;FullName&gt;! Lord Nasher offers thanks for your actions, and regrets that he can&apos;t greet you personally. He is... under the weather.</string>
<string name="22617">We rest our hopes on the dimmest of lights. Oh well, do what you can.</string>
<string name="22618">What are you, a complete moron? Don&apos;t just stand here like an idiot! You&apos;ve collected the components! Get back to Aribeth so they can start on the cure!</string>
<string name="22619">I need to ask a few questions.</string>
<string name="22620">Can you maybe answer questions for me?</string>
<string name="22621">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22622">How bad the plague be in here?</string>
<string name="22623">What do you know about all the zombies?</string>
<string name="22624">I need infomation about the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="22625">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="22626">You knows anything about walking dead guys?</string>
<string name="22627">Me wants information about Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="22628">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="22629">When did they first start showing up?</string>
<string name="22630">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="22631">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="22632">How bad has the effect of the plague been?</string>
<string name="22633">Are there any safe places?</string>
<string name="22634">Where is there safe places?</string>
<string name="22635">Anything strange besides the plague and undead then?</string>
<string name="22636">Okay, so anything besides plague and undead?</string>
<string name="22637">What do you know about the gang?</string>
<string name="22638">What you knows about gang?</string>
<string name="22639">What do you know about the cult?</string>
<string name="22640">What you know about cult?</string>
<string name="22641">Tell me about the Shining Serpent.</string>
<string name="22642">Tell about Shining Serpent place.</string>
<string name="22643">Tell me about the Helmite shrine.</string>
<string name="22644">Tell about Helmite shrine.</string>
<string name="22645">When they start not being all dead?</string>
<string name="22646">Anything strange happen around that time?</string>
<string name="22647">You sees strange things around then, maybe?</string>
<string name="22648">Not to be questioning someone with the manner of a noble, but... may I ask why you have entered me home?</string>
<string name="22649">What do you want? I ain&apos;t looking for a fight, friend, so please don&apos;t hurt me.</string>
<string name="22650">What do you want? You&apos;ve the look of a bandit to you, so... uh... please don&apos;t hurt me.</string>
<string name="22651">I suppose I can try, if it will get you to leave. Should I speak slow, or maybe use hand signals...?</string>
<string name="22652">If that will get you to leave without hurting me, I will answer what I can.</string>
<string name="22653">I don&apos;t want to know anything about any walking dead. That is just... it&apos;s not right! </string>
<string name="22654">I guess... I guess it was not that long ago... the plague had been going for a month, I think. I&apos;ve kind of lost track of the days, though.</string>
<string name="22655">Goodbye. Please, leave me in peace.</string>
<string name="22656">That&apos;s it? Couldn&apos;t you just... wander around, or something? What do you need to know?</string>
<string name="22657">Now there&apos;s dead people walking around. Dead people! What is someone like me supposed to do about that?</string>
<string name="22658">This is the &quot;poor district,&quot; so when plague first broke out, we were pretty much just walled in. No notice was really taken until it spread outside.</string>
<string name="22659">What do you want me to say? I haven&apos;t seen much of anything. I&apos;ve been boarded up in here, trying not to get the plague.</string>
<string name="22660">How can you ask that? What kind of life do you lead where plague and walking dead are no longer strange? </string>
<string name="22661">Some sort of plague-y undead-walky town, that&apos;s where you live. &lt;He/She&gt; asks me what&apos;s strange besides plague and undead... yeesh.</string>
<string name="22662">Something strange *other* than plague and undead? I never thought I would be considering something like that, but... maybe... </string>
<string name="22663">The Beggar&apos;s Nest has its share of strange people. Just plain mean ones too. There&apos;s a gang that&apos;s always been a problem. And a cult.</string>
<string name="22664">They call themselves the Sword Coast Boys. Copperthieves, mostly. No real troublemakers... except maybe for that Drawl guy. </string>
<string name="22665">He is their leader, but for all I know, they could all be dead to plague. They used to hang out in the north end of the Nest, I think.</string>
<string name="22666">Nothing, and I don&apos;t want to know anything. Bunch of Cyric worshippers, I think. Not a sane one in the bunch.</string>
<string name="22667">Don&apos;t know what&apos;s happened to them in this plague. I wouldn&apos;t feel bad about losing them, though.</string>
<string name="22668">Well, until you barged in I thought my home was safe. I suppose you mean places where the zombies can&apos;t go?</string>
<string name="22669">The Shining Serpent might be all right. The Helmite shrine might be good too. I don&apos;t know for sure. I&apos;ve been in here for days.</string>
<string name="22670">I don&apos;t go there much. Can&apos;t afford to. Nice place. I&apos;d bet they have some decent defenses up. Harben Ashensmith takes quite the interest in it.</string>
<string name="22671">Harben is the man to talk to if you actually want to do something in this district. The Shining Serpent is in the south central area of the Nest.</string>
<string name="22672">Don&apos;t know much about it. It used to be a communal shrine to whatever god you would like to appease that day.</string>
<string name="22673">Just after the plague began, the Helmites arrived and set up shop. I would guess that it&apos;s safe. It&apos;s holy ground, after all.</string>
<string name="22674">The shrine is in the south east area of the Nest, not too far from the Shining Serpent, actually.</string>
<string name="22675">We&apos;ve lost a lot of people, but I guess it&apos;s bad in other areas now too, so we&apos;re all in the same boat.</string>
<string name="22676">I just stay in here, trying not to get too close to people. I didn&apos;t even let the Helmites in. You... you I doubt I could stop even if I wanted.</string>
<string name="22677">I guess there was something... I think... I remember. A bunch of guards did a search of the area one day. They were looking for something.</string>
<string name="22678">They never said what, but I got the feeling it was an animal or something. They had cages. That&apos;s all I know.</string>
<string name="22679">Seems pretty safe all over, now. Something took care of all the zombies, that&apos;s for sure. I gotta thank whoever it was.</string>
<string name="22680">I know they are gone, and that&apos;s enough for me. I don&apos;t care who or what got rid of them, but I&apos;m grateful.</string>
<string name="22681">At least the zombies have stopped. I don&apos;t know who took care of that, but I&apos;m grateful.</string>
<string name="22682">I need to ask a few questions.</string>
<string name="22683">Can yous maybe answer questions for me?</string>
<string name="22684">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22685">How bad is plague here?</string>
<string name="22686">Can you tell me anything about the zombies?</string>
<string name="22687">I wanted to ask about the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="22688">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="22689">You tells anything about walking dead guys?</string>
<string name="22690">Me want ask about Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="22691">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="22692">When did they first start showing up?</string>
<string name="22693">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="22694">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="22695">Has the effect of the plague been bad here?</string>
<string name="22696">Are there any safe places?</string>
<string name="22697">Where is there safe places?</string>
<string name="22698">Anything strange besides the plague and undead then?</string>
<string name="22699">Okay, so anything besides plague and undead?</string>
<string name="22700">What do you know about the gang?</string>
<string name="22701">What you knows about gang?</string>
<string name="22702">What are these Dark Sun followers?</string>
<string name="22703">Dark Sun followers? What they?</string>
<string name="22704">Tell me about the Shining Serpent.</string>
<string name="22705">Tell about Shining Serpent place.</string>
<string name="22706">Tell me about the Helmite shrine.</string>
<string name="22707">Tell about Helmite shrine.</string>
<string name="22708">When they start not being all dead?</string>
<string name="22709">Anything strange happen around that time?</string>
<string name="22710">You sees strange things around then, maybe?</string>
<string name="22711">What can I do for you, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;? I pray you are not here to hurt me.</string>
<string name="22712">What do you want here? I&apos;ve got nothing you couldn&apos;t get elsewhere. Please leave me.</string>
<string name="22713">What do you want, bandit? I&apos;ve nothing to steal. I&apos;m just trying to stay safe in my home.</string>
<string name="22714">Are you so daft you couldn&apos;t find someone more important to ask? I&apos;ve been boarded up in here... what would I know?</string>
<string name="22715">I can&apos;t stop you asking. Just hurry up so I can lock and block the door again.</string>
<string name="22716">I don&apos;t want to know anything about any walking dead. That is just... it&apos;s not right! </string>
<string name="22717">I don&apos;t know... not too long ago... A while after the plague. </string>
<string name="22718">Goodbye, then. Please, try not to lead anything here, plague or otherwise.</string>
<string name="22719">I can try to answer, if you wish. I don&apos;t know what I can offer that you couldn&apos;t find somewhere else.</string>
<string name="22720">I&apos;m no fighter, no guard. That&apos;s the walking dead out there. At least I can see them, I suppose. Not like the plague.</string>
<string name="22721">Oh, hundreds... all dead. Thousands, maybe? I don&apos;t know. You can&apos;t count all the dead. It&apos;s been a nightmare, and no one helps.</string>
<string name="22722">I haven&apos;t left my home in days... longer, maybe. I don&apos;t dare go outside. I&apos;ll be dead if I do. I know it.</string>
<string name="22723">I don&apos;t know how to answer that. Stranger than plague or undead? I don&apos;t even want to think of what might be stranger than that.</string>
<string name="22724">I shouldn&apos;t have to deal with this, you know? I&apos;m just a normal person. You can go find trouble if you want... I just want to be safe.</string>
<string name="22725">Never... I never thought I would dare consider there was something more strange than what has happend to us here.</string>
<string name="22726">I guess... I guess there were some odd people... but nobody that would compare to so many dead. A gang... and maybe those Dark Sun followers.</string>
<string name="22727">The Sword Coast Boys are what they call themselves. Some good children fell in with them... now they&apos;ll end up in stocks.</string>
<string name="22728">The worst of the lot is Drawl. The rest... just babies. I think they spend most of their time in the north west of the Nest.</string>
<string name="22729">Shh... they follow Cyric. I stay the heck away from them. The whole lot are out of their minds. Just crazy.</string>
<string name="22730">I hope the plague took them. Not a decent one of the lot. I can&apos;t tell you where they were based, and I don&apos;t care to know.</string>
<string name="22731">I don&apos;t know... I don&apos;t know anywhere that&apos;s safe. That&apos;s why I&apos;m in here, trying to not be noticed. Walking dead... plague... it&apos;s too much.</string>
<string name="22732">I suppose you could try the Shining Serpent... or the Helmite shrine. I don&apos;t even know if they are still standing... </string>
<string name="22733">It&apos;s a tavern and inn... I know they always talk pretty tough. Seems like they would put up a fight. Harben Ashensmith is there a lot.</string>
<string name="22734">South central is where it is. Harben would make sure people are safe if he&apos;s there. He&apos;s who you talk to if you want to get things done.</string>
<string name="22735">It&apos;s really a community shrine, for whatever tribute you want to leave. No specific god was worshipped there. Not until the Helmites arrived.</string>
<string name="22736">They only arrived a while after the plague began.They seem nice, but I don&apos;t know any of them personally. They fixed the place up nice, though</string>
<string name="22737">It&apos;s in the south east area of the Nest, not far from the Serpent. I&apos;d go there. Holy ground, you know.</string>
<string name="22738">I think it started here... and nobody really cared until it spread. Now it&apos;s everywhere... the whole city. You just can&apos;t get away from it.</string>
<string name="22739">I&apos;ve been trying to stay away from people... trying to keep healthy. I haven&apos;t seen anyone else in days... weeks... It&apos;s horrible.</string>
<string name="22740">Maybe. I don&apos;t know. There were... There were a bunch of guards that searched the whole Nest. They wanted something.</string>
<string name="22741">Maybe an animal? They had cages. Never caught anything. Well... some caught the plague. Lots of guards have died here, even before the zombies.</string>
<string name="22742">If you just mean safe against the zombies, I think you might not have to worry. I&apos;ve been watching from in here... they seem to be gone.</string>
<string name="22743">I know they are gone, and that&apos;s enough for me. I don&apos;t care who or what got rid of them, but I&apos;m grateful.</string>
<string name="22744">I mean, at least the zombies seem to have gone away, but the plague is still there... I can&apos;t see it, but I know it&apos;s there.</string>
<string name="22745">What have you seen?</string>
<string name="22746">What you see?</string>
<string name="22747">Are you ignoring your duty as a guard?</string>
<string name="22748">You ignore duty as guard?</string>
<string name="22749">Are the undead related to the plague?</string>
<string name="22750">Undead because of plague?</string>
<string name="22751">Where is that? Is that where the undead come from?</string>
<string name="22752">Where Great Graveyard? That where undead from?</string>
<string name="22753">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22754">Bye bye.</string>
<string name="22755">Who can help, then?</string>
<string name="22756">So who would be able to help?</string>
<string name="22757">You look like officer material. Well, your orders won&apos;t do much here. I&apos;ve told my men to hold position.</string>
<string name="22758">Look, I ain&apos;t wasting what hours I have left alive talking to beggars or thugs. You hear me?</string>
<string name="22759">I see there are not as many undead around, but we ain&apos;t taking any chances. We&apos;re staying here.</string>
<string name="22760">What is it? I&apos;m getting tired of explaining myself. My men are not risking themselves down there and that&apos;s final.</string>
<string name="22761">I&apos;ll greet you warmly, but don&apos;t expect us to follow you down there. My men aren&apos;t undead hunters. We&apos;re not fools.</string>
<string name="22762">I ain&apos;t saying anything to you. If I&apos;m seen talking to potential looters or thugs, I&apos;ll be out on my ear.</string>
<string name="22763">You the replacements? Good for you. Do what you want. I&apos;ve told my men to hold position.</string>
<string name="22764">You want to walk the wall, go ahead. We&apos;ll kill undead if we see &apos;em, but I&apos;m not going looking for trouble.</string>
<string name="22765">What do you think we&apos;ve seen? Dead everywhere. If I wanted to face undead I&apos;d have been an idiot adventurer.</string>
<string name="22766">What do you know of it? You&apos;re no veteran. You&apos;ve just arrived. This kind of fight is not our job.</string>
<string name="22767">My men keep order, they don&apos;t fight abominations. This is bad magic, and I don&apos;t have the means to fight it.</string>
<string name="22768">Never liked working near the Great Graveyard. Guess the plague just filled it too damn full.</string>
<string name="22769">Go where you want. My men will hold the wall. At least it&apos;s safe up here.</string>
<string name="22770">The Great Graveyard is north of the Beggar&apos;s Nest. Go if you want. I don&apos;t want to know anything about it.</string>
<string name="22771">How the hell would I know? What do I know about undead? Or plague? This is not my problem.</string>
<string name="22772">What I know is that undead attack relentlessly. Whoever is behind this wants us dead. Period. I won&apos;t walk into it like a fool.</string>
<string name="22773">My men are supposed to keep the peace, not fight undead. I won&apos;t order them against these abominations. Find help elsewhere.</string>
<string name="22774">I don&apos;t know. Check at the Shining Serpent. I hear some fool is holding court like he&apos;s an authority on undead.</string>
<string name="22775">Harben Ashensmith is there too. Now he&apos;s a man I respect. You talk to him about this stuff, and he&apos;ll straighten you out.</string>
<string name="22776">I wish I had clear answers about the zombies in this district.</string>
<string name="22777">I&apos;d better get to it. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22778">Is anyone fighting back against the undead?</string>
<string name="22779">What are the &quot;Warrens?&quot;</string>
<string name="22780">Where are the undead coming from?</string>
<string name="22781">I&apos;m walking blind! I need more infomation about the undead!</string>
<string name="22782">I&apos;ll manage without it, thanks. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22783">Need more informations about zombies and stuff!</string>
<string name="22784">No want booze. Bye.</string>
<string name="22785">What is &quot;Warrens?&quot; You speak stupid.</string>
<string name="22786">Anyone fight dead? Anyone not cowards?</string>
<string name="22787">They say there&apos;s cause for celebration, that the undead are back to their dirt-naps, so to speak. Good on you if you saved the day.</string>
<string name="22788">I am here to serve, though I can&apos;t offer much. The greatest tragedy is the interruption of my beer supply.</string>
<string name="22789">Need a drink? Times is tough, and a body could use a little lubrication to keep it movin&apos;.</string>
<string name="22790">I don&apos;t blame you. Been crazy around these parts. First the plague, then this. We&apos;ll all be walking the Warrens before we&apos;re through.</string>
<string name="22791">Good luck. We live through this and we&apos;ll tie one on. Then we&apos;ll tie another one to that and watch them twirl.</string>
<string name="22792">Harben Ashensmith is here, and the celebrated undead hunter, Drake. He won my &quot;Eat the Most Pickled Eggs&quot; jamboree, two years running.</string>
<string name="22793"> He&apos;ll deny it, won&apos;t even let you ask, but just you think about that when he&apos;s being &quot;oh so serious.&quot;</string>
<string name="22794">Oh, Desther&apos;s Helmites are in the district somewhere too. Set up a sanctuary, I think.</string>
<string name="22795">Sorry. Local superstition. &quot;The Warrens of the Damned, burrowing deep beneath the dead to the very doormat of the Hells.&quot;</string>
<string name="22796">It&apos;s about the crypts beneath the Great Graveyard. People imagine the worst because they are out of sight. It&apos;s nothing.</string>
<string name="22797">The dying. Seriously, they don&apos;t seem concentrated anywhere, and people that die of plague seem to rise from where they fall.</string>
<string name="22798">There&apos;s more near the Great Graveyard in the north. I mean, go figure, the place is full of the dead.</string>
<string name="22799">Keep safe. The more warm bodies we have, the better.</string>
<string name="22800">Ohhh-kay. Watch your head out there. Sounds like it&apos;s been hit a few times.</string>
<string name="22801">Sorry, my slow-witted friend. Local superstition about the Warrens of the Damned that lead to the Hells or some such.</string>
<string name="22802"></string>
<string name="22803"></string>
<string name="22804">Farewell.</string>
<string name="22805">You don&apos;t agree with some people&apos;s methods of helping?</string>
<string name="22806">How bad is it getting in this district?</string>
<string name="22807">So who would you trust? Where is the safest place?</string>
<string name="22808">You lost a guard? Who was it?</string>
<string name="22809">You lose a man? But aren&apos;t they big?</string>
<string name="22810">So who you trust then? Where safest place?</string>
<string name="22811">This district really that bad?</string>
<string name="22812">You not think some people help good enough?</string>
<string name="22813">I go now. Bye.</string>
<string name="22814"></string>
<string name="22815"></string>
<string name="22816">Are there any safe locations?</string>
<string name="22817">Any safe places?</string>
<string name="22818">Where did you see him last?</string>
<string name="22819">Where he last go?</string>
<string name="22820">Is there a reason for the undead infestation?</string>
<string name="22821">You know why undead now everywhere?</string>
<string name="22822">Have you heard anything about Waterdhavian creatures?</string>
<string name="22823">You hear anything about Waterdhavi-whasis creature things?</string>
<string name="22824">Back to my previous questions.</string>
<string name="22825">Back to other questions, okay?</string>
<string name="22826">It was a Yuan-Ti named Gulnan who caused it all.</string>
<string name="22827">Snake lady Gulnan cause dead to walk and stuff.</string>
<string name="22828">The Beggar&apos;s Nest should be fine now.</string>
<string name="22829">Beggar&apos;s Nest all safe now.</string>
<string name="22830">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22831">Bye bye thens.</string>
<string name="22832">Don&apos;t know what&apos;s been happening, but the undead have dropped off completely. Not much for us to do here now.</string>
<string name="22833">The plague is still a concern, of course, but there are things being done elsewhere for that. I just hope I don&apos;t get used to the stink of burning dead before we beat it. Ugh... </string>
<string name="22834">Rioters and Looters! We will have ORDER! Do not let them pass!</string>
<string name="22835"></string>
<string name="22836"></string>
<string name="22837"></string>
<string name="22838"></string>
<string name="22839"></string>
<string name="22840"></string>
<string name="22841">Didn&apos;t think I&apos;d be doing so much talking today. Not to live people, anyway.</string>
<string name="22842">Greetings. Come to join the legions of the damned, have you? The Beggar&apos;s Nest be the closest thing to the Hells on Faerun.</string>
<string name="22843">Go ahead and patrol. I won&apos;t risk any more of my men against zombies, but you can stick your ugly neck out if you want.</string>
<string name="22844">I&apos;d get yourself to the Shining Serpent. There&apos;s too many undead... and some citizens are just as vicious.</string>
<string name="22845">It&apos;s not for me to say. If you want a safe location, I&apos;ll tell you about the sanctuary Desther&apos;s Helmites set up in the southwest.</string>
<string name="22846">I&apos;ll also tell you, however, that I wouldn&apos;t go there. Sure, the zombies avoid it, but I just don&apos;t put much stock in them Helmite blessings.</string>
<string name="22847">We&apos;re okay if we stay barricaded, but damnation, why did they have to start burning corpses upwind. Ugh! And why did the dead have to start getting restless?</string>
<string name="22848">You&apos;ll be looking for Harben Ashensmith. He knows what&apos;s what. Probably at the Shining Serpent, the safest place in the district.</string>
<string name="22849">It&apos;s in the south central area of the Nest. That&apos;s where I&apos;d go. Bunch of realists, looking for solid ways to survive.</string>
<string name="22850">A promising young guard named Walters. A local boy that grew up in the Beggar&apos;s Nest. A shame... He worked hard... </string>
<string name="22851">He pulled himself up, he did, and didn&apos;t join a gang like most his of friends. Now he&apos;s probably dead to a zombie.</string>
<string name="22852">Zombies are everywhere. I advise caution, my friend. You look like you might have potential, and there&apos;s been enough death here already.</string>
<string name="22853">Zombies are all over. If you want to patrol, you go ahead, but take care. Enough people have died already.</string>
<string name="22854">As you wish, but maybe you should go by the Shining Serpent tavern. They could look after you a bit.</string>
<string name="22855">How very astute of you. No... no, Walters didn&apos;t get lost like that. He&apos;s missing somewhere. Probably hurt or killed. </string>
<string name="22856"></string>
<string name="22857">Bad enough that I won&apos;t lose another guard in a hopeless fight. Let the undead walk. We&apos;ll pick them off from fortified places like the gate here.</string>
<string name="22858">A couple, I suppose, but it depends on what you call safe. I don&apos;t put much stock in what some people are spouting.</string>
<string name="22859">Last I saw he was heading out to patrol. Couldn&apos;t tell him not to. He&apos;s got old friends in this district, I guess.</string>
<string name="22860">He usually patrols near the northeast end of the Nest. Even without the zombies there&apos;s some shady types over there.</string>
<string name="22861">Myself, I prefer a sword in my hand to some foolish hope in my head. I&apos;d recommend you talk to Harben Ashensmith in the Shining Serpent instead.</string>
<string name="22862">If there is a reason behind any of this, nobody is telling me. First the plague, and now this. I got no answers.</string>
<string name="22863">Aribeth got you hunting for those? I was briefed by Lady Aribeth but she didn&apos;t tell me much about it. Nothing useful, anyway.</string>
<string name="22864">They were for a spell or something, right? Bah! I won&apos;t risk my men on a scavenger hunt. Search if you want. Nothing to do with me.</string>
<string name="22865">Ask what you will.</string>
<string name="22866"></string>
<string name="22867">A Yuan-Ti? Well what the hell was one of those doing in Neverwinter? Wait... was that one of the Waterdhavian beasts brought in? Damn them all!</string>
<string name="22868">I know we need a cure and all, but I lost good men to that zombie horde. Blast it, who let that snake beast loose? I&apos;d better get some answers when I file my report.</string>
<string name="22869">Good luck to you, wherever duty takes you. Make sure you keep Aribeth apprised of what you&apos;ve found.</string>
<string name="22870">I should hope so. You took a big risk wandering around in there. It could have turned out much worse. Thanks for all your effort.</string>
<string name="22871">Farewell. Wish me luck.</string>
<string name="22872">Is there anywhere I should go, specifically?</string>
<string name="22873">Is this area quarantined? Do you let anyone in or out?</string>
<string name="22874">Is this the last outpost of city guards?</string>
<string name="22875">Beggar&apos;s Nest closed? You stop sick by stopping people?</string>
<string name="22876">Where to go in area? Where good to learn?</string>
<string name="22877">I go. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="22878">You last guards? There any in Beggar&apos;s Nest?</string>
<string name="22879">Have you heard anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?</string>
<string name="22880">You know stuff about Waterdhavi-whasis creatures?</string>
<string name="22881">Who is Harben Ashensmith?</string>
<string name="22882">Who this Harben guy?</string>
<string name="22883">Are you with &lt;CUSTOM11&gt;? I am told the Beggar&apos;s Nest is much safer now because of their efforts.</string>
<string name="22884">I am told the Beggar&apos;s Nest is significantly safer, thanks to your efforts, &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="22885">Such work will earn you great respect here in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="22886">&lt;FullName&gt;, I&apos;ve heard of what you are doing in Neverwinter. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll sort out the Beggar&apos;s Nest in no time.</string>
<string name="22887">Are you what we hire for guards nowadays? I guess we take what we can get around the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="22888">I will, but I don&apos;t hold much hope for the district. It&apos;s the worst hit by the plague and now the undead are killing everything... </string>
<string name="22889">There&apos;s a tavern. The Shining Serpent. It&apos;s in the south central of the Beggar&apos;s Nest. Harben Ashensmith is there, organizing people.</string>
<string name="22890">As a guard, you&apos;ll be allowed to pass. Other than that, we&apos;ve tried to keep it sealed. The plague is worst in the Nest, and now there&apos;s undead... </string>
<string name="22891">The Helmites were allowed in to establish a shrine. I hear they continue to grant blessings. I doubt they counted on the undead infestation though.</string>
<string name="22892">There are some on the other side of the gate. They were supposed to keep the plague victims from rioting, but now they must contain the undead.</string>
<string name="22893">It&apos;s an impossible job. We don&apos;t have the manpower to maintain patrols. Hopefully you will be able to help us with that.</string>
<string name="22894">Greetings. You must be a new recruit. No one else is foolish enough to approach the gate to the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="22895">Good to see you. You must be one of the fine new recruits with the guards. No one else comes near the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="22896">Good luck. You&apos;ll need it, genius.</string>
<string name="22897">&quot;Where good to learn?&quot; I don&apos;t know if anyone can help you with that. You seem a little... slow.</string>
<string name="22898">It&apos;s a nightmare in there. Zombies are everywhere. We&apos;re keeping the City Core secure, but damned if we can do much for the Nest.</string>
<string name="22899">Aribeth has you looking for those, hmm? Sorry, I can&apos;t help you. I haven&apos;t heard anything about them. They are probably all dead.</string>
<string name="22900">Of course, being dead hasn&apos;t stopped all the zombies in the Nest. You can&apos;t count on anything to make sense right now.</string>
<string name="22901">Ah yes, I had heard you were making progress finding them. Aside from what you have done, I can&apos;t say I have heard anything good.</string>
<string name="22902">Maybe you&apos;ll be able to help some more, but I&apos;m not as hopeful as I once was. I figure the creatures are all dead.</string>
<string name="22903">The zombie threat is keeping people in their homes, so there haven&apos;t been many confrontations between the guards and people trying to break quarantine.</string>
<string name="22904">You should speak to Harben Ashensmth. He&apos;s been organizing people to keep them safe. He&apos;s in the Shining Serpent tavern, south central area of the district.</string>
<string name="22905">He&apos;s a friend of the guards. I&apos;m not sure of his official rank. He doesn&apos;t like to use it much. He prefers to stand with the rank and file.</string>
<string name="22906">He&apos;ll be able to give you more information than I can. If he&apos;s still there and alive, that is.</string>
<string name="22907"></string>
<string name="22908"></string>
<string name="22909"></string>
<string name="22910"></string>
<string name="22911"></string>
<string name="22912"></string>
<string name="22913"></string>
<string name="22914"></string>
<string name="22915"></string>
<string name="22916"></string>
<string name="22917"></string>
<string name="22918"></string>
<string name="22919"></string>
<string name="22920"></string>
<string name="22921"></string>
<string name="22922"></string>
<string name="22923">Watch who you threaten, fool! </string>
<string name="22924">I have no idea who that is and I don&apos;t care!</string>
<string name="22925">Not my problem. Good luck. You&apos;ll need it.</string>
<string name="22926">He&apos;s probably not coming back.</string>
<string name="22927">Shouldn&apos;t you go look for him?</string>
<string name="22928">I&apos;ll tell him if I see him. Good luck.</string>
<string name="22929">Sorry, I haven&apos;t seen him.</string>
<string name="22930">Hector? Yeah, he&apos;s here. A little out of sight though.</string>
<string name="22931">I saw him, but I didn&apos;t bring him with me.</string>
<string name="22932">He&apos;s got to be dead. There&apos;s no way he&apos;d survive.</string>
<string name="22933">There may be a Helmite blessing sanctuary somewhere. I could lead you.</string>
<string name="22934">I could escort you to the Shining Serpent. It&apos;s supposedly safe.</string>
<string name="22935">Your wagon is shot. You&apos;d better make a run for it.</string>
<string name="22936"></string>
<string name="22937">Tough break. Goodbye and good luck.</string>
<string name="22938">Well that&apos;s just rude. Don&apos;t make many friends, do you?</string>
<string name="22939">Easy, I&apos;m not your enemy.</string>
<string name="22940">I no hurt you. What you mad for?</string>
<string name="22941">You talk too much! Me hit if you keep yelling!</string>
<string name="22942">He dead, me think. No way he live.</string>
<string name="22943">Me see him, but not bring him here.</string>
<string name="22944">Him here with us. You just don&apos;t sees him.</string>
<string name="22945">I don&apos;t sees him.</string>
<string name="22946">Me don&apos;t knows him and me don&apos;t cares!</string>
<string name="22947">Dat tough. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="22948">Your wagon broke pretty good. Better run for it.</string>
<string name="22949">Me lead yous to Shining Serpent tavern, maybe?</string>
<string name="22950">Maybe lead you to Helmite sanctuary? You want?</string>
<string name="22951"></string>
<string name="22952">I say so if I sees him. Good lucks on you.</string>
<string name="22953">Maybe you go look?</string>
<string name="22954">Him probably no gonna come back.</string>
<string name="22955">This not problem for me. Big lucks to you.</string>
<string name="22956">I gotta hand it to you, friend, you did me a nice favor. </string>
<string name="22957">Of course, it would have been nicer to arrive with a few more people ALIVE! Nice try, though.</string>
<string name="22958">Even made it out with all hands. Now we just gotta avoid the plague... never ends, does it?</string>
<string name="22959">More live ones! Imagine that! Now, if it was just that fool Hector and my PARTS!!</string>
<string name="22960">Youuuuuu just watch yourself. If you&apos;re dead, so help me I&apos;ll make you deader!</string>
<string name="22961">Hmph! The dead ones don&apos;t talk back, so I guess you are okay. Can&apos;t blame a guy for being careful, though.</string>
<string name="22962">Hey! What are you doing with Hector? Tall-folk idiot was supposed to get us some wagon parts!</string>
<string name="22963">I tried, boss! Ain&apos;t no parts nowhere though. I swears it!</string>
<string name="22964">All right all right, relax, you lummox. Let&apos;s just figure out what we do now. Time to abandon ship, I&apos;ll wager. No parts means no wagon. Ah well.</string>
<string name="22965">You ain&apos;t seen a tall-folk named Hector, have ya? Sent him out for wagon parts and damned if he ain&apos;t just disappeared.</string>
<string name="22966">No need to get all huffy. If you see him, just tell him to get those wagon parts back here quick.</string>
<string name="22967">Don&apos;t know that. Maybe the parts are too big for him, but I ain&apos;t leaving my stuff until I have to, zombies or not!</string>
<string name="22968">I gotta wait for him to come back. I ain&apos;t leaving the wagon until there&apos;s no other hope. Plain and simple.</string>
<string name="22969">I don&apos;t get good luck. I get stuck in a zombie-filled city with a broken wagon and the scorn of my wife.</string>
<string name="22970">Thanks anyway, I guess.</string>
<string name="22971">Dang it down! Do me a favor? If you see him, tell him to get those wagon parts back here on the double!</string>
<string name="22972">Probably hiding because he DIDN&apos;T GET MY PARTS, THE IDIOT!! Okay, okay, calm down. I just have to figure out what to do.</string>
<string name="22973">I&apos;ll protect my wagon &apos;til the end, but it&apos;d all be easier if he would just get back here with my parts! I&apos;ve got wheels to fix!</string>
<string name="22974">Dang it dang it DANG IT! Fool was supposed to bring wagon parts! Dead you say? Well, that tears it. Nothing more for it. I&apos;m going to have to... leave the old girl.</string>
<string name="22975">Helmites, eh? No thanks. I don&apos;t believe a word of what those pious pie-faces are selling. I&apos;m off on my own. Thanks, though.</string>
<string name="22976">That tavern doesn&apos;t have enough ale to make me forget abandoning what&apos;s mine. Thanks for all you&apos;ve done, but I&apos;m taking my chances on my own. Thanks anyway.</string>
<string name="22977">Looks like I don&apos;t have much choice now. Well, time to head off running, I think. No shuffling zombie can catch a halfling at full run, I say!</string>
<string name="22978">Yeah, thanks ever so much for your help. Off to the races I go, I guess. Is that something moving over there? Come on you undead freaks! Just try it!</string>
<string name="22979">The dead ones don&apos;t talk back, so I guess you&apos;re okay. Dead ones are probably smarter, though.</string>
<string name="22980">We&apos;ve got to get to safety!</string>
<string name="22981">Can&apos;t help you. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="22982">Sorry, I don&apos;t have any wagon parts.</string>
<string name="22983">You can tag along, but don&apos;t get in the way!</string>
<string name="22984">I&apos;ll take you, sure. Where is he?</string>
<string name="22985">Not my concern.</string>
<string name="22986">I saw him. He&apos;s looking for you.</string>
<string name="22987">Me saw him. He look for yous.</string>
<string name="22988">Me not have any parts.</string>
<string name="22989">I no help. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="22990">This not my problem.</string>
<string name="22991">I take you to him maybe? Where he be?</string>
<string name="22992">Ugh! Okay, Me lead you, but yous don&apos;t get in way!</string>
<string name="22993">Who are you?</string>
<string name="22994">Who you?</string>
<string name="22995">Hector punch? Are you an imbecile?</string>
<string name="22996">You sound stupids.</string>
<string name="22997">Aren&apos;t you worried about zombies or plague?</string>
<string name="22998">You not scared of walking dead or plague-sick?</string>
<string name="22999">You stay here for a bit, all right?</string>
<string name="23000">Yous wait here, okay?</string>
<string name="23001">We&apos;ll find him. Come on.</string>
<string name="23002">We find him soon. You keep following.</string>
<string name="23003">Perhaps you are too stupid to be scared.</string>
<string name="23004">Maybe you too stupid to scare.</string>
<string name="23005">Hey, more people to talk to! Good, because me not want to go back to Aldo without wagon parts. Can&apos;t find none nowhere that will work. You see wagon parts?</string>
<string name="23006">You dead? Hector punch you if you are! No... you&apos;re alive. </string>
<string name="23007">Okay. I&apos;ll keep looking here. No... no good... these all broken. Maybe somewhere... </string>
<string name="23008">Aldo will be mad. He doesn&apos;t want to leave his stuff behind. He sure likes his stuff.</string>
<string name="23009">Maybe you could... uh... come with me to tell him there&apos;s no parts? He gets real mad sometimes.</string>
<string name="23010">Good good! Aldo is guarding his wagon in middle of Beggar&apos;s Nest. Uh... just don&apos;t let him bug you. He gets mad... </string>
<string name="23011">Oooh, he probably mad. Me can&apos;t find any parts, which means he can&apos;t move his stuff. He sure likes his stuff!</string>
<string name="23012">We got to find Aldo. Boy, he going to be mad.</string>
<string name="23013">We got to get to safety.</string>
<string name="23014">Good to be alive. Stupid wagon.</string>
<string name="23015">Me? Me Hector. Me work for Aldo and work hard. Gotta find wagon parts, but me only find broken stuff. You see any not broken anywhere?</string>
<string name="23016">Me sound like you. Yous got problems with that? Me just wanna find wagon parts for bossman Aldo, but me just finds broken stuff. Leave me be.</string>
<string name="23017">Me? Me not scared! Hector punch zombies good, and punch plague too if it try to fight me. Maybe. Me not see plague before.</string>
<string name="23018">Me just scared of Aldo. He needs parts for wagon, so me look. Not finding any anywhere. Just broken stuff.</string>
<string name="23019">Okay, but he get mad if it not soon.</string>
<string name="23020">Okay. Maybe there&apos;s parts here somewhere? Maybe.</string>
<string name="23021">Don&apos;t matter to me why. Me not scared of zombies, and me not scared of you. Me just want parts, so gimme or beat it.</string>
<string name="23022"></string>
<string name="23023">Have you seen anything dangerous?</string>
<string name="23024">Farewell for now.</string>
<string name="23025">You shouldn&apos;t be staying here. I could lead you out.</string>
<string name="23026">Bad you stay here. Maybe I lead you safe place?</string>
<string name="23027">You seen danger? Scary things?</string>
<string name="23028"></string>
<string name="23029">Okay, me go now. Bye.</string>
<string name="23030">Who are you? Why are you out here?</string>
<string name="23031">Who you? Why you here?</string>
<string name="23032">Greetings. Nice to see someone still alive out here. I&apos;d prefer that we were talking somewhere safe, but it&apos;s still nice.</string>
<string name="23033"></string>
<string name="23034"></string>
<string name="23035"></string>
<string name="23036">Other than legions of undead, a husband that puts his cart ahead of his family, and a plague that seems almost apocalyptic?</string>
<string name="23037">Nope, nothing. really. I&apos;ve been too busy trying to stay alive.</string>
<string name="23038">Good day to you.</string>
<string name="23039">We&apos;ll be all right. Aldo will keep us safe. He&apos;s a good man. A bit too attached to the cart, I think, but a good man.</string>
<string name="23040">Ankle-biting undead sons of... I know you&apos;re out there. Just try it! Come on!</string>
<string name="23041">It&apos;s not such a nice wagon, dear.</string>
<string name="23042">You&apos;ll wish you were... uh... DEADER, you dead... undead... WHATEVER!</string>
<string name="23043">We can buy new things, dear.</string>
<string name="23044">Keep away from my stuff you undead freaks!</string>
<string name="23045">Should we die for this lousy furniture? It was your mother&apos;s and smells funny.</string>
<string name="23046">Zombie... bastards... why, I ought&apos;ta... I&apos;ll feed &apos;em some speedy bolts o&apos; death, I will.</string>
<string name="23047">Travel, you said. Move to the big city, you said.</string>
<string name="23048">As... thoughtful... as your offer is, I think I&apos;ll stay with my husband. He can form sentences.</string>
<string name="23049">You know, my old hound had that exact look on his face. All the time. Don&apos;t get me wrong, he was a SMART dog... </string>
<string name="23050">In answer to your masterfully constructed question, I have seen zombies, plague, and the madness of my husband. Danger enough?</string>
<string name="23051"></string>
<string name="23052">Good day. Take care. Read the occasional book.</string>
<string name="23053">We&apos;ve got to get to safety!</string>
<string name="23054">I blame the wagon. Not the plague, not zombies... the wagon.</string>
<string name="23055">Well, my name is Mattily. As for why I am out here, that&apos;s a very good question. Why don&apos;t you ask the cart?</string>
<string name="23056">Don&apos;t start, woman! I&apos;m doing my best over here!</string>
<string name="23057">I&apos;m sorry for my stressed tone, but I&apos;m growing tired of waiting for a wagon wheel in a zombie-infested street. You hear me, Aldo?!</string>
<string name="23058">Save it, Aldo! I&apos;m getting real tired of waiting for a wagon wheel in the middle of a zombie-infested street!</string>
<string name="23059">I&apos;m more concerned about finding Hector. Aldo sent him for wagon parts and I&apos;m worried for his safety. Family friend, you understand.</string>
<string name="23060">Oh, I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll be fine. I see you have Hector with you. Now that he&apos;s here, we&apos;ll be all right. I was worried about him. Aldo! Look! It&apos;s Hector!</string>
<string name="23061">Talk to Aldo, will you? He&apos;ll want to know Hector is safe.</string>
<string name="23062">Farewell.</string>
<string name="23063">Marcus? Was he a mage, perhaps? Kept a Journal?</string>
<string name="23064">He&apos;s probably dead in the streets.</string>
<string name="23065">Ha! He&apos;s dead! I saw his corpse under a dozen zombies!</string>
<string name="23066">I am sorry, but he fell to zombies. I found his body.</string>
<string name="23067">I found his possessions. I could give them to you.</string>
<string name="23068">Actually, I was mistaken. I don&apos;t have his things.</string>
<string name="23069"></string>
<string name="23070">He had this staff. Take it.</string>
<string name="23071">He had a journal. Take it.</string>
<string name="23072">I don&apos;t have anything else of his.</string>
<string name="23073">Heh, I have his things now. Let&apos;s talk price.</string>
<string name="23074">I wish I could help.</string>
<string name="23075">Then live in denial, fool. I told you what I saw.</string>
<string name="23076">I&apos;m sure he will turn up.</string>
<string name="23077">Powerful? Maybe I should seek him out.</string>
<string name="23078">I have not seen anyone by that name.</string>
<string name="23079">Me no see no Marcus anywheres.</string>
<string name="23080">Brother dead, probably. </string>
<string name="23081">This Marcus, he maybe write stuff? Was he spell-chucker?</string>
<string name="23082">Bye byes. Me go.</string>
<string name="23083">Maybe me find powerful guy. Maybe me get stuff.</string>
<string name="23084">He be here sometime. No worry.</string>
<string name="23085">Me not want to say but... him dead.</string>
<string name="23086">He so dead! Weak and stupid and dead!</string>
<string name="23087">You be fool. Me say what is true.</string>
<string name="23088">Me wish could help yous, but can&apos;t.</string>
<string name="23089">I have dead Marcus stuff. Maybe you... pay for it?</string>
<string name="23090">Me have dead Marcus stuff. Maybe give to you?</string>
<string name="23091">Him have book he write. Take it.</string>
<string name="23092">Him have big staff. Here, you take.</string>
<string name="23093"></string>
<string name="23094">Heh... whoopsies. Me not have anything.</string>
<string name="23095">Me not have nothing more.</string>
<string name="23096"></string>
<string name="23097"></string>
<string name="23098">Farewell.</string>
<string name="23099">Go bye.</string>
<string name="23100">What are you waiting for?</string>
<string name="23101">What you wait for heres?</string>
<string name="23102">You just did. Out with it. What do you want?</string>
<string name="23103">You did anyways. What you want, already?</string>
<string name="23104">Tell me of your brother.</string>
<string name="23105">You tells me about your brother.</string>
<string name="23106">Have you seen many survivors, or just zombies?</string>
<string name="23107">You see lotta survivors, or just dead guys?</string>
<string name="23108">Is this the only safe place he might have gone?</string>
<string name="23109">This the only safe place he maybe be?</string>
<string name="23110">It is a small solace, I suppose, but I am more accepting of his passage now. My brother was a good person, you know?</string>
<string name="23111"></string>
<string name="23112">Even your uncouth kind are a welcome sight to me. Only zombies have populated the vigil for my brother.</string>
<string name="23113">You&apos;ll forgive me if I am a bit distracted. I have been hoping that... well, I need not burden you with my troubles.</string>
<string name="23114">Safe passage to you. You&apos;ll excuse me if I return to my vigil.</string>
<string name="23115">You don&apos;t know that. He is quite skilled, and I place more faith in my knowledge of him than in your simple insults.</string>
<string name="23116">That... that cannot be. I will not believe it. Not until I see his belongings with my own eyes. </string>
<string name="23117">I cannot believe... </string>
<string name="23118">I have been given much... All his things... I&apos;m sure they will bring me comfort. I hope they will. I hope...</string>
<string name="23119">Please, take this gold. I know it is not much, but you have been a great help to me. I appreciate it.</string>
<string name="23120">I thank you. I can at least have this little piece of him back. It is no replacement but... it is something.</string>
<string name="23121">I thank you, though I am sure there was more. It will show up eventually, I&apos;m sure. I hope.</string>
<string name="23122"></string>
<string name="23123">I will not believe it until I hold his belongings. He is just beyond my sight, I am sure. You are mistaken.</string>
<string name="23124">I have no doubt. He could always take care of himself.</string>
<string name="23125">I would not approach him with that greedy look in your eye. He is well-mannered, but will not abide your intent.</string>
<string name="23126">Ugh... I suppose people of all sorts must find shelter here... even the likes of you. Greetings... I am Bertrand.</string>
<string name="23127">Hello there! I am pleased to see people of refinement can survive out there. My name is Bertrand.</string>
<string name="23128">I know you will make good use of it. Thank you again.</string>
<string name="23129">Are... you sure? You seem... capable of mistakes. I won&apos;t believe it. Not until I see his belongings with my own eyes. </string>
<string name="23130">A friendly face is a welcome sight. Only zombies have populated the vigil for my brother.</string>
<string name="23131">It is good to see the living out. Only zombies have passed during the vigil for my brother.</string>
<string name="23132"></string>
<string name="23133"></string>
<string name="23134">Greetings stragglers. Forgive my disappointment, but your arrival brings me no joy. Where are my manners? I am Bertrand.</string>
<string name="23135">You sound like you wouldn&apos;t recognize much that wasn&apos;t small and shiny. I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m being rude. I&apos;ve been out of sorts, lately.</string>
<string name="23136">Your ill-spoken words are a great comfort. Really. I trust his ability more than your simple assurances.</string>
<string name="23137">You mock me with your callous talk. I won&apos;t believe you, not until I see his belongings with my own eyes.</string>
<string name="23138">Go. Take your cruelty. Leave me to my vigil.</string>
<string name="23139">Your words are no comfort. I won&apos;t believe it until I see his belongings. I wont.</string>
<string name="23140">Please, leave me to continue my vigil. Please.</string>
<string name="23141">What do you know?! You can barely pour the words out of that barrel you call a head!</string>
<string name="23142"></string>
<string name="23143"></string>
<string name="23144"></string>
<string name="23145">Hello there... You will find this place safe, though I don&apos;t know why I stay here... I know he is dead now... </string>
<string name="23146">The vigil for my brother is over. I know he is dead. I just... can&apos;t let go. I don&apos;t have closure.</string>
<string name="23147">Be careful out there. Many have fallen already.</string>
<string name="23148">I have been watching for people fleeing the zombies. I&apos;ve lost track of my brother in all the commotion and I was hoping he would come here.</string>
<string name="23149">His name is Marcus, Marcus Penhold. I shouldn&apos;t be worried. He&apos;s quite competent, and the heirloom he carries is powerful, too.</string>
<string name="23150">I am sorry if I appeared to lead you, but as I said, I am distracted. I&apos;ve been waiting for my brother. I lost him in all the commotion.</string>
<string name="23151">That is unfortunate... but I am sure he is well. I will hear of him eventually.</string>
<string name="23152">I&apos;ll feel better once I hear of him. I&apos;m sure it won&apos;t be long.</string>
<string name="23153">Yes, that sounds like him. Have you seen him, then?</string>
<string name="23154">This is the most logical place for him to go. I hear the Shining Serpent is also fortified, but I don&apos;t think Marcus thought much of the place.</string>
<string name="23155">Not many are willing to risk traveling. This place is safe, but getting here may be beyond the abilities of many people.</string>
<string name="23156">Some people may also be afraid of gathering together because of the risk of plague. Isolation doesn&apos;t work as well against zombies, though.</string>
<string name="23157">Well, he is a spellcaster, if that&apos;s what you mean. Yes.</string>
<string name="23158">Go ahead, though I doubt it shall do any good.</string>
<string name="23159">Farewell for now.</string>
<string name="23160">Have your blessings had an effect on the progress of the plague?</string>
<string name="23161">Where is the Great Graveyard?</string>
<string name="23162">Will people be safe if I bring them here?</string>
<string name="23163">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is this the only haven? People could fortify elsewhere.</string>
<string name="23164">Do you know who is creating the zombies?</string>
<string name="23165">I welcome the offer, thank you.</string>
<string name="23166">You will forgive me if I do not indulge, thank you.</string>
<string name="23167">I am not interested in your hollow blessings.</string>
<string name="23168">No thanks. No blessing wanted.</string>
<string name="23169">Give me blessing if you want. Probably do nothing.</string>
<string name="23170">No want. Take a hike.</string>
<string name="23171">Sure. Give me blessing. Thanks much.</string>
<string name="23172">Bye now.</string>
<string name="23173">Blessings slow plague down yet?</string>
<string name="23174">People be safe if me bring here?</string>
<string name="23175">Uh, you know who make plague zombies?</string>
<string name="23176">Where am this Great Graveyard thingy?</string>
<string name="23177">Can you offer basic temple services?</string>
<string name="23178">Maybe you gots store of basic temple stuff?</string>
<string name="23179">More have come seeking shelter, I see. Do you wish to receive the blessing I offer?</string>
<string name="23180">Greetings, and welcome to this small house of Helm. Do you seek a blessing in this troubled time?</string>
<string name="23181">It is an anointing of the soul. You will feel the effects like any of willing heart might, I am sure.</string>
<string name="23182">And now, what has truly brought you to this place? You have a great weight upon you.</string>
<string name="23183">As you will, but these doors are open should you need. All are welcome to receive the blessing.</string>
<string name="23184">Not as yet, but hope is powerful. Each blessing eases the mind, even if unable to prevent destruction of the body.</string>
<string name="23185">The Great Graveyard literally overflows, but we will not give up. Hope will deliver this city. You will see.</string>
<string name="23186">The Great Graveyard is north of the Beggar&apos;s Nest, but you will not enter with ease.</string>
<string name="23187">It is very effectively barricaded. I know of no other entrances, unfortunately. </string>
<string name="23188">Definitely. This is a sanctuary against the undead. They cannot enter here, by virtue of the power behind my blessings.</string>
<string name="23189">I will see to the safety of all who enter, and will administer to them indiscriminately. All will be treated equally.</string>
<string name="23190">Bah! I offer hope. Some huddle in the filth of the Silver Serpent tavern, but that doesn&apos;t make it a sanctuary.</string>
<string name="23191">The zombies? I know little except that their disrespectful attack upon the city degrades the hopes of all Neverwintans.</string>
<string name="23192">However, if you find the one responsible, tell them they have helped even as they meant to do the city harm.</string>
<string name="23193">Fear of undead has brought many to this temple, just as the plague does. The number of blessings I give grows daily.</string>
<string name="23194">No, I can see that you are possessed of another purpose. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="23195">Uh, yes. It is an annointing of the soul. You should feel the effects like any other, despite your... limited faculties.</string>
<string name="23196">No, I can see in your vacant eyes that you are here for something else. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="23197">This may be hard for you to understand, but even though the death continues, the blessings ease both mind and spirit.</string>
<string name="23198">Only here will people get the blessings they need. Only here do we understand the plague.</string>
<string name="23199">As you will. Return if you wish to be set at ease with a blessing... though your thoughts seem quite inert as it is.</string>
<string name="23200"></string>
<string name="23201">Drake and Harben are working out a defence for people still trapped by zombies. You should go help.</string>
<string name="23202">I saw some strange stuff around the old warehouse in the northeast, but Drake might know more.</string>
<string name="23203">There&apos;s a few places that still have people in &apos;em. Speak with Drake if you want to check them out.</string>
<string name="23204">I swear, the dead are rising faster than the plague is killin&apos; people off! Gotta be connected somewhere.</string>
<string name="23205">The undead cluster around the Great Graveyard, and nobody can get close. Barricaded up good, it is.</string>
<string name="23206">The Helmites swear the city will be delivered through blessings. Bah! Drake and Harben will deliver us proper by killin&apos; zombies!</string>
<string name="23207">Sure, the Helmite sanctuary keeps zombies away, but you have to listen to their &quot;blessing this&quot; and &quot;blessing that.&quot;</string>
<string name="23208">That Desther and his Helmites believe their &quot;pat on the head&quot; blessing actually helps. Hmpf! Ain&apos;t stopped anyone getting plagued yet!</string>
<string name="23209">Harben and Drake are keeping folk busy, but the damn undead need to be stopped at the source.</string>
<string name="23210">Those guards at the gate canna even keep their own safe. Lost that young fellah Walters, I hear.</string>
<string name="23211">That Drake fellah, he&apos;s something else, eh? An undead hunter! Good to see SOMEONE taking it to &apos;em!</string>
<string name="23212">I coulda gone to that sanctuary instead of here, but I prefer sensible talk over their pipe dreams.</string>
<string name="23213">Saw some fool mage in red fighting instead of running. Full of himself, he was. Now the street&apos;s full of him too.</string>
<string name="23214">Came here from the soup kitchen before it got overrun. Damned guards couldn&apos;t help. They didn&apos;t even know where it was.</string>
<string name="23215">You&apos;re better off dead, you freak!</string>
<string name="23216">I&apos;ll leave you alone then. Goodbye!</string>
<string name="23217">You just have to get to a safe place. Do you know one?</string>
<string name="23218">It&apos;s okay. Follow me and we&apos;ll go someplace safe.</string>
<string name="23219">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt;&gt; Settle down now, I don&apos;t mean you any harm.</string>
<string name="23220">Just stay here where you won&apos;t hurt yourself!</string>
<string name="23221">Okay, you runs to Helmite sanctu-thingy.</string>
<string name="23222">Look, do you know a safe place to go?</string>
<string name="23223">Look, just follow me and you&apos;ll be fine, all right?</string>
<string name="23224">You&apos;ll be fine. Just stay here out of trouble.</string>
<string name="23225">You just stays here, so you not get hurt.</string>
<string name="23226">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You settle now. Me not hurt you. Honest.</string>
<string name="23227">You know about zombies at all?</string>
<string name="23228">Shhh... relax. I&apos;m &lt;Race&gt; just like you. Trust me.</string>
<string name="23229">Be still. I&apos;m &lt;race&gt;, like you. Not undead.</string>
<string name="23230">Shut up, you! No way for &lt;race&gt; folk to act!</string>
<string name="23231">Me &lt;race&gt; kind, like you. Be quiet.</string>
<string name="23232">Shut up! That&apos;s not the &lt;race&gt; way to act!</string>
<string name="23233">You know safe place to run?</string>
<string name="23234">Follow and me lead you to safe place.</string>
<string name="23235">You runs to Shining Serpent then.</string>
<string name="23236">You stay here away from trouble, okay?</string>
<string name="23237">Do you know anything about the zombies?</string>
<string name="23238">You knows a safe place for you to go?</string>
<string name="23239">Okay, just go to the Shining Serpent.</string>
<string name="23240">You&apos;re okay. Just get to the Helmite Sanctuary.</string>
<string name="23241">Me leave then. Bye.</string>
<string name="23242">Me just kill you! Too loud!</string>
<string name="23243">You okay. Me &lt;race&gt; kind just like yous.</string>

<string name="23245">Okay... okay, everything is okay... it&apos;s okay... thanks for... calming me down... </string>
<string name="23246">More undead?! More?! Get away or... I&apos;ll get the MUFFFINS!</string>
<string name="23247">GAH!!! Take the muffins and GO!! Muffins and go!!!</string>

<string name="23264">Just... leave me be. Zombies... everywhere. I almost died... </string>
<string name="23265">Well, you&apos;re safe now. Quit your crying.</string>
<string name="23266">I&apos;m leaving. What are you doing now?</string>
<string name="23267">Who did Drawl make a deal with? Who did this?</string>
<string name="23268">Who is Drawl? A zombie?</string>
<string name="23269">Yes, the plague has taken its toll.</string>
<string name="23270">Like who?</string>
<string name="23271">Who you mean?</string>
<string name="23272">Yeah, plague bad for everyone.</string>

<string name="23280">What happen to these rival guys of Drawl?</string>
<string name="23281">How did Drawl do all this?</string>
<string name="23282">How Drawl do this stuff?</string>
<string name="23283">Who are you to the Sword Coast Boys?</string>
<string name="23284">Who you? What you do with Sword Coast Boys?</string>
<string name="23285">I don&apos;t have many answers, but it seems like the Sword Coast Boys are out of action. Everything&apos;s calming down in this district.</string>
<string name="23286">What are you doing? I don&apos;t want anyone drawing attention here! It ain&apos;t safe out there, not with Drawl and his Sword Coast Boys making like corpses.</string>
<string name="23287">Your looks aren&apos;t much better than the zombies, but thanks just the same. Didn&apos;t want to end up like them.</string>
<string name="23288">I ain&apos;t safe. They&apos;ll come back. Once a Sword Coast Boy, always a Sword Coast Boy... even if you&apos;re dead.</string>
<string name="23289">I wasn&apos;t having anything more to do with them, not after what happened to Drawl&apos;s rivals. Now they&apos;re all dead, and Drawl&apos;s some kind of monster!</string>
<string name="23290">I ain&apos;t going anywhere! I ain&apos;t ending up like them... not even Drawl, if I can help it.</string>
<string name="23291">I don&apos;t know. At first I thought The Heavies had something to do with it. They&apos;re a gang of half-orcs, but now they are all undead too.</string>
<string name="23292">They&apos;re all wandering around the warehouse. It&apos;s like Drawl put them on display, like with all his rivals... making a point.</string>
<string name="23293">No way, Drawl and his lieutenants are worse. I saw &apos;em for a second... they ain&apos;t lumbering or slow... They look really evil now.</string>
<string name="23294">He was the leader of our gang, but I don&apos;t know who he&apos;s dealing with now. I bet he gave over everyone just so he could be powerful.</string>
<string name="23295">I wish it were just the plague. The Sword Coast Boys will do worse. These zombies were some of the gang I was in.</string>
<string name="23296">The Sword Coast Boys. These undead are... they WERE the gang I was in. I thought they would look out for me, you know?</string>
<string name="23297">Thank you for your help... I didn&apos;t want to end up like them.</string>
<string name="23298">Thank the gods it&apos;s a friendly face. I sure didn&apos;t want to end up like those boys.</string>
<string name="23299">Some of the guys, they wanted to try and get the gang out of town while the plague was going on. You know, save their skins.</string>
<string name="23300">Drawl was leader, and said everyone should stay. He said he had a deal that would make the gang really powerful. He wouldn&apos;t let anyone leave.</string>
<string name="23301">Then he changed into... something. Now... everyone is dead... zombies, but different. And Drawl, he&apos;s still leading them. Don&apos;t know how... He&apos;s got a powerful friend somewhere.</string>
<string name="23302">I tell you, he&apos;s got someone backing him. I don&apos;t know. Maybe... maybe it&apos;s got something to do with the zombies everywhere, and they wanted undead that still had a mind.</string>
<string name="23303">Not sure why they&apos;d want Drawl, though. I guess he&apos;s real easy to please. I don&apos;t think he cares what happens to him, just as long as he&apos;s the strongest guy on the block.</string>
<string name="23304">I just hope he doesn&apos;t come looking for me. I wanna live a good long time.</string>
<string name="23305">The Sword Coast Boys? Drawl had them take over a warehouse as a new base. Don&apos;t know why he thought that specific building was so important.</string>
<string name="23306">That was just a little while ago. It&apos;s in the north central area of the district.</string>
<string name="23307">Me? I&apos;m Krestal. I was just one of the Boys. I&apos;m lucky that I&apos;m not important enough to come after. Plague or no, I&apos;d be over the wall if I was.</string>
<string name="23308">After what Drawl did to the others... and how they tracked Walters down after he left. I hope he&apos;s all right... I know Drawl&apos;s rivals ended bad.</string>
<string name="23309">You guard fools can go risk your necks, but I&apos;m not ending up like them... not me.</string>
<string name="23310"></string>
<string name="23311"></string>
<string name="23312"></string>
<string name="23313"></string>
<string name="23314"></string>
<string name="23315"></string>
<string name="23316"></string>
<string name="23317"></string>
<string name="23318"></string>
<string name="23319">Just thank your lucky stars I&apos;m not a flesh-eating corpse. </string>
<string name="23320">I might check it out. What are you going to do?</string>
<string name="23321"></string>
<string name="23322">You say the undead leave the house alone?</string>
<string name="23323">Any idea who lives at this house you mention?</string>
<string name="23324">Maybe I am, but I&apos;ve undead to kill first.</string>
<string name="23325">I&apos;ve been fighting undead. You need some help?</string>
<string name="23326">Me fight undead. You needs help?</string>
<string name="23327">Maybe me loot, but me kill undead first.</string>
<string name="23328">Bah! Just you lucky me not undead.</string>
<string name="23329">Who live there?</string>
<string name="23330">Undead don&apos;t go to this bad house?</string>
<string name="23331"></string>
<string name="23332">Me maybe take look. What you do?</string>
<string name="23333">I found this ring in the cult hideout. Recognize it?</string>
<string name="23334">Me find ring in cult place. You know it?</string>
<string name="23335">Farewell, then.</string>
<string name="23336">Bye for nows.</string>
<string name="23337">Me found some ring in cult place. It his?</string>
<string name="23338">I found this ring in the cult hideout. Was it his?</string>
<string name="23339">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Are you sure you don&apos;t have something more?</string>
<string name="23340">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe you give something more?</string>
<string name="23341">Give me more or you&apos;ll be seeing your brother real soon!</string>
<string name="23342">Give more or join brother right quick!</string>
<string name="23343">Why do you think that?</string>
<string name="23344">Why? What you think you know?</string>
<string name="23345">I don&apos;t have time right now.</string>
<string name="23346">Me not got time right now.</string>
<string name="23347">I have questions about this strange house.</string>
<string name="23348">Me want know stuff about strange house place.</string>
<string name="23349">I want to know some things about your brother.</string>
<string name="23350">Me gots questions about brother.</string>
<string name="23351">What&apos;s his name? What does he do?</string>
<string name="23352">What his name? What job he gots?</string>
<string name="23353">Could I have it?</string>
<string name="23354">Maybe you give to me?</string>
<string name="23355">I&apos;ll take a look. You just stay here.</string>
<string name="23356">You stay here where it safer, okay? Me look.</string>
<string name="23357">I wouldn&apos;t want you along anyway. Stay here.</string>
<string name="23358">Me not want worthless you along anyways. You stay.</string>
<string name="23359">Why didn&apos;t you give this out the first time you were talked to?</string>
<string name="23360">Why you not give this out first time you talked to?</string>
<string name="23361">Well, at least the zombies have stopped. Do you know anything about that? I&apos;m worried for my brother. He was mixed up in some cult.</string>
<string name="23362">I&apos;d just like to know where he is. Torin has never been gone this long. If you happen by the estate in the northwest... well... this is my problem.</string>
<string name="23363">I&apos;m going crazy here. They are up to something at that estate. It&apos;s something to do with the undead... I just know it.</string>
<string name="23364">What do you want? There&apos;s squat I can do to stop you looting, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re here for.</string>
<string name="23365">I suppose you could be worse. I&apos;m going after worse right now. I think I know something about these undead... </string>
<string name="23366">My brother has been acting... funny. He goes to a strange house just north of here. The undead leave it alone!</string>
<string name="23367">He&apos;s not himself... I think they took his mind. There&apos;s a group in there... a cult... and my brother mentioned some kind of... creature.</string>
<string name="23368">I... I don&apos;t know. I&apos;d like to help find him, but I don&apos;t know if I could make it.</string>
<string name="23369"></string>
<string name="23370">It&apos;s the strangest thing: They walk right around it, and don&apos;t attack the people going in. My brother said the creature keeps them safe?</string>
<string name="23371">No clue, but I know they don&apos;t get attacked by the zombies, and I know my brother is acting weirder and weirder.</string>
<string name="23372">Yeah? I could use your help if you are looking to kill things. I think I know something about these undead... </string>
<string name="23373">I could use some. I&apos;m probably going to be dead in an hour. I... might know something about these undead... </string>
<string name="23374">I hope you&apos;re not looters. Not much I can do if you are, but I hope you&apos;re not.</string>
<string name="23375">I hope you&apos;re here as a friend. You look like decent folk, and I&apos;d hate for you to have sunk to looting.</string>
<string name="23376">I need SMART help. I&apos;m probably going to be dead within the hour. I... might know something about these undead.</string>
<string name="23377">He&apos;s dead... I don&apos;t know what to do... </string>
<string name="23378">That&apos;s... that was my brother&apos;s. He always had it with him... he&apos;s dead. I know it.</string>
<string name="23379">Keep safe out there.</string>
<string name="23380">Thank you. At least now I know... Here... you have been more than helpful. Take this...</string>
<string name="23381">I don&apos;t have much to give you... Just keep the ring. It reminds me of how he died, not his life.</string>
<string name="23382">I thank you... I don&apos;t know why you did this, you seem so harsh... but thank you.</string>
<string name="23383">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ve a little gold. I suppose you could take it. Just go now, all right?</string>
<string name="23384">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; What do you want? I&apos;ve nothing left. Just leave me... please.</string>
<string name="23385">Look, maybe I&apos;ve got a little gold... I suppose you could have it... Just go, okay?</string>
<string name="23386">I&apos;ll tell you what I can.</string>
<string name="23387">I suppose. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="23388">All right... just leave me, then. I guess I&apos;ll stay here. Not much I can do on my own.</string>
<string name="23389">His name is Torin. He studied at a mage tower outside Waterdeep for a while, but never stuck with it. He&apos;s been a little lost.</string>
<string name="23390">I think he wanted something that had quicker rewards. He didn&apos;t have much patience for books.</string>
<string name="23391">They don&apos;t want any visitors, either. He uses some sort of key to get in, but it&apos;s not a normal one. Some kind of magic thing.</string>
<string name="23392">I suppose. I hope that means you&apos;ll try and find him. I&apos;m worried.</string>
<string name="23393">I would give it to you, but I don&apos;t have it anymore. I gave it away already, and I sure hope it helps find my brother.</string>
<string name="23394">Maybe... maybe if I was more useful I could have found him already... I don&apos;t know... I&apos;ll just stay here.</string>
<string name="23395">I suppose, though I really wish I could do more. I feel so helpless here. He needs my help. I know it.</string>
<string name="23396">The cult hideout is north of here. If you are going to look for him, that&apos;s where I&apos;d start.</string>
<string name="23397">What? I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m not used to all this pressure. My brother is missing... maybe dead... maybe worse... Give me a break.</string>
<string name="23398">Besides, nobody asked me for it. I just forgot.</string>
<string name="23399"></string>
<string name="23400">I have this thing that he used to get in the hideout... well, I&apos;m sure it&apos;s not important. What do I know?</string>
<string name="23401">I don&apos;t know anything more about it than that. It&apos;s all happened so fast... right about when the zombies started showing up.</string>
<string name="23402">I honestly don&apos;t know what he&apos;s talking about anymore, and now he&apos;s been gone for days.</string>
<string name="23403"></string>
<string name="23404"></string>

<string name="23422">I don&apos;t want to die.</string>
<string name="23423">Nooooooooo.......</string>
<string name="23424">Stay away from me.</string>
<string name="23425">Somebody save me.</string>
<string name="23426">How could the gods be so cruel.</string>
<string name="23427">Please don&apos;t hurt me.</string>
<string name="23428">Thank you for saving me.</string>
<string name="23429">Farewell.</string>
<string name="23430">Anything new you know?</string>
<string name="23431">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is the creature justified? Neverwinter would&apos;ve used it in a spell.</string>
<string name="23432">Me want talk about reward.</string>
<string name="23433">Go over the basic run down of the area.</string>
<string name="23434">A Waterdhavian creature was in another district. Think there&apos;s one here?</string>
<string name="23435">Are there any safe locations in the district?</string>
<string name="23436">Is there an identifiable enemy behind this?</string>
<string name="23437">If I find out anything I&apos;ll let you know.</string>
<string name="23438">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Are the undead linked to the plague? When did this start?</string>
<string name="23439">You know a bossman behind the dead?</string>
<string name="23440">There safe places in this district?</string>
<string name="23441">Water-whosian creature found in other district. One here maybe?</string>
<string name="23442">Me see what me find.</string>
<string name="23443">You go over simple stuff about area.</string>
<string name="23444">Me go now.</string>
<string name="23445">Have you had any updates? Any new information?</string>
<string name="23446">Tell me about the Sword Coast Boys.</string>
<string name="23447">You tell about local Cult thingy.</string>
<string name="23448">Tell me about this local Cult.</string>
<string name="23449">You tell about Sword Coast Boys.</string>
<string name="23450">Me tough and scary. You give more!</string>
<string name="23451">I&apos;m very dangerous, and worth more than that.</string>
<string name="23452">Am I to be rewarded for my efforts? </string>
<string name="23453">Me get reward for doing stuff?</string>
<string name="23454">I found the Waterdhavian Yuan-Ti creature. It raised the zombies.</string>
<string name="23455">Me find Water-daisy creature. Snake Lady. It caused dead problems.</string>
<string name="23456">Reward time. Cough something up or I get nasty.</string>
<string name="23457">Me break faces if no get reward now!</string>
<string name="23458">Farewell.</string>
<string name="23459">Bye bye.</string>
<string name="23460">Thanks. Farewell.</string>
<string name="23461">Me thank you. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="23462">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now. Don&apos;t I deserve more than that?</string>
<string name="23463">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me deserve more. You think so, right?</string>
<string name="23464">I wanted to discuss the reward?</string>
<string name="23465">&lt;FullName&gt; is my name. I&apos;m helping Aribeth.</string>
<string name="23466">Me &lt;FullName&gt;. Me help Aribeth.</string>
<string name="23467">What is my name to you? Why should I tell you?</string>
<string name="23468">Why you care what name me gots? Why me tell you?</string>
<string name="23469">I&apos;ve no time to speak right now. Farewell.</string>
<string name="23470">Me gots no time for you. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="23471">Do you know anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?</string>
<string name="23472">You know anything about Water-whosian creature things?</string>
<string name="23473">I killed the creature that caused the undead.</string>
<string name="23474">Me kill creature that caused undead.</string>
<string name="23475">Back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="23476">Back to other questions, okay?</string>
<string name="23477">What rumors you hear?</string>
<string name="23478">What rumors have you heard?</string>
<string name="23479">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t think that would be very fair. I&apos;ve paid what I can and there&apos;s not much more.</string>
<string name="23480">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; All right, but don&apos;t go wearing out your welcome. This is coming out of my own pocket. Beat it.</string>
<string name="23481">Thank you. Be safe out there.</string>
<string name="23482">A lad named Krestal fears that the Sword Coast Boys have made a deal with a strange creature. Their leader, Drawl, has become a powerful undead.</string>
<string name="23483">You must be with &lt;CUSTOM520&gt;. Do you need a recap of what I told them, or have you something to report?</string>
<string name="23484">Back again, hmm? Need a recap?</string>
<string name="23485">Of course, he may just be worried about his brother, and I can&apos;t spare anyone to investigate the estate. It&apos;s in the northwest if you want to look.</string>
<string name="23486">Gulnan... Where have I heard that... Oh boy. That name was on one of the crates brought from Waterdeep. It must be one of the creatures.</string>
<string name="23487">Gulnan... Where have I heard that... Oh boy. That name was on one of the crates brought from Waterdeep. It must be one of the creatures.</string>
<string name="23488">What the heck did we bring in that could cause a mess like this? I&apos;ll be asking about this when Castle Never is back open, that&apos;s for sure!</string>
<string name="23489">Seach that estate top to bottom. This Gulnan creature had to contact them somehow, and it wasn&apos;t by knocking on the door.</string>
<string name="23490">Don&apos;t go feeling sorry for it. Sure, some of the creatures were a little more... sentient than others... but there&apos;s more to it.</string>
<string name="23491">The spell to cure the plague isn&apos;t supposed to be lethal, and I heard some of these things came willingly, even out of charity.</string>
<string name="23492">Of course, rumors say one was imprisoned in Waterdeep, and probably saw the trip as a chance to escape. Don&apos;t know any more than that, though.</string>
<string name="23493">These are alarming tales, but I can&apos;t spare anyone to check out the warehouse the gang uses as a base. Perhaps you could?</string>
<string name="23494">What the heck did we bring in that could cause a mess like this? I&apos;ll be asking about this when Castle Never is back open, that&apos;s for sure!</string>
<string name="23495">You&apos;d better check the Sword Coast Boys&apos; warehouse in the Beggar&apos;s Nest north central. This Gulnan contacted Drawl somehow, and not by walking the streets openly.</string>
<string name="23496"></string>
<string name="23497">That&apos;s you? I expected green recruits, but I&apos;ve heard how you&apos;ve been helping find those blasted Waterdhavian creatures already! Glad you&apos;ve come.</string>
<string name="23498">You&apos;re one of the new guards? Land and lord, why didn&apos;t you say so? Your job will be finding the source of the zombie infestation.</string>
<string name="23499">I heard some things about the local Sword Coast Boys gang. Don&apos;t know a lot, but they seem involved.</string>
<string name="23500">We&apos;ve been up to our necks in undead. Even deeper for short folk like me. The Beggar&apos;s Nest is just a mess, it is.</string>
<string name="23501">Aribeth has you chasing those things, hmm? Well, don&apos;t blab it around to everyone. If people hear that we lost a shot at the cure... </string>
<string name="23502">I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t know where those things might have gone, and I ain&apos;t even sure what they were. I got zombies to worry about now.</string>
<string name="23503">You&apos;re standing in one. The Helmite Sanctuary is another, though you have to put up with their soggy blessings.</string>
<string name="23504">I got nothing against them, I guess. Gives people hope, but all their splashing hasn&apos;t scared the plague away yet.</string>
<string name="23505">I wish I knew. Like I said, that will be your job. You find out who&apos;s behind this and take &apos;em out.</string>
<string name="23506">The plague was here before the zombies, though, and it was only a few days ago that the undead became a horde.</string>
<string name="23507">Don&apos;t know if the two are linked. Not all plague victims become undead, but the ones that do hardly hit the ground before rising.</string>
<string name="23508">Here&apos;s the thing. I know you&apos;re just supposed to keep the peace, but we&apos;re up against a wall here.</string>
<string name="23509">Keep your voice down, lunk-head. People hear about that and they may lose what hope they have.</string>
<string name="23510">Well, you&apos;re kinda standing in one, smarty. The Helmite temple is another, though you have to suffer their soggy blessings.</string>
<string name="23511">If I knew that I&apos;d do something about it. All I hear about are the zombies. I&apos;ve no idea who might be behind it.</string>
<string name="23512">You find out what&apos;s happening, and I&apos;ll make it worth your while over and above whatever Aribeth wants from you.</string>
<string name="23513">So off you go then. And make sure you talk to Drake if you haven&apos;t. He&apos;s an undead hunter from way back.</string>
<string name="23514">I may say something you already know. I can only repeat what the guards have heard. Some of this you probably did yourself.</string>
<string name="23515">Careful out there. And remember, I&apos;ll make your efforts worth your while.</string>
<string name="23516">Would you like someone to jot this down? You seem to have a problem with retention.</string>
<string name="23517">Not as such. We&apos;re still up to our armpits in dead things. You find anything out, let me know.</string>
<string name="23518">Seems Drawl, the leader of the Sword Coast Boys, has become a powerful undead. Killed his rivals... some of his own gang too. Something named Gulnan was behind it... </string>
<string name="23519">I heard some things about a local Cult, or some such. Don&apos;t know too much, but it seems they are a concern.</string>
<string name="23520">I heard some things about the Sword Coast Boys gang, and a little about a local Cult, or some such. I think they have something to do with the undead.</string>
<string name="23521">A boy named Jemanie suspects a local cult has something to do with the undead. He claims some sort of creature keeps their estate safe from the zombies.</string>
<string name="23522">I guess it&apos;s a snake worshipping cult, of all things. They are in league with someone named Gulnan. </string>
<string name="23523">We were short people to help and you filled the bill. You got your fair share, and now you should leave.</string>
<string name="23524">I knew you&apos;d help us, by Whilliker&apos;s whiskers. I heard about what you did before, and knew you&apos;d take care of business.</string>
<string name="23525">Well now, the details ain&apos;t my business, but you sure helped us. The undead are practically fallin&apos; by themselves.</string>
<string name="23526">If you found anything important in that mess, report it to Aribeth. She&apos;s keeping score, or some such. </string>
<string name="23527">And thank you again. Good luck.</string>
<string name="23528">Fair enough. I know Aribeth is more keen on duty as its own reward. Me, I like coins.</string>
<string name="23529">Snake-Lady? A Yuan-Ti? Dang, they must be desperate for a cure if they were willing to risk messing with one of those.</string>
<string name="23530">I have no information on what to do with it. You&apos;d best take it to Aribeth. She&apos;ll want a look at it.</string>
<string name="23531">A Yuan-Ti? The search for a cure must not be going well if they are willing to risk dealing with one of those.</string>
<string name="23532">No need to get testy. I had gold put aside for whoever helped out. You&apos;ll get your share.</string>
<string name="23533">Here&apos;s 500 gold for you, and an item that I was saving for just the right person. Yer a hero... and likable, too.</string>
<string name="23534">Here&apos;s 500 gold for your trouble. Not a lot in the way of items floating around, but the money will serve you well.</string>
<string name="23535">Here&apos;s 200 gold and a special sword of mine. Not much, I know, but still an interesting little trinket.</string>
<string name="23536">Well, you know, I WOULD do that, but there&apos;s this thing me and Drake have about bullies. We don&apos;t appreciate &apos;em.</string>
<string name="23537">I have already given out a reward. I am very grateful for any assistance, but we can afford no more.</string>
<string name="23538">Well then, what would a person of your manners be doing here? I&apos;ve only a minute, so your introduction must be quick. Too much to do.</string>
<string name="23539">Who might you be, then? Speak up, speak up, I can&apos;t spend much time on pleasantries right now. Too much to do.</string>
<string name="23540">What manner of malcontent are you? Say who you are and why I should bother with you. I&apos;ve got a lot to worry about right now.</string>
<string name="23541">You&apos;ve got no time? Well, join the bloody club. Go on then, and don&apos;t come back unless you&apos;re someone willing to help.</string>
<string name="23542">And why wouldn&apos;t you? Goodness, you are making this unnecessarily difficult. Tell me or don&apos;t, but I have a lot to do.</string>
<string name="23543">Now, who might you be, then? I don&apos;t have a lot of time to talk. We&apos;re busy with clean up now that the zombie threat seems to be over.</string>
<string name="23544">It&apos;s a mess in here right now. We&apos;ve got a zombie infestation, and it will be your job to root out what&apos;s behind it.</string>
<string name="23545"></string>
<string name="23546">I&apos;m sure you did, but I hear that the beast was already turned in to Aribeth. I&apos;ll have to give out my reward to that person.</string>
<string name="23547">Well, I don&apos;t know about that. I&apos;ve already given out a reward for killing that beast. You&apos;d best take your concerns to the person that claimed it.</string>
<string name="23548">Yes, I know, and I have already given you the reward that you deserved. We cannot afford any more.</string>
<string name="23549">There are rumors, sure, but nothing makes much sense right now, and I don&apos;t have time to talk to everyone.</string>
<string name="23550">What do you need to know?</string>
<string name="23551">Like I said, I haven&apos;t had time to talk to anyone about it, but a couple of boys have said they heard things. Krestal and Jemanie.</string>
<string name="23552">Don&apos;t know much about them. Krestal lives just north of the Helmite shrine. Jemanie lives over in the central west section.</string>
<string name="23553">I think Drake will probably tell you of them as well. He&apos;s trying to organize rescues. That&apos;s all I know.</string>
<string name="23554">I heard you turned it in to Aribeth. Good. She&apos;ll know what to do with it.</string>
<string name="23555">It&apos;s in the north central of the Beggar&apos;s Nest, but take care. Drawl has apparently killed off all his rivals... including many of his own gang.</string>
<string name="23556">Where threat from?</string>
<string name="23557">Me continue looking.</string>
<string name="23558">I will continue my investigations.</string>
<string name="23559">I will lend my assistance where required.</string>
<string name="23560">I&apos;ll poke around on my own without your guidance.</string>
<string name="23561">Tell me of any people that need immediate help.</string>
<string name="23562">I will look into it.</string>
<string name="23563">Tell me of Jemanie.</string>
<string name="23564">Tell me of Krestal.</string>
<string name="23565"></string>
<string name="23566">Maybe somebody less squeamish should replace you.</string>
<string name="23567">I&apos;ve seen how dangerous the undead can be.</string>
<string name="23568">Me know how dangerous dead ones are.</string>
<string name="23569">Maybe you scaredy-cat. Somebody probably be better.</string>
<string name="23570">Me help wherever me can.</string>
<string name="23571">You tell about people needing help.</string>
<string name="23572">Me look around without you helping.</string>
<string name="23573"></string>
<string name="23574">Tell me about Krestal lad.</string>
<string name="23575">Tell me about Jemananama-whosis.</string>
<string name="23576">Me look into things.</string>
<string name="23577">Have you found any new information?</string>
<string name="23578">Gots new news at all?</string>
<string name="23579">Tell me about the Sword Coast Boys.</string>
<string name="23580">Tell me &apos;bout Sword Coast Boys.</string>
<string name="23581">Tell me about this Snake Cult.</string>
<string name="23582">Tell about Snake Cult thingy.</string>
<string name="23583">Where do you think the threat originates from?</string>
<string name="23584">Well, I must say that whatever you did in that bloody graveyard, it seems our immediate troubles are over. </string>
<string name="23585">There&apos;s still the plague, of course, but the undead threat seems to be on the wane in this district.</string>
<string name="23586">You should report to Aribeth with whatever you found. Oh, Harben may give you something special as well as reward.</string>
<string name="23587">I knew we could count on you to repeat your success in this district. I had heard good things about you.</string>
<string name="23588">Ahh, you must be with &lt;CUSTOM41&gt;. Will you need me to repeat what they asked me about?</string>
<string name="23589">Ahh, you have returned to me. Do you need me to repeat my earlier information, or have you something else?</string>
<string name="23590">An organization of malevolent fanatics, following someone named Gulnan. They are entrenched in an estate in the northwest of the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="23591">She will have needed access to the cult, so there may be passages that lead to her or her lair.</string>
<string name="23592">You know the area now, so you spearhead the effort. She has taken advantage of a plague-ravaged city, and must be stopped.</string>
<string name="23593">Something was corrupting the young. A creature named Gulnan offered power in exchange for complicity.</string>
<string name="23594">Whoever she is, she will have needed access to the warehouse. Search for passages, and take the fight to her lair.</string>
<string name="23595">You know the area now, so you spearhead the effort. She has taken advantage of a plague-ravaged city, and must be stopped.</string>
<string name="23596">Ah, I have heard of the impact you are making in Neverwinter. Good to know you are on our side today.</string>
<string name="23597">Greetings. Harben told me to expect additional troops arriving. Let me tell you, you are much needed here.</string>
<string name="23598">I&apos;ve never seen an infestation like this. Undead fester over time, but here, they rise before a corpse even cools.</string>
<string name="23599">What we need right now is some order in the streets. People need help, first and foremost. We need you.</string>
<string name="23600">Once people are safe we can find the source of these undead and get down their throats. I&apos;m sure Harben agrees and will reward people accordingly for helping.</string>
<string name="23601">If you learn anything, keep us informed. We must know what we&apos;re dealing with, and if it&apos;s connected to the plague.</string>
<string name="23602">The lad Krestal and the lad Jemanie were spotted barricaded in their homes. More houses may be overrun.</string>
<string name="23603">Jemanie&apos;s home is in the west central section of the district. He has a brother too, but I have no news of him.</string>
<string name="23604">His home is in the central east of the district, north of the Helmite shrine. He is usually with a gang but they appear to have disappeared.</string>
<string name="23605"></string>
<string name="23606">Ha! I wish that were possible. I fight undead. If you can add to my experience, then good, but we gain nothing as adversaries.</string>
<string name="23607">There is always someone better, but we gain more working together. We&apos;ve enough enemies right now.</string>
<string name="23608">I&apos;ve heard a thing or two about the Sword Coast Boys and a Snake Cult, though you probably already know this.</string>
<string name="23609">It was probably your efforts that brought this information to light. Forgive me if I repeat something you know all too well.</string>
<string name="23610">Unknown. We don&apos;t have the men for simple information gathering. It&apos;s vital we find out what is going on, and if it&apos;s plague-related.</string>
<string name="23611">I&apos;ve heard a thing or two about the Sword Coast Boys, though you probably already know this.</string>
<string name="23612">I&apos;ve heard a thing or two about a Snake Cult, though you probably already know this.</string>
<string name="23613">I haven&apos;t heard anything new. Sure could use someone out there to poke around and get some answers.</string>
<string name="23614">Krestal and Jemanie may also know of some strange happenings in the area, but we have not been able to interview them as yet.</string>
<string name="23615"></string>
<string name="23616"></string>
<string name="23617"></string>
<string name="23618"></string>
<string name="23619">What was this Drawl creature?</string>
<string name="23620">You&apos;re dressed like a city guard. Why were you captured?</string>
<string name="23621">You look like city guard. Why you trapped here?</string>
<string name="23622">Who this Drawl creature guy?</string>
<string name="23623">I have questions about Drawl.</string>
<string name="23624">Me gots questions about Drawl.</string>
<string name="23625">I have questions about you, Walters.</string>
<string name="23626">Me gots questions about you, Walters.</string>
<string name="23627">I have questions about the &quot;others&quot; you mentioned. </string>
<string name="23628">Me gots questions about &quot;others&quot; you mention.</string>
<string name="23629">I should get moving. What will you do now?</string>
<string name="23630">Me should get moving. What you do now?</string>
<string name="23631"></string>
<string name="23632"></string>
<string name="23633">I assume he wasn&apos;t always like this?</string>
<string name="23634">He not always like this, was he?</string>
<string name="23635">If he&apos;s just some kid, who gave him this power?</string>
<string name="23636">If he just some jerk, who give him power?</string>
<string name="23637">I need to ask something else.</string>
<string name="23638">Me ask something else.</string>
<string name="23639">Why did you quit the gang and become a guard?</string>
<string name="23640">Why you quit gang to become guard?</string>
<string name="23641">Where are you supposed to be stationed?</string>
<string name="23642">Where you supposed to patrol?</string>
<string name="23643">What happened to them?</string>
<string name="23644">What happen to those guys?</string>
<string name="23645"></string>
<string name="23646"></string>
<string name="23647">Back to my general questions... </string>
<string name="23648">Back to general stuff questions... </string>
<string name="23649"></string>
<string name="23650"></string>
<string name="23651"></string>
<string name="23652"></string>
<string name="23653"></string>
<string name="23654"></string>
<string name="23655"></string>
<string name="23656"></string>
<string name="23657">I think you should make a break for it.</string>
<string name="23658">You maybe make a break for it, okay?</string>
<string name="23659">Just wait here until I clear things out.</string>
<string name="23660">You waits for me to bash streets safe.</string>
<string name="23661">You should just run to the gate.</string>
<string name="23662">Yous just run there, okay?</string>
<string name="23663"></string>
<string name="23664"></string>
<string name="23665">No gang cause all this stuff around here. </string>
<string name="23666"></string>
<string name="23667"></string>
<string name="23668">What is going on around here?</string>
<string name="23669">What going on around heres?</string>
<string name="23670">A gang couldn&apos;t have caused all this trouble.</string>
<string name="23671"></string>
<string name="23672"></string>
<string name="23673">Who helped this Drawl?</string>
<string name="23674">Who behind Drawl for this?</string>
<string name="23675">Why would someone corrupt a gang like that?</string>
<string name="23676">Why someone make gang bad like that?</string>
<string name="23677">Should killing Drawl have stopped the zombies?</string>
<string name="23678">Should making Drawl dead stop zombies?</string>
<string name="23679"></string>
<string name="23680">Thanks for getting rid of Drawl. He&apos;s kept me here for days. Just to show me up, I guess. My name is Walters.</string>
<string name="23681">He used to be a friend of mine, back when I ran with the Sword Coast Boys. Never forgave me for &quot;joining the enemy&quot; as a guard.</string>
<string name="23682">I AM a guard, but I used to run with the Sword Coast Boys. They never forgave me for &quot;joining the enemy.&quot; Especially Drawl.</string>
<string name="23683">I guess he wanted to make an example of me after he... changed. I got off lucky, I guess... not like some others... </string>
<string name="23684">Don&apos;t worry about me! Just kill that fool Drawl! Get him!</string>
<string name="23685">I&apos;ll answer what I can, but we should keep it short. There are still zombies swarming the district. Killing Drawl didn&apos;t get rid of them.</string>
<string name="23686">About me? All right, but we should keep this short. There are still undead swarming all over the Beggar&apos;s Nest, and killing Drawl probably didn&apos;t get rid of them.</string>
<string name="23687"></string>
<string name="23688"></string>
<string name="23689">I&apos;ll answer what I can. Anything to help people not end up like the others in the gang did.</string>
<string name="23690">Well, Drawl was always a jerk. He had big plans for the Sword Coast Boys becoming a mercenary company, but he was lazy. It was all talk.</string>
<string name="23691">The only thing that changed was that he became a *powerful* jerk. He thought he was a lich or something. He was too stupid to see he was just a pawn.</string>
<string name="23692">He was bragging nonstop about someone. I think the name was Gulnan. I don&apos;t know what or who that is. Drawl wouldn&apos;t say.</string>
<string name="23693">Personally, I don&apos;t think he really knew. He was just happy to be tough enough to back up his threats for once.</string>
<string name="23694">I do know that he&apos;d been in contact with this Gulnan a lot, so there&apos;s got to be a link between them around here somewhere.</string>
<string name="23695">Because it&apos;s a job with a future. Drawl promised a lot, but he never delivered. His plans never accomplished anything but petty crime.</string>
<string name="23696">Since I joined the guards I&apos;d been trying to straighten him out, but he wouldn&apos;t listen. Always looking for the easy way, no matter the long term cost.</string>
<string name="23697">I was patrolling near the gate to the city core. They must have noticed I&apos;m missing, but probably can&apos;t spare anyone to look.</string>
<string name="23698">I&apos;ll have to find my way back there eventually. Dangerous with the undead, though.</string>
<string name="23699">Ever since I left, Drawl really tightened his grip on the Sword Coast Boys. He didn&apos;t want anyone else leaving... not alive, anyway.</string>
<string name="23700">A few weeks ago, I guess some of the guys tried to convince Drawl to take the gang out of the city. They wanted to try and avoid the plague.</string>
<string name="23701">Go ahead, but we should keep this short. Killing Drawl didn&apos;t do much to stop the zombies.</string>
<string name="23702">The same thing that happened to all of the boys. Drawl made some deal to become... whatever it was he became, and the rest of them were killed.</string>
<string name="23703">All the old gang... gone. I&apos;m just glad Drawl got what he deserved in the end. Good riddance.</string>
<string name="23704"></string>
<string name="23705"></string>
<string name="23706"></string>
<string name="23707"></string>
<string name="23708"></string>
<string name="23709"></string>
<string name="23710"></string>
<string name="23711"></string>
<string name="23712">I&apos;ll be here at the gate for now. I&apos;m still a bit weak after being trapped in the warehouse.</string>
<string name="23713">I&apos;ll be staying here. I can&apos;t do much for the Sword Coast Boys in my current state. I gotta realize I&apos;m not one of them anymore.</string>
<string name="23714"></string>
<string name="23715">I&apos;d like to get out of here, of course. I don&apos;t know if I could make it to the main gates on my own unless the zombies were taken care of.</string>
<string name="23716"></string>
<string name="23717">Good luck out there. I hope you fix that &quot;Gulnan&quot; Drawl talked about. Get some vengeance for the dead.</string>
<string name="23718"></string>
<string name="23719"></string>
<string name="23720"></string>
<string name="23721"></string>
<string name="23722">You think? I suppose I could try. I&apos;m pretty weak right now but... I guess I don&apos;t have much choice.</string>
<string name="23723">I suppose, but there are still a lot of undead swarming around. Drawl&apos;s benefactor is out there somewhere. I wish I wasn&apos;t so weak right now.</string>
<string name="23724">He&apos;s gone... I know it... Drawl is finally gone. Good riddance. He brought all my old friends down with him... The Sword Coast Boys... all dead.</string>
<string name="23725">Hello to you. I hope the day finds you well. Looks like things are finally settling down in the Beggar&apos;s Nest. The undead are gone.</string>
<string name="23726">Was it you that put an end to what was happening? Thanks, if it was. Is the way to the main gates safe? I&apos;m a bit weak because of all the fighting that was going on.</string>
<string name="23727"></string>
<string name="23728">Things are pretty quiet here at the gate now that the threat in this area is gone. Saves the guards a lot of worry.</string>
<string name="23729">I suppose it would be all right now. There&apos;s not too much danger now that the undead seem to be gone. Thanks for your help.</string>
<string name="23730"></string>
<string name="23731"></string>
<string name="23732"></string>
<string name="23733"></string>
<string name="23734"></string>
<string name="23735"></string>
<string name="23736">I agree. If you were in on destroying Drawl, you know that he had far too much power for the smalltime hood that he was.</string>
<string name="23737">The Beggar&apos;s Nest is obviously under siege by undead. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s doing it, but it sure made a mess of the Sword Coast Boys.</string>
<string name="23738">Drawl seemed to have made some sort of deal for the power he received. He corrupted the whole gang... some used to be my friends... </string>
<string name="23739">I don&apos;t know. He bragged about someone named Gulnan... said he was her &quot;Lieutenant of Evil.&quot; I bet he gave himself the title. Adolescent garbage.</string>
<string name="23740">Whoever or whatever Gulnan is, the two of them must have had a way to meet. Have you thoroughly checked the warehouse? Some strange things went on.</string>
<string name="23741">Well, if they got some willing people, maybe they&apos;d make better henchmen than mindless zombies. I don&apos;t know anything about undead.</string>
<string name="23742">It could be that they just wanted to cause chaos... or make people afraid that even people without the plague could turn on them... </string>
<string name="23743">I doubt it. Drawl couldn&apos;t have been behind it all. He was an idiot. A tough one, but still an idiot. He was pure patsy.</string>
<string name="23744">Stopping the zombies probably means finding this &quot;Gulnan&quot; creature Drawl was bragging about. Don&apos;t know anything about how to do that, though.</string>
<string name="23745"></string>
<string name="23746">You cannot defeat me! Gulnan has made me immortal!</string>
<string name="23747">Yes, fight! You&apos;ll see! You&apos;ll see!</string>
<string name="23748">Who are you to come here?! Do your worst! You will see how futile it is!</string>
<string name="23749">You can never leave the gang... I will have Gulnan kill you last so you see everything fall!</string>
<string name="23750">See what you lost? I am powerful now! She has given me this!</string>
<string name="23751">You look like hell, man. Dead doesn&apos;t suit you.</string>
<string name="23752">You should never have left, Walters. Look at what I have now!</string>
<string name="23753"></string>
<string name="23754"></string>
<string name="23755">No! NO! Not the link! Her power must reach me! I am strong! I am strong with her help! I AM!!</string>
<string name="23756">This pillar of light radiates necromantic energies. Just being close to it makes you feel uneasy</string>
<string name="23757"></string>
<string name="23758"></string>
<string name="23759"></string>
<string name="23760"></string>
<string name="23761"></string>
<string name="23762">I do follow the serpent.</string>
<string name="23763">Me like snakes</string>
<string name="23764">Goodbye</string>
<string name="23765">&lt;StartAction&gt;A wall of force blocks the way as an ethereal voice begins to speak.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="23766">Only those who follow the serpent may enter. Do you bear the proper sign?</string>
<string name="23767">Infidel! Only those who carry the token are true followers! You shall not pass!</string>
<string name="23768">I see you carry the symbol. Welcome &lt;race&gt; one, follower of the scale. All praise to our new matron! All praise to Gulnan!</string>
<string name="23769">There are outsiders present! The incantation is soiled!</string>
<string name="23770">The magic is tainted! Gulnan&apos;s servant will not be fully controlled!</string>
<string name="23771">Abandon the Spell! The outsiders taint it.</string>
<string name="23772">Ooooh, this isn&apos;t good.</string>
<string name="23773">You&apos;re not one of us!</string>
<string name="23774">You&apos;re a potential threat, so you can rot here.</string>
<string name="23775">Oh, what the hell. I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="23776">I am leaving. What should I do about you, hmm?</string>
<string name="23777">Cease your raving!</string>
<string name="23778">Relax, I will help, but I have some questions.</string>
<string name="23779">You relax. Me help, but gots questions first.</string>
<string name="23780">Shut up or me leave you.</string>
<string name="23781">Me leave. What me do about you, hmm?</string>
<string name="23782">Whatever. Me see what me can do.</string>
<string name="23783">You rot here &apos;cause you maybe be dangerous later.</string>
<string name="23784">Who are you?</string>
<string name="23785">Who you?</string>
<string name="23786">Scaled Worm? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="23787">What you mean, Scaled Worm?</string>
<string name="23788">How did you end up in here?</string>
<string name="23789">How you get put in here?</string>
<string name="23790">What do you think this Gulnan is?</string>
<string name="23791">What you think Gulnan is?</string>
<string name="23792">Where is she?</string>
<string name="23793">Where she go?</string>
<string name="23794">Back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="23795">Back to other questions, okay?</string>
<string name="23796">You would defeat her if released? She already beat you.</string>
<string name="23797">You defeat her if released? She beat you already once.</string>
<string name="23798">What god does she sacrifice to?</string>
<string name="23799">What god she kill stuff for?</string>
<string name="23800">Focus? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="23801">What you mean by focus thing?</string>
<string name="23802">Foul minion of darkness, you&apos;ll stay imprisoned here.</string>
<string name="23803">You bad, so you stay here like in jail.</string>
<string name="23804">I see her influence fading... Muuaahaha! She&apos;s gone! Gulnan of the pathetic little scaled worms is gone! Praise the Prince of Lies!</string>
<string name="23805">Yes! I shall rebuild the grand and glorious cabal of Cyric I had so long planned to unleash upon the city in its weakest moments... er... </string>
<string name="23806">What I mean, of course, is that the followers of Cyric will aid the city as best they can. Yes... yes of course they will. Let me out. Do it.</string>
<string name="23807">Tormentors! More of you walk free as I languish! Cyric, free me! The scaled worm Gulnan will not have my temple! She will not!</string>
<string name="23808">By the Black Sun, how could she fell me?! The snake gods are pitiful! Beneath the notice of mighty Cyric!</string>
<string name="23809">Oh, certainly! Bully the man in the cage. How sporting! As bold as the scaled worm that seduced my flock, and now takes their lives! The indignity!</string>
<string name="23810">Great, I&apos;m at the mercy of a simpleton. Can you even understand what she has done? That scaled worm has stolen my flock!</string>
<string name="23811">Questions? Oh, certainly. After all, what else am I doing? Just languishing here while my flock are taken to the altar of a worm! A scaled worm!</string>
<string name="23812">Who am I? I am a follower of the great god Cyric! I am a servant of the coming Day of the Dark Sun! I am his will!</string>
<string name="23813">&quot;Who am I,&quot; it barks. Can you fathom the greatness of who I follow, the mighty Cyric? Can you fathom his glory?</string>
<string name="23814">I am Jared, and I am also caged like so many worthless enemies of the Prince of Lies that I have put to their end!</string>
<string name="23815">My flock... my flock are usurped, but I shall not bow! I shall not bend! Cyric shall see to my freedom!</string>
<string name="23816">I was usurped, if you must know! She corrupted the weakest of my flock, and now the rest follow or join her legions of undead!</string>
<string name="23817">I am to be gutted upon her altar! ME! It&apos;s not right! Jared of Cyric does the gutting! Not some scaled worm!</string>
<string name="23818">Treacherous snake-woman! It calls itself Gulnan! I call it usurper! Cyric, why was she able to defeat me?! I follow the Word!</string>
<string name="23819">I suppose you mean physically? Yuan-Ti. Snake-beast wench. Dead, if I get my hands on her! I&apos;ll make boots from her flanks!</string>
<string name="23820">I WASN&apos;T READY! She was sneaky! She was supposed to be weak! She&apos;s a scaled worm, damn it! Where did she get such power?!</string>
<string name="23821">In the crypts. She&apos;s using the undead... an army of corpses. I would be impressed IF IT WAS ME DOING IT!</string>
<string name="23822">What indeed! Not the god of her pathetic people, whatever name such a whelp goes by. Cyric would not have allowed that defeat!</string>
<string name="23823">She cheats! She&apos;s got some power on her side! One that dares ignore my true calling! One that abuses the focus I created!</string>
<string name="23824">Grrr... if you dared beg this knowledge at any other time I would skin you alive. It is not for outsiders to know... but... </string>
<string name="23825">I will not allow her to keep it... even if that means some pawn like you taking it from her. It is a tool, a darkly magic stone.</string>
<string name="23826">It makes the flesh of the dead... useful... for things. Take it from her! It is mine by right! It is pledged to Cyric, not her false lord, whatever it is.</string>
<string name="23827">Well, imbecile, you should fear the will of Cyric and appease him! Release his loyal servant so my dark work in his name continues!</string>
<string name="23828">Really, you should let me out. Such an action will speak well of you, and guarantee a swift, merciful death when my Lord rules all.</string>
<string name="23829">I shall build anew for Cyric! I will... I will use her beguiling techniques... yessss. Now... if someone would just LET ME THE HELL OUT!</string>
<string name="23830">What?! Pawn of order! You will all feel the wrath of Cyric in the end times! I will not be caged! Er... not for long, anyway!</string>
<string name="23831">A wise move... IF IT WAS ME MAKING IT! Let me out of here! Cyric let me loose that I might... I might... </string>
<string name="23832">Please? Come on!</string>
<string name="23833">Free! The will of Cyric shall descend upon this weakened city like... like... like some suitable metaphor I&apos;ll think of later! Oh yes, fear my coming retort! Uh... goodbye!</string>
<string name="23834">By Cyric, I would speak with you!</string>
<string name="23835">Ugh... visions... cannot lie!?</string>
<string name="23836">The plague is a gift! It grants an army for the taking!</string>
<string name="23837">Scales! Scales will defeat you!</string>
<string name="23838">I have seen the visions! You cannot deny the power!</string>
<string name="23839">Warmbloods! Vermin! No more than mice or rats!</string>
<string name="23840">Here is where you become my MEAT!</string>
<string name="23841">Hear my voice through your dead! You thought to use me, to sacrifice for a spell! I have used you to free myself!</string>
<string name="23842">You will join my legion of dead! I have seen the visions! The scaled ones will rule here! I will overrun!</string>
<string name="23843">The plague weakens you, but strengthens my army! It is a blessing! A gift! You cannot imagine the gift!</string>
<string name="23844">You cannot deny that the scales will rule! See the power I am granted?! It is incredible, and beyond even Merrshaulk!</string>
<string name="23845">Come if you must, but you will die! The visions cannot lie! I see the coming of the eye! The eye!</string>
<string name="23846">This is Bloodsailor territory. Get out!</string>
<string name="23847">Off in the distance you hear the sound of a door opening.</string>
<string name="23848">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="23849">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="23850">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="23851">Have you heard anything about a cure for the Wailing Death?</string>
<string name="23852">Did you know anything about the attack on the Academy?</string>
<string name="23853">How did you end up here tending the afflicted.</string>
<string name="23854">Have you heard any rumors lately? You know, gossip and the like?</string>
<string name="23855">You know stuff &apos;bout cure for sick?</string>
<string name="23856">What you know &apos;bout fight at Academy?</string>
<string name="23857">You be nurse. How you get your job here?</string>
<string name="23858">You hear gossip or rumors or stuff?</string>
<string name="23859">That&apos;s it? You haven&apos;t heard the rumors about a cure from Waterdeep?</string>
<string name="23860">You not hear stuff &apos;bout cure from Waterdeep?</string>
<string name="23861">Tell me what you&apos;ve heard about Desther.</string>
<string name="23862">Tell me what you&apos;ve heard about Aribeth.</string>
<string name="23863">Tell me what you&apos;ve heard about Fenthick.</string>
<string name="23864">Tell what you hear &apos;bout Desther.</string>
<string name="23865">Tell what you hear &apos;bout Aribeth.</string>
<string name="23866">Tell what you hear &apos;bout Fenthick.</string>
<string name="23867">What were they saying?</string>
<string name="23868">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You don&apos;t like Desther much, do you?</string>
<string name="23869">What them say?</string>
<string name="23870">Aren&apos;t you afraid of contracting the plague yourself?</string>
<string name="23871">You not scared you get sick, too?</string>
<string name="23872">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="23873">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="23874">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="23875">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="23876">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="23877">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="23878">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="23879">Neverwinter big place. Me need directions.</string>
<string name="23880">Greetings, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. How may I be of service? </string>
<string name="23881">May whatever gods you pray to keep you safe from the plague.</string>
<string name="23882">On your way, then. I&apos;ve got too many sick and suffering to waste my time on long goodbyes.</string>
<string name="23883">Off with you, then. I&apos;ve no time for the likes of you.</string>
<string name="23884">Your mind is feeble, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Never fear, I am used to dealing with patients whose minds have become enfeebled. I&apos;ll speak slow so you understand.</string>
<string name="23885">I really should be tending the sick, but for you my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; I can spare a few moments.</string>
<string name="23886">I really should be tending the sick, but I can spare a few moments, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="23887">Make it quick - my time is better spent easing the suffering of my patients.</string>
<string name="23888">There&apos;s no cure for the plague - everybody knows that! All I can do is try to ease their suffering and make their last days less painful.</string>
<string name="23889">I heard Fenthick and Desther whispering about it once, but they clammed up right as soon as they saw me. That Desther gave me a foul look.</string>
<string name="23890">I was a midwife, before the plague. But there ain&apos;t many babies being born now - not live ones, anyhow. I heard Castle Never needed nurses to tend their sick and dying, so I came.</string>
<string name="23891">I&apos;ve heard my share. Desther and Aribeth are always arguing and Fenthick&apos;s always trying to keep the peace.</string>
<string name="23892">Some people won&apos;t have nothing to do with the sick. They board themselves up in their homes and don&apos;t come out for no reason. And they still get the Wailing Death. </string>
<string name="23893">Is there something else you wanted to know? Or can I get back to my duties?</string>
<string name="23894">Aribeth doesn&apos;t like him, I know that much. He&apos;s got a sharp tongue and a sour face, but I think it&apos;s more than that. But it&apos;s not really my place to speak of such things.</string>
<string name="23895">Lady Aribeth&apos;s always telling Fenthick not to put so much faith in Desther and his Helmites. You know they&apos;re lovers? Fenthick and Aribeth, I mean. Of course you know. Everybody knows. </string>
<string name="23896">Poor Fenthick. He&apos;s caught in the middle between Desther and Aribeth, always ends up having to pick one side or the other when they argue about how to save the city.</string>
<string name="23897">Well I suppose that&apos;s about as direct as one can get.</string>
<string name="23898">You interested in more of my gossip, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="23899">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Desther and his Helmites showed up soon after the plague started, just in time to get locked inside the city when the quarantine hit. </string>
<string name="23900">Desther says they came because they heard about Neverwinter&apos;s suffering, but it seems like odd timing to Lady Aribeth. Or so she told Fenthick once.</string>
<string name="23901">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but I better not say anymore. Desther&apos;s just over there on the other side of the room.</string>
<string name="23902">A cure from Waterdeep? How they going to get it in here with Neverwinter under quarantine! Throw it up over the walls? You&apos;re talking crazy.</string>
<string name="23903">Is there something else you need? If not I really should get back to the sick.</string>
<string name="23904">Desther was saying the attack was all Aribeth&apos;s fault, and Fenthick was trying to defend her. That&apos;s all I heard.</string>
<string name="23905">Do you have more questions? If not, I really should get back to my duties.</string>
<string name="23906">He&apos;s sour, that one. A bitter man with a sharp tongue. But he&apos;s a man of the cloth, and his Helmites do good work around the city, helping the sick. </string>
<string name="23907">Desther&apos;s not a real friendly sort, but I guess that ain&apos;t no crime. I just try to stay out of his way.</string>
<string name="23908">Is there something I can do for you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="23909">What do you want? And be quick about it - can&apos;t you see how busy I am here?</string>
<string name="23910">As much as most, less than some I suppose. I&apos;ve seen my share of the dead and dying since I started to work here tending the sick.</string>
<string name="23911">I&apos;m here to tend the sick and the dying, not play tour guide. </string>
<string name="23912">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="23913">Yes, I suppose it would seem large to someone like you, wouldn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="23914">The Helmites don&apos;t catch it from helping the sick, so why should I? The plague takes who it wants, when it wants. Nothing anyone can do about that.</string>
<string name="23915">None of them pay any attention to a quiet little nurse going about her duties, so I&apos;ve heard all sorts of stuff about each and every one of them.</string>
<string name="23916">Besides, all you have to do is go outside Castle Never&apos;s front door. The Core District has every kind of shop, store or inn you&apos;ll ever need, I suspect.</string>
<string name="23917">You think he&apos;d always side with Aribeth, being they&apos;re lovers and all. But Fenthick&apos;s an honest man, and when Aribeth is wrong he&apos;s not afraid to tell her so.</string>
<string name="23918"></string>
<string name="23919"></string>
<string name="23920">&lt;StartAction&gt;Speak the word &quot;Halueth.&quot;&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="23921">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="23922">There is something strange about this bookshelf. There might be an opening behind it, but the shelf resists any physical attempt to move it.</string>
<string name="23923">I am in service to Aribeth as a guard, just like you.</string>
<string name="23924">Me works for Aribeth as guard like you.</string>
<string name="23925">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="23926">My purpose here is not your business.</string>
<string name="23927">You not need to know stuff about me.</string>
<string name="23928">I have been sent here by Oleff to see Briley.</string>
<string name="23929">Me sent by Oleff to speak with Briley.</string>
<string name="23930">Can I ask you questions about this place?</string>
<string name="23931">Maybe me ask you stuff about this place?</string>
<string name="23932">Can I ask you about the district or the plague?</string>
<string name="23933">Maybe me ask about district or the plague thing?</string>
<string name="23934">This area is in the care of the Temple of Tyr. May I inquire as to what you hope to find here?</string>
<string name="23935">Yes, yes. On your way, then.</string>
<string name="23936"></string>
<string name="23937">I see. Recent academy graduate, hmm? Well, go on in. Guards are allowed, as are people with permission from Oleff in the Tyrran Temple.</string>
<string name="23938"></string>
<string name="23939"></string>
<string name="23940">I have been instructed to allow anyone associated with the city guard or the Temple of Tyr access to the dig below.</string>
<string name="23941">What are you doing here? State your intent to me.</string>
<string name="23942">I have been hired to make sure that nobody makes trouble here. If you won&apos;t tell me why you are here, then I won&apos;t let you pass.</string>
<string name="23943">If you have any questions regarding this place, I suggest you take them up with Briley below, or Oleff in the Temple in the City Core.</string>
<string name="23944">Ah, I see. Yes, you seem to have a letter from him. Hmm, aren&apos;t you one of the new recruits for the city guard as well? A recent academy graduate?</string>
<string name="23945">I&apos;ll make certain that only other city guards are allowed in as well. You make sure that nothing goes wrong while you&apos;re here, all right? Right.</string>
<string name="23946">Don&apos;t know nothing about it. I just guard what I&apos;m told to guard. Looks like nothing but a hole in the ground to me.</string>
<string name="23947">I don&apos;t know this district very well. I think that&apos;s why I got this assignment. The other guards didn&apos;t want to be stationed here.</string>
<string name="23948">As for the plague, I know I don&apos;t want it and that&apos;s enough. Now get going, all right? I&apos;m not supposed to be talking to people.</string>
<string name="23949">Inscribed on the chest are the words &quot;A wall at arms length.&quot;</string>
<string name="23950">Inscribed on the chest are the words &quot;Tooth of the forge.&quot;</string>
<string name="23951">Inscribed on the chest are the words &quot;A splinter delivered in flight.&quot;</string>
<string name="23952">Inscribed on the chest are the words &quot;Diamond of the forest, if the seasons never changed.&quot;</string>
<string name="23953">What do you have?</string>
<string name="23954">What you got?</string>
<string name="23955">Nothing.</string>
<string name="23956">What can I get you?</string>
<string name="23957">I need a Pass Coin.</string>
<string name="23958">Me need Pass Coin.</string>
<string name="23959">Let me see your wares.</string>
<string name="23960">What you got?</string>
<string name="23961">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="23962">Here&apos;s 200 gold.</string>
<string name="23963">Me give 200 gold.</string>
<string name="23964">I don&apos;t have enough.</string>
<string name="23965">Me not have enough.</string>
<string name="23966">What can I get you?</string>
<string name="23967">They&apos;re 200 gold each. Remember you&apos;ll need to talk to Ophala before she&apos;ll let you upstairs.</string>
<string name="23968">Well, the boys and girls in the backroom will be waiting for you when you can afford it. They&apos;re well worth the price.</string>
<string name="23969">When you get upstairs, just give this to the companion of your choice.</string>
<string name="23970">Moonstone Mask closed. Direct all complaints to &lt;CUSTOM625&gt;.</string>

<string name="24128">Do you know anything about the Wailing Death?</string>
<string name="24129">Anything interesting going on here in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="24130">I&apos;m looking for work.</string>
<string name="24131">You know stuff &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="24132">There be interesting stuff happen here in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="24133">Me look for work.</string>
<string name="24134"></string>
<string name="24135"></string>
<string name="24136"></string>
<string name="24137"></string>
<string name="24138"></string>
<string name="24139"></string>
<string name="24140"></string>
<string name="24141"></string>
<string name="24142"></string>
<string name="24143"></string>
<string name="24144"></string>
<string name="24145"></string>
<string name="24146"></string>
<string name="24147"></string>
<string name="24148">I&apos;m sorry, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Only guests of Hodge are allowed to enter his estate. The guards inside are under strict orders.</string>
<string name="24149"></string>
<string name="24150"></string>
<string name="24151"></string>
<string name="24152"></string>
<string name="24153">I&apos;m just a guard trying to do his duty. Well, actually I&apos;m not much of a guard. I was the butler, but the door guard fell to the plague.</string>
<string name="24154">I&apos;m on duty, so I really shouldn&apos;t be chatting... but it gets awful boring just standing here. Usually I&apos;m cleaning inside.</string>
<string name="24155">Ask your questions and I&apos;ll do my best to answer them.</string>
<string name="24156">Well, actually, I don&apos;t much care one way or the other. If you are set on entering, I&apos;m not going to get in your way. I&apos;m not really much of a fighter.</string>
<string name="24157">Huh - not too bright, are you? I&apos;ll speak slow so you understand.</string>
<string name="24158"></string>
<string name="24159">Goodbye. Do as you will. I&apos;m not paid enough to worry about this.</string>
<string name="24160">You better step back. Only those in the company of Mr. Hodge are allowed to enter his estate.</string>
<string name="24161">Get lost! Only guests of Mr. Hodge are allowed in, and as low as he might be, I don&apos;t think he would stoop to associate with your type.</string>
<string name="24162">I only know what everyone&apos;s been saying. We&apos;re all doomed unless Aribeth and her crew can find a cure.</string>
<string name="24163">Nothing you haven&apos;t heard before, I&apos;d bet. Was there anything else?</string>
<string name="24164">Interesting? What would I know about interesting? This is the first I&apos;ve been outside in weeks. I&apos;m usually inside, minding the dusting and whatnot.</string>
<string name="24165">Who&apos;d want to hire someone as dumb as you? Not that it matters, anyway.</string>
<string name="24166">I ain&apos;t doing any hiring myself, and I don&apos;t know anyone who is. I&apos;m just a butler... guard too, I guess. Anything else you need?</string>
<string name="24167"></string>
<string name="24168"></string>
<string name="24169"></string>
<string name="24170"></string>
<string name="24171"></string>
<string name="24172"></string>
<string name="24173">I&apos;m supposed to be the butler, after all. I&apos;m only filling in because the door guard died of plague. I wouldn&apos;t go in, though. It&apos;s not safe.</string>
<string name="24174"></string>
<string name="24175"></string>
<string name="24176"></string>
<string name="24177"></string>
<string name="24178"></string>
<string name="24179"></string>
<string name="24180"></string>
<string name="24181"></string>
<string name="24182"></string>
<string name="24183"></string>
<string name="24184">Earth came first.</string>
<string name="24185">Earth was followed by Water.</string>
<string name="24186">Next came Air.</string>
<string name="24187"></string>
<string name="24188">Fire is the end. Fire is my end.</string>
<string name="24189">This portal will not work for you.</string>
<string name="24190">Someone is already taking the test. You must wait.</string>
<string name="24191">Aye, you&apos;d be a good one to watch in the ring. Just enough panache to win the crowd.</string>
<string name="24192">Hmph. People are mad they sealed off the Blacklake district to keep out the plague. As long as I&apos;m inside I don&apos;t care.</string>
<string name="24193">Hmph! I&apos;m surprised you are here. Weren&apos;t most of the louts like you put out when the barricades went up?</string>
<string name="24194">My word! Put some decent clothing on at least, &lt;man/woman&gt;!</string>
<string name="24195">You can&apos;t run around town without anything on! Are you mad?</string>
<string name="24196">Err... forgot to put on your clothing to&lt;day/night&gt;, did you?</string>
<string name="24197">Ran into some trouble downstairs, did you?</string>
<string name="24198">Whoah, don&apos;t get your blood in my beer, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="24199">That must have been some fight you were in. Did you take the prize?</string>
<string name="24200">You&apos;re a rather slow one, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="24201">Sorry, but I&apos;ve got no time to talk to mor... err, that is, I have to go.</string>
<string name="24202">I would chat, but I&apos;d probably talk too fast for you.</string>
<string name="24203">Must you brandish that thing about up here? Save it for the cellars!</string>
<string name="24204">Stop waving that about, will you, &lt;mister/missus&gt;? Upstairs ain&apos;t the place for it.</string>
<string name="24205">Looking to put another notch in that weapon, &lt;mister/missus&gt;?</string>
<string name="24206">Welcome to the Den of Iniquity, holy roller... </string>
<string name="24207">A good &lt;day/night&gt; to you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Is the temple sending contestants, now, too?</string>
<string name="24208">Ha, folks, we&apos;ve got ourselves a holy &lt;man/woman&gt; to&lt;day/night&gt;!</string>
<string name="24209">Hmph. Best keep your magics to yourself around here, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="24210">Wizards and such are not very welcome in these parts.</string>
<string name="24211">You should have stayed in your tower, of wherever it is you folk come from.</string>
<string name="24212">It&apos;s always good to see a &lt;race&gt; face these days.</string>
<string name="24213">It&apos;s always a delight to see another &lt;race&gt; face around here.</string>
<string name="24214">Be wary of the humans in this town. They&apos;ll tax you extra for your &lt;race&gt; blood, I&apos;m not joking.</string>
<string name="24215">Hello, miss. Might I say that you&apos;re looking mighty pretty today?</string>
<string name="24216">Always a pleasure to bump into a pretty lass like yourself.</string>
<string name="24217">We sure don&apos;t have many local girls who look like you.</string>
<string name="24218">My, my. Hello there, handsome.</string>
<string name="24219">If there were more men about like you, this town wouldn&apos;t be so boring.</string>
<string name="24220">(sigh) I suppose you already have a lady friend of your own... </string>
<string name="24221">Hmm, I don&apos;t know if the Board Laid Bare is the place for nice folks such as yourself.</string>
<string name="24222">Just between you and me, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, wouldn&apos;t you say the Wailing&apos;s put a dent in the merchants&apos; coffers?</string>
<string name="24223">It&apos;s horrible, with the quarantine in place, they haven&apos;t been able to import my favorite ale.</string>
<string name="24224">It&apos;s cold for this time of year. I do pity the folks that have lost their homes to looting. I may even do something to help... but not until the plague is over, of course.</string>
<string name="24225">More plague-waifs cluttering up the place, I see. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="24226">Stand away from me, you, before I call the tavern guards!</string>
<string name="24227">You must be from up in the mountains... or maybe even further, right?</string>
<string name="24228">Ah, the Board Laid Bare&apos;s a good place for a savage brute like you.</string>
<string name="24229">Were you brought up by bears, perhaps? It smells like it.</string>
<string name="24230">Well, wonderful. More &lt;race&gt; scum wandering about. If that isn&apos;t all we need.</string>
<string name="24231">I have better things to do than chat with any &lt;race&gt; n&apos;er-do-well who wanders by.</string>
<string name="24232">Oh, hello. You&apos;re one of those &lt;race&gt; folk, right?</string>
<string name="24233">Good &lt;day/night&gt; to you, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;! How runs the tavern?</string>
<string name="24234">Good fight. You won your first badge.</string>
<string name="24235">Wow, your second badge. I bet you&apos;re going to go all the way.</string>
<string name="24236">You did it! You got the third badge. Claudus is going down!</string>
<string name="24237">I&apos;ve never seen such a fight! I even got hit with the blood spray! I&apos;m never going to wash again.</string>
<string name="24238">I love a good fight.</string>
<string name="24239">A new contestant. Come talk to me, I&apos;m the coordinator.</string>
<string name="24240">All of the animal cages have opened.</string>
<string name="24241">&lt;StartAction&gt;Use the Transport via Plants scroll to transform the tree into a portal through which the animals in the zoo can escape when released.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="24242">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="24243">Before you stands a mighty tree.</string>
<string name="24244">Hello &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="24245">Lord Nasher&apos;s men will soon find a cure.</string>
<string name="24246">I wish I shared your optimism.</string>
<string name="24247">Begone peasant!</string>
<string name="24248">Got a silver?</string>
<string name="24249">*Grumble*</string>
<string name="24250">Damn freeloader.</string>
<string name="24251">You should be indoors.</string>
<string name="24252">It dosn&apos;t matter, we&apos;ll all catch it soon enough.</string>
<string name="24253">Get away from me, you may be diseased.</string>
<string name="24254">No more than you.</string>
<string name="24255">You can&apos;t loiter by the gate. Aribeth&apos;s orders.</string>
<string name="24256">I&apos;m not trying to escape. I wouldn&apos;t have anywhere to go.</string>
<string name="24257">Would you accept Helm&apos;s blessing in this troubled time?</string>
<string name="24258">You have already blessed my entire family. Thank you.</string>
<string name="24259">I heard about your daughter. I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="24260">Ilmater will look after her until I join her.</string>
<string name="24261">I heard Desther is working on a cure.</string>
<string name="24262">He had better hurry. Every day someone I know starts the Wailing.</string>
<string name="24263">That&apos;s the one we were told about.</string>
<string name="24264">Get the cure reagent!</string>
<string name="24265">Kill the enemy!</string>
<string name="24266">We cannot fail in our task.</string>
<string name="24267">We must not fail in our task.</string>
<string name="24268">Kill the enemy!</string>
<string name="24269">Let me see your wares.</string>
<string name="24270">Me want to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="24271">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="24272">Step right up! I&apos;ve got just what you&apos;re looking for. My shop ain&apos;t what it used to be, but I&apos;m still a shopkeeper, nonetheless.</string>
<string name="24273">Whoever has been piling these disease-ridden corpses for burning has long ago fled. If you had a torch you could continue his work.</string>
<string name="24274">It will take a long time for these bodies to be consumed by the flames.</string>
<string name="24275">You must be one of the new city guard. Hopefully you can do something about those zombies in the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="24276">You must be one of the new city guard. Hopefully you can do something about those zombies in the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="24277">Hmph! You look like you must be one of them escaped convicts from the prison break in the Peninsula district!</string>
<string name="24278">What are you doing with no clothes?! You want to get sick and catch the plague?</string>
<string name="24279">Why are you naked? You must be plague stricken! Get away from me!</string>
<string name="24280">A naked plague victim! Don&apos;t touch me! </string>
<string name="24281">Those wounds look terrible! You better get looked after before you come down with the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="24282">You&apos;re bleeding all over the place! Get some healing before your wounds get infected with plague!</string>
<string name="24283">That must have been some fight you were in. Don&apos;t those wounds hurt?</string>
<string name="24284">You aren&apos;t quite right in the head, are you? Maybe you escaped during the prison break in the Penisula district.</string>
<string name="24285">I heard the Beggar&apos;s Nest is crawling with zombies infected by the plague! </string>
<string name="24286">Not too bright, are you? Maybe your mind was destroyed by the plague! Get away from me!</string>
<string name="24287">Quit waving your weapon around like a thug! Criminals aren&apos;t running things around here - this isn&apos;t the Docks district!</string>
<string name="24288">I heard the Blacklake district nobles have a cure for the plague, but they won&apos;t share it with us common folk!</string>
<string name="24289">Think carrying that weapon will keep the Wailing Death at bay?</string>
<string name="24290">You&apos;re a priest! Why has your god let the Wailing Death kill so many of us!?</string>
<string name="24291">You&apos;re a cleric - why don&apos;t you do something about the zombies terrorizing the Beggar&apos;s Nest! </string>
<string name="24292">You&apos;re a holy &lt;man/woman&gt; - can&apos;t you make the nobles in the Blacklake district share their cure with the rest of us?</string>
<string name="24293">Hmph. Best keep your magics to yourself around here, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Some blame sorcery for the plague!</string>
<string name="24294">There&apos;s anarchy in the Docks district! I heard criminals have taken over and the city guard are afraid to go in there now.</string>
<string name="24295">Heard about the prison break in the Peninsula district? As if the plague wasn&apos;t bad enough!</string>
<string name="24296">They say plague corpses walk the streets in the Beggar&apos;s Nest, feasting on the living!</string>
<string name="24297">The nobles in the Blacklake district have sealed themselves away from everyone. There&apos;s something strange there, mark my words!</string>
<string name="24298">Be wary of the humans in this town. They&apos;ll tax you extra for your &lt;race&gt; blood, I&apos;m not joking.</string>
<string name="24299">A pretty girl like you should stay away from places like the Docks. They are rough at the best of times.</string>
<string name="24300">Them nobles are up to something in the Blacklake district. I hear they got themselves a secret cure for the plague!</string>
<string name="24301">We sure don&apos;t have many local girls who look like you - not since the plague killed &apos;em all off.</string>
<string name="24302">Ain&apos;t you handsome! Better stay away from the Docks - the thugs there will mess up that pretty face something awful.</string>
<string name="24303">Them nobles are up to something in the Blacklake district. I hear they got themselves a secret cure for the plague!</string>
<string name="24304">You&apos;re a handsome one. Just don&apos;t catch the plague, or your looks won&apos;t last long. </string>
<string name="24305">A word of advice: be careful. If you catch the Wailing Death, you&apos;ll not be among the living for long. </string>
<string name="24306">I heard there was a prison break in the Peninsula district. I wonder if the rumors are true.</string>

<string name="24310">People like you belong in the Docks district - along with the rest of the thugs and ruffians!</string>
<string name="24311">You must be from up in the mountains... or maybe even further, right? The plague spread up there yet?</string>
<string name="24312">What a brute you are! You must have escaped during the prison break in the Peninsula district. </string>
<string name="24313">You&apos;re obviously a thug. Say, are you a member of that criminal organization that&apos;s taken over the Docks district?</string>
<string name="24314">Well, wonderful. More &lt;race&gt; rabble wandering about. Plague carriers are what your kind are!</string>
<string name="24315">The city guard can&apos;t keep order anymore! They don&apos;t even care that there was a prison break in the Penisula district.</string>
<string name="24316">Oh, hello. You&apos;re one of those &lt;race&gt; folk, right? Plague take all the &lt;race&gt; race, I say!</string>
<string name="24317">You must be one of the new city guard. Hopefully you can do something about those zombies in the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="24318">You must be one of the new city guard. Hopefully you can do something about those zombies in the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>

<string name="24331">Think carrying that weapon will keep the Wailing Death at bay? May as well spit in the Anauroch!</string>
<string name="24332">Sorry cleric, but I can&apos;t even begin to think the gods are good while the stink of burning corpses covers everything.</string>
<string name="24333">You&apos;re a cleric; why don&apos;t you do something about the zombies terrorizing the Beggar&apos;s Nest! This would never happen in Tethyr!</string>
<string name="24334">You&apos;re a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;; can&apos;t you make the nobles in the Blacklake district share their cure?</string>
<string name="24335">Hmph. Keep your magic to yourself around here, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Some blame sorcery for the plague! They might banish mages to the Mere of Dead Men. Maybe.</string>

<string name="24357">The militia can&apos;t keep order anymore! The guards in the Core don&apos;t even care that there was a prison break in the Penisula district.</string>

<string name="24413"></string>
<string name="24414"></string>
<string name="24415">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="24416">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="24417">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="24418">Are you sure there isn&apos;t anything going on?</string>
<string name="24419">You not know about stuff? No stuff happening?</string>
<string name="24420">I thought bartenders liked to talk. Why not you?</string>
<string name="24421">Me thought bartenders talk lots. Why you not?</string>
<string name="24422">So you&apos;ve just given up?</string>
<string name="24423">So you just give up then?</string>
<string name="24424">Hello there. Something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="24425">Bye then. Safe travels.</string>
<string name="24426">On your way. Farewell.</string>
<string name="24427">Ah, whatever.</string>
<string name="24428">Sorry, but it seems like you&apos;d need the answers said real slow, and I don&apos;t have the time regardless.</string>
<string name="24429">Well, you seem friendly enough, but I don&apos;t really want to spend my time answering questions.</string>
<string name="24430">Sorry, but I really don&apos;t want to spend my time answering your questions.</string>
<string name="24431">Ah, beat it, you lout. I&apos;ve no interest in answering your questions.</string>
<string name="24432">Oh, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s plenty happening, but I just don&apos;t want to talk about it. I&apos;ve heard enough, and I&apos;m done dwelling on it.</string>
<string name="24433">Yes? Something you need?</string>
<string name="24434">What is it? Come on then, I don&apos;t have all day.</string>
<string name="24435">There&apos;s not much to say. I&apos;m not trying to be rude, but if you&apos;re looking for real useful information I&apos;m sure there&apos;s better places to find it.</string>
<string name="24436">I haven&apos;t given up; I&apos;m just not letting these horrible things have power over me. </string>
<string name="24437">I mean, there&apos;s nothing I can do about what&apos;s going on, and I don&apos;t know enough to be truly useful, so why should I bother worrying?</string>
<string name="24438"> People don&apos;t come here because they&apos;ve solved all their problems; they come because they want to get away from them. Nobody here has a clue. I sure don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="24439">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="24440">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="24441">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="24442">What do you know about Lord Nasher?</string>
<string name="24443">What do you know about Aribeth?</string>
<string name="24444">Shouldn&apos;t the people be the first to hear about cure attempts?</string>
<string name="24445">What can you tell me about Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="24446">What you know about Nasher guy?</string>
<string name="24447">What you know about Aribeth?</string>
<string name="24448">Maybe people should be told plague stuff. Why they not?</string>
<string name="24449">What you know about Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="24450">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Has he been seen in public recently?</string>
<string name="24451">Do you know anything about the plague?</string>
<string name="24452">You knows about plague, maybe?</string>
<string name="24453">Let&apos;s go back to my first questions.</string>
<string name="24454">Maybe we go back to first questions?</string>
<string name="24455">I&apos;ve got another drink order.</string>
<string name="24456">There ya go.</string>
<string name="24457">Hmm? What do you want? I have to get back to work.</string>
<string name="24458">Goodbye. Careful out there.</string>
<string name="24459">Yes, yes. On your way, then.</string>
<string name="24460">Good riddance.</string>
<string name="24461">I don&apos;t really have time. I&apos;m working right now. Do you understand that? You look a bit dim.</string>
<string name="24462">I suppose you can ask what you want, but I&apos;m in this place all day and don&apos;t see much.</string>
<string name="24463">Eh, if you make it quick.</string>
<string name="24464">Go bother some gutter-girl, I don&apos;t have time for louts like you.</string>
<string name="24465">Oh, it ain&apos;t my place to talk about him. I see him at parades and stuff, but that ain&apos;t enough to know the man. Sorry.</string>
<string name="24466">Not much. She seems nice. She and Fenthick make a nice couple, though I&apos;m sure they are too busy with the plague to get much personal time together.</string>
<string name="24467">Not me. I don&apos;t want to know. Might get my hopes up too soon and just get let down all the more if it fails.</string>
<string name="24468">I&apos;m not sure what you mean by that. It&apos;s a decent enough city, I guess. Fairly old. Everything is a mess right now, of course, but plague will do that.</string>
<string name="24469">Do you have a speech impediment? Oh, nevermind.</string>
<string name="24470">Well, no, I suppose not. I ain&apos;t heard of him being out since the plague started. I imagine he&apos;s powerful busy.</string>
<string name="24471">Not really. Lost some good friends to it. I suppose Lady Aribeth and Lord Nasher are fighting it somehow, but people like me don&apos;t get told about that stuff.</string>
<string name="24472">Please make it quick. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="24473">I don&apos;t need that kind of disappointment. It&apos;s not like I can do anything about it. Let the leaders lead. It ain&apos;t my job.</string>
<string name="24474">Really, I don&apos;t know much else. I just keep to myself. Is that enough of an answer for you? Are we done?</string>
<string name="24475">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="24476">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="24477">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="24478">You&apos;re sure you haven&apos;t heard anything?</string>
<string name="24479">What do you think of how the plague is being dealt with?</string>
<string name="24480">You sure you not hear nothing?</string>
<string name="24481">What you think about how plague thing is being fighted?</string>
<string name="24482">Who is Aarin Gend?</string>
<string name="24483">Why the animosity toward priests?</string>
<string name="24484">What do you mean by &quot;strange creatures?&quot;</string>
<string name="24485">Who this Aarin Gend?</string>
<string name="24486">Why you not like priest guys?</string>
<string name="24487">What you mean by &quot;strange creatures?&quot;</string>
<string name="24488">Have you heard anything interesting?</string>
<string name="24489">You hear abouts anything interesting or something?</string>
<string name="24490">Back to my first questions.</string>
<string name="24491">Back to first questions, okay?</string>
<string name="24492">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="24493">Maybe I should try and find this Aarin Gend.</string>
<string name="24494">Maybe me try to find this guy Aarin?</string>
<string name="24495">Here&apos;s your drink.</string>
<string name="24496">Thank you.</string>
<string name="24497">Barmaid, over here?</string>
<string name="24498">I&apos;ll be right with you.</string>
<string name="24499">Barmaid.</string>
<string name="24500">What would you like?</string>
<string name="24501">Another ale.</string>
<string name="24502">Right away.</string>
<string name="24503">Get meesh another drink! I&apos;m thirshty!</string>
<string name="24504">I think you&apos;ve had enough.</string>
<string name="24505">Eh? Not polite to interrupt someone&apos;s drinkin&apos;. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="24506">Bye then. Good on you.</string>
<string name="24507">All right then. Farewell.</string>
<string name="24508">Bah. Waste of my time.</string>
<string name="24509">I ain&apos;t got time for imbeciles. Ah, all right, what do you want to know?</string>
<string name="24510">I suppose. Don&apos;t know why you would want to know what I think, though.</string>
<string name="24511">I guess, but I don&apos;t feel much like talking.</string>
<string name="24512">Ah, like I care. Talk if you want. Maybe I&apos;ll answer.</string>
<string name="24513">Look, you seem like an all right person. Just leave me be. I don&apos;t know anything about any of this. I just wait to get the plague and die.</string>
<string name="24514">Bah! Can&apos;t trust anybody. I wish Aarin Gend were back in town. He gets things done with a quick slice to the throat, not priests and strange creatures.</string>
<string name="24515">Who is... ? You don&apos;t know Aarin Gend, spymaster? Some guard you are, if you really are one. Aarin Gend is the best officer Neverwinter has.</string>
<string name="24516">I don&apos;t hate all of them, but I&apos;m damn tired of promises that ain&apos;t helping. Like those Helmite guys talking about blessings that just get you soggy.</string>
<string name="24517">Ah, I heard Aribeth and that lot were looking for some weird beasts that were supposed to be part of a cure.</string>
<string name="24518">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="24519">Like what? I ain&apos;t seen nothing but the inside of a bottle for days now. You should really go bug somebody that matters.</string>
<string name="24520">Whatever. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="24521">What? You bother me just to blow me off? Take a walk, little &lt;boy/girl&gt;, you ain&apos;t making friends here.</string>
<string name="24522">I tell you, if he weren&apos;t off on some mission somewhere he&apos;d be cutting a swath through this plague. Couldn&apos;t do worse than these fool clerics and creatures.</string>
<string name="24523">Don&apos;t waste your time. If you&apos;re at all important to Neverwinter you&apos;ll meet him eventually. Trust me, you won&apos;t find him if he doesn&apos;t want to be found.</string>
<string name="24524">Ain&apos;t seen nothing but empty words from anyone. The plague just keeps going.</string>
<string name="24525">Nothing&apos;s happened with that yet, so it&apos;s probably just as much of a lie as what the Helmites are spilling. I don&apos;t know nothing more.</string>
<string name="24526">Oh, I remember now. I heard about how to cure the plague and gain fabulous riches in the process. Yep, I heard how to solve everyone&apos;s problems.</string>
<string name="24527">Then I sat in this tavern and waited for some jerk to come ask me about it, so I could tell them and let them get all the glory.</string>
<string name="24528">Is that what you want, a solution for everything? Well, how about this: stop pestering losers in bars and go do something that matters!</string>

<string name="24782">Day 2084 of my Duty
 Kurdan Fenkt ate another inmate today. Solitary confinement may be the only solution.

Day 2085 of my Duty
 Emernik fell asleep on the job again today. He has been reprimanded and demoted to storeroom duty on the main floor.

Day 2086 of my Duty
 Meeting with my cousin, Lady Tanglebrook, in the tunnels today. The poor woman has lost almost everyone to the Wailing Death and I fear there is little I can do to console her.</string>
<string name="24783">Lady Tanglebrook&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="24784">...Everyone, everyone is dead. All I have left is my cousin Alaefin, the Head Gaoler. He has been so good to me in the past, even building a tunnel between his office and the estate so I could visit him without running the risk of actually walking the dangerous peninsula streets. How fortuitous that these same tunnels now protect me from exposure to the plague. I am going to meet with him later today, for I know a good game of chess shall cheer me up from this spiteful malaise into which I have fallen.

Hmm -- that was odd. I thought I heard something crashing around downstairs but when I went down there, there was nothing. Must have been the rats! Oh, how I hate living alone. I shall visit my cousin at once!</string>
<string name="24785">Prison Logbook</string>
<string name="24786">Entry 247:
 We guards are beginning to question Captain Alaefin&apos;s sanity. He has been out of sorts ever since he went to visit with his cousin, Lady Tanglebrook. The prisoners grow restless.

Entry 248:
 Someone has unlocked the prisoners and cursed Captain Alaefin is nowhere to be found! We have had prison breaks before but this is serious. I don&apos;t know if we&apos;ll be able to keep it under control...

Entry 249:
 Heh. This your pretty book, guards? Whoever reads this, we prisoners killed half your stupid guards and locked the rest away where they belong. Long live the Head Gaoler and may the Wailing get the rest of ya...</string>
<string name="24787">Prisoner&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="24788">The Head Gaoler left my cell door open today... unlocked all of them on the block... Madman. Sure, I&apos;m a criminal but I was a thief, that&apos;s all -- If I&apos;m going to go free, I&apos;m not going to do it alongside a bunch of cold-hearted killers like the lot of them. I&apos;ve closed my door again, heard the lock click shut... I can hear them in the common room -- The Head Gaoler&apos;s rallying them to some cause, they&apos;re all shouting and cheering, it makes me sick. They&apos;re mad, all of them... I can hear them coming for me.</string>
<string name="24789">Journal of Marcus Penhold</string>
<string name="24790">This is the journal of Marcus Penhold, a young mage. The details of his life are uneventful, although the last entry is now likely more prophetic than the writer might have wished.

Excerpt:
I have hidden with the rest in fear of the plague, but I have no such anxiety about some pitiful shambling zombies. My brother awaits at the shrine the Helmites maintain in the Beggar&apos;s Nest, but I will not be joining him. Finally there is something real to fight.</string>
<string name="24791">Devourer&apos;s Brain</string>
<string name="24792">This is part of the body of an Intellect Devourer, an aberration consisting almost entirely of brain matter. This beast was one of four different creatures brought from Waterdeep as components of a powerful spell to cure the Wailing Death plague. It should be delivered to Lady Aribeth with all haste.</string>
<string name="24793">Anonymous Letter</string>
<string name="24794">In place of a signature, this letter bears the mark of a stylized, reptilian eye. It strikes you as somehow familiar, as if you&apos;ve seen it before, perhaps in a different context. You examine the text closer...

&quot;Read this letter well. Commit its words to heart, for I am your Master and there are those who would seek to thwart us, the People of the Eye.

&quot;Lady Aribeth has promoted some adventurers into the militia and sent them out to seek the creatures of the cure. They have already been successful once and they must not be so again. You must stalk them from every shadow, pursue them at every turn. Those creatures are to be set loose and hidden wherever they are out of reach.

&quot;Do not fail me in this. Remember, I hold the power to grant you life in this place of death. Your lives are mine to deny.

&quot;Long live the People of the Eye...&quot;

This note should be shown to someone in authority.</string>
<string name="24795">Torin&apos;s Ring</string>
<string name="24796">This is a simple signet ring, bearing a small family crest. The inscription in the band marks it as a gift between brothers, from Jemanie to Torin. It is otherwise unremarkable.</string>
<string name="24797">Lock of Dryad Hair</string>
<string name="24798">This is a lock of dryad hair, an important component for the spell to stop the Wailing Death plague. The dryad this came from was one of four magical creatures brought from Waterdeep to participate in the cure attempt. All were lost in an attack, and Lady Aribeth eagerly awaits their return.</string>

<string name="24802">Auction Announcement</string>
<string name="24803">This document details an auction to be held at the Seedy Tavern in the Docks district. It does not reveal exactly what will be for sale, but it does seem to suggest that anyone interested in surviving the plague should attend. It also mentions that anyone bringing this to the attention of the city guard will be dealt with in &quot;a manner that suggests finality.&quot; The seal at the bottom is apparently that of the Bloodsailors, a group of pirates.

There is a map on the back that shows the whole of the Docks District. The Seedy Tavern is one of the larger buildings along the northern edge.

<string name="24804">Dara&apos;nei&apos;s Locket</string>
<string name="24805">Opening this locket reveals an inscription from Vengaul Bloodsail to Dara&apos;nei.
&quot;If separated we be, this locket shall unfurl the Silver Sails and float you to safety in my arms.&quot;</string>
<string name="24806">Masterson Family Amulet</string>
<string name="24807">The Masterson family rose to moderate nobility through persistent mercantile efforts, rather than royal bloodlines or great achievements. Nevertheless, William Masterson did dabble in the occasional dungeon excursion, and a number of his more interesting finds became heirlooms passed to his three generations of offspring. This amulet is one of several marked with his crest, though he never revealed where he acquired them, and made little use of them once retired in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="24808">This amulet bears a small ornate crest typical of the merchant nobilty. The family name of &quot;Masterson&quot; is present on the back face of it.</string>
<string name="24809">Instructions from Callik</string>
<string name="24810">This note is from Callik, the traitorous lieutenant of Vengaul Bloodsail. It appears to be instructions on how to access the sea caves through the city aqueducts.

Excerpt:
When you have pulled what information you can from Vengaul&apos;s wench, join us in the Aqueducts. The entrance is in the very northwest of the Docks District, through an old maintenance building. I believe I know an alternate path to where the old fool keeps his secret stores. The Cockatrice should be there, as well as whatever else he has been keeping from us. Time to take our due! Use the hand signs below to pass the seal on the aqueduct gates. Keep this note with you! I doubt you could remember the signs without it!

Callik

(A complex series of hand motions is detailed below. You will definitely need this note present to reproduce them accurately enough to pass the gate.)</string>
<string name="24811">Smugglers&apos; Coin</string>
<string name="24812">Smugglers&apos; Coins are the currency of the Docks District black market. They are made with drops of blood-red glass, each pressed with the image of a ship and a cutlass. The exact value of these &quot;coins&quot; compared to gold is debatable, and seems to vary primarily on the prominence of the person using them. Despite this wild fluctuation, many thieves prefer them, knowing that a person buying with Smugglers&apos; Coins is usually not concerned about where the merchandise is coming from.</string>

<string name="24821">Tanglebrook Key</string>
<string name="24822">This copied key will open any door on the prison&apos;s second floor. It&apos;s flimsy, however, and quickly crafted. You doubt you will be able to use it more than once.</string>
<string name="24823">Prison Key (2nd Floor)</string>
<string name="24824">Judging by the insignia etched into the cold metal, this is a key to the main doors of the Peninsula district prison.</string>
<string name="24825">This is Meldanen&apos;s personal key, and it probably fits every lock in his estate. It also has a small magical rune on it, matching a similar one just visible on the lock of the cage that houses the Dryad.</string>

<string name="24830">Key to Meldanen Estate</string>
<string name="24831">Journal of Meldanen</string>
<string name="24832">This book is full of tightly-scripted dates and notes, a journal kept by the wizard Meldanen. Most entries are short and to the point, regarding his various magical experiments and some of the creatures he has paid to have smuggled into the city for his examination.

Most recently, however, his entries become much more interesting:

Excerpt:
The gods have smiled on my destiny. I had heard a little about the creatures being brought to the city from Waterdeep, but thought little of my chances of even laying eyes upon them. Lo and behold, however, I discovered a dryad from that very shipment wandering the streets of the district, lost and frightened after the battle in the Academy. It was glad enough to accompany me and I have caged it for the moment until I decide what to do with it.

Excerpt (the following day):
I have decided to experiment upon this dryad and find a cure for this plague on my own. Think of all the gold the panicked nobles of this city would offer for a cure! It is too bad that the dryad must be sacrificed, however... she is comely, if inhuman.

Excerpt (Several Days Later):
I cannot get the dryad out of my mind. Thoughts of her are with me always. Today I attempted to draw blood from her to fuel my experiment and found I could not hurt her even that much. Has she enchanted me? Or am I simply lonely for such beauty? I cannot think clearly. Still she recoils from my touch... I must win her love, I must! I will not release her from the cage until she feels as I do!</string>
<string name="24833">This key allows entry to the west wing of the Meldanen estate.</string>
<string name="24834">Meldanen West Wing Key</string>

<string name="24836">Meldanen Prison Key</string>
<string name="24837">Clothing: Wizard</string>
<string name="24838">One of many staffs created by the mage Meldanen. Over his career he supplied gold to a small industry of adventurers that would bring him exotic materials for his workshop. In his later years he was not so charitable, and occasionally set two or more groups against each other to secure the most reasonable prices for himself. Recently he stopped the practice altogether, preferring that as few people knew of his experiments as possible.</string>
<string name="24839">This staff was the weapon of the sorceror Meldanen, and is likely imbued with magic.</string>

The bird-like beast it came from was one of four magical creatures sent from Waterdeep to be part of the cure attempt. They were all lost in an attack as they were brought into the city.

<string name="24851">Gulnan&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="24852">Excerpt:
The sheep of Cyric fell swiftly. Fools. And to think their pathetic leader Jared was going to smash the altar to keep its power from me. Perhaps I should just kill him. It would quell the last of his followers, although they already seek to appease me. My own sect of snake-worshippers, how amusing! Soon I won&apos;t need to cower in the Warrens with their precious Necromantic Focus. 

It is an interesting device, I will grant Jared that. I have used it to create an army of undead, and I learn more about it each time I link with its power. Its pillar-like appearance disguises how fragile it truly is, and despite its power I must constantly watch that my undead servants don&apos;t inadvertently damage it with their clumsy flailing.</string>
<string name="24853">In Service of Cyric</string>
<string name="24854">Excerpt:
Cyric, why have you allowed me to be so weak? That conniving Yuan-Ti wench has taken our beloved focus, the altar that I constructed to show your glory, the glory of the Dark Sun! Now she kills what few loyalists I have left, and raises them as undead with its power! Great Prince of Lies, I must smash the focus before her army grows too great with its misuse! How dare she drag it to the depths of the Warrens! She wastes its potential on plague dead! Her scales will be plucked one by one! I will rend...

It appears that whatever writing implement Jared was using broke at this point.</string>
<string name="24855">Drawl&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="24856">Drawl apparently had big expectations of what serving Gulnan would get him, but if this Gulnan truly wanted her servant to be anything more than a pawn, she probably would have placed more emphasis on grammatical aptitude when making her selection.

Excerpt:
My minions shall address me as:
High Eminence of Evil
Overlorder
Invulneron
The Black Dark - this one&apos;s good!

The journal of The Black Dark, Master of the Necromantic link to Gulnan! Nobody can pass while the link strengthens me! I am invulnerable, and recording my thoughts for posterior-ity just like a real overlord! I am so tough! Nothing can stop me now! I sacrificed the whole gang for Gulnan to grant me power... but I&apos;m dead too, sort of. Does that mean they could still come back? And, wait, am I writing this for me to read? I already know all this stuff. Journals are stupid. And necromantic doesn&apos;t mean I have to kiss her, does it?</string>
<string name="24857">In Service of Gulnan</string>
<string name="24858">This journal tells of the changes that this cult went through once a creature named Gulnan was captured. It deals mostly with how the Cyric loyalists were ousted, allowing for the writer to move swiftly up the ranks. 

Excerpt:
Things are very different now, though they might not appear as such from the outside. We still follow blindly, and a number of us are still slain for no reason, but I finally believe a potent entity is acting through our master. Gulnan seems surprised at her own power, but her desire for conquest has erased any questions from her mind. I welcome her intensity, and her strong use of the focus. Jared was more interested in lining his pockets than causing true havoc, and he would never have dared use his precious fragile altar to focus necromantic energy and create an army of undead as Gulnan has. She is well worth following, this Yuan-Ti, even into the depths of the Warrens below.</string>
<string name="24859">This small blade has the name &quot;Zelieph&quot; inscribed near the hilt. It is otherwise unremarkable, likely more a utility knife than a prized weapon. A simple everyday tool, although it was probably an important part of this Zelieph&apos;s life.</string>
<string name="24860">Zelieph&apos;s Dagger</string>
<string name="24861">Zelieph&apos;s Ring</string>
<string name="24862">This simple ring is inscribed with the name &quot;Zelieph,&quot; alongside the initials &quot;SCB.&quot; It is an unassuming accessory, meant to be worn everyday without calling too much attention to it. Even so, it was likely an important part of this Zelieph&apos;s life.</string>
<string name="24863">Cockatrice Bite</string>
<string name="24864">Cockatrice Hide</string>
<string name="24865">Estate Ward Stone</string>
<string name="24866">This wardstone allows the bearer to bypass whatever magic protections have been placed on the entrance of an estate in the northwest of the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="24867">Armor: Splint (Yuan-Ti)</string>
<string name="24868">Clothing: Cyric</string>
<string name="24869">This key was found among the servants of Gulnan, a creature that appears to be behind the undead infestation in the Beggar&apos;s Nest district. It looks like it fits a large lock, probably on one of the ancient doors in the Warrens of the Damned beneath the Great Graveyard.</string>
<string name="24870">Ancient Key</string>
<string name="24871">Crumpled Note</string>
<string name="24872">This note is disjointed and sloppy, as though the author wrote it after suddenly waking from a deep sleep.

Excerpt:
I have gained much since the Academy was attacked. I did not see who freed me, and I don&apos;t care. Strength has come to me strangely... quickly. There is definitely some greater power at work in Neverwinter, and it favors me this day. I have seen it in the dreams... I see the eye... I don&apos;t know what it means, but I know this: if the Neverwintans want me for their cure they can carve the contribution from my corpse! So sayeth Gulnan!</string>
<string name="24873">Yuan-Ti Heart</string>
<string name="24874">This is the heart of Gulnan, a humanoid snake-like Yuan-Ti. Gulnan was one of the Waterdhavian creatures brought to Neverwinter to be part of the magical attempt to end the Wailing Death. She used the confusion of an unexpected attack to escape and cause untold horror in the Beggar&apos;s Nest. Aribeth awaits the delivery of this foul remnant, in the hopes that it may yet help provide a cure.</string>
<string name="24875">This ring is little more than a simple metal band, with a short inscription on the surface identifing the owner as &quot;Torin.&quot; There is also a message around the interior, naming the person that apparently gave the ring as a gift. &quot;Your brother, Jemanie.&quot;</string>

<string name="24882">Rare Earth Clay</string>
<string name="24883">A careful mixture of earth makes this small bit of clay ideal for use as a reagent in magical study. There may once have been a rather long description of this item pressed or carved into its surface, but it appears to have been deliberately smudged.</string>
<string name="24884">Cloaktower Badge 1</string>
<string name="24885">Cloaktower Badge 2</string>
<string name="24886">Flask of Water</string>
<string name="24887">Written on a piece of tape that is stretched across the flask: &quot;For while the water should have generally been proud, having existed far longer than many of those within this world, it could not exist without a solid foundation to settle in upon - and for that, it remained humble.&quot;</string>
<string name="24888">Puff of Fog</string>
<string name="24889">This small container appears to hold a swirling puff of fog. The following message delicately inscribed on the surface: &quot;When air became, in its youth, jealous of its place in the world, it sought out ways to assert its power. It floated high in the night air, and obscured the view of the stars from those that lay beneath it. But soon it filled with water that became too heavy, and it came crashing down to rejoin with those who came before - an embrace that left it no longer uncertain of its place within the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="24890">Kindling Wood</string>
<string name="24891">Carved upon this bit of kindling wood is the following phrase: &quot;And the fire was angry that it could not overcome the rain above. The air taunted the fire, knowing that fire needed the air to live. Such is the way of those who have come late in life.&quot;</string>
<string name="24892">Gauntlet Award: First Round</string>
<string name="24893">Badges like this are given to would-be gladiators participating in the Gauntlet fighting club beneath Neverwinter&apos;s Board Laid Bare tavern.

<string name="24894">Gauntlet Award: Second Round</string>
<string name="24895">Badges like this are given to would-be gladiators participating in the Gauntlet fighting club beneath Neverwinter&apos;s Board Laid Bare tavern.

The badge must be presented before a challenge can be recognized.</string>
<string name="24896">Gauntlet Award: Third Round</string>
<string name="24897">Badges like this are given to would-be gladiators participating in the Gauntlet fighting club beneath Neverwinter&apos;s Board Laid Bare tavern. This particular award signifies that the bearer has defeated all comers, and is now eligible to challenge for ownership of the club. The badge must be presented before a challenge can be recognized.</string>
<string name="24898">Gauntlet Championship Award</string>
<string name="24899">There is only one badge of this type. It signifies that the bearer is the Grand Champion of the Gauntlet fighting club beneath Neverwinter&apos;s Board Laid Bare tavern. The owner of this item has defeated all comers, including the group&apos;s founder, and has taken the Board Laid Bare tavern as their prize.</string>
<string name="24900">This key opens the door to the back room of Neverwinter&apos;s Board Laid Bare tavern, thereby granting access to the Gauntlet combatant&apos;s club below.</string>

<string name="24904">Halueth&apos;s Rusted Armor</string>
<string name="24905">This armor once belonged to Lord Halueth Never, but it has barely survived the ages. It was exposed to a damaging amount of moisture over time, although you can still see the quality it must have once had. There is light etching throughout, including a faint image of the symbol of Tyr. It remains an important artifact for Neverwinter, even if it should never see combat again.</string>
<string name="24906">Halueth Dig Logbook</string>
<string name="24907">This book details the initial search for the tomb of Halueth Never. It is unfinished, the writer obviously falling to the plague before he could include many details, but it does point to the possible locations for three tombs in addition to the one in the Peninsula District.

Beggar&apos;s Nest: Great Graveyard
Docks District: Northwestern quarter aqueducts
Blacklake District: Southwestern quarter

The directions are vague, but the book does mention that each tomb is likely sealed with a magically protected door. A riddle of some sort is the &quot;key&quot; to each. The solution to the Peninsula tomb door was &quot;Emerald,&quot; which was answered by actually placing an emerald in the container immediately next to the door. It is worth noting that this action seemed to destroy the item, making it an expensive discovery.

Text of the &quot;Emerald riddle&quot; on the Peninsula tomb:
Diamond of the forest, if the seasons never changed.

<string name="24908">Ancient Chronicles of Halueth Never</string>
<string name="24909">This aged tome details the latter life of Halueth Never, and the trials that he overcame to found the city of Neverwinter. Much of it is written in an archaic script that will likely take Tyrran scholars years to decipher. </string>

<string name="24915">Jacob&apos;s Quill</string>
<string name="24916">This object bears an inscription in delicate writing. &quot;Jacob in service of Tyr. Truth be revealed in your words.&quot;</string>
<string name="24917">Ancient Symbol of Tyr</string>
<string name="24918">The meticulous carving that went in to this item is evident even through the dust of ages on its surface. This would be a very valuable artifact to the Temple of Tyr, even without the provenance of having possibly belonged to Lord Halueth Never.</string>
<string name="24919">Tamora&apos;s Brooch</string>
<string name="24920">This brooch is not the best of quality, but the inscription on the back likely means it has tremendous sentimental value to someone.

<string name="24941">Note From Hodge</string>
<string name="24942">This note from Hodge is intended for Ophala Cheldarstorn, and consists of an almost steady stream of profanities and curses. Apparently they have been exchanging such sentiments for a great deal of time, and he is none too pleased with having had to flee his refuge yet again. Standard fare for vanquished foes.</string>

<string name="24944">This coin is the recognized currency of the Moonstone Mask, and entitles the bearer to approach one of the men or women working in the back room.</string>
<string name="24945">Portrait of Sir Reginald Rumbottom III</string>
<string name="24946">This portrait is a rather unremarkable likeness of Sir Reginald Rumbottom III. The only things that stand out about it are the strange markings on the back of the canvas. They are largely illegible, but the name &quot;Ophala Cheldarstorn&quot; does appear to be among them.</string>
<string name="24947">Gaudy Statuette</string>
<string name="24948">The workmanship responsible for this item is questionable, at best. A small plaque declares it to be a partially nude representation of Ophala Cheldarstorn of the Moonstone Mask, but you cannot see how it could be an accurate likeness.</string>
<string name="24949">Gilded Urn</string>
<string name="24950">This urn makes a rather cheap attempt at appearing stately, and may have once held the ashes of a respected but poor merchant or minor noble. More recently it has held delicious-smelling after-dinner mints. It bears a dent that could have come from gripping it at the lip and delivering a swinging blow to the back of someone&apos;s skull, likely leaving his or her head in much the same condition as the urn. Strangely, &quot;Best wishes, Ophala Cheldarstorn&quot; has been scratched into the base of it. </string>

<string name="24952">Elemental Wand of Fire</string>
<string name="24953">Many-Starred Cloak</string>
<string name="24954">These masterfully crafted cloaks, stitched on both sides with glittering stars, are the guild emblem of the sorcerers and wizards of Neverwinter&apos;s fabled Cloaktower. Loyal to Lord Nasher, the Cloakwizards are vital to the city&apos;s defense and carry themselves with the appropriately cautious air that such a duty entails.</string>
<string name="24955">This wand is infused with energy from the elemental plane of earth, allowing the user to cast a single Stoneskin spell. It will only function in the testing chamber of the Many-Starred Cloak guild tower.</string>
<string name="24956">Elemental Wand of Earth</string>
<string name="24957">Scented Fetish</string>
<string name="24958">Nyatar created this item to aid in rescuing the animals in the Blacklake zoo. It grants the bearer very specific use of certain ranger and druid abilities, allowing communication with the captive animals.</string>
<string name="24959">This wand is infused with energy partially from the elemental plane of water, allowing the user to cast a single Slow spell. It will only function in the testing chamber of the Many-Starred Cloak guild tower.</string>
<string name="24960">Elemental Wand of Water</string>
<string name="24961">This wand is infused with energy partially from the elemental plane of air, allowing the user to cast a single Color Spray spell. It will only function in the testing chamber of the Many-Starred Cloak guild tower.</string>
<string name="24962">Elemental Wand of Air</string>
<string name="24963">This key apparently opens a number of locks within the zoo operated by Montgomery &quot;Sureshot&quot; Weatherson. Nyatar&apos;s animal companion stole the original, and Nyatar made copies.</string>
<string name="24964">Zoo Key Copy</string>
<string name="24965">This key belongs to Eltoora of the Many-Starred Cloak. It allows entry to the various workshops the mage guild has established around the city.</string>
<string name="24966">Eltoora&apos;s Key</string>
<string name="24967">Transport Via Plants Scroll</string>
<string name="24968">This magic scroll is to be used near the large tree outside the zoo in the Blacklake district. It will transform that single large tree into a portal through which the animals of the zoo can escape. After they are through, the druid Nyatar will see to their well-being. </string>

<string name="24970">Map of the Peninsula</string>
<string name="24971">This map of the Peninsula district is well annotated and easy to memorize. The mapmakers&apos; art has gone largely unrecognized in Neverwinter. Lord Nasher has forbidden the mass production of such documents, for fear they might aid enemy spies.</string>

<string name="24978">Armor: Plate (Neverwinter Nine)</string>
<string name="24979">Clothing: Neverwinter Militia</string>
<string name="24980">This is the somewhat garish uniform of the Bloodsailors pirate guild. By wearing this, a person might be able to fool a casual observer into thinking they are a Bloodsailor. Other actual members would probably see through the deception, however, as such groups are usually very adept at recognizing their own people.</string>
<string name="24981">Talismans such as this border on the power of artifacts. Drawing from the soul of the wearer, these magical devices focus and hone intentions to an extreme level. The good become more charismatic and wise, while the evil become more cunning and manipulative. Examples of these items are varied in form, suggesting multiple creators at different points in history.</string>
<string name="24982">This ring and several of its type were originally crafted to protect the sons of King Castter De&apos;wess, though the creator is unknown. History records that the rings remained within that family for at least 13 generations, though they were all apparently lost within the space of one. Enmity between the King and the family of the creator may be to blame.</string>

<string name="24988">This weapon was fashioned to the tastes of Melthius Penhold, a scholar who traveled the south in the last century. His unassuming manner led to a long and peaceful life, a similarly uneventful death, and a lineage of anonymity. His staff is of modest ability, and that quality mirrors his honest family history. The last descendants of the Penhold line are two great great grandchildren: Marcus, now evidently deceased, and Bertrand, both of Neverwinter.</string>

Excerpt:
Things are very different now, though they might not appear as such from the outside. We still follow blindly, and a number of us are still slain for no reason, but I finally believe a potent entity is acting through our master. Gulnan seems surprised at her own power, but her desire for conquests has erased any questions from her mind. I welcome her intensity, and her strong use of the focus. Jared was more interested in lining his pockets than causing true havoc. </string>

Combining his skills, Telenn created amulets that allowed his students to train using real weapons without risk of injury. This worked so well that Telenn gave up the quiet life, and resumed his adventuring life, necklaces in tow.</string>

Excerpt:
When you have pulled what information you can from Vengaul&apos;s wench, join us in the sea caves. The entrance is in the very northwest of the Docks District, through the city aqueducts. I believe I know an alternate path to where the old fool keeps his secret stores. The cockatrice should be there, as well as whatever else he has been keeping from us. Time to take our due! Use the hand signs below to pass the seal on the aqueduct gates. Keep this note with you! I doubt you could remember the signs without it!

Excerpt:
I have gained much since I made my escape from those blasted pens at the Academy. Strength has come to me strangely... quickly. There is definitely some greater power at work in Neverwinter, and it favors me this day. I have seen it in the dreams... I see the eye...

<string name="25317">This book details the initial search for the tomb of Halueth Never. It is unfinished, the writer obviously falling to the plague before he could include many details, but it does point to the possible locations for three tombs in addition to the one in the Peninsula District:

Beggar&apos;s Nest: Eastern quarter
Docks District: Northeastern quarter
Blacklake District: Southwestern quarter

The directions are vague, but the book also mentions that each tomb may be sealed with a magically protected door. A riddle of some sort is the &quot;key&quot; to each. The solution to the Peninsula tomb door was &quot;Emerald,&quot; which was answered by actually placing an emerald in the container immediately next to the opening. It is worth noting that this action seemingly destroyed the emerald.

Text of the &apos;Emerald riddle&apos; on the Peninsula tomb:
&quot;Diamond of the forest, if the seasons never changed.&quot;

<string name="25334">The design of the average Wand of Frost owes much to the once mighty legions under Auril the Frostmaiden and, to a lesser extent, some of the more obscure elemental lords. Few producing them today are among those faithful however, and most contemporary versions are the product of arcane rather than divine spellcasters.</string>
<string name="25335">It is a popular bit of lore that the first wizard to encapsulate magical projectiles within an object like this was apparently drawn and quartered, accused of releasing the staples of arcane power to the masses. Most mages and sorcerers scoff at this, citing that if every crafter of wands were killed today, magic would indeed be a very exclusive club.</string>

<string name="25445">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="25446">We maybe go back to other questions?</string>
<string name="25447">Has your opinion of Desther changed any?</string>
<string name="25448">You like Desther any better now?</string>
<string name="25449">Will your relationship with Fenthick improve now?</string>
<string name="25450">You maybe get along better with Fenthick now?</string>
<string name="25451">The gods are powerful. Why not rely on them?</string>
<string name="25452">Gods are big. It not smart to rely on them?</string>
<string name="25453">If Desther and his Helmites are fake, where are the real ones?</string>
<string name="25454">If Desther and Helmites is fake, where the real ones?</string>
<string name="25455">Fenthick says that he gave his ward key to Desther.</string>
<string name="25456">Fenthick give his castle key thing to Desther.</string>
<string name="25457">There is no time! You must find Desther! I can maintain the portal for now, but you must hurry! If you find them soon enough, maybe... </string>
<string name="25458">Maybe Fenthick&apos;s actions will be overlooked... maybe he will be forgiven before the city looks for... vengeance instead of justice... </string>
<string name="25459">Do not say such things! It cannot be! He was mistaken! He was fooled! He was... He was... damn him... </string>
<string name="25460">People won&apos;t let this pass. They have been denied a cure and they will want vengeance on the traitor and anyone that helped him... I... won&apos;t be able to protect him... I won&apos;t... </string>
<string name="25461">Perhaps... perhaps delivering Desther will mitigate things. Find him alive if you can. Find Fenthick and get him to... I don&apos;t know... I don&apos;t know what will help now.</string>
<string name="25462">The city guards are needed elsewhere, so this task falls to you. Go, before the portal falls!</string>
<string name="25463">What was he thinking? If he had a part in this... it hardly matters now... He looks like he fled with Desther. The people will not accept this action!</string>
<string name="25464">Hurry, get through the portal while I can still maintain it! Find the cure! Get Desther and... and Fenthick too. He may be under a spell or... I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="25465">Can you imagine? I must wish Fenthick harm rather than face the possibility that... that he might have known of this.</string>
<string name="25466">I... I don&apos;t know. People will think he&apos;s in league with the greatest threat we have ever known... I don&apos;t know... </string>
<string name="25467">He was mistaken... he was an advocate for a traitor. People will not understand his naivete... his trust. Could you blame them for finding a scapegoat?</string>
<string name="25468">I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll maintain the portal as long as I can, but it may be a while before we can send guards through. You&apos;ll have to go on your own.</string>
<string name="25469">I&apos;ll also try to make this sound better than it is... I can&apos;t hide Fenthick&apos;s blind trust of Desther... but if I explain it in context... Maybe... </string>
<string name="25470">I don&apos;t know... it&apos;s hard to tell. I can&apos;t see through Desther&apos;s magic. It probably leads to wherever he and his false Helmites originally came from.</string>
<string name="25471">I must say, I knew you would be instrumental in this cause. You&apos;ve always presented the confident look of a &lt;man/woman&gt; of action.</string>
<string name="25472">Yes, farewell for now. There is much I must do to prepare for the casting to come. The incantations are very complex.</string>
<string name="25473">Well, several of our Tyrran priests have already begun preparations. Their meditation will allow the different components to be combined smoothly.</string>
<string name="25474">I&apos;m certain they can speak for themselves, but I will answer any questions you have.</string>
<string name="25475">Yes, I would agree. He is... archetypal. We are almost certain the plague was an attack, but he has no idea what kind of villain would stoop so low.</string>
<string name="25476">It is a bit of a shocking revelation. I wish we still lived in a time when the possibility of someone doing this was uknown and unthinkable.</string>
<string name="25477">If you don&apos;t mind me saying, you have proven valuable beyond the average exterior you present. None of this would have been possible without your help.</string>
<string name="25478">I have to say, I was not impressed when I first met you, but you have done much to prove me wrong. Your help has been invaluable.</string>
<string name="25479">You needn&apos;t worry about anything. Your efforts got us this far, and now the ritual will take care of the rest. Following that, I will see to your reward.</string>
<string name="25480">Greetings, &lt;FullName&gt;. Preparations are well under way for the ritual. If all goes well, we will have the cure in just a few moments.</string>
<string name="25481">For now, you can leave what must be done to us. You&apos;ve earned the right to bear witness, however, and I&apos;m sure the others would say the same.</string>
<string name="25482">Such impatience does not suit you. You will see the fruits of your labors when the ritual is complete. </string>
<string name="25483">Well, I guess my original estimation was closer to the truth than I might have thought. You will be rewarded when the ritual is complete, mercenary.</string>
<string name="25484">Desther, Fenthick and I will all begin the main incantations as soon as we are prepared. If all goes well, we&apos;ll have the cure in mere moments.</string>
<string name="25485">None too soon for Lord Nasher; the plague has weakened him considerably. I think he almost considers it a personal insult to be seen this way.</string>
<string name="25486">You should speak with the others. No doubt they will each have their own feelings about how our situation has changed.</string>
<string name="25487">You have yet to speak with Desther or Fenthick. I&apos;m sure they would like to congratulate you. No doubt they also have their own opinions about the cost of getting here.</string>
<string name="25488">You should speak with Desther and Lord Nasher. No doubt they will both have their own ideas about the cost of getting to where we are.</string>
<string name="25489">You should speak with Fenthick and Lord Nasher. I am certain they would want to congratulate you.</string>
<string name="25490">You have yet to speak with Fenthick. I&apos;m sure he would like to congratulate you.</string>
<string name="25491">You haven&apos;t yet spoken with Desther. I&apos;m sure he has opinions on your performance he would like to relate.</string>
<string name="25492">You have yet to speak with Lord Nasher. I&apos;m sure he would like to extend his congratulations and thanks. You have earned the honor.</string>
<string name="25493">Yes, I think the time for talk has passed. You have spoken with everyone and we are ready. The ritual will commence now.</string>
<string name="25494">I will try to explain. Is there anything specific you wish to know?</string>
<string name="25495">Well, we have prepared a small container. The mixture itself will be fairly unspectacular to look at, despite the importance of it.</string>
<string name="25496">Oh sure, &lt;FirstName&gt;, the container we&apos;ve provided is nice and shiny. Now, have you any more brilliant questions to ask?</string>
<string name="25497">Well, once we have the cure in hand we will determine the best way to get it to the most people as soon as possible. </string>
<string name="25498">It will take time, so we&apos;ll treat the most severe cases of plague first, regardless of station. I just hope... well... we&apos;ll worry about other things later.</string>
<string name="25499">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; We are very near our goal but... I can&apos;t help but worry about the effects of the plague. There is a great scar across Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="25500">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s not really appropriate to speak of these things right now. It&apos;s not important. We will deal with everything as it comes.</string>
<string name="25501">Now, is there anything else? You should speak with the others if you have not done so. They would congratulate you, too.</string>
<string name="25502">Already I see the distrust. The mood of the city has changed. When all is done, the people will want someone to blame, and I don&apos;t know if we will find anyone.</string>
<string name="25503">Will you be able to undestand, I wonder? A great scar has been carved across the heart of Neverwinter. Perhaps you also see it? </string>
<string name="25504">(ahem) I shouldn&apos;t ramble on like this when we are so close to a cure. This is a happy day, and we got here because of you.</string>
<string name="25505">As you will. What do you want me to say?</string>
<string name="25506">You should really ask him that. He despises being thought of as weak, and would much prefer to be involved in any talk of his health.</string>
<string name="25507">I would ask whether your opinion of him has suffered. It was your efforts that brought us this far. His claims of action seem based on your results.</string>
<string name="25508">While you searched, his Helmites blessed. While you fought, his Helmites blessed. The comfort he brought will pale next to the actual cure you have provided.</string>
<string name="25509">Of course, he is needed for the final ritual, so I cannot dismiss him entirely. Fenthick also serves as his advocate, so he must be deserving of some respect.</string>
<string name="25510">This time has been... difficult, and our difference of opinion made it more so. Fenthick and I have had little to speak of besides the plague.</string>
<string name="25511">I understand why he vests so much hope in Desther, but I could not. I know the power of faith, but you need to back it up with action.</string>
<string name="25512">I am a paladin of the Just God, Tyr. My sword is edged with belief, but it is MY arm that must still swing it.</string>
<string name="25513">I simply feared that if we waited for faith alone to save us, we would have more martyrs than survivors.</string>
<string name="25514">Hello again, &lt;FullName&gt;. I have a moment to talk, but as soon as you have finished speaking with everyone we can begin the ceremony.</string>
<string name="25515">I don&apos;t know. Perhaps Desther killed them. It seems impossible. He came from Helm&apos;s Hold... if that great hall has fallen... this is an even greater tragedy.</string>
<string name="25516">This is a huge undertaking... it seems like Desther has done all this to promote the plague... but why?! So many dead... now the Hold?</string>
<string name="25517">I am aware. Our guards here are very observant. There will be consequences, but not for now. There are more important things at hand.</string>
<string name="25518">We will watch Desther carefully, but he is needed for the incantations and I will not risk his temperamental nature and spoil our chance for a cure.</string>
<string name="25519">Fenthick takes foolish risks, but I will not allow any harm to come from this. The plague will not divide the living.</string>
<string name="25520">Desther claimed he came from Helm&apos;s Hold in the east, but I don&apos;t know how that could be true. They would have no part of a plot like this.</string>
<string name="25521">Wherever the portal leads, I am sure it will be dangerous. He must know we would send someone after him. Be careful.</string>
<string name="25522">Quickly, you must defeat the invaders!</string>
<string name="25523">I will attempt to hold the portal open. It&apos;s up to you to stop these madmen!</string>
<string name="25524">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="25525">What will you do after the plague is cured?</string>
<string name="25526">I have questions about your fellows.</string>
<string name="25527">What you do after plague cured?</string>
<string name="25528">Me gots questions about other peoples here.</string>
<string name="25529">Me gots questions about the spell thingy.</string>
<string name="25530">I have questions about the ritual.</string>
<string name="25531">Why did you have Fenthick give you his Castle Never key?</string>
<string name="25532">Why you get Fenthick to give you his Castle Never key thing?</string>
<string name="25533">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Magical risk, or tempting the wrath of Aribeth?</string>
<string name="25534">Just happy to help. We all sought a cure in our own way.</string>
<string name="25535">Me glad to help. We all wanted the cure, right?</string>
<string name="25536">I&apos;m a hero. That&apos;s what we do.</string>
<string name="25537">Me just a hero. Heroes do stuff like this.</string>
<string name="25538">I did more than you can claim. I got results.</string>
<string name="25539">Me do more than you. Me get results.</string>
<string name="25540">What do you intend to do?</string>
<string name="25541">What you gonna do?</string>
<string name="25542">You must admit that it seems odd.</string>
<string name="25543">It still seems odd. Kinda strange.</string>
<string name="25544">Back to my initial questions.</string>
<string name="25545">Back to first questions, okay?</string>
<string name="25546">Of course, now it is time for you to step aside. The ritual will not require you. You may watch as we create the plague cure, but do not interfere.</string>
<string name="25547">Yes, let me concentrate on the ritual to come. Goodbye, &lt;FullName&gt;. I&apos;m sure you are proud of all you have done.</string>
<string name="25548">My interest in these people is shrinking as we near the end of the plague. You would do better to speak with them yourself.</string>
<string name="25549">Well, hello &lt;FullName&gt;. I imagine you are well pleased with yourself? This is your doing, after all.</string>
<string name="25550">You should speak with each of the others before we begin the ritual. They will likely want to congratulate you. Very important, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="25551">You have yet to talk with Aribeth or Fenthick. I&apos;m sure they would like to congratulate you. If they are speaking. We&apos;ll begin the ritual when you are done.</string>
<string name="25552">You should speak with Aribeth and Lord Nasher. No doubt they&apos;ll agree on the importance of what you have done. We&apos;ll begin the ritual when you are through with them.</string>
<string name="25553">You should speak with Fenthick and Lord Nasher. I am certain they would want to congratulate you. We&apos;ll begin the ritual when you are through with them.</string>
<string name="25554">You have yet to speak with Fenthick. I&apos;m sure he would appreciate it. Not getting much attention at home, I hear.</string>
<string name="25555">You should speak with Aribeth. I&apos;m sure she would consider it a slight if you spoke with me and not her. We&apos;ll begin the ritual when you are done.</string>
<string name="25556">Oh, I believe you have yet to speak with Lord Nasher. You should do so before we commence the ritual. He is your Lord, after all.</string>
<string name="25557">Very well. I believe it is time for us to proceed. Let the ritual commence!</string>
<string name="25558">Then I suggest you study magic for a few more years. You are not a part of the spell, so I see no point in having you mimic the incantations.</string>
<string name="25559">With a cure in hand, my reason for being in Neverwinter will be gone. I will be returning to Helm&apos;s Hold for a time. Beyond that is my own affair.</string>
<string name="25560">I will speak if you wish, but you should really spend some time with each of the others before the ceremony. They will want to congratualte you, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="25561">That is my affair. I explained my need to Fenthick and he saw the wisdom in it. Getting the proper result from the ritual requires a certain amount of risk.</string>
<string name="25562">Perhaps, although it was definitely your thuggish actions that brought us to this point. You outstepped my Helmite brethren very effectively. Bravo.</string>
<string name="25563">I&apos;m sure. You made my Helmite brethren look quite ineffective by comparison. The importance of what we were trying to do was called into question.</string>
<string name="25564">Oh, I don&apos;t question your results, but I hoped to have more of a say in the outcome. My Helmite brethren and I have a lot invested in this.</string>
<string name="25565">Well, that is certainly part of it. Aribeth dislikes me, and it makes her difficult to deal with. I&apos;m not sure what Fenthick sees in her, really.</string>
<string name="25566">I doubt she can provide a real proven reason for her distrust. Fenthick is more understanding. He knows that faith is a powerful tool.</string>
<string name="25567">I am going to fulfill my promises and make sure the cure is successfully created. There is no other purpose to this ceremony.</string>
<string name="25568">Perhaps to you, but this whole ritual is beyond your understanding. You may rest assured that the cure will be successfully created.</string>
<string name="25569">We will invoke energy both arcane and divine, and when we are done there will be a cure for the plague. That is all you need to know.</string>
<string name="25570">As you will. Do try to hurry.</string>
<string name="25571">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="25572">What will happen during this ritual?</string>
<string name="25573">I have questions about your fellows.</string>
<string name="25574">What gonna happen in spell?</string>
<string name="25575">Me gots questions about other peoples here.</string>
<string name="25576">I was happy to be part of the team. </string>
<string name="25577">Me glad to work with everyone.</string>
<string name="25578">How is Lord Nasher faring?</string>
<string name="25579">Lord Nasher okay? How he doing?</string>
<string name="25580">Why you kinda stop saying something? What you not say?</string>
<string name="25581">Why did you hesitate to tell me something?</string>
<string name="25582">What form will the cure take?</string>
<string name="25583">What the cure gonna look like? Shiny?</string>
<string name="25584">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="25585">We maybe go back to other questions?</string>
<string name="25586">Will your relationship with Aribeth improve now?</string>
<string name="25587">You maybe get along better with Aribeth now?</string>
<string name="25588">Desther will not create the cure alone. Others are involved.</string>
<string name="25589">Desther not make cure by himself. Others is helping.</string>
<string name="25590">I did the important part. Desther sat on his hands.</string>
<string name="25591">Me did important stuff. Desther just talk lots.</string>
<string name="25592">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You can tell me. I&apos;ve proven myself trustworthy.</string>
<string name="25593">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; It okay to tell me. Ain&apos;t me proven good to trust?</string>
<string name="25594">I am &lt;race&gt;, just as you are. I&apos;ll understand.</string>
<string name="25595">We both &lt;race&gt; kind. Me understand good.</string>
<string name="25596">Tell me or I&apos;ll rip your head off!</string>
<string name="25597">You tells or me smash you flat!</string>
<string name="25598">Have you done something to help him?</string>
<string name="25599">You done something to help him somehow?</string>
<string name="25600">Is there precedent for this? Will it work?</string>
<string name="25601">You understand it? It really work like that?</string>
<string name="25602">Doesn&apos;t that leave the castle unprotected?</string>
<string name="25603">That not make Castle Never weaker?</string>
<string name="25604">What would Aribeth think of this?</string>
<string name="25605">What Aribeth think of this, hmm? You not tell her?</string>
<string name="25606">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps you see what you want to see.</string>
<string name="25607">You keep secrets from her. That isn&apos;t a clue?</string>
<string name="25608">Yous keep secrets from her. You being dumb.</string>
<string name="25609">You found the Waterdhavian creatures, allowing Desther and his Helmite brethren to concentrate on helping the spirits of the people. Now he can construct the cure and all will be well.</string>
<string name="25610">Yes, it is best that I concentrate on what is coming. I will have to be very careful not to disturb the incantations Desther utters during the ritual.</string>
<string name="25611">Oh, I would not presume to speak for them. If you wish to know what they think, I&apos;m certain they would welcome your questions.</string>
<string name="25612">Yes, I knew you could be trusted, just as I knew Desther would prove critical. Even now he... well... let&apos;s just say he is helping, despite what others think.</string>
<string name="25613">Hello there! A grand day, isn&apos;t it? And you... you are to thank. It was your effort that allowed us to progress this far.</string>
<string name="25614">Can you believe it? In a few moments this great trial will be over. The plague will have a cure.</string>
<string name="25615">You should speak with the others. Each will have valuable insights into the ritual to come, I am sure.</string>
<string name="25616">You should speak with Desther and Aribeth. While their views of the coming ceremony are no doubt different, it would be wise to speak with both of them.</string>
<string name="25617">You should speak with Desther and Lord Nasher. While their views of the coming ceremony are no doubt different, it would be wise to speak with both of them.</string>
<string name="25618">You should speak with Aribeth and Lord Nasher. They would want to thank you for your service, I am sure.</string>
<string name="25619">You have not yet spoken to Aribeth. She would certainly like to offer congratulations before we begin the final incantations.</string>
<string name="25620">I see you have not yet spoken to Desther. His insight is always valuable. You should seek his confidence before we begin.</string>
<string name="25621">I see you have not yet spoken with Lord Nasher. You have played an important part, and should allow him to express his thanks.</string>
<string name="25622">Yes, it is time that I joined the incantations. We are moments from the cure, I am certain!</string>
<string name="25623">Oh, it was nothing, really. Something better left unsaid. It is a matter for Desther and I alone.</string>
<string name="25624">I don&apos;t really know. I would like to think it would be an inspiring beacon of magic and hope, glowing with divine energy and radiating healing warmth.</string>
<string name="25625">The Tyrran priests have already begun the incantations. Aribeth, Desther and I will join them when we are all ready.</string>
<string name="25626">We should have the cure soon after. I hope it will work on the advanced symptoms. There are so many people infected.</string>
<string name="25627">As you will. What do you want me to say?</string>
<string name="25628">He has kept his gallant posture throughout, though I worry for him. He will not show a need for help. He may be far weaker than he seems.</string>
<string name="25629">What? I&apos;m not sure what you mean. Certainly we have been occupied by the events of the plague, but I wouldn&apos;t let our minor disagreements color my love of her.</string>
<string name="25630">You think she feels differently? I haven&apos;t seen any signs of it, and I certainly know her well enough. She&apos;s just concerned for the sick. You are mistaken.</string>
<string name="25631">Greetings again. I can spare a moment, but we should begin the ritual as soon as you speak with everyone else. With my help, Desther will... well... it isn&apos;t important.</string>
<string name="25632">Really, Fenthick, now is not the time for such talk. Others will not understand like you do.</string>
<string name="25633">Of course, of course. It is better that we look forward. In but a few moments we will have the cure!</string>
<string name="25634">I don&apos;t like your tone. You are just like the others. You don&apos;t realize the importance of what he has done.</string>
<string name="25635">Even now, that kind of attitude keeps his hands tied. I have had to... well... Suffice to say, it has been hard getting Desther the resources he needs.</string>
<string name="25636">But enough of this squabbling. In a few moments we will have the cure. This great trial is almost over.</string>
<string name="25637">I realize that, but he has done so much more. I really don&apos;t expect you to understand the weight of his involvement... the risks he takes.</string>
<string name="25638">Misunderstandings have plagued him from the start. I&apos;ve even had to... well... Suffice to say that it has been hard getting him the resources he needs.</string>
<string name="25639">You would think so, but even Aribeth does not understand. I don&apos;t know how to put it into words. I have had to act on my own.</string>
<string name="25640">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes, yes you have, and I will not push you aside. I have seen my companions do that too much already.</string>
<string name="25641">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t know. I wish I could trust you, but this matter is perhaps best left between Desther and I.</string>
<string name="25642">You see, Desther has been pushed out of the plans for this ceremony. His efforts to help are ignored. My companions mean well, but they are too untrusting.</string>
<string name="25643">I think the strain of the plague has taken your patience, friend. I know you wouldn&apos;t try to hurt me, not in the heart of Castle Never.</string>
<string name="25644">We are so well protected that the guards would be here in seconds. It&apos;s almost oppressive. It prevents the best of us from doing what we must.</string>
<string name="25645">Again, I almost say too much. The business I have with Desther should stay between him and me.</string>
<string name="25646">It&apos;s a small thing, really. I mean, he needs to help for the cure to work. He shouldn&apos;t be held back by suspicions now. He&apos;s proven himself.</string>
<string name="25647">You see, for the cure to work, he needs to draw magical energy from the Temple of Helm. It&apos;s apparently very dangerous... it might kill him... </string>
<string name="25648">Aribeth and the others would never allow it, so I gave him my key for the wards protecting Castle Never. The magic of Helm will aid in our spell.</string>
<string name="25649">Of course not. I would never endanger the castle. Desther will simply channel a little Helmite energy to help the cure be as potent as possible.</string>
<string name="25650">Desther has assured me that it is all very sound reasoning. It is a simple thing that will ensure the cure is as potent as it can be.</string>
<string name="25651">There is no danger. The wards are still in place. No one can enter or leave without alerting those of us with keys.</string>
<string name="25652">Aribeth... I love her dearly, but her eyes have been closed by the horror of the plague. I must do this for the good of us all. You will see.</string>
<string name="25653">Of course, the size of the container we prepared seems inadequate for such a miracle. I may be a bit over excited.</string>
<string name="25654">I have done what I must for the good of us all, and I believe all of my actions will be vindicated in the end.</string>
<string name="25655">As I have said, some people just have trouble understanding matters of the spirit, even those that seem wise in every other aspect.</string>
<string name="25656">An empty statement. You are merely another doubter, trying to see the worst in everything. Well, I refuse to fall in step.</string>
<string name="25657">Aribeth knows my feelings, just as she knows Desther is genuine. This plague has cast everyone into the dark. I will try to help them to the light.</string>
<string name="25658">Farewell.</string>
<string name="25659">Should Desther be killed?</string>
<string name="25660">Maybe Desther should die?</string>
<string name="25661">I go for now.</string>
<string name="25662">Why you think he follow Desther?</string>
<string name="25663">Why would he follow Desther?</string>
<string name="25664">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="25665">Will things be getting back to normal now?</string>
<string name="25666">I have questions about your fellows.</string>
<string name="25667">Maybe stuff get normal when this spell get done?</string>
<string name="25668">Me gots questions about other peoples here.</string>
<string name="25669">Me gots questions about the spell thingy.</string>
<string name="25670">I have questions about the ritual.</string>
<string name="25671">Let&apos;s go back to my initial questions.</string>
<string name="25672">We maybe go back to first questions?</string>
<string name="25673">Fenthick says that he gave his ward key to Desther.</string>
<string name="25674">Fenthick give his castle key thing to Desther.</string>
<string name="25675">Desther appears to be a traitor. What are your thoughts?</string>
<string name="25676">Desther a traitor. What you think of that?</string>
<string name="25677">What do you think of what Fenthick has done?</string>
<string name="25678">What you think about what Fenthick do?</string>
<string name="25679">Who were the attackers that Desther allowed in?</string>
<string name="25680">Who them guys Desther brought to attack us?</string>
<string name="25681">Let&apos;s go back to my first questions.</string>
<string name="25682">Maybe go back to first questions, okay?</string>
<string name="25683">What&apos;s Fenthick really done? Nothing outright criminal yet.</string>
<string name="25684">Fenthick really that bad? He not do real criminal stuff yet.</string>
<string name="25685">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Investigations in the Docks suggest you knew Vengaul Bloodsail?</string>
<string name="25686">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Stuff in Docks district say maybe you know Vengaul Bloodsail?</string>
<string name="25687">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; New villains, but not the kind you are used to.</string>
<string name="25688">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Does that extend to each other?</string>
<string name="25689">I grow tired of people standing in front of me when villains walk freely with our stolen cure! Find Desther! And Fenthick! I will have an explanation!</string>
<string name="25690">Treachery! We are betrayed, the cure is gone, and I am to believe Fenthick had a part in this as well?! I will have someone&apos;s head over this!</string>
<string name="25691">You, &lt;FullName&gt;, must bring Desther to justice. We must find him and demand his explanation! Fenthick&apos;s as well!</string>
<string name="25692">Go quickly while Aribeth can still maintain the portal. Neverwinter... *I* must have an explanation!</string>
<string name="25693">Desther is deserving of death, as are any accomplices, but I must know why this was done, why my Neverwinter was attacked.</string>
<string name="25694">And we still need a cure... The ritual was not interrupted, so Desther must have the untainted result. It must be retrieved.</string>
<string name="25695">Once I have the cure - once we ALL have the cure - then Desther will be judged, his plot and masters exposed, and punishment will be dealt.</string>
<string name="25696">I have seen Neverwinter crippled with plague. I have seen attempts to poison. Now I see attacks that cause panic and confusion... it is too much.</string>
<string name="25697">I&apos;ve no trust left. If Fenthick aided in this attack, he will stand accused with Desther and meet swift justice. The people will demand it.</string>
<string name="25698">You are an elf as well, so this will be familiar to you. The human mind is jarring to your kind. You are longer lived; your changes are gradual and long-term.</string>
<string name="25699">Desther was a friend yesterday and an enemy today? A lifetime for such a change would be drastic to an elf. I suppose a day is unthinkable.</string>
<string name="25700">Fenthick and Aribeth are young elves. I cannot justify what Fenthick appears to have done, but perhaps he doesn&apos;t comprehend how quickly a man can change, or seem to.</string>
<string name="25701">It was explained to me that the human mind is jarring to an elf. They are much longer lived, and their changes are more gradual. They think long-term.</string>
<string name="25702">I don&apos;t know his reasons for following Desther, but I have learned a few things about elves in my dealings with them over the years.</string>
<string name="25703">His actions seem foolish. He will be judged harshly if his reasons do not satisfy. I would give him the benefit of the doubt, but I lack the patience I once had. </string>
<string name="25704"> I can&apos;t imagine the motivation of this man. Obviously he wants us to suffer, but the reason why escapes me.</string>
<string name="25705">I don&apos;t know what to say about this. If Desther has been against us all along, his villainy has affected all of us... every plague victim... </string>
<string name="25706">We suspected the plague was artificial, that it was an attack of some sort, but I can&apos;t believe someone in our midst would actively prevent us from curing it... </string>
<string name="25707">Neverwinter is going though a difficult time. It is good to know that we can count on people of quality to assist us.</string>
<string name="25708">Farewell, &lt;FullName&gt;. Once again, I am grateful for your service to Neverwinter. There are very few who could have done what you did.</string>
<string name="25709">If you wish information about my trusted advisors, I suggest you ask them yourself. They have been instructed to be cooperative.</string>
<string name="25710">I am pleased that we could count on the average wayfarer to rise up and help Neverwinter in this difficult time.</string>
<string name="25711">It is surprising to see how you have risen to the defense of Neverwinter. I doubt I could have recognized the potential beneath your crude manner.</string>
<string name="25712">Well, you must be &lt;FullName&gt;. Aribeth has told me of your actions. I must say that I appreciate what you have done.</string>
<string name="25713">Oh, and don&apos;t forget to speak with the others. I&apos;m sure they would like to tell you how you have helped.</string>
<string name="25714">You should speak with Desther and Fenthick before we begin. I&apos;m sure they would like to congratulate you.</string>
<string name="25715">You should speak with Desther and Aribeth. I&apos;m sure they appreciate what you have done.</string>
<string name="25716">You should speak with Fenthick and Aribeth. You have helped them immensely.</string>
<string name="25717">Fenthick awaits you. Speak with him, and then we will begin the final incantations.</string>
<string name="25718">You&apos;ve yet to speak with Desther. He&apos;ll no doubt appreciate you being here. You made this possible.</string>
<string name="25719">Aribeth has yet to thank you. Speak with her, and then we will begin the final incantations.</string>
<string name="25720">Yes, it is best that we commence with the ritual. Ready yourself, &lt;FullName&gt;. The plague ends with this.</string>
<string name="25721">Thank you, &lt;FullName&gt;, but that will be handled by Aribeth, Fenthick, and Desther. The details of it need not concern you.</string>
<string name="25722">Things will not be normal until we have captured and punished the culprits behind the plague. I have never seen my Neverwinter injured so.</string>
<string name="25723">I will allow it, though I would request that you make it brief.</string>
<string name="25724">Greetings, &lt;FullName&gt;. I can spare a moment, but I don&apos;t have much to say. You should speak with everyone else so we can begin the ceremony.</string>
<string name="25725">I would ask you not to push into the affairs of my trusted advisers. Fenthick has my full confidence, and by his word, I trust Desther to act responsibly.</string>
<string name="25726">Do not concern yourself with it. Castle Never is well fortified, and nothing shall disrupt the ritual. The cure is all that matters now.</string>
<string name="25727">From first glance they appear to be some of the Helmite brethren that were dispensing blessings around the city. I suppose if Desther was false, then they were as well.</string>
<string name="25728">I will have my guards examine the Helmite temple, and try to understand what these people were hoping to accomplish. I charge you with finding Desther himself.</string>
<string name="25729">There is little time for questions now, but I will answer as best I can.</string>
<string name="25730">&lt;FirstName&gt;, Neverwinter is a fair city, but tragedy like this can change much. The citizens will demand justice. They will want the head of their enemy on a pike. </string>
<string name="25731">They will not be kind to apparent collaborators. Whatever his true motives, Fenthick spoke on behalf of Desther many times, so he is already tainted by association.</string>
<string name="25732">If his reasons do not absolutely satisfy, I do not foresee a happy end to this matter. Aribeth will know what is coming. I think we all do.</string>
<string name="25733">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Vengaul? Yes, I had reports of his activity in the Docks. We used to clash during my adventuring youth but... things have changed.</string>
<string name="25734">I would have sought him out, but not while I am... weak. To face him now would taint the battles we&apos;ve had before. I&apos;ve new villainies to deal with.</string>
<string name="25735">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ve had some association with the scoundrel, but this is not the time to discuss it. The plague is not his style. He would be disgusted by it.</string>
<string name="25736">No, they aren&apos;t. These cowards scuttle behind the scenes as we shrivel and die to a plague like some creeping old age... </string>
<string name="25737">(ahem) Well, Vengaul may want to bring back the old days, but I have responsibilities and... I will not indulge him.</string>
<string name="25738">You are referring to the disagreements between Aribeth, Fenthick and Desther? Yes, they have had different ideas about how to fight the plague. I demanded it.</string>
<string name="25739">I have no use for advisers and officers who merely parrot each other. I wanted every option covered, regardless of whether everyone was in agreement.</string>
<string name="25740">And now it&apos;s clear Aribeth was right to suggest that you help, and Fenthick was also wise to advocate for Desther as aggressively as he did. The cure will soon be ours.</string>
<string name="25741">This priest is in deep meditation preparing for the ritual. He ignores you.</string>
<string name="25742">This priest is still quite shaken up about the events that have just happened. He is unable to put his feelings into words.</string>
<string name="25743">It&apos;s working! Concentrate!</string>
<string name="25744">Soon... very soon.</string>
<string name="25745">It&apos;s done... it worked! We have the cure!</string>
<string name="25746">Now, my brethren! Attack!</string>
<string name="25747">Desther! What treachery is this?!</string>
<string name="25748">(laughs) You have no idea what opposes you. You should have just laid down and died!</string>
<string name="25749">No.... NO! Desther! Wait! Let me help! No!</string>
<string name="25750">Yes, Fenthick, *I* have the cure.</string>
<string name="25751">W-what do you mean?</string>
<string name="25752">I have no need of you. Die as you should!</string>
<string name="25753">I have questions I want answered.</string>
<string name="25754">Me not need yous. Die!</string>
<string name="25755">Me gots questions for you!</string>
<string name="25756">I want some information about these Old Ones.</string>
<string name="25757">Me want info &apos;bout Old Ones.</string>
<string name="25758">Where can I find Desther?</string>
<string name="25759">Where Desther?</string>
<string name="25760">Go on. Just get out of here, coward.</string>
<string name="25761">You just run away now, worm.</string>
<string name="25762">I&apos;ve decided to kill you after all.</string>
<string name="25763">Me kill you after all.</string>
<string name="25764">I&apos;ve beaten you once. You&apos;d better talk.</string>
<string name="25765">You talk or me get mad! You no want me get mad! </string>
<string name="25766">Back to my initial questions now.</string>
<string name="25767">Okay, back to first questions.</string>
<string name="25768">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; There&apos;s no harm in telling me now. You are through here.</string>
<string name="25769">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You done here. It no matter is you tell me now.</string>
<string name="25770">Either you start talking or I start removing your fingers!</string>
<string name="25771">You talk or me hack off you fingers!</string>
<string name="25772">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You aren&apos;t holding anything back, are you?</string>
<string name="25773">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You holding back on me, maybe?</string>
<string name="25774">You&apos;re holding out on me! Come clean or I&apos;ll burn your ears off!</string>
<string name="25775">You know more! You tell or maybe me burn you good!</string>
<string name="25776">Who do you serve?</string>
<string name="25777">You know anything about any guards or traps nearby?</string>
<string name="25778">Who you serve?</string>
<string name="25779">You know about guards or traps around here?</string>
<string name="25780">Get out of my sight, coward.</string>
<string name="25781">Get lost, scared little worm!</string>
<string name="25782">I want to ask about Helm&apos;s Hold.</string>
<string name="25783">Me ask about Helm&apos;s Hold.</string>
<string name="25784">Why did you come here?! Why kill everyone?!</string>
<string name="25785">Why you do that? Why you come here and kill?!</string>
<string name="25786">I have to get moving. I wonder what to do with you.</string>
<string name="25787">Me got to move on. What me do with you, hmm?</string>
<string name="25788">Why was Neverwinter supposed to fall to plague?</string>
<string name="25789">Why Neverwinter gotta fall to this plague?</string>
<string name="25790">Who promised you this? Where are they?</string>
<string name="25791">Who tell you this stuff? Where you hear it?</string>
<string name="25792">You will die here! My masters command it!</string>
<string name="25793">I... I bow to you. Please, spare me. My masters have failed to protect me as promised... </string>
<string name="25794">What?! But... you can&apos;t! I will die fighting!</string>
<string name="25795">What... what do you want to know?</string>
<string name="25796">Where... where are they? They said I would never fall... I surrender! I surrender!</string>
<string name="25797">I can&apos;t tell you what I don&apos;t know. I was told to report to Desther. He is our leader here. He serves the will of the Old Ones.</string>
<string name="25798">Thank you... I will not trouble you again. My masters... they haven&apos;t delivered what they promised.</string>
<string name="25799">I... I don&apos;t know. He&apos;s here somewhere. He is above me. I don&apos;t ask questions.</string>
<string name="25800">I swear I don&apos;t know! He&apos;s in the Hold somewhere!</string>
<string name="25801">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... I know, but there&apos;s nothing left that I can say except... well, I think Desther is trying to raise some more protection.</string>
<string name="25802">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; There&apos;s nothing left to tell that matters. I just want to leave. I was promised protection and I didn&apos;t get it.</string>
<string name="25803">Well, there might be a few things. **DETAILS**</string>
<string name="25804">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe there&apos;s this other thing. **DETAILS 2** That&apos;s all I know - honest! </string>
<string name="25805">Please! I&apos;ll tell you whatever you want! **DETAILS 2**</string>
<string name="25806">The Old Ones. They are the Scale and the Eye. All will serve them and be protected... or so Desther told me... </string>
<string name="25807">I told you I don&apos;t know anymore! I just want to go! I just want to go! Please! Don&apos;t hurt me!</string>
<string name="25808">What about it? There isn&apos;t much to tell now that we&apos;ve killed everyone.</string>
<string name="25809">I was told they wanted a base to support people sent to Neverwinter. I wan&apos;t told why. I was just supposed to help infiltrate this place.</string>
<string name="25810">I followed orders. Desther went to Neverwinter and we made sure nobody could get word from any real Helmites here in the Hold.</string>
<string name="25811">I am no threat, I swear it. I won&apos;t hurt you, or anyone else.</string>
<string name="25812">He&apos;s doing some kind of ritual to gain power, since I think he&apos;s been abandoned just like me. He probably thinks the Old Ones will be impressed... </string>
<string name="25813">You&apos;ll have to stop whatever spell he&apos;s begun before you fight him. He won&apos;t fall easily.</string>
<string name="25814">I don&apos;t know much else about them. I was promised protection and wealth when the end came to Neverwinter. That was enough for me to follow.</string>
<string name="25815">I don&apos;t know. I was just told that the plague served the Old Ones, and that weakening Neverwinter would prepare it for the battle to come.</string>
<string name="25816">I thought some of it could be lies, but they paid me and promised me more, so I did what Desther said. I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m a fool.</string>
<string name="25817">The cult of the Old Ones recruited me while I was traveling. I don&apos;t know where they came from or where their base is.</string>
<string name="25818">All I know is they wanted the plague in Neverwinter to last as long as possible. It wasn&apos;t my business to ask why. They don&apos;t like questions.</string>
<string name="25819">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Come on, I&apos;m just the hired help. Just let me go. I don&apos;t know anything really important. I don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="25820">That&apos;s all I know! I swear it! I swear!</string>
<string name="25821">Where has Desther gone?</string>
<string name="25822">Don&apos;t play games! You are in league with him!</string>
<string name="25823">Fenthick, what have you done?</string>
<string name="25824">Aribeth is waiting for you. Waiting for an explanation.</string>
<string name="25825">Why me not kill you right now?!</string>
<string name="25826">We&apos;ll let a court decide that. Or a mob.</string>
<string name="25827">What you do, Fenthick?</string>
<string name="25828">Bah! You in league with him!</string>
<string name="25829">Where Desther go?</string>
<string name="25830">A court decide that stuff. Or maybe a mob.</string>
<string name="25831">Why shouldn&apos;t I kill you right now?!</string>
<string name="25832">Do you know who he is working for?</string>
<string name="25833">You maybe know who Desther work for?</string>
<string name="25834">Where is he now?</string>
<string name="25835">Where he now?</string>
<string name="25836">Why didn&apos;t he want us to have the cure?</string>
<string name="25837">Why he not want us to get cure?</string>
<string name="25838">I must find Desther. What do you intend to do?</string>
<string name="25839">Me go find Desther. What you gonna do, hmm?</string>
<string name="25840">Aribeth waits for your reasons. She gots questions.</string>
<string name="25841">What are these Old Ones?</string>
<string name="25842">Desther spread the plague? How?</string>
<string name="25843">Desther spread plague? When he do that?</string>
<string name="25844">But what initially caused the plague? What started it?</string>
<string name="25845">Okay, but what first started the plague stuff?</string>
<string name="25846">Old Ones? What they?</string>
<string name="25847">Let&apos;s go back to my previous questions.</string>
<string name="25848">Back to other questions, okay?</string>
<string name="25849">I followed Desther to help him... so he could prove that he was worth trusting. I followed... to save my conscience... </string>
<string name="25850">Here I am... the fool. My stay here... with the dead... has taught me more in a few hours than... than I deserve.</string>
<string name="25851">He&apos;s a traitor. Desther. I helped him, and then followed hoping his deception was a mistake. I thought he would... He will return! Won&apos;t he?</string>
<string name="25852">No... yes... I don&apos;t know! He&apos;ll come back! To help the people! The people... I calmed their fears... when they doubted... </string>
<string name="25853">He&apos;ll be back! He couldn&apos;t lie! How could he lie?! All this time?! When people had their doubts... I calmed their fears... </string>
<string name="25854">The blessing is a gift, I said. THIS MAN CARES, I SAID! I killed them... I killed them all by believing in him... </string>
<string name="25855">Unless... unless I help him and he comes back... if he comes back then I was right... I helped them... </string>
<string name="25856">He deceived us... betrayed us... but if I help him and he returns to Neverwinter, I helped them... </string>
<string name="25857">No, I can&apos;t go. I... I can&apos;t. I can&apos;t face my love... my Aribeth... </string>
<string name="25858">Leave me... I&apos;ll wait for the guards... I swear it... but I can&apos;t see her... I can&apos;t.</string>
<string name="25859">I... I don&apos;t know. There&apos;s nothing I could do except... except try to help. If he recants, everything will be fine... </string>
<string name="25860">I... I don&apos;t know. I can&apos;t go back... not yet. You... you can find him. Find Desther. Make him recant. Make him say he didn&apos;t betray us.</string>
<string name="25861">Make him say I didn&apos;t let people die because of him... </string>
<string name="25862">I suppose it will come to that. I will wait for that judgment. I swear it. I will wait here. There&apos;s nothing else I can do... </string>
<string name="25863">Leave me... I&apos;ll wait for the guards... I swear it... There&apos;s nothing else I can do... </string>
<string name="25864">I don&apos;t know. He is no Helmite. The true brethren of Helm&apos;s Hold are dead... murdered... just to provide him with a false identity when he came to Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="25865">He says he is one of the &quot;People of the Eye,&quot; a cult following the &quot;Old Ones,&quot; but I can&apos;t tell anything else from his ranting. It&apos;s like he&apos;s a different person... he has to be.</string>
<string name="25866">Somewhere inside... trying to raise undead to fortify this place. He has few followers left, and no more are coming. He claims he is being cast aside.</string>
<string name="25867">He won&apos;t say... he is fanatical... raving... like he wants his blasphemies to wash out the Helmite words he let me believe... </string>
<string name="25868">The plague... he gloated that he was sent to Neverwinter to spread it! His masters wanted it to last as long as possible! They wanted us all to die... </string>
<string name="25869">He rants like a madman. Murderous. Heretical. I don&apos;t know this Desther. How could he have hidden this from me... </string>
<string name="25870">The... the blessings... THE BLESSINGS... tainted... foul. Each blessing that he and his false Helmites gave was tainted... </string>
<string name="25871">He could have poisoned the harbors... the whole water supply... but the blessings raised false hopes, so people would be even more desperate when they finally did get the plague.</string>
<string name="25872">Such cruelty... carefully designed to destroy our wills... and I trusted him. Made other people trust him... their deaths are on my hands too... </string>
<string name="25873">I don&apos;t know... Desther was only sent to Neverwinter after the plague started. Whoever his masters are, I don&apos;t think they were prepared at the time.</string>
<string name="25874">Whatever these Old Ones are, they have abandoned him. He screams that he deserves protection, but none is coming. Whatever his purpose was, it is over now.</string>
<string name="25875">Desther just says he was supposed to prolong it... to stop our cures. There&apos;s something about the way it kills people... something they wanted to last as long as possible.</string>
<string name="25876">All those people... and I let him do it. I made people trust him.</string>
<string name="25877">I will say whatever you want... I have hurt so many. I made everyone trust him... I believed in him. I let this happen... </string>
<string name="25878">Who commanded Desther to do all of this?</string>
<string name="25879">I am grateful. Will you help me find him?</string>
<string name="25880">Who are you? How do you know these things?</string>
<string name="25881">Why does Desther surround himself with undead?</string>
<string name="25882">How can I get inside the Hold?</string>
<string name="25883">How maybe me get inside Hold?</string>
<string name="25884">Why Desther making all kinda undead?</string>
<string name="25885">Who tell Desther to do this stuff?</string>
<string name="25886">How you know this? Who are you?</string>
<string name="25887">Thank you. Maybe you help find him?</string>
<string name="25888">Lash out if you will. Neverwinter will learn to accept its fate, even as Desther is allowed to be taken.</string>
<string name="25889">Yes, you come seeking the traitor, the bringer of disease... You are a fierce beacon of life amidst his undead.</string>
<string name="25890">The walking corpses are a new addition, though the... good... people of the Hold have been silent for some time.</string>
<string name="25891">The &quot;False Helmites,&quot; they forced the good away, but now even they are not enough for Desther, and he creates a hasty army of dead.</string>
<string name="25892">I am not here for your questions. I give this insight of my own accord. If that is inadequate, walk away.</string>
<string name="25893">Desther fortifies here because his role is nearly played out. He is abandoned. He has no bridges left to burn.</string>
<string name="25894">The dead are plentiful, so he surrounds himself with corpses. It won&apos;t be enough. His death is ordained and his life is forfeit.</string>
<string name="25895">I am not here to aid, I am not here at all. I speak so you know that none of this can be escaped.</string>
<string name="25896">Desther has served his purpose and now tries to defy his fate. Neverwinter will learn to accept such things, even as you are allowed to take him. Remember well this lesson.</string>
<string name="25897">I am not here to answer your pathetic questions, imbecile. This is of my own accord. If that is inadequate, walk away.</string>
<string name="25898">This bridge used to lead to Neverwinter. It has recently been destroyed, however, and will take a number of days to rebuild.</string>
<string name="25899">This way is barred! The Old Ones will be obeyed!</string>
<string name="25900">You cannot enter! I will stop you, and earn a reprieve! </string>
<string name="25901">Desther fights to live and serve! I will live and serve with him! We are the People of the Eye!</string>
<string name="25902">Back! The Hold is ours, in service to your masters to come!</string>
<string name="25903">Easy now, just tell me your name.</string>
<string name="25904">Just stay here, out of the way.</string>
<string name="25905">If work calms you down, how about we do business?</string>
<string name="25906">Know anything about the cult?</string>
<string name="25907">Can you tell me why Desther is doing this?</string>
<string name="25908">Who are you? Answer!</string>
<string name="25909">Who is you! Speak!</string>
<string name="25910">You calm down. What your name?</string>
<string name="25911">Do you know why Desther do this?</string>
<string name="25912">What you know about the cult?</string>
<string name="25913">If you like work, maybe we do trading?</string>
<string name="25914">You stay here where it sorta safe.</string>
<string name="25915">Can&apos;t I just work alone? Like a normal day? No death, no cult, no Desther... </string>
<string name="25916">Don&apos;t kill me! I&apos;ll do what you say, just don&apos;t kill me!</string>
<string name="25917">I&apos;m... I&apos;m Johnny. Me and dad, we run the Hold storehouse. But... Some cult took over a few weeks ago. People of the Eye?</string>
<string name="25918">They killed lots of Helmites, but left us alive to work... and now the boss, Desther? He&apos;s raising their dead bodies! Everywhere!</string>
<string name="25919">Now dad is dead and there&apos;s zombies and stuff... I just want to work... I just wanna sort the nails... </string>
<string name="25920">Yeah... yeah... I&apos;ll just... organize the shelves... or something... </string>
<string name="25921">Simple business... okay, I can do that... but, it&apos;s gotta be fair or I&apos;ll get in trouble... if this blows over, anyway.</string>
<string name="25922">They... they were here as spies, I think. Then one day they just killed almost all the brothers. Except Dumal.</string>
<string name="25923">I don&apos;t know who they are. They worship something called the &quot;Old Ones?&quot; Must be some northern cult, maybe.</string>
<string name="25924">I don&apos;t know! He marches in saying something about being cast aside, saying he isn&apos;t getting any more help, and now he&apos;s raising the dead.</string>
<string name="25925">I heard him yelling while I hid. He said he wouldn&apos;t be abandoned. Said he had plans to prove himself.</string>
<string name="25926">You are one of Desther&apos;s men? Not a trapped Helmite?</string>
<string name="25927">You&apos;ll get no sympathy here, invader.</string>
<string name="25928">Tell me where Desther is!</string>
<string name="25929">Who are your Masters?</string>
<string name="25930">Why was Desther abandoned!</string>
<string name="25931">Tell me about your masters!</string>
<string name="25932">What if I let you out?</string>
<string name="25933">Tell me about Desther or I will kill you!</string>
<string name="25934">Maybe I&apos;ll talk to you later. Insane fool.</string>
<string name="25935">You with Desther&apos;s mens? Not true Helmite?</string>
<string name="25936">You get no sorrys from me, invader.</string>
<string name="25937">Tell where Desther is!</string>
<string name="25938">Who your masters?</string>
<string name="25939">Why was dat Desther abandoned?</string>
<string name="25940">Tell me about your master guys!</string>
<string name="25941">What if me let you outs?</string>
<string name="25942">Tell me about Desther or me kill!</string>
<string name="25943">Maybe me talk to you later, crazy fool.</string>
<string name="25944">Heheh. You know, I would have thought that killing the Helmites of this place once would be enough... but no... </string>
<string name="25945">Next thing you know, they&apos;re raising up all over! Lucky thing I trapped myself in here. Yeah... LUCKY!! DAMMIT!!</string>
<string name="25946">Desther&apos;s men? Desther&apos;s!? Desther is a tool like everyone. Like you. Some of us are just happy to serve.</string>
<string name="25947">His time is done. He should have accepted the glorious role he was given. He only delays the inevitable.</string>
<string name="25948">Invader?! I know the truth! You know nothing! We are all tools for the greater glory! You, me, Desther!</string>
<string name="25949">You... you will pay as well. And Neverwinter. The past comes to haunt, and you will be the dead ones soon enough.</string>
<string name="25950">No more truth for you! No more! You&apos;ll learn what you need as you are fed through it! HAAAAAhaaaaahahaa!</string>
<string name="25951">You? You want more? You get nothing! NOTHING! My masters will punish you all for the past! For the Future!</string>
<string name="25952">An honor to die for the Old Ones! Desther needs to learn this! The People of the Eye must serve! You too! All of Neverwinter will!</string>
<string name="25953">Your time comes! Your time comes! After mine, after Desther&apos;s, but not before Neverwinter! HAAAAAhahahahaha!!!</string>
<string name="25954">What? Yes! Yesssssss! Open the door! Set me free and I will... uh... follow you. Yesssss!</string>
<string name="25955">Yesss... free! FREE!! I will tell the Old Ones of your foolishness and weakness! Your time comes! It COMES!!!!</string>
<string name="25956">Forever? Sealed Forever!? It changes nothing! NOTHING!! You&apos;ll pay! All of Neverwinter will pay!</string>
<string name="25957">What do you know of this cult?</string>
<string name="25958">I have to find Desther. I have to go.</string>
<string name="25959">What have you heard? What happened here?</string>
<string name="25960">Who are you? How did you get here?</string>
<string name="25961">Who you? How you get here?</string>
<string name="25962">What you heard? What happen here?</string>
<string name="25963">What you know of cult?</string>
<string name="25964">Me gotta find Desther. Me go now.</string>
<string name="25965">I hope your battle goes well. Do you need me?</string>
<string name="25966">Greetings, I am Dumal, Watchknight of Helm. It is good to see a face of reason amidst the ravings.</string>
<string name="25967">I suppose being caged is better than torture, but at least during those sessions I could pass out if I tired of their rhetoric.</string>
<string name="25968">Madness! These &quot;People of the Eye&quot; are all fanatics, content to be a cog in their master&apos;s machine, even if it makes no sense!</string>
<string name="25969">They attacked Neverwinter for no reason, or at least no reason they have been told! The plague would never have lasted without them.</string>
<string name="25970">They might be based out of the north, but I&apos;ve never heard of the &quot;People of the Eye&quot; or their &quot;Old Ones&quot; before.</string>
<string name="25971">I&apos;d come with you but I wouldn&apos;t be any help. I&apos;m too weak. If you have any other questions, I&apos;ll be here until the fighting stops.</string>
<string name="25972">Screams, mostly. I think something has gone wrong for these cult invaders. I think their agents in Neverwinter are being abandoned.</string>
<string name="25973">Desther led them, but he is no longer needed, for some reason. Next thing you know, he&apos;s raising undead all over. It&apos;s disgusting.</string>
<string name="25974">Looks like he&apos;s trying to gather power for himself, but I doubt this &quot;Old One&quot; cult will be impressed. Whether he&apos;s one of these &quot;People of the Eye&quot; or not, they seem done with him.</string>
<string name="25975">The Hold was my home until it was infiltrated. A third of our number were spies... betrayers. It was terrible.</string>
<string name="25976">They killed most of us, but we weren&apos;t even their target. It was just to support an attack somewhere else.</string>
<string name="25977">A day ago &quot;Desther&quot; returned, and seemed to have a new plan. I thought I was dead for sure, but I think he&apos;s forgotten about me.</string>
<string name="25978">This Pedestal has an indent where a gem may be placed.</string>
<string name="25979">Let nothing living remain! Helm&apos;s Hold is dead! All the world shall follow!</string>
<string name="25980">Nothing can stop our masters! Nothing!</string>
<string name="25981">The masters in the enclave will hear about this!</string>
<string name="25982">Desther be damned! It is an honor to die for the Old Ones!</string>
<string name="25983">Fight! Let the Old Ones know you are willing to die!</string>
<string name="25984">Your attack will change nothing! All the world will fall!</string>
<string name="25985">What ritual, infernal creature?</string>
<string name="25986">Speak, but no tricks!</string>
<string name="25987">I will not speak with such as you, demon.</string>
<string name="25988">I will think about it.</string>
<string name="25989">If I did this, you would be in my debt.</string>
<string name="25990">So you can add to the havoc? Never!</string>
<string name="25991">Was there a reward?</string>
<string name="25992">Now die, evil beast! Feel my wrath!</string>
<string name="25993">I want the magic item.</string>
<string name="25994">I&apos;ll take the magic weapon.</string>
<string name="25995">Grant me some of your power.</string>
<string name="25996">Nothing! Nothing! I change my mind!</string>
<string name="25997">What ritual you mean, beasty?</string>
<string name="25998">Okay, you talk, but no trick!</string>
<string name="25999">Me not deal with demons!</string>
<string name="26000">Maybe me think about it.</string>
<string name="26001">You would owe me if I did this.</string>
<string name="26002">You just cause more chaos. Me not help!</string>
<string name="26003">Me promised reward?</string>
<string name="26004">Now you die, evil beastie!</string>
<string name="26005">Grant me your insight.</string>
<string name="26006">Give me insight from you.</string>
<string name="26007">Maybe you answer more questions?</string>
<string name="26008">Me want magic item.</string>
<string name="26009">Me want magic weapon!</string>
<string name="26010">You give me some power.</string>
<string name="26011">Me change mind! Not want your help!</string>
<string name="26012">What cause plague?</string>
<string name="26013">Where is my enemy?</string>
<string name="26014">Where my enemy?</string>
<string name="26015">What caused the plague?</string>
<string name="26016">Who does Desther protect?</string>
<string name="26017">Who Desther protect?</string>
<string name="26018">I want ultimate power. How do I get it?</string>
<string name="26019">Me want ultimate power. How me get it?</string>
<string name="26020">Will you answer more questions?</string>
<string name="26021">Chaohinon of the Void bids you welcome. You need not fear me, for I am bound well and good.</string>
<string name="26022">You are not those who summoned me. Perhaps... perhaps you would finish the ritual that they have let lapse? </string>
<string name="26023">As you will. I have patience. Someone will listen. I am but a minor evil.</string>
<string name="26024">I wouldn&apos;t dream of it. You are far more capable than those who brought me to this place.</string>
<string name="26025">A simple matter, well within your capability. You are far superior to those who brought me here.</string>
<string name="26026">You see, they have let their petty squabbles interfere with more important concerns. They leave my summoning unfinished.</string>
<string name="26027">I was to crush the guardian spirit of this place, and I have done so. For this I was promised release.</string>
<string name="26028">If you are willing, there is a book of ritual in the study to the south. A Black Grimoire. Complete the ceremony and I shall be free.</string>
<string name="26029">If you must, but actions lead to glory far more often than mere thoughts.</string>
<string name="26030">I see you are familiar with these sorts of transactions. Free me and I will reward you well. Do it.</string>
<string name="26031">I languish here. Am I not pathetic? Will you not help me free myself of these bonds? Complete the ritual... </string>
<string name="26032">Hmmmmhehehehe....</string>
<string name="26033">Wretch!! SPECK!! YOU WILL PAY IN THE END!! YOUR FUTURE IS MARKED!! YOU WILL SUFFER!!! SUFFERRRRR!!!</string>
<string name="26034">FREE!!!! WWWHHHHAAAAAAHAHAHAHHAHAAA!!!</string>
<string name="26035">WHAAAAHAHHAHAAAA!! Now that IS funny. You are not worth my time! Goodbye, fool!!</string>
<string name="26036">Hmm? Ah yes, my... little... friend. Let me ask what you wish of me. Something... appropriate. Yessssss... </string>
<string name="26037">Perhaps I will tempt you? A magical cape, an ensorcelled double-axe, or a taste of power for a VERY limited time?</string>
<string name="26038">Changed your mind? Fine, accept no reward, but I am already free!! Deals such as this are difficult to rescind.</string>
<string name="26039">I do, however, like the taint of you. You have what I offered, but allow me to gift you with something more.</string>
<string name="26040">My obligations are done. I am free of what tied me to this place. I leave you to your trials ahead.</string>
<string name="26041">And that shall be all. Make adequate use of my gifts, mortal. My kind are not normaly so charitable.</string>
<string name="26042">Well, you are a bright one, but it is well within your capability. You are better than those who summoned me.</string>
<string name="26043">I wouldn&apos;t dream of trying to circumvent your impressive faculties. You are far the superior of those who summoned me.</string>
<string name="26044">Free... FREE!!! HAHAHAHHAAAA!!!! Now... what to do on my first day out... hmm....</string>
<string name="26045">Something for the black of heart? Yes, we are alike in some ways. I will offer something... more.</string>
<string name="26046">Name your payment. Is it a weapon, a magical trinket, a portion of my power for a VERY short time, or... my insight?</string>
<string name="26047">Hmm.... you are not the one I spoke with previously... No matter! My rare gratitude extends to all!</string>
<string name="26048">Ah, you seek knowledge from the infernal. I like that. I shall answer, and you may do what you will with the answers.</string>
<string name="26049">You seek Desther. You must suspect he did not create the Neverwinter plague, though he spread it and delayed the cure.</string>
<string name="26050">He follows a cult, but they are also constructs beneath your true foe. The power that backs them... is strange.</string>
<string name="26051">Desther is here, found easily enough. The master above him... I do not know. Power veils my sight... It is... strange.</string>
<string name="26052">Envy. Wrath. Humans stepping where they shouldn&apos;t. All the classics. What the plague DID, however, is the unique part.</string>
<string name="26053">Plague-dead could not be raised, their essense falling away. Healers could not help because the body rotted AROUND the soul.</string>
<string name="26054">Where it truly came from is beyond my knowledge, a fact that disturbs me and should scare the hells out of you.</string>
<string name="26055">That fabric of being did not disappear. Someone or something has gained what these victims lost. The plague fed its master.</string>
<string name="26056">Himself. He is no longer useful to whomever was his master. The plague has run its course. Your cure is done and in his hand.</string>
<string name="26057">Now he tries to deny fate, and may succeed. The power he tampers with is... unpredictable, even to me.</string>
<string name="26058">Oh, ambitious. We have a lot of people like you where I&apos;m from. We like making you dance.</string>
<string name="26059">So you want ultimate power, hmmm? Well, to achieve that, I suppose there&apos;s a few things that would need doing.</string>
<string name="26060">First, you would have to destroy the threat to Neverwinter. You&apos;ll be dead, otherwise, and that wouldn&apos;t be a good start.</string>
<string name="26061">After that, maybe slay the gods with your hatred, enslave the hells by will alone, and march your legions of chaos to the very heart of the universe. </string>
<string name="26062">Of course, if you aren&apos;t capable of sorting out the details, you wouldn&apos;t know what to do with ultimate power if you had it.</string>
<string name="26063">No. I am not your personal font of knowledge, and I am not bound to serve you any more than I have.</string>
<string name="26064">I sense that you distance yourself from extremes. Bah! Creatures of whimsy are no more welcome than those of pure intent.</string>
<string name="26065">I will take the magical item.</string>
<string name="26066">Me take magical item.</string>
<string name="26067">I will take the weapon.</string>
<string name="26068">Me have the weapon.</string>
<string name="26069">Grant the power of Helm to aid me.</string>
<string name="26070">Grant power of Helm to aid me.</string>
<string name="26071">Nothing. I want nothing from you.</string>
<string name="26072">Nothing for me, I think.</string>
<string name="26073">Grant me your insight into events.</string>
<string name="26074">Tell me what your insight sees.</string>
<string name="26075">Where is my enemy?</string>
<string name="26076">Where my enemy?</string>
<string name="26077">Who is Desther&apos;s master?</string>
<string name="26078">Who Desther&apos;s master?</string>
<string name="26079">Why was Neverwinter attacked?</string>
<string name="26080">Why Neverwinter attacked?</string>
<string name="26081">How do I bring peace to the world?</string>
<string name="26082">How me bring peace to the world?</string>
<string name="26083">Will you answer more questions?</string>
<string name="26084">Maybe me ask more questions?</string>
<string name="26085">I am returned to preserve the heart of this place. The demon who suppressed me is banished, and I am free. </string>
<string name="26086">You have allowed the will of Helm to return, yet your nature is tainted by evil. We shall be cautious allies.</string>
<string name="26087">You have done as your conscience commanded, and have allowed the will of Helm to return. Your motives are pure.</string>
<string name="26088">Your nature is indeterminate. Are you aiding the balance, or merely acting on a whim? I am your cautious ally.</string>
<string name="26089">I offer this assistance: An enchanted ring, an expertly crafted bow, or the strength of Helm to aid you.</string>
<string name="26090">To you I grant something extra: A enchanted ring, an expertly crafted bow, the aid of Helm, or my insight of what comes.</string>
<string name="26091">Accept the gifts of Helm. Use them to guard and in the fulfillment of duty. Few are rewarded in this manner.</string>
<string name="26092">But such is your purity that you will receive a further boon. Accept this not lightly, for you have recieved a true blessing.</string>
<string name="26093">I must go elsewhere, and fortify against the coming darkness. Go forth, and do what must be done.</string>
<string name="26094">It is your choice to refuse the gifts I offer. I would have chosen otherwise, but this fight is not yet mine.</string>
<string name="26095">You seek guidance from the divine. That shows a presence of mind I find lacking in many. Ask and I shall answer.</string>
<string name="26096">The plague became an attack only after being unleashed. Desther did not start it, but he did spread it and delayed the cure.</string>
<string name="26097">The Wailing attacked the spirit, rotting the body around the soul. The essense of the victim fell away, along with the hope of others.</string>
<string name="26098">That fabric did not disappear. Someone or something has benefitted from what was lost. The plague has fed its master.</string>
<string name="26099">I have no true answer as to why. I cannot see. That worries me. It worries me.</string>
<string name="26100">Fear, anger, desire. He is a slave to each of these. The master that commanded him is no longer his master. Desther is abandoned, his usefulness at an end.</string>
<string name="26101">Now he defies fate. The power he tampers with is strange. It is ancient, and I cannot see the hand that moves it.</string>
<string name="26102">A broad question. Desther is near, and easily found. Those behind him are shrouded, unknowable in their strangeness. </string>
<string name="26103">I see layers of evil, seeded with hate, but the foundation is unknown. I can&apos;t see the beginning, but I fear what may come.</string>
<string name="26104">I cannot. Such sights are tiring. I hope this has proved valuable. There is little else that I can do.</string>
<string name="26105">I&apos;ve seen many a road paved with such dreams. Unfortuantely, not many travelers end up where they intended.</string>
<string name="26106">That said, I imagine destroying whatever threatens Neverwinter will bring a great deal more peace than exists currently.</string>
<string name="26107">In the global sense, bringing peace means either appeasing the needs of - or, more likely, destroying - everyone.</string>
<string name="26108">If I thought you were capable of this, the fight ahead of you would be altogether different and, likely, against me.</string>
<string name="26109">I was chosen! I will not be replaced! I will not obey!</string>
<string name="26110">I will not play my part! I will not step aside! The plague will continue!</string>
<string name="26111">Your city dies because of me! The cure will not be yours!</string>
<string name="26112">Abandon me, will they?! I will not be sacrificed!</string>
<string name="26113">I will show them how used up I am! I will show them!</string>
<string name="26114">My fate is my own! Not Maugrim&apos;s! Not yours! Not the Old Ones!</string>
<string name="26115">You have come. Fight, then, and we shall see who rules destiny this day! I AM READY FOR YOU!!</string>
<string name="26116">&lt;StartAction&gt;Complete the Ritual.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="26117">&lt;StartAction&gt;Banish the Demon.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="26118">&lt;StartAction&gt;Do nothing.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="26119">&lt;StartAction&gt;Summon the Guardian Spirit of Helm.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="26120">With the Black Grimoire you may either complete the ritual or banish the Demon.</string>
<string name="26121">With the Demon banished you may use the Book of Helm to reinstate the Guardian Spirit.</string>

<string name="26129"></string>
<string name="26130"></string>
<string name="26131"></string>
<string name="26132">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="26133">Me have questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="26134">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="26135">Shieldmeet. What&apos;s that?</string>
<string name="26136">Why do you think the place &quot;shut down?&quot;</string>
<string name="26137">You&apos;re sure Desther&apos;s back?</string>
<string name="26138">What is this place?</string>
<string name="26139">Shield-meat. What that be?</string>
<string name="26140">Why you think this place &quot;shut down?&quot;</string>
<string name="26141">Des-ter back for sure, then, yuh?</string>
<string name="26142">Uh... What this place called?</string>
<string name="26143">Anything strike you as odd this Shieldmeet?</string>
<string name="26144">Shield-meat strike you funny this year?</string>
<string name="26145">Which way did he go?</string>
<string name="26146">Which way he go?</string>
<string name="26147">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Good man&quot; Desther&apos;s a traitor. Lord Nasher sent me to hunt him down.</string>
<string name="26148">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That Des-ter guy be evil. Mister Nasher send me to hunt &apos;im down.</string>
<string name="26149">So you know Desther, do you?</string>
<string name="26150">So you know this Des-ter guy, yuh?</string>
<string name="26151">How do you know they&apos;re not all dead?</string>
<string name="26152">How you know they not dead?</string>
<string name="26153">By Jiminy, how many of you are in there? You must be friends of good man Desther.</string>
<string name="26154">Travel well... </string>
<string name="26155">Mind the crops on your way through... </string>
<string name="26156">Aye, an&apos; keep yer pinching fingers clear of me crops, too.</string>
<string name="26157">A touch daft, are you? No matter.</string>
<string name="26158">Helm willing, I reckon you and I could wag our tongues all day... </string>
<string name="26159">Hmph. Any friend of Helm is a friend of mine - He watches over my crops, he does.</string>
<string name="26160">Well I reckon a few questions won&apos;t harm an old fella like myself... Helm protect me if I be wrong.</string>
<string name="26161">Why, it&apos;s a plantin&apos; festival for folks like me. For the Helmites, though, they come to the keep and figger out how to protect us over the comin&apos; year.</string>
<string name="26162">Fear o&apos; the plague, I reckon. Not very befittin&apos; of Helm, if you ask me, but mebbe stayin&apos; in all the time helps &apos;em protect us, somehow.</string>
<string name="26163">Right as rain. I was headin&apos; down to catch some riverfish for tomorrow&apos;s supper when he and his priest friends showed up right where you&apos;re standin&apos; now.</string>
<string name="26164">Why, this here&apos;s the road up to Helm&apos;s Hold, where all the priests live. There&apos;s no better lord than a Helmite, I say, &apos;cause they&apos;ll always protect you in hard times.</string>
<string name="26165">Up to the keep - The only way anyone can go, now that the bridge is out.</string>
<string name="26166">There anythin&apos; else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="26167">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; By Jiminy, you&apos;re serious? Now I *told* my wife there was something funny &apos;bout good man Desther.</string>
<string name="26168">When he left for Neverwinter, he had me and my ox tear down the bridge behind him. He said it was to protect me from plague-bearers breaking quarantine.</string>
<string name="26169">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;re not going to fool me with that sorry tale! I reckon I know a plague-bearer when I see one... </string>
<string name="26170">Aye, I remember wakin&apos; up to hear shouts and the sound of fightin&apos; comin&apos; from the keep. Just thought the priests were in their cups after all the festivities.</string>
<string name="26171">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="26172">Well fancy that... I reckon you&apos;re with good man Desther, then, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="26173">Good man Desther told me there might be trouble... Guess you&apos;re it.</string>
<string name="26174">&apos;At I do. I first met good man Desther the night of Shieldmeet. He must be an important fella, &apos;cause the whole place shut down when he left for Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="26175">Now that he&apos;s back, mebbe things&apos;ll start gettin&apos; back to normal &apos;round here.</string>
<string name="26176">Priests an&apos; paladins get reassigned all over. If they&apos;re in Baldur&apos;s Gate one year, they&apos;re in Neverwinter the next.</string>
<string name="26177">Why, that was a fine bridge, too. My father built it and I&apos;m the fool who tore it down... Toadstools!!</string>
<string name="26178">Good man Desther had me and my ox tear down the bridge after he left for Neverwinter - said it would protect me from the likes of you.</string>
<string name="26179">Go back to where you came from, Wailer!</string>
<string name="26180">Neverwinter&apos;s in the other direction - at least it would be if good man Desther hadn&apos;t had me get my ox and... I prob&apos;ly shouldn&apos;t of said that... </string>
<string name="26181">I&apos;m still makin&apos; deliveries there, though they&apos;re not going through as much as they used to. They ain&apos;t coming to the gate no more, either.</string>
<string name="26182">I leave a half-stocked wagon outside the keep every week an&apos; they leave me an empty one to swap to, with enough gold to make it worth my while.</string>
<string name="26183">Click to continue.</string>
<string name="26184">Click to continue.</string>
<string name="26185">Click to continue.</string>
<string name="26186"></string>
<string name="26187">Hail, &lt;FirstName&gt;! You have provided a great service to all of Neverwinter in these trying times.</string>
<string name="26188">As a token of Lord Nasher&apos;s gratitude, he thought you might want to bear witness to the cure&apos;s creation after all of your hard work.</string>
<string name="26189">Before the ritual proceeds, however, the four assembled would each like the chance to speak with you and offer their personal thanks for what you have achieved.</string>
<string name="26190">Go on, speak with them -- I must inform the town crier of the good news.</string>

<string name="26479">Is there anywhere I can find work here?</string>
<string name="26480">I need some directions, actually.</string>
<string name="26481">What go on in city?</string>
<string name="26482">Have you heard of any cults in the city?</string>
<string name="26483">Me look for work. What you know?</string>
<string name="26484">Me not know way around city. You help?</string>
<string name="26485">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there any correlation between the plague in Neverwinter and the fighting, here?</string>
<string name="26486">Maybe I could ask you something else.</string>
<string name="26487">Me want to ask other question.</string>
<string name="26488">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="26489">Is there someplace nearby to buy equipment?</string>
<string name="26490">Where can I find the Host Tower?</string>
<string name="26491">Where close temple?</string>
<string name="26492">Need to find store.</string>
<string name="26493">Where me find Host Tower?</string>
<string name="26494"></string>
<string name="26495">Who are you?</string>
<string name="26496">Who you be?</string>
<string name="26497"></string>
<string name="26498"></string>
<string name="26499"></string>
<string name="26500"></string>
<string name="26501">How does one get into the Host Tower?</string>
<string name="26502">How you gets into Host Tower?</string>
<string name="26503">Do you know what started all of this?</string>
<string name="26504">Tell me about the High Captains.</string>
<string name="26505">Why doesn&apos;t someone put a stop to this?</string>
<string name="26506">Have you heard any rumors?</string>
<string name="26507">What start all this? You knows?</string>
<string name="26508">Tell me &apos;bout High Captains.</string>
<string name="26509">Why nobody stop fighting?</string>
<string name="26510">You hear rumors, maybe?</string>
<string name="26511">Tell me about the Arcane Brotherhood.</string>
<string name="26512">What is Arcane Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="26513">How do you get into the Host Tower, then?</string>
<string name="26514">How you gets to Host Tower?</string>
<string name="26515">Tell me about Baram.</string>
<string name="26516">Tell me about Kurth.</string>
<string name="26517">You tell me stuff &apos;bout Baram.</string>
<string name="26518">You tell me stuff &apos;bout Kurth.</string>
<string name="26519">What&apos;s this about necromancers?</string>
<string name="26520">Can you think of anyone who might know more?</string>
<string name="26521">What you says? Necromancers?</string>
<string name="26522">You knows someone, maybe, who tell more?</string>
<string name="26523">A stranger to Luskan... and a &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;, besides. The Cutlass Inn certainly hasn&apos;t gotten many visitors since the High Captains sealed the gates and the docks... allow me to welcome you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="26524">Greetings, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. You are... from the northern forests, then? Normally I don&apos;t allow barbarians to stay at the Cutlass Inn, but since the High Captains sealed the gates and docks, I&apos;ve had little enough business.</string>
<string name="26525">I won&apos;t ask how you got into Luskan, &lt;brother/sister&gt;, but a holy &lt;man/woman&gt; is always welcome in the Cutlass Inn. The gods know I&apos;ve seen little enough business since the High Captains sealed the gates and docks... I can use all the divine favor I can get.</string>
<string name="26526">Greetings, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Have you come to find refuge at the Cutlass Inn, like most of these other folk? Business has been poor since the High Captains sealed the gates and docks, so I&apos;m more than pleased to welcome you.</string>
<string name="26527">Another lost soul seeking refuge at the Cutlass Inn, is it? Since the High Captains sealed the gates and docks, I&apos;ve had little true business... allow me to bid you welcome, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="26528">What&apos;s this? Another stray looking for refuge at the Cutlass Inn? Ehhh, fair enough. The gods know since the High Captains sealed the city, I&apos;ve seen little enough business. Make no trouble while you&apos;re here, however.</string>
<string name="26529">As you wish, friend. Do be careful in the streets.</string>
<string name="26530">Aye. Be wary if you head outside.</string>
<string name="26531">Yes, yes, off you go. Don&apos;t get killed out there.</string>
<string name="26532">Sorry. I&apos;d like to accomodate you, but the inn is packed to the rafters with refugees as it is.</string>
<string name="26533">Aye, ask if you wish. I suppose I&apos;ve not much else to do.</string>
<string name="26534">I suppose there&apos;s no harm in it. What would you like to know?</string>
<string name="26535">Oh, dear. Why do I suddenly have visions of yet another room demolished? (sigh)</string>
<string name="26536">Ah. Well, that&apos;s the big question, isn&apos;t it? The High Captains have been fighting for weeks, now, each trying to kill the other. They&apos;ve gone completely crazy, I&apos;ve heard, each trying to take power in the city for himself.</string>
<string name="26537">Hmmm. Now that you mention it, word about the plague arrived here right after the fighting started. That&apos;s the excuse the High Captains used to seal off the city.</string>
<string name="26538">They also started drafting every able-bodied pirate and smuggler that was stuck in the ports into their forces. The amount of men that have died here so far probably puts that plague to shame, I bet.</string>
<string name="26539">Hmph. There could be all sorts of religious cults here in Luskan, friend, and nobody would bat an eye about it.</string>
<string name="26540">My. That&apos;s pretty succinct.</string>
<string name="26541">Hardly anyone is working. The city has more or less ground to a halt, for all the fighting. If you&apos;re the adventurous sort, though, I suppose there&apos;s people who&apos;d want things done, still.</string>
<string name="26542">Maybe talk to mistress Londa. Or Elynwyd. They&apos;re both folks here at the inn who are desperate to find loved ones. Maybe they&apos;ll hire you, I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="26543">Ha ha ha! Oh... you&apos;re serious. You do know that the city&apos;s under siege, practically, right?</string>
<string name="26544">I wouldn&apos;t suggest walking the streets, but it&apos;s up to you.</string>
<string name="26545">You&apos;d want the temple of Tyr...it&apos;s quite a ways to the west from here. I&apos;m not sure if any of the priests are still alive, though. So much for justice.</string>
<string name="26546">Maybe... but chances are they won&apos;t have much that hasn&apos;t been ransacked by the High Captains&apos; forces. Mirabar is closed off, so I would suggest one of the merchant houses in the northwest.</string>
<string name="26547">Well... it&apos;s on an island off to the northwest. The bridge to it is guarded by both arms and magic, however. You won&apos;t be able to get inside... not that anyone would want to.</string>
<string name="26548"></string>
<string name="26549">The fighting mostly bypasses my inn, so it&apos;s fairly safe if you wish to stay here. Supplies have been scarce... but I&apos;ll serve you as best I can.</string>
<string name="26550">The name&apos;s Aruph Thunderfist, if you must know. I be the proprietor of this inn... although it&apos;s not much to look at, with things the way they are.</string>
<string name="26551">Normally we&apos;d be bustling with all the sailor folk and other travelers that would come through the city. At the moment, all I&apos;ve got are locals who are taking refuge from the fighting.</string>
<string name="26552">I&apos;ve got a few meager rooms available, still, and some watered-down ale... but not much besides. That&apos;s more than most have, however.</string>
<string name="26553"></string>
<string name="26554"></string>
<string name="26555">Why would you want to get into the Host Tower? No, wait... I don&apos;t want to know.</string>
<string name="26556">Half the city has been burnt down between all the fighting. The pirates in Mirabar have completely blockaded the area. Word is that the High Captains got sorcerers summoning monsters to fight for them... it&apos;s been complete chaos.</string>
<string name="26557">Nobody does. The High Captains have always been at each others&apos; throats, but they&apos;ve never resorted to pitched battles in the streets and creating monsters.</string>
<string name="26558">Maybe the Arcane Brotherhood wants there to be only one High Captain. Not sure. Everyone knows the Brotherhood is the real power, here, but they haven&apos;t done a thing about all the fighting.</string>
<string name="26559">Oh, aye, sorcerers they are. They live in the Host Tower on their island just off the coast. Powerful, mysterious bunch... everyone knows they&apos;re the real reason Luskan has the power it does.</string>
<string name="26560">Nobody knows much else about them, though. They don&apos;t let anyone on their island... and word has it they speak only to the High Captains.</string>
<string name="26561">Why they&apos;re letting all this fighting go on is anyone&apos;s guess. It&apos;s not like we can ask them to put a stop to it.</string>
<string name="26562">You don&apos;t get into the Host Tower, that&apos;s just it. There&apos;s a bridge to their island up in the northwest part of the district, but you won&apos;t get across it unless the Brotherhood wants you to.</string>
<string name="26563">I suppose the High Captains would know more about it. They&apos;re the only ones who might even want to go out there, believe me.</string>
<string name="26564">There used to be five of them. Since the fighting started, three of them have died... or gone missing. I suppose nobody really knows.</string>
<string name="26565">There&apos;s only two of them left: Baram and Kurth. The two of them have gone mad, I&apos;ve heard, doing everything they can to kill the other.</string>
<string name="26566">High Captain Baram is a slippery one. I&apos;m not surprised he&apos;s survived. He used to have his base down in the slums, but that was burnt down long ago.</string>
<string name="26567">Some people say he&apos;s retreated down into the sewers with the rats. Don&apos;t know how much stock I put in that, though.</string>
<string name="26568">He&apos;s the most powerful of the High Captains... or he was, I suppose. His tower was near here to the west, but that was destroyed last week.</string>
<string name="26569">I&apos;m told he&apos;s taken his Bloody Hands and barricaded himself in West Harbor. The district&apos;s all closed off so I&apos;m not even sure how one would get in there now, if you cared to.</string>
<string name="26570">Like who? Luskan ain&apos;t part of the Lords&apos; Alliance. The lords are probably praying that the whole city goes up in flames.</string>
<string name="26571">The High Captains each have hordes of soldiers under their command... nobody can stand up to them. Except maybe the Arcane Brotherhood, but they&apos;ve done nothing.</string>
<string name="26572">Some people say High Captain Baram&apos;s gone and allied with a pack of necromancers... that he&apos;s summoned all the undead in the streets.</string>
<string name="26573">Some say High Captain Kurth is working with the Brotherhood to raise an army to take over the North.</string>
<string name="26574">Others say Luskan has the same plague as Neverwinter does, but here it&apos;s driven everyone mad. I say that&apos;s just crazy talk, though.</string>
<string name="26575">You see what I mean, though? You can&apos;t listen to that nonsense. Truth is, nobody knows what&apos;s going on.</string>
<string name="26576">If it makes you feel better, I haven&apos;t heard anything about cults. Necromancers, perhaps, but no cults.</string>
<string name="26577">Oh... nothing, really. Some say the High Captain Baram has aligned himself with a group of necromancers. Hence the undead in his forces.</string>
<string name="26578">Not sure that the Arcane Brotherhood would stand for that, though. Of course, for all I know, they may be necromancers themselves.</string>
<string name="26579">About cults? Maybe the priests at the temple of Tempus, if they&apos;re still alive. Otherwise I can&apos;t think of a one.</string>
<string name="26580">Back already? What can I do for you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="26581">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="26582">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="26583">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="26584">What is going on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="26585">What going on in city?</string>
<string name="26586">Do you know anything about cults in the city?</string>
<string name="26587">You knows about cults here, maybe?</string>
<string name="26588">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="26589">Me new to city. Need directions.</string>
<string name="26590">Where is the nearest inn?</string>
<string name="26591">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="26592">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="26593">Just give me an overview of the area.</string>
<string name="26594">Me look for place to sleep.</string>
<string name="26595">Me look for temple.</string>
<string name="26596">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="26597">Just tells me &apos;bout area.</string>
<string name="26598">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="26599">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="26600">I need some more directions.</string>
<string name="26601">Me need more directions.</string>
<string name="26602">What do you mean? Kurth&apos;s? Baram&apos;s?</string>
<string name="26603">What you mean? Who Kurth? Who Baram?</string>
<string name="26604">Who are you?</string>
<string name="26605">Who you?</string>
<string name="26606">I am not anybody&apos;s.</string>
<string name="26607">Me not belongs to no one.</string>
<string name="26608">Kurth&apos;s.</string>
<string name="26609">Baram&apos;s.</string>
<string name="26610">Another assault, is it? I&apos;ll kill you first!</string>
<string name="26611">You want rob me, huh? Me kill you!!</string>
<string name="26612">What brothel?</string>
<string name="26613">I&apos;ll do what I like!</string>
<string name="26614">Me does what me likes!</string>
<string name="26615">The Arcane Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="26616">What is Arcane Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="26617">Where is this Host Tower?</string>
<string name="26618">Where wizard tower?</string>
<string name="26619">You don&apos;t think they rule the city anymore?</string>
<string name="26620">You thinks they no rule no more?</string>
<string name="26621">Tell me &apos;bout High Captains.</string>
<string name="26622">Tell me about these High Captains.</string>
<string name="26623">Can nobody stop the fighting?</string>
<string name="26624">Nobody stops fighting?</string>
<string name="26625">What have they done to Luskan?</string>
<string name="26626">What they do to city?</string>
<string name="26627">Let me ask you something else.</string>
<string name="26628">Me asks something else.</string>
<string name="26629">Tell me about Baram.</string>
<string name="26630">Tells me &apos;bout Baram.</string>
<string name="26631">Tell me about Kurth.</string>
<string name="26632">Tells me &apos;bout Kurth.</string>
<string name="26633">Hail! You don&apos;t look like one of Kurth&apos;s or Baram&apos;s soldiers. Best stay off the streets if you can, then, stranger... it&apos;s not safe, as you can plainly see.</string>
<string name="26634">Aye, be safe.</string>
<string name="26635">On your way, then.</string>
<string name="26636">Aye, I&apos;ll be watching you.</string>
<string name="26637">I see. A little on the slow side, are we?</string>
<string name="26638">If you like, go ahead.</string>
<string name="26639">I suppose so.</string>
<string name="26640">(sigh) Go ahead and ask.</string>
<string name="26641">Hail, &lt;sir/madam&gt;! You aren&apos;t one of Kurth&apos;s or Baram&apos;s soldiers, are you? You don&apos;t seem the type.</string>
<string name="26642">Ho there! Be you Kurth&apos;s or Baram&apos;s?</string>
<string name="26643">Aye, where do you need to go?</string>
<string name="26644">Yes, I suppose it would seem large to someone like you, wouldn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="26645">The Cutlass Inn still operates, I think. It&apos;s to the left of the main gate, just south of here.</string>
<string name="26646">Hmmm. I had heard the temple of Tyr was sacked, but that may not be true. Go to the far west where the merchants are... the temple is there.</string>
<string name="26647">Aye. There be a few merchants off in the west part of the district. They be poorly-equipped, though, and until the Mirabar district is opened up they&apos;ll stay that way.</string>
<string name="26648">Well, let&apos;s see. You have Miss Bela&apos;s here, on the island. To the north is the slums. There are still some merchants to the west. Much of the remainder of the city is closed off. Most of the streets are dangerous... so be careful.</string>
<string name="26649">Where to?</string>
<string name="26650">Hmm. You really are a stranger, then, if you don&apos;t know what I speak of. Most sane folk of Luskan stay indoors, now, if they know what&apos;s good for them.</string>
<string name="26651">Me? The name&apos;s Gregor. I was hired by the brothel, here, to try and keep some of the worse elements roaming the city from making their way to our doorstep.</string>
<string name="26652">Well, that&apos;s good. Be careful if you&apos;re out in the streets, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. As I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve seen, they aren&apos;t safe with the fighting going on.</string>
<string name="26653">Hmph. Do what you like, then. I&apos;ll have none of your trouble spilling into the brothel, however, you got that?</string>
<string name="26654">Another thug? Well, I&apos;ll stop you!</string>
<string name="26655">Miss Bela&apos;s, of course, on the island here. Kurth and Baram both have an interest in keeping it open... but there are enough vandals and thieves about, regardless.</string>
<string name="26656">Hmmm. Can&apos;t say that I do. The Arcane Brotherhood is quite thorough in ensuring there&apos;s no groups of great power other than themselves.</string>
<string name="26657">A group of wizards who hole up in the Host Tower and control the city. Or, at least, they used to. They aren&apos;t telling the High Captains anything, now, as far as we can tell.</string>
<string name="26658">You haven&apos;t been here for the fighting? It&apos;s been going on for, oh, a couple of weeks now. Out of the blue the High Captains started trying to kill each other.</string>
<string name="26659">Nobody knows why... most think they&apos;ve gone insane. Each of the High Captains has their own army, however, and they&apos;ve been tearing Luskan apart.</string>
<string name="26660">It&apos;s on an island to the northwest, by the mouth of the river. There&apos;s one bridge across, but nobody can cross it without the Brotherhood&apos;s leave... magical wards and all that, I suppose.</string>
<string name="26661">Hard to believe that anyone rules the city anymore. The wizards don&apos;t come out... they could be dead, for all we know... and the High Captains have all gone mad.</string>
<string name="26662">There were five of them, before... all pirate lords set up to rule the city together at the pleasure of the Arcane Brotherhood.</string>
<string name="26663">Now it seems they&apos;re going to fight until there&apos;s only one left standing... or Luskan is in ruins, maybe. Just two are left, now, as far as anybody can tell... High Captain Baram and High Captain Kurth.</string>
<string name="26664">Look around you. Many people have been drafted into their armies and killed... or just slaughtered in the streets.</string>
<string name="26665">Homes have been sacked and burned. The ports are completely shut down, the gates have been sealed. We&apos;re all trapped here in this mess.</string>
<string name="26666">Hmph. I&apos;m sure the northern lords outside of Luskan are cheering all this on; they won&apos;t stop it. The Arcane Brotherhood might, but they haven&apos;t done anything.</string>
<string name="26667">Baram is a sneaky one. I didn&apos;t think he&apos;d make it this long... especially after Kurth torched his base down in the slums.</string>
<string name="26668">Nobody knows where he is now. His wererats are everywhere, though... and everyone says he has more monsters and even demons under his control.</string>
<string name="26669">He was the most powerful High Captain before, no surprise he still lives. Baram still managed to burn down his tower, though.</string>
<string name="26670">People say he&apos;s gone and walled himself up in the West Harbor district, and nobody can get in or out of there. Don&apos;t know if that&apos;s true, though.</string>
<string name="26671">What is true is that his men, the Bloody Hands, are vicious killers. If they see you on the streets, they&apos;ll think you&apos;re with Baram. Avoid them.</string>
<string name="26672">Momma says we gotta stay here for a while. Daddy was killed by the soldiers.</string>
<string name="26673">You seem nice, &lt;mister/misssus&gt;. Can I be like you when I grow up?</string>
<string name="26674">They burned our house down. Now we live in an inn.</string>
<string name="26675">There&apos;s monsters in the streets. I seen &apos;em.</string>
<string name="26676">My sister is missing, now. Momma says that she may be gone forever.</string>
<string name="26677">Them captains are tryin&apos; to take over the city. I don&apos;t know why.</string>
<string name="26678">I don&apos;t like you, &lt;mister/missus&gt;. Go away!</string>
<string name="26679">You leave me alone, or I&apos;m gonna tell my mommy!</string>
<string name="26680">We don&apos;t have nowheres to live any more. I watched my house burn down, I did.</string>
<string name="26681">What kind of wares do you sell here?</string>
<string name="26682">Can I see your merchandise?</string>
<string name="26683">I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="26684">What you sell?</string>
<string name="26685">Me want to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="26686">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="26687">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="26688">Have you heard of any cults in the city?</string>
<string name="26689">What&apos;s going on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="26690">I need some directions, actually.</string>
<string name="26691">You hears of cults &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="26692">What go on in city?</string>
<string name="26693">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="26694">Who are you?</string>
<string name="26695">Who you?</string>
<string name="26696">What invention is that?</string>
<string name="26697">What invention you means?</string>
<string name="26698">Why, yes... I&apos;ve heard of you.</string>
<string name="26699">Uhhh, yup... me hears of you.</string>
<string name="26700">Can I ask you some questions about this invention of yours?</string>
<string name="26701">Me asks questions about inven-shun, maybe?</string>
<string name="26702">Where is this laboratory of yours?</string>
<string name="26703">Where this lab you talks about?</string>
<string name="26704">How did this &apos;Contrapulator&apos; work?</string>
<string name="26705">How machine works?</string>
<string name="26706">Could your machine be fixed... and used?</string>
<string name="26707">Could me fixes machine? Uses it, too?</string>
<string name="26708">I believe I have fixed your invention... </string>
<string name="26709">Me thinks I fix your machine... </string>
<string name="26710">I&apos;d like to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="26711">Me asks other question.</string>
<string name="26712">But how do you use the machine?</string>
<string name="26713">How you uses machine, though?</string>
<string name="26714">My, oh my! I can&apos;t remember the last time I saw another &lt;race&gt; face in these parts! So good to meet you! Come, now... I haven&apos;t my full selection available, but what wares I have will still dazzle you!</string>
<string name="26715">Oho! How rare to have a personage of such fine quality come to my shop! Due to war, pestilence and an unforeseen shortage of crates, my stock isn&apos;t what it was... but I bet you&apos;ll still be impressed!</string>
<string name="26716">Hello there! Come in, come in! Take a gander at my various wares! They may be depleted from the war, but I&apos;ve still a variety to knock your knickers off!</string>
<string name="26717">Ah... er, hello there! Most of my finer items have already been stolen, but you&apos;re certainly welcome to try your hand at stealing what remains, &lt;sir/madam&gt;! That is... if you&apos;re here to steal at all.</string>
<string name="26718">Oh, this and that. Magical things I&apos;ve collected over the years, plus more than a few I&apos;ve made myself! I am a most notorious inventor, after all. You&apos;ve no doubt heard of me.</string>
<string name="26719">Why, certainly! Come... and prepare to be fascinated!</string>
<string name="26720">Oh. I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m not much on things that go on outside my store. As an inventor, I spend most of my time at work... except when the outside world intervenes, heh heh.</string>
<string name="26721">Do come again, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;!</string>
<string name="26722">Leaving so soon? Well, don&apos;t get killed! Ha ha!</string>
<string name="26723">What, so soon? Well, good luck to you!</string>
<string name="26724">Cults! You mean... strange worshippers of demons and such? Hmm... I spoke to a mole in my lab that said there were strange necromancers in the sewers. No doubt where all the ghouls came from. But otherwise, no... haven&apos;t a clue.</string>
<string name="26725">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="26726">The name is Colmarr, purveyor of fine magical goods and inventor extraordinaire! I&apos;d be more than happy to show you my most recent invention, if it... ah... wasn&apos;t broken.</string>
<string name="26727">A fan! How delightful! So the name of Colmarr the Uncanny has spread beyond the boundaries of this sleepy little town, has it? Good to know!</string>
<string name="26728">Ahhh, I&apos;d love to show you my most recent invention. It&apos;s a grand, grand thing, truly! However, its... ah... broken.</string>
<string name="26729">I finished it only a week ago... my finest work, in fact. Named it &apos;the Fantabulous Contrapulator&apos;! Not too much, do you think?</string>
<string name="26730">It has the ability to turn out any number of fantastic magical potions, a wide variety according to customer specifications. I would have made a fortune had cruel fate not intervened!</string>
<string name="26731">Picture this: there I was, sweating away at the final touches to the Contrapulator, eager to show it to my jealousy-filled colleagues and end their mocking once and for all. Suddenly, a crash!</string>
<string name="26732">Hideous undead creatures stormed my secret laboratory, shredding everything they found... including my beloved invention! I tried to stop them, but they were too much for me... and, umm, awfully intent on taking a bite, if you know what I mean.</string>
<string name="26733">So I ran for it and barely escaped through a magical hole I always carry with me. Ahhh, alas... I cannot go back to my lab until all this fuss is over. And my invention is ruined. (sigh)</string>
<string name="26734">Well, I&apos;d certainly hesitate to reveal the details of my patented theories on magical physics... but otherwise, certainly! Ask away!</string>
<string name="26735">Hee hee. Normally I wouldn&apos;t tell anyone where my secret lab is... but I suppose it doesn&apos;t matter *now*, does it?</string>
<string name="26736">It&apos;s down in the sewers... and no doubt in quite a state of disarray. If you find it, don&apos;t think less of me for all the mess. Oh, yes, be wary of all the ghouls down there, too. Don&apos;t know where they came from.</string>
<string name="26737">Let&apos;s see... how shall I put this in layman&apos;s terms?</string>
<string name="26738">The sewage water under the city has some... unusual properties. Could be because of the Host Tower... could be that some dragon died here long ago... could be my imagination, hard to say.</string>
<string name="26739">*Anyway,* I&apos;ve found a way to distill the more magical elements of the sewer water and transform it via the Contrapulator into magical potions! Brilliant, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="26740">Well, were the machine working, it would have four levers... each one to add a degree of elemental essence into the mix. A pinch of fire, a dash of earth... either pull the lever or leave it in place. Once you have all four levers set, pull the chain to start the potion creation.</string>
<string name="26741">Use the levers properly and mix the right elements... and poof! Instant potion! Healing, invisibility, giant size, hair restoration... you name it! Aren&apos;t I a genius?</string>
<string name="26742">The exact ingredient for which potions, however... well, I hadn&apos;t time to determine that yet. Please do be careful. And don&apos;t break the chain if you pull it... it&apos;s quite fragile.</string>
<string name="26743">If you want to try, you&apos;re welcome to. It would be quite a delight to return to my lab and have my machine once again intact!</string>
<string name="26744">From what I remember, the ghouls ripped some of my levers. The machine is otherwise intact, so I would wager if all four levers were fixed the machine would work just fine.</string>
<string name="26745">It only has enough fuel in it for, oh, maybe thirty potions or so. I won&apos;t be able to synthesize any more fuel from the sewage until spring run-off... just so you know.</string>
<string name="26746">Er... you? Hee hee hee... that I&apos;d like to see!</string>
<string name="26747">All right. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="26748">You don&apos;t say! Bravo! Bravo!! My work can continue! At last, I can show up those priggish little bastards at the university! I&apos;ll show them, I&apos;ll kill them all!! I&apos;ll - -</string>
<string name="26749">Er, oh... nevermind that last part. *Cough! Cough!*</string>
<string name="26750">I wish I could give you a better reward for putting my machine together... I hope a discount at my fine store will do. Thank you again!</string>
<string name="26751">You can indeed! Of course, as the fixer of my Fantabulous Contrapulator, you&apos;ll also get a substantial discount!</string>
<string name="26752">Oh dear! I&apos;m not very good with finding my way about. I once got lost trying to find my way to the little gnome&apos;s room!</string>
<string name="26753">No offense, but you&apos;d be better off asking someone else how to get about.</string>
<string name="26754">Well... there seems to be a lot of fighting. It&apos;s all rather horrid. Some beastly humans came in here just the other day and robbed me silly.</string>
<string name="26755">Beyond that, I don&apos;t know. I get most of my information from Aunt Binny&apos;s letters... and I haven&apos;t received any mail from Neverwinter for weeks!</string>
<string name="26756">Greetings again! So nice to see you!</string>
<string name="26757">Might I ask your name, friend?</string>
<string name="26758">May I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="26759">Who are you?</string>
<string name="26760">I would ask a question of you.</string>
<string name="26761">Tell me who you are.</string>
<string name="26762">Yeah, whatever. I have a question.</string>
<string name="26763">Who you?</string>
<string name="26764">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="26765">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="26766">I am called &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="26767">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. Pleased to meet you.</string>
<string name="26768">You don&apos;t need to know who I am.</string>
<string name="26769">Me is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="26770">Me called &lt;FullName&gt;. Is nice to meet you.</string>
<string name="26771">You no need know me.</string>
<string name="26772">What&apos;s so terrible about today?</string>
<string name="26773">Do you know of any work around here?</string>
<string name="26774">Can you tell me what&apos;s going on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="26775">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="26776">You tells me what go on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="26777">Me looks for work.</string>
<string name="26778">Me needs directions.</string>
<string name="26779">What bad about today?</string>
<string name="26780">Perhaps you could tell me who you are?</string>
<string name="26781">Who you?</string>
<string name="26782">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="26783">Why is Kurth holding her captive?</string>
<string name="26784">Where is she being held? Do you know?</string>
<string name="26785">What would the reward be if I rescued her?</string>
<string name="26786">I could rescue her for you.</string>
<string name="26787">Sorry, but I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="26788">Why sister captive?</string>
<string name="26789">You knows where she held?</string>
<string name="26790">What reward for rescue, maybe?</string>
<string name="26791">Me could rescues her.</string>
<string name="26792">Nope. Me have no interest. Too busy.</string>
<string name="26793">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sure I can get your sister back safely.</string>
<string name="26794">Fine, if you don&apos;t want my help, so be it.</string>
<string name="26795">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me get sister back safe, no problem.</string>
<string name="26796">Fine, me go then.</string>
<string name="26797">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; All right... but don&apos;t you think some coin up front might be suitable for my trouble?</string>
<string name="26798">Fine. But I want some coin now. Cough it up before I search your corpse.</string>
<string name="26799">I&apos;ll do what I can.</string>
<string name="26800">Evaine will be returned safe and sound, I promise.</string>
<string name="26801">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me think some coin now be good idea, no?</string>
<string name="26802">You give me coin now. And me means now, or else me get angry.</string>
<string name="26803">Me do that.</string>
<string name="26804">Evaine come back safe, me promise.</string>
<string name="26805">Tell me again how to find her?</string>
<string name="26806">I found Evaine in Kurth&apos;s fortress, but she isn&apos;t with me at the moment.</string>
<string name="26807">I am so sorry, but... I&apos;m afraid that Evaine died while I was freeing her... </string>
<string name="26808">Yes, I&apos;ve word. She&apos;s dead. Them&apos;s the breaks.</string>
<string name="26809">Not yet, but I&apos;m working on it.</string>
<string name="26810">Yeah, yeah, I&apos;ll get around to it eventually.</string>
<string name="26811">Say where sister is again? Me forget.</string>
<string name="26812">Me find sister in Kurth&apos;s fortress... but she not here right now.</string>
<string name="26813">Me so sorry... but she die when me try free her... </string>
<string name="26814">Me free sister, but she die on way. (belch!) Oh well.</string>
<string name="26815">No, but me working on it.</string>
<string name="26816">Me get around to it sometime, maybe.</string>
<string name="26817">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Are you sure you can&apos;t? This is your sister, after all.</string>
<string name="26818">Cough up some more gold, or I kill your sister now.</string>
<string name="26819">That will be fine.</string>
<string name="26820">There&apos;s no need for the reward. You&apos;ve lost enough.</string>
<string name="26821">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me thinks you could try. Sister important, no?</string>
<string name="26822">No good. You gives more or me kills sister now.</string>
<string name="26823">This is okay.</string>
<string name="26824">No, me no need gold. You loses enough.</string>
<string name="26825">Sorry, no, I&apos;m not with &lt;CUSTOM1071&gt;.</string>
<string name="26826">Yes, I&apos;m with &lt;CUSTOM1071&gt;.</string>
<string name="26827">Me not with &lt;CUSTOM1071&gt;, nope.</string>
<string name="26828">Yep - me with &lt;CUSTOM1071&gt;.</string>
<string name="26829">Maybe I could help, if you tell me what you&apos;re talking about.</string>
<string name="26830">Me could help, if you say what me need do.</string>
<string name="26831">I&apos;ve spoken to Kurth. He still has her and claims she is alive.</string>
<string name="26832">Me talks to Kurth. He say he gots her and she okay.</string>
<string name="26833">I did what Kurth demanded... but he reneged on our deal.</string>
<string name="26834">Me do what Kurth want... but he still no let her go.</string>
<string name="26835">She suffered plenty at Kurth&apos;s hands... and he has paid for it with his life.</string>
<string name="26836">She did not suffer, no... but Kurth is dead for what he did.</string>
<string name="26837">She suffered, yes. Kurth remains alive, however.</string>
<string name="26838">She did not suffer, no, and Kurth is not dead.</string>
<string name="26839">Sister suffer, yeah... but Kurth be very dead for it.</string>
<string name="26840">Sister not suffer. Kurth be dead anyways.</string>
<string name="26841">Sister suffer, yeah. Kurth no dead, though.</string>
<string name="26842">Sister no suffer. Me kills Kurth anyways.</string>
<string name="26843">I don&apos;t think you want to know.</string>
<string name="26844">Me not think you wants to know.</string>
<string name="26845">She died screaming like a stuck pig, heh heh.</string>
<string name="26846">She die screaming like stuck pig! Ha ha!</string>
<string name="26847">Kurth has agreed to release Evaine if I do something for him.</string>
<string name="26848">Kurth wanted me to kill Baram, but I refused.</string>
<string name="26849">Kurth say he give Evaine if me does something for him.</string>
<string name="26850">Kurth want me to kill Baram, but me say no.</string>
<string name="26851">I&apos;ll try, Elynwyd.</string>
<string name="26852">Me try to, yeah.</string>
<string name="26853">I don&apos;t think so.</string>
<string name="26854">Me no think so.</string>
<string name="26855">Ahhh, h-hello, there, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="26856">Goodbye, friend.</string>
<string name="26857">Aye... </string>
<string name="26858">(sigh) Go, then.</string>
<string name="26859">Oh. Yes, my name is Elynwyd. Elynwyd Direlean. Um... and you are?</string>
<string name="26860">Who... ? Oh. I guess... my name is Elynwyd. Why do you want to know? Who are you?</string>
<string name="26861">(sigh) I guess I should expect that kind of rudeness, in a place like this. Not that I have much choice. My name is Elynwyd, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, if you must know. And you are?</string>
<string name="26862">I suppose I am happy to meet you, &lt;FirstName&gt;... though I wish the occasion were brighter. Is there... something you wanted of me?</string>
<string name="26863">Ah. Now we know each other, then. Please pardon my mood... this is not a good day.</string>
<string name="26864">I would be more pleased to meet you were it not such a... terrible day, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="26865">I... thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Please, this is such a terrible day... is there something you wanted of me?</string>
<string name="26866">I suppose that on a day such as this, that&apos;s true enough. Is there something you wanted, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="26867">(sigh) I am in no mood to play games, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Not today. Please... please just leave me be.</string>
<string name="26868">Aye. If you wish. Although... I am not myself, today. I do not know how much help I shall be.</string>
<string name="26869">If you must. This is a dark day, however, and I am not very talkative. What do you wish to know?</string>
<string name="26870">Considering what a dark day this is, that hardly makes me feel any more charitable. Ask, if you must.</string>
<string name="26871">What&apos;s going on? The High Captains are trying to take Luskan for themselves, of course. They do whatever they please in this city. And it&apos;s... it&apos;s the innocent... they&apos;re the ones who have to pay!</string>
<string name="26872">I see. Please... ask someone else for directions. I&apos;m just... not in the mood today.</string>
<string name="26873">My sister... my dear Evaine... is being held by Captain Kurth, the most powerful of the High Captains fighting for control of the city.</string>
<string name="26874">If... if you&apos;re looking for work, maybe you could help me. I would pay you, if you did.</string>
<string name="26875">I don&apos;t even think you would understand. Oh, why not?</string>
<string name="26876">Evaine is... she is a beautiful woman. When his men raided our home and took most of my wealth, she caught his eye and he took her, too. I dare not... imagine... what he has done to her.</string>
<string name="26877">My sister has some skill with magic... I would have hoped it would allow her to escape Kurth on her own, but that doesn&apos;t appear to be the case.</string>
<string name="26878">Kurth and his men took most of my wealth for their own use... but I still have some of it. I would gladly give all I own for Evaine&apos;s safe return. All of it!</string>
<string name="26879">I... yes, I see. I did not expect to find anyone... not in Luskan... who would be willing to help me, to be honest.</string>
<string name="26880">Now please... leave me be, if you cannot help. It is too difficult to discuss.</string>
<string name="26881">You... do seem like one who knows &lt;his/her&gt; way with a sword. I do not wish to endanger Evaine further... but, oh, if there is a chance for her rescue... </string>
<string name="26882">I... I thank you for the offer, but while you do seem trustworthy, I would be placing Evaine&apos;s life in your hands... </string>
<string name="26883">I thank you for the offer, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, but... I mean no offense, but I&apos;d be entrusting the life of my sister to you. Who knows what could happen to her if you fail?</string>
<string name="26884">Thank you for the offer, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, but I must find some other way.</string>
<string name="26885">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... I suppose I have little choice. The fact that you offer to save her at all is more than most would do. If there is even a chance for her rescue, I must take it... </string>
<string name="26886">I... I have been told that near Kurth&apos;s ruined tower there is a gap in the wall which may lead into West Harbor. I have been too frightened to try it, myself, but perhaps you... perhaps you could attempt it.</string>
<string name="26887">Here... I&apos;m giving you a ring that belongs to Evaine. If you find her, she will likely be so frightened... this will let her know that I&apos;ve sent you. Perhaps it will help.</string>
<string name="26888">Find Evaine, please... I beg you! Find her... or tell me what has become of her. I will die if I do not know!</string>
<string name="26889">Have... have you found Evaine? Is there any word of her?</string>
<string name="26890">Ah... greetings, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. You are... with &lt;CUSTOM1071&gt;, yes?</string>
<string name="26891">That... I appreciate such a promise. I pray that you find Evaine and return her to me... she does not deserve the cruel fate I fear awaits her!</string>
<string name="26892">Thank you, thank you! I shall pray for her safe return!</string>
<string name="26893">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... yes, I suppose... I do not have much. Here is... 100 gold pieces. Please... take it and save Evaine! Go quickly!</string>
<string name="26894">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; That is not very fair of you to ask. I have lost almost everything I own. I will give the rest of it to you... but only if Evaine is returned to me.</string>
<string name="26895">I... I... well, of course. Here is 100 gold pieces... I hope that suffices. Please... take it and find her!</string>
<string name="26896">I can only pray that you find her quickly.</string>
<string name="26897">I see. I suppose I have pinned my hopes on someone who could care less, then? Please... find Evaine before something truly happens to her! I can only pray that you will.</string>
<string name="26898">I... notice that you do not have my ring. I hope you have not lost it.</string>
<string name="26899">I see that you still have my ring. Good... Evaine will be relieved when you show it to her, I am sure.</string>
<string name="26900">I do not know exactly where she is, as I said. But I am told there is a gap in the wall near Kurth&apos;s old tower that leads into West Harbor. Have you found it?</string>
<string name="26901">You... you&apos;ve found her? Don&apos;t tell me that you left her there! Or... or worse, that you&apos;ve left her somewhere in the streets! Something worse could happen to her! What are you waiting for? Please, go and bring her back!</string>
<string name="26902">I... I see. I suppose there is... no reason why Evaine should be any more fortunate than anyone else in this city, is there?</string>
<string name="26903">What?! Dead?! How could you... ? No... I suppose it is not truly your fault, is it? There is no reason Evaine&apos;s fortune should be better than anyone else in this town.</string>
<string name="26904">Dead?! No! I knew I should never have trusted you to do this! I have little doubt you killed her yourself!</string>
<string name="26905">Thank you for nothing, then. I have lost everything I own and now my sister is dead as well. Her blood is on your hands!</string>
<string name="26906">T-tell me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;... did she suffer? Has Kurth... has he paid for what he did, at least?</string>
<string name="26907">That... that is all you have to say? My sweet, sweet sister is dead and... ? (sigh) But... why should Evaine be any more fortunate than the rest of this city, aye?</string>
<string name="26908">I... see that &lt;CUSTOM1071&gt; has given you my ring. Has the task of finding Evaine also been turned over to you? Have you any word of her?</string>
<string name="26909">That is good. I assumed that you were... well, you look like a &lt;man/woman&gt; who can handle themselves. No doubt &lt;CUSTOM1071&gt; needs the aid in finding Evaine, after all.</string>
<string name="26910">I... I can scarce believe it! You have returned Evaine to me! I had almost... almost lost hope.</string>
<string name="26911">Evaine explained to me your rescue after she appeared. How can I ever thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? Here is the 300 gold pieces... I only wish I could give you more.</string>
<string name="26912">I... you wouldn&apos;t! How could you?! Ahhh, what else was I to expect in this city? Here... take it. Take all the gold I have. 375 gold pieces... I have nothing else to give you.</string>
<string name="26913">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Obviously you are correct I would rather be poor and destitute than have Evaine killed. Here is 375 gold... though it is truly all I own.</string>
<string name="26914">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I am no longer a wealthy man, &lt;FirstName&gt;... would you take my last coin? My previous offer will simply have to suffice.</string>
<string name="26915">Come, then, Evaine. I believe I have arranged a way out of this hellish city... let us use it at once.</string>
<string name="26916">Take it, then. You deserve far more, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="26917">You... are far, far too kind, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Far too good for this city, at the very least. I hope the gods smile kindly on you for all that you&apos;ve done.</string>
<string name="26918">I really must be going. I have arranged a way out of this city once and for all... I intend to leave as quickly as possible.</string>
<string name="26919">I have paid him a fortune in ransom... begged him, even, to release her... but he refuses. There is no authority for me to turn to... Kurth does as he pleases. I fear I shall never see her again.</string>
<string name="26920">Oh, my apologies. It&apos;s just that you look like... well, that is, I assumed &lt;CUSTOM1071&gt; might have recruited you to help with my, ah, situation. Oh, please don&apos;t mind me... </string>
<string name="26921">I suppose there would be no harm in that.</string>
<string name="26922">I... do appreciate your offer, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, but &lt;CUSTOM1071&gt; has already offered to try and return Evaine to me. I would not want you to attempt her rescue... only to find that someone else has done it. </string>
<string name="26923">Of course... were you the one to bring Evaine to me, I would gladly pay you the reward, instead. What is important is that Evaine is safe... that is all I care about.</string>
<string name="26924">Please... do excuse me. I worry so much for her safety, this is... difficult to talk about.</string>
<string name="26925">Ahhh... hello, again. Might you have heard anything of Evaine? I know it is much to hope for... </string>
<string name="26926">Kurth once had a tower not far from here, but it was burnt down in the recent fighting. My Evaine could be dead... and if not, she is wherever Kurth has moved to.</string>
<string name="26927">I... good. I hope the bastard rots in hell. E-excuse me, then... </string>
<string name="26928">That is... good to know. Thank you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Now, please... excuse me... </string>
<string name="26929">I... I see. Than I shall see that he pays for what he has done. Somehow. E-excuse me, please... </string>
<string name="26930">I... I suppose it is good that she did not suffer, then. Thank you for that much, at least. As for him... I shall see he pays. Somehow.</string>
<string name="26931">I see. No... perhaps I don&apos;t, at that. Excuse me, then, I... must go.</string>
<string name="26932">You... are a very cruel and evil &lt;man/woman&gt;. I am very sorry I ever met you.</string>
<string name="26933">She is alive! Thank the gods! Can you... can you get her away from him? Is there some way?</string>
<string name="26934">Please! Do something, don&apos;t leave her there! I beg you!</string>
<string name="26935">Thank you! It is... good to know that she is still alive, at least. Thank you for telling me that much.</string>
<string name="26936">That is wonderful news! I... I dare not ask what such a man might ask of you, but I beg that you do as he says! Please save Evaine!</string>
<string name="26937">Then... can you not get inside his base? Kill him and save Evaine or... or something? Please, please! I cannot know that she alive but that I cannot save her!</string>
<string name="26938">That loathesome bastard! Ahhhh, one could only expect it from one such as he!</string>
<string name="26939">Please... please find out if Evaine is at least all right! Storm his base, or... or something! I beg you, please!</string>
<string name="26940">Some say that his Bloody Hands have taken over the West Harbor district... walled it off from the rest of the city. If so, I have no clue how anyone might reach her.</string>
<string name="26941">There be not much for us t&apos; do except wait... and hope that the fighting stops.</string>
<string name="26942">Aruph&apos;s been kind enough to give us refuge, here. Me, I&apos;d like to just go home.</string>
<string name="26943">If the guardsmen capture you, they take ye to the sorcerers and turn ye into... something else.</string>
<string name="26944">Have ye no decency?! Put something on, for the love o&apos; Ilmater!</string>
<string name="26945">Ye gone mad, have ye? Took off all yer clothes, streaking about like a lunatic?</string>
<string name="26946">Aye. Ye aren&apos;t the only one who&apos;s had all &lt;his/her&gt; clothes stolen, here.</string>
<string name="26947">Did ye just come in from the streets? Ye&apos;re covered with wounds an&apos; blood!</string>
<string name="26948">Ye&apos;re bleeding all over the floor, ye are. Aruph&apos;s not goin&apos; to like that.</string>
<string name="26949">Ach! Ye&apos;re hurt, &lt;lad/lass&gt;! Ye should see someone to bandage yerself up!</string>
<string name="26950">Ah, &apos;tis a pity when the dullards attempt to speak, much.</string>
<string name="26951">Careful, there, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Don&apos;t try t&apos; speak too fast, now... ye&apos;ll only hurt yerself.</string>
<string name="26952">My first cousin sounded like ye do. He chased after butterflies an&apos; fell into a well one day.</string>
<string name="26953">Must you brandish that thing about? Can&apos;t you put it away?</string>
<string name="26954">Haven&apos;t we all had enough weapons waved in our faces?</string>
<string name="26955">Oh, put that away! I&apos;ll not speak to ye at all unless ye do.</string>
<string name="26956">Ach, &apos;tis a relief to see a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;. I hear they killed all them priests o&apos; Tyr.</string>
<string name="26957">So when is yer god goin&apos; to come an&apos; save us, aye? Or is Luskan doomed for sure, now?</string>
<string name="26958">Ye&apos;re a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;. Can&apos;t ye help us? We&apos;re dying, all of us.</string>
<string name="26959">Best keep yer spells to yerself, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. People will think ye&apos;re of the Brotherhood.</string>
<string name="26960">Are ye part of the Arcane Brotherhood, then? Can&apos;t ye stop the High Captains?</string>
<string name="26961">Ye best not let the Brotherhood catch on t&apos; yer presence. They don&apos;t like stray mages runnin&apos; about.</string>
<string name="26962">Hello there, ye handsome thing, you.</string>
<string name="26963">A fella like yerself could make a lass forget all this awful fighting.</string>
<string name="26964">Get on with ye! Thinkin&apos; ye&apos;re the gods&apos; gift t&apos; women! Hmph!</string>
<string name="26965">The High Captains have gone an&apos; sealed the gates... to keep us in, I think, not to keep anyone out.</string>
<string name="26966">The Captains are all mad, I say! They&apos;ve got demons in their armies, that&apos;s what&apos;s tearing up the city!</string>
<string name="26967">Don&apos;t you trust any of the High Captains&apos; men. They&apos;ll each think ye work for the other and attack on sight.</string>
<string name="26968">Don&apos;t be a fool and go out into the street. An&apos; if ye do, do it quickly.</string>
<string name="26969">Them Captains don&apos;t care if they tear the city apart. They&apos;ll burn it all down, they will!</string>
<string name="26970">Get away from me, blast it! I&apos;ve got enough problems without you botherin&apos; me.</string>
<string name="26971">Ach. I can&apos;t believe it... a &lt;race&gt; roustabout wanderin&apos; Luskan in broad daylight.</string>
<string name="26972">Careful. Any &lt;race&gt; folk walkin&apos; the streets will be skinned alive by them soldiers.</string>
<string name="26973">It used t&apos; be that we never allowed any &lt;race&gt; types inside the city.</string>
<string name="26974">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="26975">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="26976">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="26977">Do you know anything about cults in the area?</string>
<string name="26978">You knows about cults, maybe?</string>
<string name="26979">What&apos;s going on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="26980">What go on in city?</string>
<string name="26981">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="26982">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="26983">Where is the nearest inn?</string>
<string name="26984">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="26985">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="26986">Me look for place to sleep.</string>
<string name="26987">Me look for temple.</string>
<string name="26988">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="26989">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="26990">No, me have other question.</string>
<string name="26991">Who are you?</string>
<string name="26992">Who be you?</string>
<string name="26993">I want to speak to you about Yvette&apos;s baby.</string>
<string name="26994">Me want talk &apos;bout Yvette&apos;s baby.</string>
<string name="26995">Be reasonable. Maybe we could work out some kind of deal.</string>
<string name="26996">How&apos;d you like me to pry the child from your cold, dead hands?</string>
<string name="26997">Fine. Keep it. I want to ask you about something else anyway.</string>
<string name="26998">We make deal, maybe?</string>
<string name="26999">You give baby or me just kill you and takes it from you.</string>
<string name="27000">Fine. Me no want it. Me want ask &apos;bout something else.</string>
<string name="27001">1000 gp... deal.</string>
<string name="27002">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I won&apos;t give you more than 250 gp.</string>
<string name="27003">That&apos;s it. Hand over the child... now.</string>
<string name="27004">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That too much. Me give 250 gp.</string>
<string name="27005">That it! You hands over baby... now!</string>
<string name="27006">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Take the 250 gp. The next person who comes for the baby might not be so generous.</string>
<string name="27007">Fine. 400 gp... deal.</string>
<string name="27008">250 gp? Deal.</string>
<string name="27009">I&apos;m done haggling. Time to kill you!</string>
<string name="27010">Me not argue no more. Now me kill you!!</string>

<string name="27015">I&apos;m not buying the child for that much!</string>
<string name="27016">Me no spend so much for baby!</string>
<string name="27017">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Calm down. I don&apos;t mean you any harm.</string>
<string name="27018">Get out of my way! I&apos;ll take whatever I want!</string>
<string name="27019">I was just leaving.</string>
<string name="27020">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You be calm. Me means no harm.</string>
<string name="27021">You get out of way! Me take what I wants!!</string>

<string name="27025">Yvette doesn&apos;t intend to raise the child in the brothel.</string>
<string name="27026">But she not wants to raise baby in brothel.</string>
<string name="27027">Let&apos;s not argue over this, sir. Hand over the child... now.</string>
<string name="27028">Me not going to argue. You gives me baby... now.</string>
<string name="27029">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I can take the child from you. I would rather you gave her to me.</string>

<string name="27034">Fine. We makes deal, okay?</string>
<string name="27035">All right, then. Now you die. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="27037">*Sigh* Then you leave me little choice. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="27038">*Sigh* You leaves me no choice. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="27039">What wizards?</string>
<string name="27040">Hmph. To what do I owe the &apos;pleasure&apos; of another visit from you?</string>
<string name="27041">Fare you well. Perhaps we&apos;ll speak again.</string>
<string name="27042">Yes, yes. On your way, then.</string>

<string name="27046">If you must.</string>
<string name="27047">Ask and then leave.</string>
<string name="27048">You&apos;ve come calling again, have you? What do you need now? Out with it!</string>
<string name="27049">Gah! What do you want from me now?</string>
<string name="27050">(sigh) Make it quick.</string>
<string name="27051">Yes, I suppose it would seem large to someone like you, wouldn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="27052">How should I know? Haven&apos;t they all been burnt down?</string>
<string name="27053">Oh, yes. The temple of Tyr is off on the west end of the district. I was told it had been sacked by the High Captains, however, so you needn&apos;t bother.</string>
<string name="27054">Bah. Merchants all over the place, no doubt. Try near the temple on the west end of the district.</string>
<string name="27055">Is there something else?</string>
<string name="27056">Not that you were necessarily going to rob me, but one can never be too sure in Luskan. Especially from the baseborn, as you appear to be.</string>
<string name="27057">I see. &apos;Her&apos; baby, is it? The child happens to be my blood as well, as much as I am loathe to admit fathering the girl upon that whore. I&apos;ll tell you the same thing I told her:</string>
<string name="27058">I am not going to give the child up. I will not have that woman returning later with this child and laying claim to anything of mine... and besides, that brothel is no place for any blood of mine!</string>
<string name="27059">Gah! Again?! Are you deaf, &lt;man/woman&gt;?! Allow me to repeat myself, then:</string>
<string name="27060">Hmph. Are you deluded, &lt;man/woman&gt;? I already gave you the child!</string>
<string name="27061">Now, if there&apos;s something else I can do for you... </string>
<string name="27062">You do, do you? Hah! You&apos;re too late... I no longer have the little bastard in my possession any longer.</string>
<string name="27063">Somebody else already beat you to it. They&apos;re probably getting whatever reward the wench promised them as we speak. Now, if there is nothing else... </string>
<string name="27064">A deal, is it? Very well. Let&apos;s see how badly she wants her bastard back... and whether she can afford it. I&apos;ve lost most of my wealth since this war began... you give me 1000 gold pieces and you can have the child. Everyone wins.</string>
<string name="27065">I... I see. I did not think the wench would stoop so low as to send a violent criminal after me. She is even less of an appropriate mother for my blood than I suspected.</string>
<string name="27066">But it seems I have little choice in the matter. Very well... if she wants the child, I want something out of it. The war has destroyed my business... give me 1000 gold pieces to rebuild it and the child is yours.</string>
<string name="27067">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Bah! The beast has been an intolerable hassle since her governess died. Best I take what I can get and rid myself of the thing.</string>
<string name="27068">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *Sigh* Very well. 400 gp, then... I suppose that would be enough to rebuild my business.</string>
<string name="27069">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I have a business to rebuild once this war is over. The price is 1000 gp. Of course, I don&apos;t expect that the wench wants the child that much.</string>
<string name="27070">Give me a moment and I&apos;ll retrieve the child from where I&apos;ve hidden her... just in case thugs like yourself barged in my home again.</string>
<string name="27071">Very well. I really doubt that the wench can repay you what you&apos;ve given to me... but that&apos;s your choice. At any rate, since the child&apos;s governess died, raising the beast has been an interminable hassle.</string>
<string name="27072">So I have no say in this, do I? Give up my blood to some baseborn wench for nothing? Hmph. 250 gp, then... that is not much, but it will serve.</string>
<string name="27073">Wh-what?! You wouldn&apos;t! H-help me! Somebody help me!!</string>
<string name="27074">I have a business to rebuild after the war. If I&apos;m going to risk the wench raising a child of my blood, I want something out of it. 1000 gold pieces is the price she must pay.</string>
<string name="27075">If the wench cannot even afford that, then we are done. 250 gold pieces is as low as I go... no lower.</string>
<string name="27076">I&apos;m not going to bicker with you. If the wench wants the child, she&apos;s going to prove she can afford it. 400 gold pieces is as low as I will go.</string>
<string name="27077">Here she is, then. Take her and begone. If that wench knows what&apos;s good for her, she&apos;ll leave and I won&apos;t see her again.</string>
<string name="27078">I&apos;ve had enough of all this! Get out of here!</string>
<string name="27079">More looters, is it?! Get out! Get out, I say!</string>
<string name="27080">How dare you come in here! I shall thrash you!</string>
<string name="27081">You don&apos;t look like those hooligan soldiers who have been tearing up the city. Why have you come here?! I demand you speak at once!</string>
<string name="27082">If there were still a guard in this city, I would have you arrested! Why are you here?!</string>
<string name="27083">Get out of my home! Thief! Looter! What do you want from me?!</string>
<string name="27084">You... oh. Oh, I see.</string>
<string name="27085">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmm... I suppose I am just not accustomed to visitors in these times. Either way, you were not invited.</string>
<string name="27086">So what is it that you would like from me, exactly?</string>
<string name="27087">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hah! I don&apos;t believe you for an instant! I won&apos;t stand around and watch my home be looted again! Out, get out!</string>
<string name="27088">Aaahhh! Robbers! Somebody help me!!</string>
<string name="27089">Then I demand you leave at once!</string>
<string name="27090">Perhaps that&apos;s what she told you. I wouldn&apos;t trust any word coming out of her mouth. The child stays!</string>
<string name="27091">What&apos;s this? That woman went and hired herself some thug, did she? Well! Just what do you plan on doing if I refuse?</string>
<string name="27092">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hah! I call your bluff! I&apos;ll not give up this child just because the wench asks me to!</string>
<string name="27093">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... see. Perhaps you could, at that. Fine then! Take the little beast and begone! Since her governess died, keeping her has been an intolerable task anyway!</string>
<string name="27094">Wh-what?! I... help! Somebody help me!!</string>
<string name="27095">Wh-what do you mean? What are you going to do to me?! H-help! Somebody help me!!</string>
<string name="27096">Take the child and go, then. I&apos;m sorry I ever encountered that sorry wench!</string>
<string name="27097">My name is Galrone. While I am a nobleman, you needn&apos;t think of robbing me. The High Captains&apos; thugs have already beaten you to it... and burned down my business to boot.</string>
<string name="27098">Oh, who knows, really? The High Captains who ruled the city together decided to see which of them will rule alone.</string>
<string name="27099">I don&apos;t know what all the fuss is about. The fighting will be over soon enough, and then Luskan can go back to being the cesspool it&apos;s always been.</string>
<string name="27100">Other than those fools over at the temple of Tempus, no. The wizards don&apos;t allow such things.</string>
<string name="27101">(sigh) The Arcane Brotherhood, of course. The wizards in that tower at the mouth of the river, across the bridge.</string>
<string name="27102">Not that anyone knows anything about them. They don&apos;t come out... nobody goes in. Except for the High Captains, of course.</string>
<string name="27103">We don&apos;t want any of the fighting outside to spill into here, do we? Don&apos;t make any trouble and we won&apos;t have a problem.</string>
<string name="27104">If you have questions, direct them to Mr. Thunderfist. He owns the inn.</string>
<string name="27105">These folks are just here for some safety, is all. It&apos;s my job to see that they don&apos;t get attacked while they&apos;re here.</string>
<string name="27106">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="27107">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="27108">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="27109">Do you know of any cults in the city?</string>
<string name="27110">You knows about cults, maybe?</string>
<string name="27111">What is going on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="27112">What going on in city?</string>
<string name="27113">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="27114">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="27115">Who are you?</string>
<string name="27116">Who be you?</string>
<string name="27117">I want to speak to you about Erb&apos;s ring.</string>
<string name="27118">Me want talk &apos;bout Erb&apos;s ring.</string>
<string name="27119">Maybe we could work out some kind of deal.</string>
<string name="27120">I&apos;m not going to argue with you. Hand over the ring... now.</string>
<string name="27121">Fine. Keep it. I want to ask you about something else anyway.</string>
<string name="27122">We make deal, maybe?</string>
<string name="27123">Me no argues. You gives ring... now.</string>
<string name="27124">Fine. Me no want it. Me want ask &apos;bout something else.</string>
<string name="27125">1000 gold? Deal.</string>
<string name="27126">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s outrageous! I won&apos;t give more than 250 gp!</string>
<string name="27127">Are you trying to cheat me?! Don&apos;t make me angry... </string>
<string name="27128">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That too much. Me give 250 gp.</string>
<string name="27129">You cheats me?! You makes me very angry... </string>
<string name="27130">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Take the 250 gp. Do you really want that ring, now?</string>
<string name="27131">400 gold? Deal.</string>
<string name="27132">250 gp? Deal.</string>
<string name="27133">I&apos;m done haggling. Give me the ring... now.</string>
<string name="27134">Me not argue no more. You gives ring... now!</string>
<string name="27135">I can&apos;t afford to spend that much gold on this.</string>
<string name="27136">Me not got that much gold for spend on this.</string>
<string name="27137">I can&apos;t afford to spend that much on this.</string>
<string name="27138">Me not afford that much for this.</string>
<string name="27139">I don&apos;t have 400 gold to spend on this.</string>
<string name="27140">Me no got 400 gold to spend on this.</string>
<string name="27141">I don&apos;t believe you - hand over the ring now!</string>
<string name="27142">Hey - if you don&apos;t have it I want my coin back!</string>
<string name="27143">What do you mean you&apos;ve been robbed?</string>
<string name="27144">I guess I&apos;ll be going, then.</string>
<string name="27145">Me no believe you - you gives ring now!</string>
<string name="27146">Hey - you no gives ring, me want me money back!</string>
<string name="27147">What you mean you be robbed?</string>
<string name="27148">Me guess me go now.</string>
<string name="27149">That&apos;s not fair!</string>
<string name="27150">I&apos;m warning you... give me my coin. Now.</string>
<string name="27151">Fine, keep the coin.</string>
<string name="27152">That not fair!</string>
<string name="27153">Me warns you... you gives coin back. Now.</string>
<string name="27154">Fine, you keeps coin.</string>
<string name="27155">What about your husband? What will he think of the ring?</string>
<string name="27156">What abouts husband? What he thinks of ring?</string>
<string name="27157">Be reasonable. Let&apos;s talk about this, shall we?</string>
<string name="27158">You and me talks about it, okay?</string>
<string name="27159">Why do you think Erb wants his ring back?</string>
<string name="27160">Why you thinks gnome wants ring back?</string>
<string name="27161">Fine. Hand over the ring, then... now.</string>
<string name="27162">Fine. You gives ring... now.</string>
<string name="27163">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Finesse]&lt;/Start&gt; How about the fact that you&apos;ve broken Section 12 of Luskan&apos;s gift-receiving code?</string>
<string name="27164">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Threaten]&lt;/Start&gt; Ignorance is no excuse. I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ll have to place you under arrest.</string>
<string name="27165">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, yes. You see, that ring is quite valuable, and Erb didn&apos;t pay his taxes on it.</string>
<string name="27166">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You don&apos;t want me to turn you in, do you? So just give me the ring.</string>
<string name="27167">Er, yes... just a joke. Ha ha!</string>
<string name="27168">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; It means I&apos;ll have to arrest Erb unless the ring is returned.</string>
<string name="27169">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; It means you&apos;ll have to pay the taxes... or return the ring.</string>
<string name="27170">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; It means I&apos;ll have to arrest you. Sorry.</string>
<string name="27171">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I guess Erb was trying to get you into trouble. He must not love you as much as you thought.</string>
<string name="27172">Oh, nothing. Forget I said anything.</string>
<string name="27173">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You really want to keep the ring of a man who doesn&apos;t love you?</string>
<string name="27174">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You wants ring of gnome who no loves you?</string>
<string name="27175">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Erb doesn&apos;t love you, let me assure you.</string>
<string name="27176">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Gnome not love you, me knows.</string>
<string name="27177">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; It doesn&apos;t matter. You&apos;ve broken Section 12 of Luskan&apos;s gift-receiving code, m&apos;lady.</string>
<string name="27178">He&apos;s frightened of your husband. You want him to get hurt?</string>
<string name="27179">He scared of husband. You wants gnome hurt?</string>
<string name="27180">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, Erb thinks you must, since you won&apos;t return the ring.</string>
<string name="27181">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Gnome thinks so, since you not gives ring back.</string>
<string name="27182">Fine. I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="27183">Fine. Me sorry.</string>
<string name="27184">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; You think I can&apos;t take your guards? Try me.</string>
<string name="27185">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; You thinks me not take guards? You funny lady.</string>
<string name="27186">That&apos;s it! I&apos;m through playing around!</string>
<string name="27187">That it! Me done being nice!!</string>
<string name="27188">Forget it. I&apos;m leaving.</string>
<string name="27189">Forgets it. Me go, anyways.</string>
<string name="27190">I don&apos;t believe you - hand over the ring now!</string>
<string name="27191">What do you mean you&apos;ve been robbed?</string>
<string name="27192">I guess I&apos;ll be going, then.</string>
<string name="27193">Me no believe you - you gives ring now!</string>
<string name="27194">What you mean you be robbed?</string>
<string name="27195">Me guess me go now.</string>
<string name="27196">Oh! I wasn&apos;t expecting any visitors. Are you here to see my husband? I&apos;m afraid he&apos;s out of the city right now.</string>
<string name="27197">Fare you well. Perhaps we&apos;ll speak again.</string>
<string name="27198">Yes, yes. On your way, then.</string>
<string name="27199">Begone and good riddance.</string>
<string name="27200">Mmm. I see.</string>
<string name="27201">I&apos;d be delighted to answer your questions. What do you wish?</string>
<string name="27202">*Sigh* You came in my home to question me? All right, go ahead.</string>
<string name="27203">I&apos;d rather you left my home, please. I didn&apos;t invite you, after all. So, if there&apos;s nothing pressing... </string>
<string name="27204">Welcome to my home. Is there something I can do for you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="27205">I don&apos;t remember inviting you into my home. What do you want?</string>
<string name="27206">I am the Lady Jadale. My husband is out of the city, right now, however. Is there something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="27207">You know about the ring Erbie gave me? Oh... Erbie must have sent you, I guess. Well I don&apos;t think what he&apos;s asking is very fair!</string>
<string name="27208">Erbie&apos;s just being silly. He gave me his ring because he loves me, and I&apos;m not giving it back because that hasn&apos;t changed!</string>
<string name="27209">Again? (sigh) We already talked about this. I don&apos;t know why you insist on hounding me.</string>
<string name="27210">Why would you want to do that? I gave Erbie&apos;s ring to you already.</string>
<string name="27211">Now, if there&apos;s nothing else I can do for you... </string>
<string name="27212">Oh... but I don&apos;t have Erbie&apos;s ring anymore.</string>
<string name="27213">I gave it to someone else already. I&apos;m sorry. Is there something else you wanted?</string>
<string name="27214">I suppose there&apos;s no harm in that... it is just a nice bauble, after all. Fine... you want the ring? I&apos;ll sell it to you. For 1000 gp.</string>
<string name="27215">What?! How dare you speak so to a lady! You take that back right now or I&apos;ll have my guards throw you out of here!</string>
<string name="27216">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, all right. I don&apos;t really want it around anymore, anyhow... it would just remind me of Erbie.</string>
<string name="27217">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *Sigh* How about 400 gp, then?</string>
<string name="27218">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. The price is 1000 gp. If you don&apos;t like it, then you know where the door is.</string>
<string name="27219">Just give me a moment... </string>
<string name="27220">Hmph. You want it that badly, then fine... though I doubt Erbie will pay you that much for it. But I don&apos;t care what he does anymore.</string>
<string name="27221">No, I&apos;m not... ! (sigh) Fine. I don&apos;t really want this thing around anyhow. 250 gold pieces and it&apos;s yours.</string>
<string name="27222"></string>
<string name="27223">I&apos;m not going to sell it, if that&apos;s what you mean. There is no price you can put on my love for Erbie!</string>
<string name="27224">Well! I suppose you are out of luck, then. The price is 1000 gold, no lower.</string>
<string name="27225">Hmph. You don&apos;t even have that little bit of gold? Are you a pauper? Anyway... the price isn&apos;t going any lower. It is my ring, after all.</string>
<string name="27226">Well if you don&apos;t even have 400 gold to spare, I can&apos;t help you. Haggle all you want, that&apos;s as low as I&apos;ll go.</string>
<string name="27227">Here it is. Take it and go... I&apos;m sure we don&apos;t have anything else to discuss.</string>
<string name="27228">What -? Where is it? My ring is gone! I&apos;ve been robbed!!!</string>
<string name="27229">You! You were involved in this, weren&apos;t you?! Erbie sent you to distract me so someone else could steal it!</string>
<string name="27230">For all I know, Erbie may not even have sent you! Well... I&apos;m going to teach you a lesson! I&apos;m keeping your gold!</string>
<string name="27231">Fine! Now get out of my home. I&apos;m sure you know where the door is.</string>
<string name="27232">How dare you threaten me after all this! I&apos;ll teach you a lesson you won&apos;t soon forget! Guards!!</string>
<string name="27233">Fair? Don&apos;t talk to me about fair! I&apos;ve just been robbed of my precious ring - and I know you were involved somehow!</string>
<string name="27234">Talk about what? I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything to discuss.</string>
<string name="27235">You... you must be joking! I&apos;ve never heard of such a thing!</string>
<string name="27236">Well, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s very funny.</string>
<string name="27237">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh no! I... I... you can have the ring! I didn&apos;t mean to do anything wrong!</string>
<string name="27238">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s the most absurd thing I&apos;ve ever heard. I don&apos;t believe for a second that you&apos;re with the garrison!</string>
<string name="27239">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; What?! But... what does that mean?</string>
<string name="27240">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Don&apos;t be absurd! Even if such a law existed, it wouldn&apos;t matter *now,* with all this fighting.</string>
<string name="27241">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh no! My poor Erbie! All right, then, have it your way! You can have the ring... you leave him alone!</string>
<string name="27242">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, that&apos;s fine! My husband has plenty of coin, he... oh. Wait. (sigh) That won&apos;t work.</string>
<string name="27243">I guess... I guess I shall have to return the ring.</string>
<string name="27244">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... guess you&apos;re right. That wasn&apos;t very nice of him.</string>
<string name="27245">I should keep the ring, then. It&apos;s pretty... and that pig of a gnome doesn&apos;t deserve it back!</string>
<string name="27246">Oh, if he even notices it at all. First he would have to come home. Hmph. Erbie is just over-reacting.</string>
<string name="27247">I don&apos;t know. Maybe he loves me so much that it scares him? Erbie is so sweet.</string>
<string name="27248">That&apos;s very rude of you, you know.</string>
<string name="27249">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;re right. It&apos;s a gaudy thing, anyway. I&apos;ll give you the ring, then, if you&apos;ll throw it in his face.</string>
<string name="27250">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hah! I get expensive gifts all the time from my husband, don&apos;t I? The ring is mine, now.</string>
<string name="27251">Well, no... no, of course I don&apos;t want Erbie hurt!</string>
<string name="27252">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; He... doesn&apos;t? But, I... oh! There&apos;s someone else, isn&apos;t there? He wants to... give the ring to someone else! That pig!</string>
<string name="27253">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh piffle! I don&apos;t believe you. Erbie loves me!</string>
<string name="27254">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t want Erbie thinking that, no! I... all right, I&apos;ll give his ring back.</string>
<string name="27255">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, he&apos;s being silly then. He should know better. I love Erbie and Erbie loves me and that&apos;s that!</string>
<string name="27256">Then get out! This conversation is over!</string>
<string name="27257">That&apos;s better. And you can take the damned ring! I don&apos;t want it anymore.</string>
<string name="27258">That&apos;s better.</string>
<string name="27259">Aieee! Thug! Ruffian!! Guards, help me!!</string>
<string name="27260">I... I... fine! If Erbie wants to send some brutish &lt;man/woman&gt; to steal my ring, then you can have it!</string>
<string name="27261">I... I... fine! If Erbie wants to send some brutish &lt;man/woman&gt; to steal my ring, then you can have it!</string>
<string name="27262">Hmph. Are you going to apologize or not?</string>
<string name="27263">What -? Where is it? My ring is gone! I&apos;ve been robbed!!!</string>
<string name="27264">You! You were involved in this, weren&apos;t you?! Erbie sent you to distract me so someone else could steal it!</string>
<string name="27265">For all I know, Erbie may not even have sent you! You could be some... some thief &lt;man/woman&gt;!</string>
<string name="27266">Well, I&apos;m going to teach you a lesson! Guards!!</string>
<string name="27267">I really don&apos;t know. It&apos;s all such a big mess. My husband had to go out of town on business when it started... I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll explain it to me when he comes back.</string>
<string name="27268">Well... a good lady-friend of mine wanted to start a cult to Sune, once. Does that count?</string>
<string name="27269">(giggle!) I really don&apos;t know my way around the city. My coachman would know... but he was killed days ago, alas.</string>
<string name="27270">Lady Jadale is the mistress of the house. If you have business, please speak to her.</string>
<string name="27271">Who are you?</string>
<string name="27272">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="27273">What seems to be the problem?</string>
<string name="27274">Fine, I&apos;ll go.</string>

<string name="27290">Aww... poor rich girlie lose all gold, huh?</string>
<string name="27291">You loses name? Is okay, me loses name lots.</string>
<string name="27292">Me go now.</string>
<string name="27293">Sure you would.</string>
<string name="27294">Uh-huh. It be bad story, me thinking.</string>
<string name="27295">That is very sad.</string>
<string name="27296">Sounds like a tough break.</string>
<string name="27297">Hah! At least you&apos;re still alive.</string>
<string name="27298">That be very sad.</string>
<string name="27299">It be tough break for you.</string>
<string name="27300">Pfaw! You is alive, no?</string>
<string name="27301">Perhaps I could help.</string>
<string name="27302">I could help... for the right reward.</string>
<string name="27303">Yes, well, life&apos;s tough all over.</string>
<string name="27304">Maybe me could helps.</string>
<string name="27305">Me help... for good reward.</string>
<string name="27306">Yeah, well... life be tough.</string>
<string name="27307">Tell me where it is now and I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="27308">Very well... I&apos;ll help you.</string>
<string name="27309">I&apos;ll do what I can.</string>
<string name="27310">I changed my mind. Not interested.</string>
<string name="27311">Tell me where is now and me helps.</string>
<string name="27312">Okays, me helps you.</string>
<string name="27313">Me do what me can, then.</string>
<string name="27314">Me changing mind. Have no interest.</string>
<string name="27315">Where can I find Baram?</string>
<string name="27316">Do you know where your children might be?</string>
<string name="27317">Why would Baram be holding your children?</string>
<string name="27318">Does Baram have any enemies?</string>
<string name="27319">I&apos;ll go now.</string>
<string name="27320">Where me finds this Baram?</string>
<string name="27321">You knows where kids be?</string>
<string name="27322">Why Baram keeps kids?</string>
<string name="27323">Baram has enemies, maybe?</string>
<string name="27324">Me go now.</string>
<string name="27325">I have found nothing yet, but I hope to.</string>
<string name="27326">Me knows nothing yet, but soon.</string>
<string name="27327">I&apos;ll get around to it.</string>
<string name="27328">Me gets around to it, maybe.</string>
<string name="27329">I have spoken to Baram... He says your children are safe.</string>
<string name="27330">Me talks to Baram... He says kids is okay.</string>
<string name="27331">Baram has reneged on his deal. He will not release your children.</string>
<string name="27332">Baram brokes his deal. He not lets kids go.</string>
<string name="27333">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Your children are fine, Londa... but I can&apos;t bring them to you.</string>
<string name="27334">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; The kids is okay. Me can no bring them, though.</string>
<string name="27335">I am sorry, Londa. All your children are dead... </string>
<string name="27336">Me is sorry, Londa. All the kids is dead... </string>
<string name="27337">They&apos;re dead, actually. Baram and his rats ate them.</string>
<string name="27338">They is dead. Baram and rats eats them all up.</string>
<string name="27339">I have agreed to perform a service for Baram in return for their release.</string>
<string name="27340">Me going to do stuff for Baram, then he let kids go.</string>
<string name="27341">Baram wanted me to kill Kurth for their release, but I refused.</string>
<string name="27342">Baram want me to kills Kurth for kids, but me say no.</string>
<string name="27343">I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="27344">Me do what me can.</string>
<string name="27345">No, I have no idea.</string>
<string name="27346">No, me haves no clue.</string>
<string name="27347">The small ones. The rest he turned into wererats... and they&apos;re dead, too.</string>
<string name="27348">Small ones. Others he makes wererats. Me kills them.</string>
<string name="27349">It&apos;s the truth. I thought you should know.</string>
<string name="27350">It be truth. Me thinks you shoulds know.</string>
<string name="27351">(yawn!) You&apos;ll get over it.</string>
<string name="27352">(yawn!) You gets over it, me thinking.</string>
<string name="27353">Baram... sent them away. To orphanages, elsewhere. I don&apos;t know where they are.</string>
<string name="27354">Baram... send kids away. To orphanages. Me not know where.</string>
<string name="27355">I can&apos;t lie to you, Londa. Your children are dead... </string>
<string name="27356">I no want lies, Londa. The kids is dead... </string>
<string name="27357">Fine, make me tell the truth. Baram and his rats ate your kids.</string>
<string name="27358">(sigh) Okay, me say truth. Baram and rats eats the kids.</string>
<string name="27359">Very well. I shall return.</string>
<string name="27360">Okay. Me comes back, then.</string>
<string name="27361">Forget it. I don&apos;t care if you don&apos;t believe me.</string>
<string name="27362">You forget it! Me no care if you not believing!</string>
<string name="27363">Look... I just want the coin. That&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="27364">Me wants coin. You give me.</string>
<string name="27365">Hand over the coin or you&apos;ll join your husband... get it?</string>
<string name="27366">You gives me coin or you meets husband!</string>
<string name="27367">Please leave me alone, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I do not wish to speak and I have nothing left to steal, I assure you.</string>
<string name="27368">Please forgive me, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, but I am in no mood to speak. I am sure others here will accomodate you.</string>
<string name="27369">I beg you to leave me be, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I have nothing to say and nothing left to steal, I assure you.</string>
<string name="27370">You have my sincere thanks. I only wish to be left to my grief.</string>
<string name="27371">Did you not hear me? I wish to be left alone, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Please respect that.</string>
<string name="27372">I am... or, rather, I was... the Countess Londa Whitesnow. That means nothing anymore. Now I am merely... Londa.</string>
<string name="27373">(sigh) I see you intend to be persistent. Very well. You wish to know what is wrong? I shall tell you... though my story is not a unique one, here.</string>
<string name="27374">That... that is not what I meant at all. In fact, it is quite the opposite. I was once Countess Londa Whitesnow... but now I am... merely Londa.</string>
<string name="27375">I am grateful. I only wish to be left to my misery.</string>
<string name="27376">You know nothing of me, and obviously you would not understand if you did. Indeed, I have no gold for myself or anyone else any longer. Now begone, and leave me to my misery.</string>
<string name="27377">The title is nothing. I would have gladly given it up, and all the wealth that went with it, to still have my family. They are all that gave the others meaning.</string>
<string name="27378">That evil man, High Captain Baram, invaded our home with his soldiers. He desired all our wealth... to pay for his army and his war, no doubt.</string>
<string name="27379">My husband objected, naturally. Without even a thought, Baram... he... cut my husband down. Murdered him.</string>
<string name="27380">I still remember his laughter as he took my children... all nine of them... and turned me out of my home. Once he was done with it, he burned it to the ground.</string>
<string name="27381">Now my husband is dead, and that fiend holds my children. I know nothing of their fate and have nothing left and nowhere to turn. That is my tale, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="27382">Aye, it is very sad. I would do anything to have my children back, but Baram will not even see me... and no one can help.</string>
<string name="27383">You speak crudely, but it is true enough. I would do anything to have my children back... but Baram will not even see me, and no one can help.</string>
<string name="27384">Forgive me, but that fact currently pales compared to all I have lost. Please... leave me to my misery.</string>
<string name="27385">Aye... life is &apos;tough&apos; for everyone in Luskan, and we should all just bear through it, is that what you mean? Just... leave me be, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="27386">Could you? I would give anything to have my children saved from that fiend, or to at least... at least know that they are all right!</string>
<string name="27387">I could reward you. I have no coin here, but... my husband had some saved. I know where it is, and I could tell you. It would be enough, I think.</string>
<string name="27388">I am no fool. If that is all there is that will get someone to find my children, then I will never give it up beforehand.</string>
<string name="27389">I... I see. Then leave me alone.</string>
<string name="27390">I am glad to hear it. Have you any questions for me, then?</string>
<string name="27391">You have given me a glimmer of hope. I... I wish you the best of luck.</string>
<string name="27392">His men once had a base in the slums... but that was burnt down more than a month ago as the war in the streets went on.</string>
<string name="27393">Where he has gone since, I... simply do not know. Some people say he lives in the sewers, now, but I truly hope not.</string>
<string name="27394">No. I have heard no news, and Baram will tell me nothing. He is the only one who would know where they are.</string>
<string name="27395">I... wish I knew. Perhaps he has some sinister purpose in mind for them... I do not even want to imagine it. I am hoping he has already sent them somewhere or released them and I simply do not know where they are.</string>
<string name="27396">Aye. The other High Captains who he has fought with these long weeks. Only Kurth remains... but no one is sure where he is. Kurth would want Baram dead, it is certain.</string>
<string name="27397">You have heard my sorry tale, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Is that not enough?</string>
<string name="27398">You... return. Have you found my children? Are they safe?</string>
<string name="27399">I had gotten my hopes up, seeing you. Please find them! I cannot bear not knowing where they are!</string>
<string name="27400">But you are in no hurry. I... I see. I suppose I can expect nothing more from you.</string>
<string name="27401">That is a great relief... though until I see my children in person, I have my doubts as to whether the fiend is telling the truth.</string>
<string name="27402">Is there any way my children can be rescued? Do you know?</string>
<string name="27403">When you find out more, please tell me. If they are truly safe, I cannot bear to be apart from them! You must rescue them, I beg you!</string>
<string name="27404">Nor do I blame you. I certainly could not ask you to do such a thing. But... surely there must be some way to free them!</string>
<string name="27405">Can you not... sneak into his base, or wherever Baram is? Break the door down, I don&apos;t know... just find them, I beg you!</string>
<string name="27406">You have? I... dare not ask what it is. Whatever you do, free my children and I will be forever grateful. If they are well, I must see them!</string>
<string name="27407">No! No-ooo! Please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... do something! I cannot come this close and not find them! Please find my babies!</string>
<string name="27408">They... ate them?</string>
<string name="27409">D-dead? No... no, I don&apos;t believe it... </string>
<string name="27410">Fine? I... but why not? Bring me to them, then! I must see them!</string>
<string name="27411">He... sent them to orphanages? Outside the city?</string>
<string name="27412">No. I refuse to believe it. I won&apos;t! You have no proof, none, that what you&apos;re saying is true!</string>
<string name="27413">Bring me something... anything... that proves what you say and I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll believe it. Please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... I&apos;m begging you!</string>
<string name="27414">But you have... little Tomlen&apos;s bear. That&apos;s his, without a doubt.</string>
<string name="27415">So... what you&apos;re saying is... true.</string>
<string name="27416">And I... shall... wait here. Yes.</string>
<string name="27417">No. You won&apos;t get it. I want the proof!</string>
<string name="27418">Ah. I... forgive me for... doubting you... </string>
<string name="27419">You wretch! You evil, pathetic &lt;man/woman&gt;! You want my husband&apos;s coin, do you?! Is that all you desire?! Then here... take the key to his vault!</string>
<string name="27420">Excuse me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I must... I must go.</string>
<string name="27421">Now I... I must... go. I... excuse me... </string>
<string name="27422">Th-thank you for... telling me... the truth. Here is the key to my husband&apos;s vault. It is in the sewers... in a long passage north of the water.</string>
<string name="27423">Now I must... I must go. I... please, excuse me... </string>
<string name="27424">I must go. Please... let me go.</string>
<string name="27425">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="27426">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="27427">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="27428">What&apos;s going on in this city?</string>
<string name="27429">What happen in city?</string>
<string name="27430">Why are you so frightened? I said I wouldn&apos;t hurt you.</string>
<string name="27431">Why you so scared? Me say me not hurt you.</string>
<string name="27432">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="27433">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="27434">Where is the nearest inn?</string>
<string name="27435">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="27436">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="27437">What&apos;s around here?</string>
<string name="27438">Me look for place to sleep.</string>
<string name="27439">Me look for temple.</string>
<string name="27440">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="27441">What around?</string>
<string name="27442">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="27443">No, me have other question.</string>
<string name="27444">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I am an adventurer looking for information; I don&apos;t mean any harm.</string>
<string name="27445">Get out of my way! I&apos;ll take whatever I want!</string>
<string name="27446">I was just leaving.</string>
<string name="27447">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me adventurer. Mean no harm, only look for information.</string>
<string name="27448">You get out of way! Me take what I wants!!</string>
<string name="27449">Me was just going.</string>
<string name="27450">Tell me about these High Captains.</string>
<string name="27451">Tell me &apos;bout High Captains.</string>
<string name="27452">Is there nobody to stop all this?</string>
<string name="27453">There nobody to stops it?</string>
<string name="27454">What wizards?</string>
<string name="27455">Err... hello there. Everything all right?</string>
<string name="27456">Aye, be safe!</string>
<string name="27457">Be careful on those streets. They&apos;ll kill you if you&apos;re spotted.</string>
<string name="27458">Aye, go, go!</string>
<string name="27459">I see. A little on the slow side, are we? No matter, I guess.</string>
<string name="27460">Questions? What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="27461">I... suppose so.</string>
<string name="27462">Err... aye. I can... answer a question.</string>
<string name="27463">Back again? Did you... need something?</string>
<string name="27464">Uh... what... what do you want?</string>
<string name="27465">I... uh, sure... </string>
<string name="27466">Oh! You... you don&apos;t want to stay here! P-please! There&apos;s... there&apos;s the Cutlass Inn. It&apos;s to the left of the main gate... they says it&apos;s still open.</string>
<string name="27467">There weren&apos;t many. Tyr has a temple, on the west side...</string>
<string name="27468">Most of the stores are gone, or empty. I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="27469">Uhh... there&apos;s Miss Bela&apos;s. That&apos;s a brothel, if you&apos;re... well... if you want to know. It&apos;s across from the gate. Not sure what else you&apos;d want to see... </string>
<string name="27470">Did... you want something else?</string>
<string name="27471">Ahhh! Not again! Leave me alone!!</string>
<string name="27472">Don&apos;t hurt me! Please don&apos;t hurt me!!</string>
<string name="27473">Someone help me! Please, for the love of the gods!!</string>
<string name="27474">Please! You... you don&apos;t look like them soldiers... you won&apos;t hurt me, will you?</string>
<string name="27475">Ahhh! Don&apos;t... don&apos;t hurt me! Haven&apos;t we had enough?!</string>
<string name="27476">Aiiieee!! Don&apos;t kill me! I don&apos;t want to die!!</string>
<string name="27477">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... suppose you don&apos;t seem the bad sort. You just startled me so! With all the soldiers rampaging around, I assumed...</string>
<string name="27478">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t believe you! You&apos;re just like the other soldiers, you are!! Here to rob me or kill me!!</string>
<string name="27479">Aahhh! Robber!! Get away, get away!!</string>
<string name="27480">Thank Ilmater! Just go, go!!</string>
<string name="27481">Well... what did you want from me? Why are you here?</string>
<string name="27482">I... I know. It&apos;s just that the soldiers have been rampaging through the streets for weeks now...</string>
<string name="27483">They take whatever they like. If they think you can fight, they force you to join one of the High Captains&apos; armies... or they kill you.</string>
<string name="27484">And... and gods forbid they think you&apos;re working for one of the other High Captains...</string>
<string name="27485">N-nobody knows, for sure. Some weeks ago, the High Captains just started... started trying to kill each other.</string>
<string name="27486">Each one of them has their own army, and they&apos;ve been fighting in the streets night and day. Buildings burned, people slaughtered... everything&apos;s falling apart!</string>
<string name="27487">Worse, now that so many are dead... there&apos;s monsters come to the streets. Big rats and walking dead. Some says the High Captains use them for their armies, too.</string>
<string name="27488">I don&apos;t... know much about them. There was five of them, and they was all pirate lords, or used t&apos; be. They&apos;ve gone mad, everyone says.</string>
<string name="27489">Maybe each of them wants to control the city? I don&apos;t know... but they&apos;re killing everyone and they don&apos;t care what happens to any of us.</string>
<string name="27490">N-no... who? Maybe the wizards? I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="27491">The wizards of that Arcane Brotherhood. They lives in a big tower on the island at the mouth of the river.</string>
<string name="27492">I don&apos;t know any more abouts them, I swear! They... they&apos;re just supposed to be real powerful, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="27493">P-please don&apos;t hurt us! We&apos;re jus&apos; simple folk, this is our home!</string>
<string name="27494">The soldiers came here just the other day. Took almost everything we had.</string>
<string name="27495">The High Captains&apos; men... they&apos;ve been goin&apos; around, forcing anyone who can fight to join their armies. Or they kills &apos;em.</string>
<string name="27496">Don&apos;t go out in the street. There are monsters out there... giant rats that turns into men!</string>
<string name="27497">Luskan is cursed! There are undead... things... in the sewers! Everywhere!</string>
<string name="27498">It&apos;s them wizards in the Host Tower! They&apos;re trying to kill us all!</string>
<string name="27499">The High Captains have been fighting for weeks now. Half the city&apos;s been burnt up or butchered.</string>
<string name="27500">Take whatever you want of ours, just... just don&apos;t hurt us!</string>
<string name="27501">It&apos;s all I can do to keep my family from being killed or robbed. There&apos;s thieves and looters everywhere... almost everyone else who ain&apos;t hiding has been cut down or eaten.</string>
<string name="27502">I saw one of Baram&apos;s men... he changed into a rat-man, he did! I saw it!</string>
<string name="27503">The Bloody Hands are the worst. They&apos;ll kill you rather than look at you, they will!</string>
<string name="27504">A lot of people say that you can take refuge in the Cutlass Inn. Not even sure we would survive the trip... </string>
<string name="27505">Have they opened the gates yet?</string>
<string name="27506">Have they opened the gates? Or the ports? We so want to leave... </string>
<string name="27507">We&apos;d leave, but... we hear that plague has spread everywhere!</string>
<string name="27508">It&apos;s the plague, isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s come from Neverwinter and driven everyone mad!</string>
<string name="27509">They shut the gates... and the harbors. The pirates closed off Mirabar... we&apos;re going to starve here, I know it!</string>
<string name="27510">Please don&apos;t harm us! We&apos;re no threat to you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;!</string>
<string name="27511">You don&apos;t look like such a bad sort. You&apos;re not here to rob us, are you?</string>
<string name="27512">I... please, we&apos;ve nothing. We been beated and robbed so many times... we just wants to be left alone!</string>
<string name="27513">Don&apos;t hurt us! I beg you, please leave us be!!</string>
<string name="27514">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="27515">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="27516">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="27517">What&apos;s going on in this city?</string>
<string name="27518">What happen in city?</string>
<string name="27519">Why are you so frightened? I said I wouldn&apos;t hurt you.</string>
<string name="27520">Why you so scared? Me say me not hurt you.</string>
<string name="27521">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="27522">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="27523">Where is the nearest inn?</string>
<string name="27524">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="27525">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="27526">What&apos;s around here?</string>
<string name="27527">Me look for place to sleep.</string>
<string name="27528">Me look for temple.</string>
<string name="27529">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="27530">What around?</string>
<string name="27531">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="27532">No, me have other question.</string>
<string name="27533">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I am an adventurer looking for information, I don&apos;t mean any harm.</string>
<string name="27534">Get out of my way! I&apos;ll take whatever I want!</string>
<string name="27535">I was just leaving.</string>
<string name="27536">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me adventurer. Mean no harm, only look for information.</string>
<string name="27537">You get out of way! Me take what I wants!!</string>
<string name="27538">Me was just going.</string>
<string name="27539">Tell me about these High Captains.</string>
<string name="27540">Tell me &apos;bout High Captains.</string>
<string name="27541">Is there nobody to stop all this?</string>
<string name="27542">There nobody to stops it?</string>
<string name="27543">What wizards?</string>
<string name="27544">Err... hello there. Everything all right?</string>
<string name="27545">Aye, be safe!</string>
<string name="27546">Be careful on those streets. They&apos;ll kill you if you&apos;re spotted.</string>
<string name="27547">Aye, go, go!</string>
<string name="27548">I see. A little on the slow side, are we? No matter, I guess.</string>
<string name="27549">Questions? What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="27550">I... suppose so.</string>
<string name="27551">Err... aye. I can... answer a question.</string>
<string name="27552">Back again? Did you... need something?</string>
<string name="27553">Uh... what... what do you want?</string>
<string name="27554">I... uh, sure... </string>
<string name="27555">Oh! You... you don&apos;t want to stay here! P-please! There&apos;s... there&apos;s the Cutlass Inn. It&apos;s to the left of the main gate... they says it&apos;s still open.</string>
<string name="27556">There weren&apos;t many. Tyr has a temple, on the west side...</string>
<string name="27557">Most of the stores are gone, or empty. I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="27558">Uhh... there&apos;s Miss Bela&apos;s. That&apos;s a brothel, if you&apos;re... well... if you want to know. It&apos;s across from the gate. Not sure what else you&apos;d want to see... </string>
<string name="27559">Did... you want something else?</string>
<string name="27560">Ahhh! Not again! Leave me alone!!</string>
<string name="27561">Don&apos;t hurt me! Please don&apos;t hurt me!!</string>
<string name="27562">Someone help me! Please, for the love of the gods!!</string>
<string name="27563">Please! You... you don&apos;t look like them soldiers... you won&apos;t hurt me, will you?</string>
<string name="27564">Ahhh! Don&apos;t... don&apos;t hurt me! Haven&apos;t we had enough?!</string>
<string name="27565">Aiiieee!! Don&apos;t kill me! I don&apos;t want to die!!</string>
<string name="27566">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... suppose you don&apos;t seem the bad sort. You just startled me so! With all the soldiers rampaging around, I assumed...</string>
<string name="27567">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t believe you! You&apos;re just like the other soldiers, you are!! Here to rob me or kill me!!</string>
<string name="27568">Aahhh! Robber!! Get away, get away!!</string>
<string name="27569">Thank Ilmater! Just go, go!!</string>
<string name="27570">Well... what did you want from me? Why are you here?</string>
<string name="27571">I... I know. It&apos;s just that the soldiers have been rampaging through the streets for weeks, now... </string>
<string name="27572">They take whatever they like. If they think you can fight, they force you to join one of the High Captains&apos; armies... or they kill you.</string>
<string name="27573">And... and the gods forbid that they think you&apos;re working for one of the other High Captains... </string>
<string name="27574">N-nobody knows, for sure. Some weeks ago, the High Captains just started... started trying to kill each other.</string>
<string name="27575">Each one of them has their own army, and they&apos;ve been fighting in the streets night and day. Buildings burned, people slaughtered... everything&apos;s falling apart!</string>
<string name="27576">Worse, now that so many are dead... there&apos;s monsters come to the streets. Big rats and walking dead. Some says the High Captains use them for their armies, too.</string>
<string name="27577">I don&apos;t... know much about them. There was five of them, and they is all pirate lords, or used t&apos; be. They&apos;ve gone mad, everyone says.</string>
<string name="27578">Maybe each of them wants to control the city, I don&apos;t know... but they&apos;re killing everyone and they don&apos;t care what happens to any of us.</string>
<string name="27579">N-no... who? Maybe the wizards, I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="27580">The wizards of that Arcane Brotherhood. They lives in a big tower on the island at the mouth of the river.</string>
<string name="27581">I don&apos;t know any more abouts them, I swear! They... they&apos;re just supposed to be real powerful, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="27582">P-please don&apos;t hurt us! We&apos;re jus&apos; simple folk, this is our home!</string>
<string name="27583">The soldiers came here just the other day. Took almost everything we had.</string>
<string name="27584">The High Captains&apos; men... they&apos;ve been goin&apos; around, forcing anyone who can fight to join their armies. Or they kills &apos;em.</string>
<string name="27585">Don&apos;t go out in the street. There are monsters out there... giant rats who turns into men!</string>
<string name="27586">Luskan is cursed! There are undead... things... in the sewers! Everywhere!</string>
<string name="27587">It&apos;s them wizards in the Host Tower! They&apos;re trying to kill us all!</string>
<string name="27588">The High Captains have been fighting for weeks now. Half the city&apos;s been burnt up or butchered.</string>
<string name="27589">Take whatever you want of ours, just... just don&apos;t hurt us!</string>
<string name="27590">It&apos;s all I can do to keep my family from being killed or robbed. There&apos;s thieves and looters everywhere... those who ain&apos;t cut down or eaten.</string>
<string name="27591">I saw one of Baram&apos;s men... he changed into a rat-man, he did! I saw it!</string>
<string name="27592">The Bloody Hands are the worst. They&apos;ll kill you rather than look at you, they will!</string>
<string name="27593">A lot of people say that you can take refuge in the Cutlass Inn. Not even sure we would survive the trip... </string>
<string name="27594">Have they opened the gates yet?</string>
<string name="27595">Have they opened the gates? Or the ports? We so want to leave... </string>
<string name="27596">We&apos;d leave, but... we hear that plague has spread everywhere!</string>
<string name="27597">It&apos;s the plague, isn&apos;t it? It&apos;s come from Neverwinter and driven everyone mad!</string>
<string name="27598">They shut the gates... and the harbors. The pirates closed off Mirabar... we&apos;re going to starves here, I know it!</string>
<string name="27599">Please don&apos;t harm us! We&apos;re no threat to you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;!</string>
<string name="27600">You don&apos;t look like such a bad sort. You&apos;re not here to rob us, are you?</string>
<string name="27601">I... please, we&apos;ve nothing. We been beated and robbed so many times... we just wish to be left alone!</string>
<string name="27602">Don&apos;t hurt us! I beg you, please leave us be!!</string>
<string name="27603">What kind of wares do you sell here?</string>
<string name="27604">Can I see your merchandise?</string>
<string name="27605">I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="27606">What you sell?</string>
<string name="27607">Me want to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="27608">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="27609">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="27610">Have you heard anything about cults in the city?</string>
<string name="27611">What&apos;s going on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="27612">I need some directions, actually.</string>
<string name="27613">You hears of cults, maybe?</string>
<string name="27614">What goings on in city?</string>
<string name="27615">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="27616">No, I haven&apos;t. Tell me more.</string>
<string name="27617">I would like to ask another question.</string>
<string name="27618">No, me not know &apos;bout dat.</string>
<string name="27619">Me have other question for you.</string>
<string name="27620">The nearest inn.</string>
<string name="27621">The nearest temple.</string>
<string name="27622">The docks.</string>
<string name="27623">Tell me about the High Captains.</string>
<string name="27624">Tells me of High Captains.</string>
<string name="27625">The Arcane Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="27626">What is Arcane Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="27627">Who is winning?</string>
<string name="27628">Who wins? You knows?</string>
<string name="27629">It is good to see a friendly face here, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Since the fighting began, supplies have been scarce and customers even rarer.</string>
<string name="27630">You must have taken quite a risk to walk the streets of Luskan. With all the fighting, I have received little in the way of supplies and less in the way of customers... but I shall serve you as best I can.</string>
<string name="27631">I hope you&apos;re not another of the High Captains&apos; brigands come to rob us! We&apos;ve had enough troubles since all the fighting began... true customers seem to be rarer than gold!</string>
<string name="27632">To tell the truth, I haven&apos;t much... it&apos;s been weeks since the last caravan. I do have some odds and ends that the local thugs haven&apos;t seen the need to appropriate just yet, however.</string>
<string name="27633">I would be delighted to show you what I have. Come, follow me for but a moment... </string>
<string name="27634">Aye, let me show you what I have. Stand away from the merchandise, however... I&apos;ll not lose more to thievery!</string>
<string name="27635">Eh? Brain-addled, are you? Well, that would explain why one of the High Captains hasn&apos;t drafted you.</string>
<string name="27636">There&apos;s little else for me to do, so ask what you will of me.</string>
<string name="27637">Ah. This should be interesting.</string>
<string name="27638">Do be careful if you leave the district, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="27639">Aye, fare you well.</string>
<string name="27640">Off you go, then.</string>
<string name="27641">No. Perhaps you could ask the priests at the temple of Tempus about that, however.</string>
<string name="27642">Now, then... I have an errand to run. So, unless there is something else... </string>
<string name="27643">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="27644">Going on? Well the fighting between all the High Captains should be obvious enough. No doubt you know all about that, however.</string>
<string name="27645">I see. Well, now... there were five High Captains once. Not long ago, they all began to war with each other right out in the streets. Odd business, especially with the Arcane Brotherhood not lifting a finger to stop it.</string>
<string name="27646">Why am I not surprised?</string>
<string name="27647">Aye, where do you need to go?</string>
<string name="27648">The Cutlass Inn is just south of the gates. I am told that is still open.</string>
<string name="27649">Hmm. There be a temple to Tyr close by. Not sure if the priests yet live, however.</string>
<string name="27650">Ah, the docks. Mirabar has been sealed off by the pirates, I think. West Harbor, too. Until the High Captains re-open the city, there is to be no sea traffic to speak of.</string>
<string name="27651">Well, let&apos;s see. Three of the High Captains have all fled... or been killed. That leaves two of &apos;em still fighting: Kurth and Baram.</string>
<string name="27652">Each of them has their own little army and is tearing the city apart trying to kill the other, as I&apos;m sure you can see for yourself. Rumor used to be that the Arcane Brotherhood told them what t&apos; do, but that doesn&apos;t appear to be the case anymore.</string>
<string name="27653">They live in the Host Tower... over there on an island at the mouth of the river. They control the city... or, at least, they used to.</string>
<string name="27654">Nobody ever knew much about them or saw them at all, so it&apos;s no surprise that nobody knows what&apos;s happened to &apos;em now.</string>
<string name="27655">Who can tell? I know who&apos;s losing, though. The whole city. If you aren&apos;t being kidnapped and forced to join one of the High Captains&apos; armies, you&apos;re being slaughtered in the street.</string>
<string name="27656">By the time all this fighting is over, there&apos;ll be nothing left to rule. I hear Neverwinter has a plague... we should be so lucky!</string>
<string name="27657">I am in need of healing.</string>
<string name="27658">Do you have any healing or clerical supplies that you could sell?</string>
<string name="27659">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="27660">Me need healing.</string>
<string name="27661">You have supplies and stuff to sell?</string>
<string name="27662">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="27663">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="27664"></string>
<string name="27665">Tell me about what&apos;s going on in Luskan.</string>
<string name="27666">What has happened here?</string>
<string name="27667">What happen here?</string>
<string name="27668">Tell me what goes on in city.</string>
<string name="27669"></string>
<string name="27670">What is all the fighting about?</string>
<string name="27671">Do you know of any cults active in the city?</string>
<string name="27672">Is there no one who can stop all the fighting?</string>
<string name="27673">What fighting all over?</string>
<string name="27674">You knows about cults here, maybe?</string>
<string name="27675">Nobody can stops fighting, huh?</string>
<string name="27676">Why do you think that is?</string>
<string name="27677">Why you thinks that is?</string>
<string name="27678">You are welcome in this house of Tyr, &lt;brother/sister&gt;... or what remains of it. I am afraid many of my brethren have either been killed or have abandoned us.</string>
<string name="27679">Welcome, &lt;brother/sister&gt;. You are welcome in the house of the Maimed God. Few of us remain here due to recent hardships... I only ask that you do not add to them.</string>
<string name="27680">The Maimed God bids welcome to a proud defender of good, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Would that our temple were in a condition to give you proper hospitality... few of my brethren remain here, now.</string>
<string name="27681">Are you a supplicant to the Just God, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? I bid you welcome in Tyr&apos;s name. Few of my brethren remain here, however... I am unsure I can be of use to you.</string>
<string name="27682">Greetings. This is the house of Tyr, the Blind Overlord... or perhaps I should say it was. We have been robbed of much and most of my own brethren no longer remain here.</string>
<string name="27683">This is a house of worship to the Just God, and one that has seen much in the way of hardship. Pray do not add to it and come in peace.</string>
<string name="27684">You have survived some battle in our streets, have you? Then you have earned Tyr&apos;s blessing. It is the least that I can do to aid you.</string>
<string name="27685">Fare you well, &lt;brother/sister&gt;. Tyr&apos;s blessing upon you.</string>
<string name="27686">Tyr grant you justice.</string>
<string name="27687">Aye, go in peace, &lt;brother/sister&gt;. Know that the Just God watches you, his judgment swift and final.</string>
<string name="27688">When the temple was attacked, much of our supplies were taken. The acolytes who remain have helped me gather some tinctures and potions and such... come, I will show you.</string>
<string name="27689">I will answer you what I can. What do you wish to know?</string>
<string name="27690">Do we have... ? Oh yes, I believe I understand now.</string>
<string name="27691">I can only wonder what manner of questions one such as you might concoct... but no matter.</string>
<string name="27692">I can only pick up what pieces remain with the few acolytes I have left and push on. Fortunately your Lord Nasher has been very kind in his donations... housing Aarin Gend and you others is the least we can do.</string>
<string name="27693">I suppose it is not surprising, considering your intellect, but allow me to repeat myself.</string>
<string name="27694">That is a very large question, friend. What is it about the city that puzzles you?</string>
<string name="27695"></string>
<string name="27696"></string>
<string name="27697">Might there be something else you need?</string>
<string name="27698">Nobody is sure. There were five High Captains who ruled the city... at the bidding of the wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, perhaps, but all five of the pirate lords held power.</string>
<string name="27699">Nobody except for an invasion by the Lords&apos; Alliance... or the Arcane Brotherhood&apos;s intervention, perhaps. For whatever reason, they remain unmoved by all the violence.</string>
<string name="27700">Hmmm... cults, do you say? I was told of any one of a number of small sects that were active in Luskan. None of any true importance.</string>
<string name="27701">There is not much of a temple left, though once this was once a fine temple to the Just God in the north. Nowhere was a champion of justice needed more.</string>
<string name="27702">When the High Captains began their war against one another, each expected the warrior priests of our temple to aid them. We sought to help all and not ally ourselves only to one... and therefore met only suspicion.</string>
<string name="27703">We were attacked several times, but only recently did the temple fall. I was away from the temple, but upon my return I was told that sorcerers and soldiers had suddenly appeared and slain most of my brethren and looted the temple.</string>
<string name="27704">What few survived the battle had been taken prisoner. I know naught what has been done with them. Perhaps they have been pressed into service as the High Captains wished.</string>
<string name="27705">Several weeks ago, without warning, the High Captains began a war to eradicate each other. Our temple is not the only casualty in the strife that ensued.</string>
<string name="27706">My master did express concern, once, that several of the High Captains were associating overmuch with a cult dedicated to the evil goddess Auril... but I know little more of it.</string>
<string name="27707">Who can say? The Brotherhood have always kept to themelves in the Host Tower. No-one but the High Captains themselves ever sees them.</string>
<string name="27708">What do you sell here?</string>
<string name="27709">What sells you?</string>
<string name="27710">Can I see what you have?</string>
<string name="27711">Me sees what you has?</string>
<string name="27712">Can I ask you questions?</string>
<string name="27713">Me wants to ask questions.</string>
<string name="27714">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="27715">Aye? I&apos;ve little enough stock left... and barely enough metal t&apos; forge. State yer business or move on.</string>
<string name="27716">Aye, then, off ye go an&apos; leave me be.</string>
<string name="27717">I used to have one of the finest armories in Luskan. As it is, I&apos;ve been forced to set up shop here with a... rudimentary stock.</string>
<string name="27718">I&apos;ll sell what I has, though, before them thugs come an&apos; take it from me o&apos;er my dead body.</string>
<string name="27719">Aye. Ye can look but ye can&apos;t touch... &apos;tis all of the finest manufacture.</string>
<string name="27720">I be not in the mood to answer your questions. Find someone else t&apos; bother, if ye not be a paying customer.</string>
<string name="27721">The High Captains are killin&apos; each other, they are. Don&apos;t you be one to get in their way.</string>
<string name="27722">The Bloody Hands came an&apos; burned down my home... took everything I had. May the gods damn them all!</string>
<string name="27723">Don&apos;t let anyone hear ye talk about the High Captains. Ye&apos;ll wind up dead, ye will.</string>
<string name="27724">What? Were ye robbed of all yer clothing by the soldiers?</string>
<string name="27725">Put some clothes on, &lt;man/woman&gt;. Ye&apos;re not in the brothel, are ye?</string>
<string name="27726">Did ye forget something, &lt;lad/lass&gt;? Like clothes, mayhap?</string>
<string name="27727">Ach, ye were fighting, I see. Did the monsters outside get to ye?</string>
<string name="27728">Maybe ye should see someone &apos;bout them nasty cuts of yours.</string>
<string name="27729">That must&apos;ve been some tussle you were in. Most folks&apos;d be dead in yer shoes.</string>
<string name="27730">I&apos;ve got a cousin who were slow-witted like ye. He&apos;s dead, now.</string>
<string name="27731">Best a simple &lt;man/woman&gt; like yerself keep off the streets.</string>
<string name="27732">Don&apos;t go into the streets, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. It be dangerous. Ye know that word? Danger?</string>
<string name="27733">I&apos;ve seen enough weapons being waved about. Put yers away.</string>
<string name="27734">Stop shakin&apos; that about. Ye&apos;re makin&apos; me nervous.</string>
<string name="27735">People are scared enough here as it is. Put that away.</string>
<string name="27736">Don&apos;t see too much holy folk &apos;round Luskan.</string>
<string name="27737">Maybe prayin&apos;s what we should be doing. Luskan&apos;s gone to hell, it seems.</string>
<string name="27738">You&apos;re a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;, ain&apos;t ye? Ye come to help us?</string>
<string name="27739">Lotta good yer magicks do us. Bloody Brotherhood is behind all o&apos; this, I swear.</string>
<string name="27740">Ye&apos;re not part of the Arcane Brotherhood, are ye?</string>
<string name="27741">Ye should go back to the Host Tower. We don&apos;t need yer kind &apos;round here.</string>
<string name="27742">Ye&apos;re a might fine-lookin&apos; lass. Ye come from Bela&apos;s, aye?</string>
<string name="27743">It&apos;s good to know there&apos;s still some fine women who ain&apos;t been killed.</string>
<string name="27744">Maybe I could buy ye a drink, lass?</string>
<string name="27745">The Arcane Brotherhood is behind all o&apos; this... they&apos;ve risen up zombies and werewolves and are tryin&apos; to kill us all!</string>
<string name="27746">If I were you, friend, I&apos;d stay off the streets. Until this is over, none o&apos; us are safe.</string>
<string name="27747">I hear some of the pirate crews blockaded the Mirabar trade district once the ports were closed.</string>
<string name="27748">The High Captains have gone mad! They&apos;ve put monsters in their armies and are going to kill each other while Luskan suffers!</string>
<string name="27749">What? Driven out of your home by rampaging guardsmen, were you? Join the club... nobody&apos;s stopping these madmen.</string>
<string name="27750">Get away from me, you! I&apos;ve had me fill o&apos; assassins and thieves stalking the streets!</string>
<string name="27751">Ye must be one of them Uthgardt peoples, aye?</string>
<string name="27752">City&apos;s closed off, an&apos; somehow ye barbarian types still find yer way in.</string>
<string name="27753">Careful, now. Big &lt;man/woman&gt; like yerself will be snatched up by the soldiers in a second.</string>
<string name="27754">We don&apos;t welcome ye &lt;race&gt; folk in Luskan, much.</string>
<string name="27755">Better not go out in the street, you. They kills any &lt;race&gt; kind on sight.</string>
<string name="27756">I saw one of the Bloody Hand killin&apos; some &lt;race&gt; travelers just yesterday.</string>
<string name="27757">Please, I have always been loyal to High Captain Kurth, don&apos;t hurt us.</string>
<string name="27758">Don&apos;t hurt us, I serve only High Captain Baram.</string>
<string name="27759">By the gods, the undead have come for us! Please save us powers above.</string>
<string name="27760">Where does the bridge go?</string>
<string name="27761">Where bridge go?</string>
<string name="27762">What kind of authorization do you need?</string>
<string name="27763">Uhh... what I needs to cross?</string>
<string name="27764">I&apos;ll cross the bridge if I like.</string>
<string name="27765">Me crosses if me wants to!</string>
<string name="27766">I have a pass right here. I am an ambassador from Mulhorand.</string>
<string name="27767">Me has pass. Me is ambassador of Mulhorand.</string>
<string name="27768">Fine, I&apos;ll go.</string>
<string name="27769">Okay, me going.</string>
<string name="27770">Arcane Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="27771">Surely there must be some other way across?</string>
<string name="27772">There must be other way to goes there.</string>
<string name="27773">How do you get such a thing?</string>
<string name="27774">How you gets that?</string>
<string name="27775">You won&apos;t be allowed across the bridge without authorization, citizen. Please step away.</string>
<string name="27776">On your way, then, citizen.</string>
<string name="27777">Don&apos;t return, if you know what&apos;s good for you.</string>
<string name="27778">This bridge is the only egress onto the island where the Host Tower of the Arcane Brotherhood sits, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="27779">Aye, an organization of wizards. Some say they rule Luskan, but if they do, they do so secretly. We rarely see or hear of them.</string>
<string name="27780">Not hardly. The wizards protect their privacy with magic. You can&apos;t sail a boat to the island or tunnel there or even cast a spell to take you there... no passing, period. Not without their say so. That, at least, is what I&apos;m told.</string>
<string name="27781">You need written permission by the Arcane Brotherhood themselves, affixed with their seal.</string>
<string name="27782">(sigh) You don&apos;t. It&apos;s only given by the wizards to the High Captains and dignitaries invited to see them.</string>
<string name="27783">I wouldn&apos;t suggest it. Even if you got past us... which I doubt... there are powerful wards on the bridge. You need the pass to get past them.</string>
<string name="27784">Or this is what I&apos;m told. You&apos;re free to make the attempt... if you wish.</string>
<string name="27785">What?! Let me see that... </string>
<string name="27786">You? An ambassador? Hmph. Let me see that... </string>
<string name="27787">Well... it&apos;s affixed with the seal. That&apos;s magical, so it can&apos;t be forged. Very well, then, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, my apologies.</string>
<string name="27788">The Brotherhood have had quite a few dignitaries arriving within the last couple of weeks, but none from so far away. No matter. You may cross.</string>
<string name="27789">You are free to cross the bridge, ambassador.</string>
<string name="27790">You must be with the ambassador from Mulhorand, yes? You are free to cross the bridge.</string>
<string name="27791">What is this place?</string>
<string name="27792">Can I ask you a question?</string>
<string name="27793">I want something to drink.</string>
<string name="27794">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="27795">What place this?</string>
<string name="27796">Me ask you question?</string>
<string name="27797">Me want to drink.</string>
<string name="27798">No, me need nothing.</string>
<string name="27799">Yes, I&apos;m from Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="27800">Yeah, me from Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="27801">I&apos;m not from Luskan, that&apos;s true.</string>
<string name="27802">Me not from Luskan, yeah.</string>
<string name="27803">No, I&apos;m a local.</string>
<string name="27804">No, me from here.</string>
<string name="27805">What&apos;s going on in this town?</string>
<string name="27806">Have you heard of any cults in Luskan?</string>
<string name="27807">Who are all these people here?</string>
<string name="27808">Might I... interest you in a good time, lass?</string>
<string name="27809">What go on here?</string>
<string name="27810">You knows &apos;bout cults in Luskan?</string>
<string name="27811">Who is all these peoples?</string>
<string name="27812">Maybe me shows you good time, eh?</string>
<string name="27813">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="27814">Aye? Something ye need? We haven&apos;t much.</string>
<string name="27815">This be the Cutlass Inn. Ye tellin&apos; me ye&apos;re from out of Luskan? I haven&apos;t seen a strange face since the battles started.</string>
<string name="27816">From Neverwinter? Huh. Even with that plague o&apos; yours, ye should have stayed there. Luskan&apos;s no place fer anybody, now.</string>
<string name="27817">I thought they gone and sealed the gates. Well, mind yerself in the streets. The soldiers will kill anyone they sees.</string>
<string name="27818">Your home burned down too, I expect, aye? Well, speak to Aruph, then. This place be as good a refuge as any.</string>
<string name="27819">We&apos;ve watered-down ale. Mayhap there&apos;s some wine, left... though the soldiers came days ago an&apos; took most of it.</string>
<string name="27820">I&apos;ll find what I can and be back. If ye&apos;re in a hurry, go an&apos; talk to Aruph.</string>
<string name="27821">Don&apos;t mind me none, then. I&apos;m just here to serve the customers. Such as they be, I guess.</string>
<string name="27822">Aye, if ye be quick.</string>
<string name="27823">&apos;Tis the damned High Captains warring on each other, sure enough. They been tearing apart the city fer weeks, now.</string>
<string name="27824">Ye can&apos;t walk the bloody streets... each side will think ye&apos;re working for the other, and will kill ye on sight. They loot and burn and murder as they please.</string>
<string name="27825">I think the whole city&apos;s gone mad. Half o&apos; Luskan&apos;s been torn apart, an&apos; nobody knows why.</string>
<string name="27826">Cults? We&apos;ve enough problems, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... cults would be the least o&apos; them.</string>
<string name="27827">Normally we&apos;d be full to the bloody rafters with yer usual sort of pirates an&apos; smugglers... these folk all be locals put out o&apos; their homes.</string>
<string name="27828">The soldiers don&apos;t bother us none, for now, so the inn&apos;s a decent place fer refuge. Aruph&apos;s too kind to charge them, neither.</string>
<string name="27829">Ach, I get enough o&apos; that from the pirates who used t&apos; wander through here. Keep yer hands t&apos; yerself.</string>
<string name="27830">If ye has more questions, ye should talk to Aruph. I has things that need doing.</string>
<string name="27831">Aye, on yer way, then.</string>
<string name="27832">Baram will be the last High Captain standing. Just you wait an&apos; see.</string>
<string name="27833">Ye&apos;re one of Baram&apos;s, aren&apos;t you? Good... maybe later we&apos;ll teach Kurth&apos;s men a lesson, here, no matter what the High Captain says.</string>
<string name="27834">Those fellows are fools to follow Kurth. Baram will win, in the end.</string>
<string name="27835">I heard Kurth&apos;s in league with a priestess of Auril. That&apos;s where all the monsters we fight with are comin&apos; from.</string>
<string name="27836">I can&apos;t believe Baram is dead. It can&apos;t be true... he must be in hiding or something... </string>
<string name="27837">Well, Baram&apos;s army isn&apos;t disbanding. Word is that someone&apos;s going to lead us soon.</string>
<string name="27838">Baram isn&apos;t dead. Don&apos;t listen to all the rumors. He can&apos;t be killed, I seen him stabbed so many times an&apos; he always healed.</string>
<string name="27839">I bet one o&apos; Kurth&apos;s men over there did it. They should pay... </string>
<string name="27840">Ye&apos;re a nobody. Fit only t&apos; be slaughtered in the streets.</string>
<string name="27841">What, you one o&apos; Kurth&apos;s? Foolish &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="27842">This place is Baram&apos;s. Leave, &apos;fore ye gets hurt.</string>
<string name="27843">I get one o&apos; the girls, next. Ye&apos;ll just have t&apos; wait until the rest of us are done.</string>
<string name="27844">Kurth an&apos; his Bloody Hands are holed up in West Harbor... an&apos; if they&apos;re smart, they&apos;ll stay there.</string>
<string name="27845">Go on, get out of here. This is our place.</string>
<string name="27846">Kurth&apos;s men shouldn&apos;t even be allowed in here... </string>
<string name="27847">Go away. I&apos;m busy, here.</string>
<string name="27848">Baram says no fighting in the brothel... otherwise we&apos;d kick those Bloody Hands but good, show &apos;em who&apos;s boss.</string>
<string name="27849">I have to report to Baram tonight. I hate going into the sewers... all those disgusting ghouls everywhere... </string>
<string name="27850">What? You some rogue they let in off the street?</string>
<string name="27851">Bah. Get away from me... I&apos;m talking to my brothers, here.</string>
<string name="27852">Take a hike.</string>
<string name="27853">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="27854">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="27855">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="27856">Tell me more about these High Captains.</string>
<string name="27857">When did all this fighting begin?</string>
<string name="27858">Isn&apos;t there anyone who can put a stop to it?</string>
<string name="27859">How can you run this place with all the fighting going on?</string>
<string name="27860">You tells more &apos;bout High Captains.</string>
<string name="27861">When all this starts?</string>
<string name="27862">Is nobody who can stops it?</string>
<string name="27863">How you haves place with big fighting all around?</string>
<string name="27864">Tell me about these wizards.</string>
<string name="27865">You tells more &apos;bout wizards.</string>
<string name="27866">Tell me about what&apos;s going on in Luskan.</string>
<string name="27867">You tells me &apos;bout Luskan.</string>
<string name="27868">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="27869">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="27870">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="27871">Luskan big place. Me need know way around.</string>
<string name="27872">How do you get around the city safely?</string>
<string name="27873">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="27874">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="27875">I&apos;m looking for a good tavern.</string>
<string name="27876">How you gets around safe?</string>
<string name="27877">Me look for temple.</string>
<string name="27878">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="27879">Good place to drink?</string>
<string name="27880">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="27881">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="27882">I need some more directions.</string>
<string name="27883">Me need more directions.</string>
<string name="27884">What kind of place is this?</string>
<string name="27885">This what kind place?</string>
<string name="27886">Who are you?</string>
<string name="27887">Who you?</string>
<string name="27888">How do I go about seeing one of them?</string>
<string name="27889">How me sees one?</string>
<string name="27890">They work here of their own free will?</string>
<string name="27891">They works here &apos;cause they wants to?</string>
<string name="27892">I can&apos;t say I approve.</string>
<string name="27893">Me not approve.</string>
<string name="27894">Who are these men?</string>
<string name="27895">Who these men?</string>
<string name="27896">My goodness! It&apos;s huge!</string>
<string name="27897">Goodness! Is very big!</string>
<string name="27898">I&apos;ll take that, thank you.</string>
<string name="27899">Me takes that, thanks.</string>
<string name="27900">Big deal.</string>
<string name="27901">Is no big deal.</string>
<string name="27902">My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="27903">Me called &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="27904">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. Pleased to meet you.</string>
<string name="27905">Me name be &lt;FullName&gt;. You nice lady.</string>
<string name="27906">I&apos;d prefer you didn&apos;t.</string>
<string name="27907">No. Me no tell you.</string>
<string name="27908">Err... pickles?</string>
<string name="27909">Uhh... pickles?</string>
<string name="27910">I&apos;ll look around.</string>
<string name="27911">Me looks around.</string>
<string name="27912">I think I agree with you.</string>
<string name="27913">Me agrees with you.</string>
<string name="27914">I could not care less, one way or the other.</string>
<string name="27915">Me not cares, either way.</string>
<string name="27916">I support Kurth.</string>
<string name="27917">Me supports Kurth.</string>
<string name="27918">I support Baram.</string>
<string name="27919">Me supports Baram.</string>
<string name="27920">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="27921">Me want asks something else.</string>
<string name="27922">Hullo there, darling. Do make yourself welcome.</string>
<string name="27923">Leaving so soon? Be careful, then, sweet thing.</string>
<string name="27924">Fare you well, darling!</string>
<string name="27925">You can find the door, can&apos;t you? Off you go, sweetie.</string>
<string name="27926">Oh, you&apos;re a sweet thing, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="27927">You go right ahead and ask me your questions, darling.</string>
<string name="27928">That&apos;s what you&apos;re doing already, isn&apos;t it? Ha ha! Nevermind me... you go right ahead.</string>
<string name="27929">You can always ask... whether I answer is something else altogether.</string>
<string name="27930">Well, let&apos;s see. There used to be five of them, naturally. Most of them have died off or run off... who can really tell anymore? Only Kurth and Baram are left, two of the nastiest fellas you never want to come across.</string>
<string name="27931">Hmm... only a few weeks ago. Has it only been that long? Yes, I think it has. Simply amazing. It was about the same time that we heard about the plague in Neverwinter, I think.</string>
<string name="27932">Them wizards in the Host Tower could, I suppose. Looks like they don&apos;t want to.</string>
<string name="27933">It&apos;s not like I have much of a choice, darling. The High Captains all want a place that keeps their men happy... so they make sure that we don&apos;t close down.</string>
<string name="27934">Do you have a speech impediment? Oh, nevermind.</string>
<string name="27935">Why, hullo there, darling. Come for a bit of fun, have you?</string>
<string name="27936">Hullo, darling. This is a house of refinement, I&apos;ll remind you... we&apos;ll have no trouble, now.</string>
<string name="27937">That is a mighty big question, darling. The simple answer is that the High Captains one day decided to see which of them would be the one and only High Captain and began to kill each other and the city.</string>
<string name="27938">Where you looking to go, sugar?</string>
<string name="27939">Do I look like a signpost? Mmmm... oh, you&apos;re too sweet. Ask away, honey.</string>
<string name="27940">Sure thing, sugar.</string>
<string name="27941">Oh, you poor dear! How lost you must get some time, I declare!</string>
<string name="27942">You don&apos;t, sweetie. Oh, there&apos;s some safer places... the market is still pretty safe, and I hear the soldiers leave the inn alone, mostly. It&apos;s moving between the areas that gets you into trouble.</string>
<string name="27943">There was a temple to Tyr off in the western part of the district. Some soldier told me they ransacked the place, though. Might be nothing there any more.</string>
<string name="27944">The Mirabar trade district is closed off, I hear, but you could still try the market. It&apos;s off in the northwest, by the slums. You take your chances going there... it&apos;s not very safe.</string>
<string name="27945">Ha ha! You could always have a drink here, sugar. If you like, though, I hear the Cutlass Inn is still open. They won&apos;t have much to serve you, though.</string>
<string name="27946">Sure - where do you need to go?</string>
<string name="27947">This? This is a palace of pleasure, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. There are men and women who can take your mind away from the terrible world outside... for a time.</string>
<string name="27948">My name is Bela, darling. I keep my boys and girls safe and the customers happy. If you&apos;re ever unhappy, you come see me... I&apos;ll change your mind, you&apos;ll see.</string>
<string name="27949">Now you have me at a disadvantage, however. Might I know your name, hmm?</string>
<string name="27950">Ha ha! You would have to speak to one of them yourself, my dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. If they have the time, and they like you... well, then the two of you can take things from there.</string>
<string name="27951">All of my girls and boys spend their time upstairs. You can go up there, if you like. If you stay down here... well, do be careful around some of these men.</string>
<string name="27952">Naturally they do, darling. There are far worse ways in Luskan to make a living than to spend your time surrounded by luxury and fine company.</string>
<string name="27953">If you don&apos;t believe me, however, you are certainly free to ask them yourself. Just don&apos;t make trouble, that&apos;s all I ask.</string>
<string name="27954">Ha ha! Well, my dear &lt;man/woman&gt;, nobody said that you had to. The marvelous thing about a door is that it&apos;s as good for going as it is for coming, wouldn&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="27955">Of course... one could say the same thing about a man. Mmmm.</string>
<string name="27956">Hmph. Most of these brutes are soldiers for either High Captain Kurth or High Captain Baram. They take after their commanders, as well, for they fight continuously.</string>
<string name="27957">I declare, it is all I can do to keep them distracted enough not to tear each other apart and destroy my good home.</string>
<string name="27958">It&apos;ll be far, far better for us all when those High Captains get it all over with and kill each other once and for all. Mmm... but perhaps I shouldn&apos;t talk so. What do you think of them, darling?</string>
<string name="27959">Speaking of which... take a look at the rock on this here ring my latest beau gave me? What do you think, mmm?</string>
<string name="27960">Listen, honey, goodness had *nothing* to do with it.</string>
<string name="27961">Don&apos;t get your leathers in a bunch, sweetie. When I say it&apos;s a rock, I mean it&apos;s a rock. Looks pretty, though. So did my beau, but I don&apos;t date cheap men.</string>
<string name="27962">It was a big deal... to my beau. After borrowing all that gold, I hear you&apos;ll find his tongue in Ten Towns and his toes in Athkatla. Sad story, I know, but you&apos;ll get over it.</string>
<string name="27963">But we&apos;re getting off the topic. You were busy disapproving, as I recall. Something else you wanted, then, darling?</string>
<string name="27964">You&apos;re not from here, &lt;FirstName&gt;, are you? I like that in a man. I may have to snap you up myself.</string>
<string name="27965">Sweet name you have there, girl. Don&apos;t let the brutes down here know it, or you&apos;ll be hearing it in drunken ballads for hours. Trust me on that.</string>
<string name="27966">Ooooh, a real charmer. I like that in a man. I bet you wouldn&apos;t pass out drunk before I even knew we were started, would you darling?</string>
<string name="27967">You got the manners, girl. You ever decide to change professions, you come and talk to me. Don&apos;t kid yourself: the jewelry is fabulous.</string>
<string name="27968">Dark and mysterious. Hmmm, you&apos;re giving me goose-bumps, darling. I should snatch you up for myself, mrrowwr.</string>
<string name="27969">Mmmm, the boys are going to love you, I see. Teach them manners and show them who&apos;s boss... you&apos;ll have them eating out of your hand, trust me.</string>
<string name="27970">But that&apos;s neither here nor there. Is there something that Bela can do for you? We have satin, we have wine, we have pickles... anything you like.</string>
<string name="27971">Don&apos;t get lost, then, darling. We once found a halfling in the cellar after a week, poor fellow. He was still smiling, but that&apos;s a different story.</string>
<string name="27972">It&apos;s for the gnomes. They like their pickles sour and their women tall. Don&apos;t ask me why.</string>
<string name="27973">Boys will be boys, I suppose. I&apos;m willing to bet that you want to know more than that, though, hmm?</string>
<string name="27974">It&apos;ll be so much better for us once they kill each other off once and for all. Hmm... but perhaps I shouldn&apos;t talk like such. How do you feel about them, sugar?</string>
<string name="27975">Now there&apos;s a smart &lt;boy/girl&gt;. I knew you were gold the minute I laid eyes on you, yes I did.</string>
<string name="27976">You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Rhaine. She&apos;s one of my girls upstairs.</string>
<string name="27977">You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Oreth. He&apos;s one of my boys upstairs.</string>
<string name="27978">Shhh... don&apos;t ask why, sweetie. Just trust me.</string>
<string name="27979">You go right ahead, darling. I&apos;m all ears.</string>
<string name="27980">It&apos;ll be far, far better for us all when those High Captains get it all over with and kill each other once and for all. Then me and my poor girls and boys will be safe.</string>
<string name="27981">Ha ha! You must have walked into the city blindfolded, then! You go ahead and be mercenary if you like, darling... I like you that way.</string>
<string name="27982">Oh? Well... to each &lt;his/her&gt; own, I suppose. Kurth is, at least, a bit more civilized. Champagne still gets you drunk, though, sugar.</string>
<string name="27983">Oh? Well, to each &lt;his/her&gt; own, I suppose. That Baram reminds me of a wee sneaky rat, he does... but maybe it&apos;s just li&apos;l ol&apos; me.</string>
<string name="27984">Oh, you know. Them Arcane Brotherhood fellas who live in their tower on the island. They&apos;re supposed to be powerful, but nobody knows much.</string>
<string name="27985">I certainly don&apos;t. There&apos;s a bridge that goes out to their island, but nobody can cross it. And they don&apos;t come out here. So that&apos;s that, I guess.</string>
<string name="27986">And besides... a very happy soldier is a much, much better thing than a very unhappy soldier. You take my meaning, sugar?</string>
<string name="27987">We still have to give most of our gold to each of the High Captains to keep the peace, but it&apos;s a better living than most these days.</string>
<string name="27988">And don&apos;t you be one of them foolish ones that thinks the sewers are a safe way to travel. There&apos;s all sorts of things let loose down there... where they came from is anyone&apos;s guess.</string>
<string name="27989">Welcome to my little home. Have a drink!</string>
<string name="27990">Now, now, boys... let&apos;s all pretend to be gentlemen.</string>
<string name="27991">Keep it down, boys.</string>
<string name="27992">Don&apos;t make me spank you, fellas. I like to keep things civilized.</string>
<string name="27993">Let&apos;s keep things friendly, boys, or you&apos;re gonna have to leave.</string>
<string name="27994">Shouting won&apos;t get you upstairs any faster, fellas. Have another drink.</string>
<string name="27995">I&apos;m keeping an eye on you. No funny business... not yet, anyway.</string>
<string name="27996">Leave the carrying on and hollering for the bedroom, fellas!</string>
<string name="27997">Neither.</string>
<string name="27998">Kurth.</string>
<string name="27999">Baram.</string>
<string name="28000">None of your business.</string>
<string name="28001">Uhh... nobodies.</string>
<string name="28002">Is no business of you.</string>
<string name="28003">Who are they?</string>
<string name="28004">Who them?</string>
<string name="28005">Ho there, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. You with High Captain Kurth or High Captain Baram?</string>
<string name="28006">Good enough. If you have any problems, you talk to Miss Bela, got it?</string>
<string name="28007">Fine. Just keep in mind that there&apos;s plenty of Baram&apos;s men here, too. I&apos;ll have no trouble here, I&apos;m warning you.</string>
<string name="28008">You got a problem with that, you speak to Miss Bela. Otherwise you can do what you like.</string>
<string name="28009">Fine. Just keep in mind that there&apos;s plenty of Kurth&apos;s men here, too. I&apos;ll have no trouble here, I&apos;m warning you.</string>
<string name="28010">Fine. There&apos;s lots of both factions here, though... this is neutral ground, on the order of the High Captains themselves, so I&apos;ll have no trouble.</string>
<string name="28011">You got a problem with that, you speak to Miss Bela. You don&apos;t, and we won&apos;t have a problem. Got it?</string>
<string name="28012">Greetings to you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Miss Bela bids you welcome to her home. Might you be with High Captain Kurth or High Captain Baram?</string>
<string name="28013">Who do you take me for, a fool? Look... both factions are here, so I&apos;ll have no trouble from you. This is neutral ground.</string>
<string name="28014">You, there... you better not be here to cause trouble. You with High Captain Kurth or High Captain Baram?</string>
<string name="28015">Erb sure has gotten himself into a pickle upstairs.</string>
<string name="28016">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="28017">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="28018">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="28019">What is all this fighting about?</string>
<string name="28020">Do you know anything about cults in the city?</string>
<string name="28021">When did the fighting begin?</string>
<string name="28022">Do you know of any work I might find?</string>
<string name="28023">What all fighting about?</string>
<string name="28024">You knows &apos;bout cults here?</string>
<string name="28025">When fighting starts?</string>
<string name="28026">You know where me finds work?</string>
<string name="28027">Do you know anything else about it?</string>
<string name="28028">You knows more, maybe?</string>
<string name="28029">Can you tell me about Luskan?</string>
<string name="28030">What you tell &apos;bout Luskan?</string>
<string name="28031">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="28032">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="28033">Tell me about this place?</string>
<string name="28034">You tells &apos;bout this place?</string>
<string name="28035">Where would I find Oreth?</string>
<string name="28036">Where would I find Rhaine?</string>
<string name="28037">Where me finds Oreth?</string>
<string name="28038">Where me finds Rhaine?</string>
<string name="28039">You&apos;re one of the brothel girls, then?</string>
<string name="28040">I&apos;d like to hire you.</string>
<string name="28041">How is it the brothel is still open?</string>
<string name="28042">Tell me about Miss Bela.</string>
<string name="28043">Let me ask you something else.</string>
<string name="28044">You brothel girl, then, huh?</string>
<string name="28045">Me wants hire you.</string>
<string name="28046">How brothel open still?</string>
<string name="28047">Tells me &apos;bout Miss Bela.</string>
<string name="28048">Me ask something else.</string>
<string name="28049">What do they demand?</string>
<string name="28050">What they demands?</string>
<string name="28051">Hello there, sugar. Something ye need?</string>
<string name="28052">Going so soon?</string>
<string name="28053">Don&apos;t get lost, now.</string>
<string name="28054">On your way, then.</string>
<string name="28055">Poor baby. You want to ask me a little question, do you?</string>
<string name="28056">Oh, I suppose so. Since you asked so sweetly.</string>
<string name="28057">Hah! I suppose none of the lads would mind if I chatted for a moment.</string>
<string name="28058">If you&apos;re quick about it. I haven&apos;t all day.</string>
<string name="28059">Well... we used to have five High Captains who ran the city. Nobody knows why, but they began a war to determine which of them would be the last one standing... if they don&apos;t burn down Luskan first.</string>
<string name="28060">Only a few weeks ago, I think. It was very sudden. Three of the High Captains have disappeared or died... or so the rumors go.</string>
<string name="28061">Work? Ha ha... the entire city is huddled down in the middle of a siege, practically, and you&apos;re asking about work? I suppose everyone has to earn their coin.</string>
<string name="28062">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="28063">Well... some say that the Arcane Brotherhood is behind it all. They&apos;re a bunch of wizards out in the Host Tower on the island off the shore, but nobody knows much about them. That includes me.</string>
<string name="28064">Something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="28065">Do you have more questions?</string>
<string name="28066">Something ye wanted, hun?</string>
<string name="28067">Aye? I&apos;ve a whole room-full, here. You&apos;ll have to wait.</string>
<string name="28068">You&apos;re a stranger, are you? What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="28069">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="28070">You&apos;re looking for Oreth? Well... he&apos;s in his bedroom, of course. Oreth doesn&apos;t entertain guests like the rest of us.</string>
<string name="28071">Since all this fighting started, he&apos;s been &apos;reserved&apos; for the High Captains... and not by choice. There&apos;s nothing he nor Miss Bela can do about that, though.</string>
<string name="28072">Rhaine&apos;s in her bedroom. She doesn&apos;t entertain guests like the rest of us do, though, if that&apos;s what you have in mind.</string>
<string name="28073">Since this war began, Rhaine&apos;s been &apos;reserved&apos; for the High Captains themselves. Not by choice, either... though there&apos;s nothing she nor Miss Bela can do about that.</string>
<string name="28074">There&apos;s not much to tell. Miss Bela would be the one to ask, I&apos;d think.</string>
<string name="28075">Fine, fine, go ahead.</string>
<string name="28076">I am. The house is packed full, if you haven&apos;t noticed, so you&apos;ll have to wait your turn.</string>
<string name="28077">The soldier boys tend to take their turn whenever they want, too... unfortunately. So you may be waiting longer than you like. Nothing we can do about that.</string>
<string name="28078">Hmmm... no doubt. Can&apos;t help you there. Full house, and the High Captains&apos; boys come first whether we like it or not.</string>
<string name="28079">My, but aren&apos;t you a strange one? I&apos;d love to accomodate you, my dear, but I&apos;ve got a line of customers a mile long. Another time.</string>
<string name="28080">Because the High Captains want it open. They can send their boys here to relax and demand whatever they like from Miss Bela.</string>
<string name="28081">Gold, naturally. As well as the use of whichever courtesans they wish... for whatever purposes they like.</string>
<string name="28082">Hah! Miss Bela is a kind soul, really. She&apos;s kept us all safe, so far. I hope this fighting ends soon... it&apos;s been quite a stress on her.</string>
<string name="28083">Cults? No, I haven&apos;t heard anything about such a thing. Although here in Luskan there could be a dozen cults and they might go unseen.</string>
<string name="28084">Yvette&apos;s off in her room, of course. Miss Bela gave her some time off, thankfully. As for Erb... well, if you really want to, you&apos;ll find him wandering about the lounge, here.</string>
<string name="28085">I don&apos;t know. If you&apos;re looking for something to do, maybe talk to Erb or Yvette if you haven&apos;t already. Yvette, especially... poor girl.</string>
<string name="28086">Ye&apos;ll have to wait yer turn, honey. Out ye go.</string>
<string name="28087">Did I ask ye to come into me room? No, I didn&apos;t. Please leave.</string>
<string name="28088">What are ye doin&apos;, coming in here?! Get out! Out!!</string>
<string name="28089">You&apos;ll have to wait forever if ye&apos;re looking for a turn... if you haven&apos;t noticed, Bela&apos;s is packed.</string>
<string name="28090">You know, I hear that Kurth and Baram own this place. Took it over.</string>
<string name="28091">One of the girls told me High Captain Baram has one of Bela&apos;s courtesans all to himself. She visits with him every night!</string>
<string name="28092">I was told High Captain Kurth has one of the courtesans here visit him every night, in secret. Only reason the place stays open!</string>
<string name="28093">Be careful downstairs. A fight&apos;ll break out soon and burn the place down... just you watch.</string>
<string name="28094">Hmmm... I wonder how much that Miss Bela&apos;d charge for a night?</string>
<string name="28095">Most of us here play a little diamondback while we wait for our turn. Care to join us?</string>
<string name="28096">Blast it! Lost most of my money in diamondback... can&apos;t even afford to stay, now.</string>
<string name="28097">Nice place to come and forget about all the fighting for a while.</string>
<string name="28098">I&apos;m stuck in this hellish city until the ports are opened again.</string>
<string name="28099">I hear High Captain Kurth has closed off the West Harbor district. No way out of Luskan, now.</string>
<string name="28100">They say Baram&apos;s down in the sewers... but I know for a fact that the place is full of monsters, so that can&apos;t be true.</string>
<string name="28101">Don&apos;t let the guards catch you in the streets. If they don&apos;t know you, they&apos;ll kill you.</string>
<string name="28102">You&apos;re a sweet thing! You one of the new girls?</string>
<string name="28103">One of the girls here got pregnant, I hear. Bela&apos;s got almost no girls who are working.</string>
<string name="28104">Well... lookit you. How about it, sweetheart? Take me to your room?</string>
<string name="28105">How much you charge for a night? I&apos;ll pay double.</string>
<string name="28106">Greetings. Nice to meet you.</string>
<string name="28107">Sorry... I&apos;m a bit busy at the moment. No time to chat.</string>
<string name="28108">Who asked you? Move along!</string>
<string name="28109">Get outta here!</string>
<string name="28110">Hey! This is my time! Get yer own!</string>
<string name="28111">Can&apos;t a man be left in peace? Get your own lass!</string>
<string name="28112">Who are you?</string>
<string name="28113">I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="28114">Who you be?</string>
<string name="28115">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="28116">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="28117">Do you know what&apos;s going on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="28118">I&apos;m looking for work, if you know of any.</string>
<string name="28119">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="28120">You know what goings on in city?</string>
<string name="28121">Me look for job. You got one?</string>
<string name="28122">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="28123">Why are you so upset?</string>
<string name="28124">Why you upsets?</string>
<string name="28125">Where is the nearest inn?</string>
<string name="28126">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="28127">Where can I go to buy equipment and supplies?</string>
<string name="28128">Maybe I could ask you something else.</string>
<string name="28129">Me want find inn.</string>
<string name="28130">Me want find temple.</string>
<string name="28131">Me need buy &apos;quipment and stuff.</string>
<string name="28132">Me got other question.</string>
<string name="28133">Tell me about the job.</string>
<string name="28134">You says me more.</string>
<string name="28135">Why do you need the ring?</string>
<string name="28136">Can&apos;t you just buy it from her?</string>
<string name="28137">Isn&apos;t this stealing?</string>
<string name="28138">Okay, I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="28139">Why you wants ring?</string>
<string name="28140">Why you not just buys it from her?</string>
<string name="28141">This be stealing!</string>
<string name="28142">Okay, me do it.</string>
<string name="28143">I have some more questions about this job.</string>
<string name="28144">Any chance I could get an advance on this job?</string>
<string name="28145">Me got some questions &apos;bout job.</string>
<string name="28146">Me want money up front to do this.</string>
<string name="28147">Why do you need the ring?</string>
<string name="28148">Tell me again where I can find Lady Jadale.</string>
<string name="28149">Isn&apos;t this stealing?</string>
<string name="28150">Why you wants ring?</string>
<string name="28151">You say again where Lady be.</string>
<string name="28152">This be stealing.</string>
<string name="28153">I want to ask you again about getting the ring for you.</string>
<string name="28154">Me want ask you again &apos;bout getting ring for you.</string>
<string name="28155">You mentioned something about a job before.</string>
<string name="28156">You was talking &apos;bout job before.</string>
<string name="28157">I have the ring right here.</string>
<string name="28158">Me got ring here.</string>
<string name="28159">I seem to recall some mention of a reward?</string>
<string name="28160">You said you give reward for ring.</string>
<string name="28161">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; It wasn&apos;t easy to get this, you know. I think you could spare a little more.</string>
<string name="28162"> You better cough up some more coin or you won&apos;t even live long enough to regret it!</string>
<string name="28163">Thanks - it&apos;s been a pleasure doing business with you.</string>
<string name="28164">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me work hard for this. You give more gold, yes?</string>
<string name="28165">Me want more gold! Give more or you be sorry and you be dead!</string>
<string name="28166">Me happy - me like work for you.</string>
<string name="28167">I suppose the reward is adequate.</string>
<string name="28168">Me guess reward be okay.</string>
<string name="28169">Surely you could spare more for a fellow gnome?</string>
<string name="28170">You give me more cause we both be gnome, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="28171">You&apos;re one of the brothel&apos;s men?</string>
<string name="28172">You brothel-man?</string>
<string name="28173">I want to hire you.</string>
<string name="28174">Me wants hire you.</string>
<string name="28175">A... chest connoisseur?</string>
<string name="28176">Uhh... you was chest con-... con-oh...</string>
<string name="28177">I&apos;ve never heard of a place called Culver.</string>
<string name="28178">Me no hears of Culver.</string>
<string name="28179">Uncle Fedard who?</string>
<string name="28180">Who Uncle Fedard?</string>
<string name="28181">I see. Everyone died, then?</string>
<string name="28182">Oh. Everybody die, huh?</string>
<string name="28183">That&apos;s quite a story.</string>
<string name="28184">That some story.</string>
<string name="28185">I doubt that&apos;s true.</string>
<string name="28186">Me doubts is true.</string>
<string name="28187">No, I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="28188">No, me have no interest.</string>
<string name="28189">Are you insulting me?</string>
<string name="28190">You mean to me, yuh?</string>
<string name="28191">Upset about what?</string>
<string name="28192">Upset? Why that?</string>
<string name="28193">Why, hello there my pretty little peach. You certainly don&apos;t strike me as the normal variety of crone I&apos;ve become accustomed to servicing. Who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth, though, eh?</string>
<string name="28194">Ah, yet another young woman to chance upon the skills of a gnome in his prime!</string>
<string name="28195">Hmmm. I see the streets of Luskan are scraping the bottom of the barrel again when it comes to the availability of women in search of a good gnome. No matter! I&apos;ve taken on more difficult jobs in my lifetime, let me tell you!</string>
<string name="28196">How sweet. You&apos;ve come back to bask in the glow of gnome in his prime, have you?</string>
<string name="28197">Back again, are you? They all come back to me eventually... even the bounty hunters, though we won&apos;t get into that.</string>
<string name="28198">How goes the search? Tell me you have the ring... my third toe has been itching like mad, and that means all this fighting could stop at any second.</string>
<string name="28199">I really must be going... there&apos;s a bread box down in Mirabar with my name on it.</string>
<string name="28200">Farewell, good &lt;sir/madam&gt;. May fortune smile upon you always.</string>
<string name="28201">Farewell to you then, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="28202">Erb Jansen&apos;s the name, of the Culver Jansens originally... but, then, that branch of the family are really exiles from the Thunder Mountain Jansen clan, so perhaps I shouldn&apos;t be bragging about it.</string>
<string name="28203">Still, it&apos;s quite a tale how my family made its terrible trek all the way to Culver. Nary a turnip to be found on that trip, let me tell you. Even more remarkable is how I ended up in this job, considering my former career as a chest connoisseur.</string>
<string name="28204">Naturally. Everyone does, you know.</string>
<string name="28205">I know that the military leaders of the city, those High Captains, are all trying to kill each other and take over. Beyond that I haven&apos;t a clue... I&apos;m not the most political gnome this side of the Anauroch, you know.</string>
<string name="28206">There&apos;s not much more for me to say. My apologies... I&apos;m usually more talkative, it&apos;s just that I&apos;m so upset right now.</string>
<string name="28207">Very well, I suppose I can try to help you out. Where exactly do you need directions to?</string>
<string name="28208">The Cutlass Inn is still open, I think. Just left of the gate.</string>
<string name="28209">Anywhere else you need to get to?</string>
<string name="28210">Err... that&apos;s a good question. I tell you, if cousin Xerxes was still running his little shrine in the slums, I&apos;d direct you there. Beyond that, you might find a temple in the merchant area off to the west.</string>
<string name="28211">You might try the merchants off in the river. I doubt they&apos;d have much for sale, though. Colmarr&apos;s is still open, however... he&apos;s an enterprising little gnome, if a bit daft in the head.</string>
<string name="28212">I suppose there&apos;s some time before my wine is refreshed. Go ahead and ask.</string>
<string name="28213">No surprise there. I imagine someone like you is always getting lost.</string>
<string name="28214">Well, you certainly get right to the point!</string>
<string name="28215">Well, now, call me a halfling... but I actually have a job you could do for me. A little errand that is a mite dangerous to perform with the streets the way they are.</string>
<string name="28216">Ah, you remind me of my wee nephew, Gertie. He has a way with words, too, and sucks his thumb every chance he gets. At sixty-five, however, he&apos;s a bit old for that.</string>
<string name="28217">How shall I explain this? Well... one of my clients, a handsome noblewoman by the name of Lady Jadale, has something that belongs to me. Technically I suppose it belongs to her, since I gave it to her... but I want it back.</string>
<string name="28218">Heh heh... well, you see... the gift was a bit of impetuousness on my part. Lady Jadale&apos;s husband is a rather powerful man, a fact I forgot at the height of passion.</string>
<string name="28219">It&apos;s a ring, a little favor that I bestowed upon her that has my name enscribed. Just get it away from her and back in my hands and I&apos;ll be a happy little gnome.</string>
<string name="28220">So are you interested in the job? Whoever brings the ring to me will be well rewarded, I assure you.</string>
<string name="28221">Hah! The Lady was overjoyed when I gave her the present... and quite angry when I asked for it back. She says she&apos;s quite fond of the ring. Fonder than she is of me, at present.</string>
<string name="28222">That is why I need someone else to get the ring. Right now she won&apos;t even speak to me.</string>
<string name="28223">Not necessarily. The ring was a gift, and I&apos;m just being rude. It&apos;s a matter of life and death, though, so I&apos;m okay with that.</string>
<string name="28224">What you do to get the ring is your business. I just need it back, and will pay someone to do so.</string>
<string name="28225">Excellent! You&apos;ll find Lady Jadale&apos;s home not far from here. Go back towards the city gates and turn right... you should see the Cutlass Inn by the south walls. Lady Jadale&apos;s home is just west of the inn.</string>
<string name="28226">Do be kind to her, though, if you can. I don&apos;t wish any harm on the dotty woman... I just don&apos;t want any harm to come my way.</string>
<string name="28227">Do come back to me once you&apos;ve found that ring, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I&apos;ll be looking forward to it.</string>
<string name="28228">An advance? In this town? The chances of me seeing you again once you walk out the door would be less than those of my cousin Gilbert surviving the mooning of that red dragon. A ballsy move on his part, but foolish nonetheless.</string>
<string name="28229">Oh? Go ahead, then.</string>
<string name="28230">Heh heh... well, you see... the gift was a bit of impetuousness on my part. Lady Jadale&apos;s husband is a rather powerful man, a fact I forgot at the height of passion.</string>
<string name="28231">Now, I suppose you might have some questions before you set out after my ring?</string>
<string name="28232">You&apos;ll find her in her home on the north side of the district. Remember... don&apos;t hurt her, if you can avoid it. She&apos;s human, so it&apos;s really not her fault she&apos;s short a few marbles.</string>
<string name="28233">Not necessarily. The ring was a gift, and I&apos;m just being rude. It&apos;s a matter of life and death, though, so I&apos;m okay with that.</string>
<string name="28234">Perhaps it&apos;s just my overwhelming sense of deja vu, but I could have sworn I&apos;d already given you a job. My ring, remember? Or had you already forgotten?</string>
<string name="28235">Something else you wanted?</string>
<string name="28236">You don&apos;t say! Here I was thinking you&apos;d no doubt fish me some plastic junket out of the bottom of a box of porridge, and yet you come through with flying colors! Amazing!</string>
<string name="28237">How did you ever manage to convince the woman to give it up? Nevermind... I probably don&apos;t want to know. As my blind Aunt Binny said when she married unfortunate old Uncle Bucktooth: &apos;ignorance is bliss.&apos;</string>
<string name="28238">Yes, of course! I did say that, didn&apos;t I? Never let it be said that Erb reneged on a promise... unlike my poor, deranged and thrice-married Aunt Fanny. Hmmm... where was I? Oh, yes. Here&apos;s 500 gold pieces for the ring.</string>
<string name="28239">I must admit, I didn&apos;t have a good feeling about this when we started... sort of like when you swallow a copper piece by accident. The whole thing had trouble going down. But here we are and nobody&apos;s choking! How would 350 gold pieces sound?</string>
<string name="28240">I knew you were the successful type, right from the moment I laid eyes on you. &quot;Erb,&quot; I thought, &quot;this &lt;man/woman&gt; could be bigger than Uncle Bigbottom!&quot; And that&apos;s big. So here you go... 650 gold pieces for the ring.</string>
<string name="28241">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you probably do deserve something extra. I don&apos;t imagine Lady Jadale was all that pleasant to deal with. When she gets excited she&apos;s a bit pluckier than a griffon without its tail feathers. Here&apos;s another 100 gp.</string>
<string name="28242">And now I must take my leave for a brief while, in case Lady Jadale tries to look me up or worse. It&apos;s really a good thing gnomes are short and easy to hide. Farewell, my friend!</string>
<string name="28243">N-now just settle down. There&apos;s no need to get upset. No need for violence or any unpleasantness. Here, I&apos;ve got another 100 gold. Take it - it&apos;s yours. But that&apos;s all I have.</string>
<string name="28244">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s sweet of you to try and swindle me, but the reward is worth far more than the ring already.</string>
<string name="28245">(sigh) I suppose it falls on me to ensure that we gnomes are more successful than everyone else. Very well, then... here&apos;s another 100 gold pieces for your trouble. Don&apos;t spend it all in one place.</string>
<string name="28246">The word is &apos;connoisseur&apos;, my vocabularily-challenged friend. One who can discern that which is finer. A magnificent artist with unmatched taste.</string>
<string name="28247">Ah, yes, those were the days, weren&apos;t they? The making of proper chests was once a noble profession. They were pieces of art, I tell you, and not these flimsy things they make today that any two-bit &lt;race&gt; thief with half a mind could pick. Not that I&apos;m insinuating anything.</string>
<string name="28248">As a young little gnome in Culver, all I thought about were fine chests and the living I would make off of them. Alas, it was not to be. Pleasuring women is all I&apos;m about, now.</string>
<string name="28249">Well, of course not. Since the great Turnip Famine of &apos;45, there hasn&apos;t been a Culver.</string>
<string name="28250">I most certainly am! An expert at making the lasses smile. Ever since that fateful day when Miss Bela spotted a naive young gnome wandering into this fine city with nought but a sack of turnips on his back, in fact.</string>
<string name="28251">At first I thought I was only a guest, here... a well-treated one, I might add... although the tips struck me as a bit odd. Overall it&apos;s been a fine job. I&apos;m far better off than Uncle Fedard Jansen ever was.</string>
<string name="28252">Of course not! What a grisly story that would make. Everybody was quite hungry, though, and certainly *thought* they would die. Going too long without a proper turnip is agony enough.</string>
<string name="28253">No, no, it was the much-maligned Uncle Pinto who sold the rights to some human for a sack of turnips in one of his craving fits. They went and re-named it to &apos;Waterdeep&apos; or some nonsense, last I heard.</string>
<string name="28254">Well, some gold may have been involved... but all Uncle Pinto ever talked about was the turnips. Considering the bumper crop we had next year, he took a lot of flak for that trade. Pity.</string>
<string name="28255">Isn&apos;t it? Of course my relatives drove Uncle Pinto out of town for such foolishness. They thought two sacks should have been the minimum.</string>
<string name="28256">Now, then... was there something you needed?</string>
<string name="28257">That&apos;s what they all say, these days. I told him that winged contraption would never fly. For all I know, he&apos;s still at the bottom of that canyon.</string>
<string name="28258">Oh, really? That&apos;d be a first for this young gnome. Tempting as the offer might be, I&apos;m too upset to take on any new clients at the moment.</string>
<string name="28259">Sweet of you to offer, my dear, but I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m a bit too upset to take on a new client at the moment.</string>
<string name="28260">When Lord Jadale returns, I don&apos;t need his wife sporting my ring. He&apos;s rather renowned for his temper and I&apos;m rather fond of my legs, short though they may be.</string>
<string name="28261">The Lady Jadale is, shall we say, rather oblivious to the fact that her husband might not be too fond of me when he discovers the ring. She has less sense than an elf in a shoe store, I tell you.</string>
<string name="28262">When Lord Jadale returns, I don&apos;t need his wife sporting my ring. He&apos;s rather renowned for his temper and I&apos;m rather fond of my legs, however short they may be.</string>
<string name="28263">The Lady Jadale is, shall we say, rather oblivious to the fact that her husband might not be too fond of me when he discovers the ring. She has less sense than an elf in a shoe store, I tell you.</string>
<string name="28264">All right, all right... have it your way. Jenny Janson was picky, too, and she ended up a poor spinster in a small hovel with all of three teeth to her name. The choice is yours.</string>
<string name="28265">Naturally not. My charm is such that even the prettiest of ladies seek me out... so you&apos;re not to blame for wanting quality merchandise.</string>
<string name="28266">I&apos;m asking myself: is this lad here for a conversation or does he have some gnome-fetish that I dare not even ask about? I&apos;m hoping for the former, but being a quality gnome like myself, anything is possible.</string>
<string name="28267">Saying that you and I are both gnomes is... well, I suppose the genetic similarities are there, but it&apos;s a frightening proposition for me, nonetheless.</string>
<string name="28268">Here&apos;s an extra 100 gold pieces if you&apos;ll just keep that nugget of information to yourself.</string>
<string name="28269">I already told you that story, I&apos;m pretty sure... and you agreed to get the ring back for me. Or have you forgotten?</string>
<string name="28270">Please be quick, I must continue my duties.</string>
<string name="28271">I am a female courtesan.</string>
<string name="28272">I have been told that you dislike Baram and Kurth.</string>
<string name="28273">I&apos;ll take Baram&apos;s.</string>
<string name="28274">I&apos;ll take Kurth&apos;s.</string>
<string name="28275">Hello. If you would like to talk more, follow me.</string>
<string name="28276">Now that we are alone, what can I do for you.</string>
<string name="28277">You are correct, those two have made my life a living hell. I can give one of the keys I use to get into their bases. Either Kurths&apos; or Barams&apos; but not both: They would suspect my treachery.</string>
<string name="28278">Boy, it sure is too bad about Yvette upstairs.</string>
<string name="28279">Heh. Look at Baram&apos;s men cowering over there. Kurth&apos;ll have mopped the floor with them in no time.</string>
<string name="28280">Ye&apos;re one o&apos; Kurth&apos;s, aye? Aye, I think ye are. Good. If Kurth&apos;s going to be the true High Captain, he needs all the recruits he can get.</string>
<string name="28281">Those curs of Baram&apos;s are going to pay for burnin&apos; down our tower, they will!</string>
<string name="28282">There&apos;s been hordes of them... creatures in the streets. I thinks Baram&apos;s in league with necromancers, summonin&apos; ghouls an&apos; such.</string>
<string name="28283">With Kurth dead, we&apos;ll... well, we don&apos;t know what. Got an army now with nobody to lead it.</string>
<string name="28284">Word in the Bloody Hands is that even though Kurth is dead, we ain&apos;t disbanding. Someone else is gonna lead us... don&apos;t know who, though.</string>
<string name="28285">Kurth&apos;s dead! I wonder who had the guts to do that... </string>
<string name="28286">I&apos;m gonna find the fool who killed Kurth and make them pay, I will! Right after that fool o&apos; Baram&apos;s over there... </string>
<string name="28287">Stand off, ye bloody cur.</string>
<string name="28288">What&apos;re you? One o&apos; Baram&apos;s, I expect? Kurth will kill you all, I bet.</string>
<string name="28289">The Bloody Hands will rule the city soon enough, they will, heh... </string>
<string name="28290">Go on, get out of here. You&apos;re not one of Kurth&apos;s, which means ye&apos;re less than spit to me.</string>
<string name="28291">Huh. Who are you supposed to be?</string>
<string name="28292">We&apos;ve driven Baram an&apos; his men down to the sewers. They should stay there, if they&apos;re smart.</string>
<string name="28293">Baram&apos;s men shouldn&apos;t even be allowed in here... </string>
<string name="28294">Get lost.</string>
<string name="28295">I&apos;d smash yer face in... but we ain&apos;t allowed, in here.</string>
<string name="28296">I gotta go back to West Harbor soon. Maybe I&apos;ll take the short-cut in that hole in the wall by the old tower.</string>
<string name="28297">Who let you in here?</string>
<string name="28298">If I see you on the streets, ye&apos;re dead.</string>
<string name="28299">Leave me be, fool.</string>
<string name="28300">Hello, I am available for courtesan duties.</string>
<string name="28301">Who are you?</string>
<string name="28302">Who you?</string>
<string name="28303">You don&apos;t seem happy about that.</string>
<string name="28304">You not looks happy about that.</string>
<string name="28305">Can I ask you a question?</string>
<string name="28306">Me asks you question?</string>
<string name="28307">Bela told me to see you.</string>
<string name="28308">Miss Bela say me shoulds talk to you.</string>
<string name="28309">Where do you mean?</string>
<string name="28310">What you means &apos;elsewhere?&apos;</string>
<string name="28311">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="28312">And if someone were willing to help you... ?</string>
<string name="28313">And if somebody say they okays with helping you... ?</string>
<string name="28314">Just what do they make you do?</string>
<string name="28315">What they makes you do?</string>
<string name="28316">Can you tell me about the High Captains?</string>
<string name="28317">You tells me &apos;bout High Captains, maybe?</string>
<string name="28318">So you&apos;re weak, what else is new?</string>
<string name="28319">So you is weak. That not news.</string>
<string name="28320">Where do I find Kurth?</string>
<string name="28321">Where do I find Baram?</string>
<string name="28322">Tell me about Kurth.</string>
<string name="28323">Tell me about Baram.</string>
<string name="28324">Can they be reasoned with?</string>
<string name="28325">Where me finds Kurth?</string>
<string name="28326">Where me finds Baram?</string>
<string name="28327">Tell me &apos;bout Kurth.</string>
<string name="28328">Tell me &apos;bout Baram.</string>
<string name="28329">Can Captains be talked to?</string>
<string name="28330">How do I find Kurth, then?</string>
<string name="28331">How do I find Baram, then?</string>
<string name="28332">How me finds Kurth, then?</string>
<string name="28333">How me finds Baram, then?</string>
<string name="28334">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="28335">Naw. Forgets it.</string>
<string name="28336">Yes, give me the key.</string>
<string name="28337">No, I don&apos;t need any key.</string>
<string name="28338">Yeah, me needs key.</string>
<string name="28339">No, me not wants key.</string>
<string name="28340">Yes, give me the key.</string>
<string name="28341">No, I don&apos;t need any key.</string>
<string name="28342">Yeah, me needs key.</string>
<string name="28343">No, me not wants key.</string>
<string name="28344"></string>
<string name="28345"></string>
<string name="28346">Why do you think she&apos;d send me to you?</string>
<string name="28347">Why you thinks she sends me?</string>
<string name="28348">I said I thought the High Captains should be stopped.</string>
<string name="28349">Me says High Captains shoulds stop.</string>
<string name="28350">We were discussing the High Captains.</string>
<string name="28351">Miss Bela and me talks &apos;bout High Captains.</string>
<string name="28352">I don&apos;t know why you&apos;ve barged into my room, but whoever you are: I&apos;m not entertaining today. I&apos;m required to go... elsewhere.</string>
<string name="28353">My name is Oreth. While I am one of Miss Bela&apos;s courtesans, I don&apos;t work here anymore... thanks to those damned High Captains.</string>
<string name="28354">Hmph. I&apos;d just as soon see the High Captains both dead and in the gutter rather than cater to those sick bastards. I have to do what I&apos;m told, though, and smile about it.</string>
<string name="28355">That means that I have to go to Baram or Kurth... whichever decides he has a use for me... and do whatever they wish.</string>
<string name="28356">I&apos;m glad to help Bela, but those men... I wish someone would do something nasty to those men. If I were braver, I&apos;d try to kill the High Captains myself. That would only get me killed and Miss Bela in trouble, though.</string>
<string name="28357">No you can&apos;t. I&apos;m not really in the mood for chit-chat. I don&apos;t suppose you&apos;d mind just leaving me be?</string>
<string name="28358">I mean not here, where I should be. I mean wherever those damnable High Captains want me to go, that&apos;s where.</string>
<string name="28359">Aye, I&apos;m sure you can see yourself out.</string>
<string name="28360">She did? Why would she do that?</string>
<string name="28361">Then I&apos;d say I might be able to help them. I know the back routes into both of the High Captains&apos; bases.</string>
<string name="28362">Put on a show for them with one of the other girls here, Rhaine. Or worse... I&apos;d really rather not discuss it.</string>
<string name="28363">Get out of my room. I don&apos;t need your kind of company.</string>
<string name="28364">I suppose I know plenty about Kurth and Baram. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="28365">He&apos;s a madman. He&apos;s always been hungry for power, they say, but even his men think he&apos;s gone completely mad, now. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants.</string>
<string name="28366">All he thinks about is killing Baram and taking over the city, talking about how glorious it will be. I don&apos;t believe he actually even thinks about what this all has done to Luskan.</string>
<string name="28367">Baram is... a cunning man. He relies on guile more than strength, and doesn&apos;t consider any act too low or desperate to perform.</string>
<string name="28368">He&apos;s allied with necromancers... there&apos;s undead all about his base, making his men nervous and jittery. Even Baram, himself, seems strange... I think he&apos;s done something to himself. Something unnatural.</string>
<string name="28369">Maybe. You might be able to talk to them, if they thought you could help them kill the other High Captain. I doubt they&apos;d keep any deal you made, though.</string>
<string name="28370">Baram has a base within the sewers of the city, full of his troops and undead monsters conjured by his sorcerer allies. The main gate is through a sewer entrance on the island east of and south of here.</string>
<string name="28371">His base is heavily fortified, but not impregnable. There is a back entrance that is not well-known about... it&apos;s a sewer grate entrance just to the west of the brothel, by the stores. It&apos;s the entrance I use when I must go to him.</string>
<string name="28372">Kurth is in the West Docks district. His men come out of a gap broken in the wall. I don&apos;t suggest that you use that. There is an opening in the ruins of his old tower. It&apos;s what I use when I must go and see him.</string>
<string name="28373">You need a key to get into his base through the tower door. You can have it, if you wish. I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re plans are, but I bet you that bastard won&apos;t like them.</string>
<string name="28374">I have a key which could help you gain entrance... if you&apos;d like it.</string>
<string name="28375">That&apos;s all I can tell you about that, however.</string>
<string name="28376">Then I suppose there&apos;s nothing more to say, is there?</string>
<string name="28377">Suit yourself. Something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="28378">Take it. It&apos;s a copy I had made. Careful, however... if any of Kurth&apos;s guards see you entering there, they&apos;ll presume you&apos;re an enemy and try to kill you.</string>
<string name="28379">Kurth deserves to die, friend... if you get the chance, don&apos;t hesitate. More Luskanites than I will thank you dearly for it.</string>
<string name="28380">Here... this should unlock the gratings there for you. It&apos;s well-watched, though, and using this key will ensure Baram thinks you&apos;re an enemy.</string>
<string name="28381">I don&apos;t presume to know your business, but kill that little rat if you can. I&apos;ll be happy to know it when his days are at an end.</string>
<string name="28382">Back again? Look, I&apos;ve already told you what I have to do... what do you want from me?</string>
<string name="28383">Back again? I&apos;ve given you a key. I hope you&apos;ll use it to kill the High Captains... or whatever it is you have planned. What else do you want?</string>
<string name="28384">I don&apos;t need to talk to someone like you. Get out of my room.</string>
<string name="28385">Who are you?</string>
<string name="28386">Who you?</string>
<string name="28387">You don&apos;t seem happy about that.</string>
<string name="28388">You not looks happy about that.</string>
<string name="28389">Can I ask you a question?</string>
<string name="28390">Me asks you question?</string>
<string name="28391">Bela told me to see you.</string>
<string name="28392">Miss Bela say me shoulds talk to you.</string>

<string name="28400">Can you tell me about the High Captains?</string>
<string name="28401">You tells me &apos;bout High Captains, maybe?</string>
<string name="28402">Why don&apos;t you do something about it yourself?</string>
<string name="28403">Why you not do something?</string>
<string name="28404">Where do I find Kurth?</string>
<string name="28405">Where do I find Baram?</string>
<string name="28406">Tell me about Kurth.</string>
<string name="28407">Tell me about Baram.</string>

<string name="28434">We were discussing the High Captains.</string>
<string name="28435">Miss Bela and me talks &apos;bout High Captains.</string>
<string name="28436">Who... who are you? Look... I don&apos;t entertain here right now. I... am reserved to go elsewhere, whether I like it or not. So please leave me alone.</string>
<string name="28437">Rhaine. My name is Rhaine. I... I have to go, soon. Could you leave, please?</string>
<string name="28438">I am no fan of the High Captains, and I would rather not serve their whims if I had a say in it. I do what I&apos;m told, however.</string>
<string name="28439">Oreth and I have to go to the High Captains&apos; bases to put on a show... or do whatever else they want. We despise it, but there&apos;s nothing we can do about it.</string>
<string name="28440">Miss Bela does her best to help us, but there&apos;s nothing she nor we can do about it. I just... I just wish someone would visit a painful, horrible death on those men. Then this would all be over.</string>
<string name="28441">Please, no. I&apos;m not in the mood to talk. I have to leave soon and I... need to prepare myself.</string>
<string name="28442">Somewhere else. Somewhere I don&apos;t want to go, but don&apos;t have a choice.</string>
<string name="28443">Thank you. All I wish is to be left alone.</string>
<string name="28444">She did? Why would she do that?</string>
<string name="28445">I&apos;d gladly tell them whatever I knew, then, if it would mean those bastards&apos; deaths.</string>
<string name="28446">Sometimes they throw me to their men. Sometimes they... I... would rather not talk about it.</string>
<string name="28447">I&apos;d gladly kill them, if I could. I can&apos;t, however, and that would just get Miss Bela into more trouble than you or I could imagine... and I won&apos;t do that. Please... just leave me alone! There&apos;s nothing I can do and no one can help me!</string>
<string name="28448">Aye. I know more about them than I would ever care to.</string>
<string name="28449">He&apos;s a madman. He&apos;s always been hungry for power, they say, but even his men think he&apos;s gone completely mad, now. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants.</string>

<string name="28453">I don&apos;t know. They might make a deal with you, if they thought it would put them ahead of the other High Captain somehow. Whether they&apos;d bother keeping that deal is another matter entirely.</string>
<string name="28454">Baram has a base within the sewers of the city, full of his troops and undead monsters conjured by his sorcerer allies. The main gate is through a sewer entrance on the island east of and south of here.</string>

<string name="28461">All right. What else do you want to know?</string>
<string name="28462">Take it. It&apos;s a copy I had made. You must be careful, however. They know me... but Kurth&apos;s men will assume you are an assassin if they see you inside the base.</string>
<string name="28463">I don&apos;t know what your plans are, truly... but I have a feeling that Kurth won&apos;t like it either way.</string>
<string name="28464">Here... this should unlock the gratings there for you. Be careful... they know me, but they&apos;ll think you&apos;re an assassin if they spot you.</string>
<string name="28465">I don&apos;t presume to know your business, but kill that bastard if you can. I&apos;ll be happy to know it when his days are at an end.</string>
<string name="28466">Back again? Look, I&apos;ve already told you what I have to do... what do you want from me?</string>

<string name="28469">Who are you?</string>
<string name="28470">I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="28471">Who you be?</string>
<string name="28472">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="28473">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="28474">Do you know what&apos;s going on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="28475">I&apos;m looking for work, if you know of any.</string>
<string name="28476">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="28477">You know stuff &apos;bout Luskan?</string>
<string name="28478">Me look for job. You got one?</string>
<string name="28479">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="28480">What problem is that?</string>
<string name="28481">What is little problem?</string>
<string name="28482">Tell me about the job.</string>

<string name="28506">You mentioned something about a job before.</string>
<string name="28507">You was talking &apos;bout job before.</string>

<string name="28509">Me gots baby here.</string>
<string name="28510">You&apos;re one of the brothel girls, then?</string>
<string name="28511">You brothel girl, huh?</string>
<string name="28512">What&apos;s the problem?</string>
<string name="28513">What problem?</string>
<string name="28514">You don&apos;t seem like the type.</string>
<string name="28515">You not looks like you belongs here.</string>
<string name="28516">So? I want to hire you anyway.</string>
<string name="28517">So? Me wants to hire you still.</string>
<string name="28518">No, I don&apos;t want to get involved.</string>
<string name="28519">No, me not wants to be involved.</string>
<string name="28520">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; It wasn&apos;t an easy task. Don&apos;t you think a bit more would be suitable?</string>
<string name="28521">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me work hard for this. You give more gold, yes?</string>
<string name="28522">No it&apos;s not. Give me all of it or the kid dies, girl.</string>
<string name="28523">No it not enough. Give all or baby dies!</string>
<string name="28524">Is that all? I guess I&apos;ll take the baby back to Galrone.</string>
<string name="28525">Is all? Okays, me takes baby to Galrone again.</string>
<string name="28526">Keep your gold for the baby. It was my pleasure.</string>

<string name="28531">No. Me takes baby to Galrone again.</string>
<string name="28532">I suppose it will have to do.</string>
<string name="28533">Me guess it okay, then.</string>
<string name="28534">You&apos;re right. The original reward will do.</string>
<string name="28535">You right. Reward is okay.</string>
<string name="28536">No, no, keep the gold.</string>
<string name="28537">No, you keeps gold.</string>
<string name="28538">I am sure. In fact, I have 250 gp. Take it and be safe.</string>
<string name="28539">Me sure. Here... 250 gp. Take and be safe.</string>
<string name="28540">I... hello, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I apologize, but I am not... entertaining anyone today. My heart simply isn&apos;t in it.</string>
<string name="28541">Greetings, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Why have you come in my room? I am... not entertaining, today. My heart simply wouldn&apos;t be in it.</string>
<string name="28542">How dare you just come into my room! I... I am not entertaining anyone. I can&apos;t, my heart just... wouldn&apos;t be in it.</string>
<string name="28543">You return. Is there something else I can do for you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="28544">You&apos;ve come back? Er... what do you wish of me?</string>
<string name="28545">Have... have you found my baby? Have you any news?</string>
<string name="28546">I must be on my way now. Please excuse me.</string>
<string name="28547">Fare you well, then, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="28548">Aye. Goodbye to you.</string>
<string name="28549">My name is Yvette. I have been entertaining here at Miss Bela&apos;s for only a short time.</string>
<string name="28550">But... I&apos;m sure I am no one that would interest you. What could you want from me?</string>
<string name="28551">I&apos;ll do my best to answer, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="28552">I am no expert in such matters, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. The fighting has been going on for several weeks, now... it&apos;s quite horrible. I wish it would just stop.</string>
<string name="28553">I don&apos;t know much else. Maybe Miss Bela could tell you more? She is so smart and kind... she&apos;s been so helpful with my... little problem.</string>
<string name="28554">I don&apos;t know my way around Luskan, myself. You might be better off asking Miss Bela... or maybe Erb. Erb could help you. You&apos;ll probably find him out in the lounge.</string>
<string name="28555">All... all right. Ask me what you wish.</string>
<string name="28556">Well, you certainly get right to the point!</string>
<string name="28557">You... want a job? Maybe you could help me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I haven&apos;t anyone else to turn to... perhaps I could hire you?</string>
<string name="28558">You... want me to... oh, I understand.</string>
<string name="28559">I... had a baby, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. With a client. I didn&apos;t mean to, but it happened, and my little daughter was the joy of my life when I had her.</string>
<string name="28560">I don&apos;t know. Galrone is a haughty and... and sometimes cruel man. I didn&apos;t think he&apos;d even want to know about the child, nevermind want it.</string>
<string name="28561">The father, however... Galrone... he does not believe I would make a proper mother. He took my daughter away and will not return her. I wish... I would pay you to get my child back.</string>
<string name="28562">It frightens me to think what he might do to her. Please... if you get her back, I will reward you.</string>
<string name="28563">But... it&apos;s my baby, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I don&apos;t think Galrone even wants her... I think he just doesn&apos;t want it known that he has a... a bastard child.</string>
<string name="28564">He won&apos;t talk to me and won&apos;t let me see her at all. Please help me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, and I&apos;ll give you what gold I have.</string>
<string name="28565">I could, I know I could. Miss Bela has put aside much of the coin I&apos;ve... earned here. I want to leave Luskan and go back home... to raise my daughter proper.</string>
<string name="28566">I&apos;ve enough money to pay you and... and still make a good life for her. Please, please help me!</string>
<string name="28567">Oh, that&apos;s wonderful news! Galrone is in a house to the north, in the slums... though I&apos;ve no idea if he&apos;s remained there with all this fighting.</string>
<string name="28568">Please do whatever you can to get my daughter back... just don&apos;t hurt Galrone, please, if you can avoid it. He... he is still my child&apos;s father.</string>
<string name="28569">Please come back with my baby when you find her.</string>
<string name="28570">Miss Bela warned me not to give my gold away. You... you will get a reward once I get my daughter, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I won&apos;t give it out before then.</string>
<string name="28571">Oh, of course. What do you need to know?</string>
<string name="28572">I don&apos;t know. Galrone is a haughty and... and sometimes cruel man. I didn&apos;t think he even wanted to know about the child, nevermind care for it.</string>
<string name="28573">It frightens me to think what he might do to her. Please... if you get her back, I will reward you.</string>
<string name="28574">But... it&apos;s my baby, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I don&apos;t think Galrone even wants her... I think he just doesn&apos;t want it known that he has a... a bastard child.</string>
<string name="28575">I could, I know I could. Miss Bela has put aside much of the coin I&apos;ve... earned here. I want to leave Luskan and go back home... to raise my daughter proper.</string>
<string name="28576">I... I suppose you should know that Galrone is a very wealthy man. He has many guards, and had influence in Luskan before all this fighting started. I don&apos;t know his situation now, though.</string>
<string name="28577">You said you would find my baby. I... don&apos;t know of anything else beyond that.</string>
<string name="28578">Maybe Miss Bela could tell you more. She is a very smart lady.</string>
<string name="28579">You found her! Oh, thank you, thank you! How did you ever manage to convince Galrone to give her up? Oh, I don&apos;t care! All that matters is I have her back once more.</string>
<string name="28580">Aye, but... I have not been for long. Miss Bela has given me leave, as well, until I... until things are sorted out. I cannot bring myself to be with anyone at the moment.</string>
<string name="28581">I suppose. My family died before all the fighting began. Miss Bela gave me a home here... she has been very kind.</string>
<string name="28582">Alll... all you brutes are the same! Get out of my room, please... Miss Bela gave me leave. Talk to her, if you have a problem with that.</string>
<string name="28583">I see. Yes, of course you don&apos;t... that is, thank you for at least considering it. Now, if you could... leave me alone, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, I&apos;d appreciate it.</string>
<string name="28584">He won&apos;t talk to me and won&apos;t let me see her at all. Please help me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, and I&apos;ll give you what gold I have.</string>
<string name="28585">I&apos;ve enough money to pay you and... and still make a good life for her. Please, please help me!</string>
<string name="28586">My gold doesn&apos;t seem enough of a reward... but it&apos;s all I have to give you. I... can spare 500 gold pieces. I... hope that is enough?</string>
<string name="28587">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... suppose so. It will mean less for us, but... without your help, I wouldn&apos;t have my baby to begin with.</string>
<string name="28588">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I have very little gold, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. To give you more would mean less for my daughter... isn&apos;t the reward enough for you?</string>
<string name="28589">No! You... you wouldn&apos;t! Here, then... take it. All of it. I... I will simply have to find... some way of supporting her back home.</string>
<string name="28590">No, don&apos;t do that! I... here, I shall give you more! It means much less for the baby, but... but I cannot give her up again.</string>
<string name="28591">Are... are you sure, &lt;sir/madam&gt;? You earned the gold, after all. The baby and I can... make do.</string>
<string name="28592">Take it, then. I don&apos;t know what I would have done without your help.</string>
<string name="28593">I have to go, now. Miss Bela arranged for someone to take us out of the city, to start our lives anew. Thank you again!</string>
<string name="28594">You are a cruel, cruel &lt;man/woman&gt;. Miss Bela has found me a way to leave this city and people like you behind... I hope I never have to return!</string>
<string name="28595">You... you have done far more than I could ever have hoped. Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... I shall remember your kindness always.</string>
<string name="28596">You are so generous, I... I don&apos;t know what to say. Bless you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, I shall remember your kindness always!</string>
<string name="28597">Are you a prisoner here?</string>
<string name="28598">Stand back! I&apos;ll have no tricks out of you!</string>
<string name="28599">Calm down. I&apos;m certainly not with Kurth.</string>
<string name="28600">You is prisoner here?</string>
<string name="28601">Stand back! No tricks!!</string>
<string name="28602">Me not with Kurth. You calm down now.</string>
<string name="28603">Of course I&apos;m not one of Kurth&apos;s soldiers.</string>
<string name="28604">Me not Kurth soldier, no.</string>
<string name="28605">How do I know you&apos;re actually a prisoner, that this isn&apos;t some ruse?</string>
<string name="28606">Just how did you end up here?</string>
<string name="28607">What reward would I get for letting you go?</string>
<string name="28608">Would you be able to find your way out on your own?</string>
<string name="28609">I&apos;m not here to rescue you.</string>
<string name="28610">How I know you not lying?</string>
<string name="28611">Just how you gets here?</string>
<string name="28612">Is there reward for freeing you?</string>
<string name="28613">You find way out on own?</string>
<string name="28614">Me no rescuer.</string>
<string name="28615">Perhaps it&apos;s time I put you out of your misery, then.</string>
<string name="28616">Go, then, I could not care less.</string>
<string name="28617">I don&apos;t know. Is there anything in it for me for helping you?</string>
<string name="28618">Ha! Me puts you out of misery, then!</string>
<string name="28619">Go, then, before me gets mad.</string>
<string name="28620">Don&apos;t know. What in it for me?</string>
<string name="28621">I don&apos;t trust you. Time to die!</string>
<string name="28622">No believe! Die! Die!!</string>
<string name="28623">You&apos;re of no use to me, then.</string>
<string name="28624">You no use to me, then.</string>
<string name="28625">You&apos;re Evaine, yes? I am here to rescue you.</string>
<string name="28626">I&apos;m here to take you away. Don&apos;t give me any grief.</string>
<string name="28627">I&apos;m freeing you, but I&apos;m no babysitter. Can you get out on your own?</string>
<string name="28628">Just stay there and don&apos;t move.</string>
<string name="28629">You Evaine? Me come to rescue.</string>
<string name="28630">Me here to take you out. No grief from you!</string>
<string name="28631">Me free you, but me no protector. You get out on own?</string>
<string name="28632">Just stay and no move.</string>
<string name="28633">Then you can go.</string>
<string name="28634">Then you go, now.</string>
<string name="28635">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Calm down. Just follow me and I&apos;ll bring you to Elynwyd, I promise.</string>
<string name="28636">Stupid woman! If I have to drag you out, you&apos;re coming with me!</string>
<string name="28637">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You follow me, I bring you&apos;se to Elynwyd, me promise.</string>
<string name="28638">Stupid woman! If me must drag you out, me will!</string>
<string name="28639">I&apos;ll slit your throat if you don&apos;t do as I say! I am not joking!!</string>
<string name="28640">Me slits your throat if you not come! Me no joke!!</string>
<string name="28641">You can leave, then.</string>
<string name="28642">You goes, then.</string>
<string name="28643">Oh, thank heavens! Please tell me you&apos;re not one of Kurth&apos;s men!</string>
<string name="28644">You... aren&apos;t one of Kurth&apos;s soldiers, are you? You don&apos;t seem like the type.</string>
<string name="28645">P-please don&apos;t hurt me! I haven&apos;t tried to escape, I swear it!</string>
<string name="28646">Yes I am. My name is Evaine, and Kurth has held me here by force since he took me from my home more than a week ago. Does this mean... you would free me from this cell, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="28647">I don&apos;t have any weapons, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... and the magical wards on the door prevented me from casting spells. Please, my name is Evaine... Kurth has been keeping me here against my will. Could you not release me from here?</string>
<string name="28648">That... that is quite a relief! My name is Evaine, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Kurth has been keeping me here since he stole me from my brother&apos;s home weeks ago. I never thought anyone would come!</string>
<string name="28649">Oh, please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! Please don&apos;t leave me in here! I&apos;m begging you! Kurth has... put me through so much, I cannot stand another moment of it! Please let me leave this cell and escape!!</string>
<string name="28650">Kurth and his men raided my brother&apos;s home weeks ago, where I was staying. They took most of his wealth and burned everything. Then... then Kurth decided he would take me, as well, for his own.</string>
<string name="28651">I... am certainly no threat to you, and I&apos;ve no reason to lie. All I want is to get out of this horrid place and for Kurth to leave my brother and I in peace. Please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... could you not release me from this cell?</string>
<string name="28652">I... have no money of my own. My brother, Elynwyd, might be able to reward you if he still lives. I do not know if he is even still in Luskan, however.</string>
<string name="28653">I... I have magic that I can leave by, now that the wards on the door are gone... if you allow me to leave, that is... </string>
<string name="28654">Lying? About what? Oh... about being a prisoner.</string>
<string name="28655">Aieee! Help me, someone! Please!!</string>
<string name="28656">V-very well, then. It is enough that I can finally leave this place, I suppose. If you find Elynwyd, I am sure he will reward you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... </string>
<string name="28657">Who... who are you? You don&apos;t look like one of Kurth&apos;s soldiers.</string>
<string name="28658">Then you... you&apos;re here to rescue me?</string>
<string name="28659">But how do I know that? Kurth keeps testing me... he says he will kill Elynwyd if I even think of teleporting away.</string>
<string name="28660">That... that ring. That&apos;s Elynwyd&apos;s ring! Oh, thank the gods!</string>
<string name="28661">I... I think so, yes. I can use my magic to leave... now that the ward on the door is gone...</string>
<string name="28662">All... all right... I won&apos;t go anywhere... </string>
<string name="28663">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Elynwyd sent you? I... I believe you. Perhaps it is all right if I escape, now... thank the gods!</string>
<string name="28664">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I don&apos;t believe you! Leave me alone, I&apos;m too frightened!</string>
<string name="28665">No, no! Please don&apos;t hurt me! Leave me alone, leave me alone!!</string>
<string name="28666">Aiiee! All... all right, I&apos;m coming! Please don&apos;t hurt me!!</string>
<string name="28667">Please... I just want to get back to Elynwyd!</string>
<string name="28668">Thank you so much! I thought Kurth would have me as his slave forever! It gives me hope to know there are still heroes in this world.</string>
<string name="28669">My brother pleaded for Kurth to let me go, but Kurth just laughed in his face. He said he would keep me for his... his pleasure... if he wanted to.</string>
<string name="28670">That fiend said he would kill my brother if I tried to use my magic to teleport away. I&apos;ve been... trapped here, forced to do his bidding... ever since... </string>
<string name="28671">I... can leave, then? Oh, thank the gods!</string>
<string name="28672">I have to go... thank you again, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="28673">Kurth has been keeping me held here in this cell so I can&apos;t use my spells to teleport away. Now that the wards on the door are gone, I can leave on my own... if you&apos;ll let me.</string>
<string name="28674">Thank you for releasing me, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! I am very grateful. Please find Elynwyd when you have a chance... I am sure he can reward you.</string>
<string name="28675">You... you don&apos;t have to take me anywhere, though, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! I... I can teleport away, now that the ward is gone from the door. I&apos;ll go, now... I hope you&apos;re right... </string>
<string name="28676">What would the reward be, exactly?</string>
<string name="28677">What kind reward you mean?</string>
<string name="28678">Baram already made me the same offer.</string>
<string name="28679">Baram made same offer.</string>
<string name="28680">Baram is already dead, actually.</string>
<string name="28681">Baram dead, already.</string>
<string name="28682">I would never work for you!</string>
<string name="28683">Me never works for you!</string>
<string name="28684">I have some questions, first.</string>
<string name="28685">Me has questions, first.</string>
<string name="28686">What about Elynwyd&apos;s sister, Evaine? Do you have her?</string>
<string name="28687">What about elf&apos;s sister, Evaine? You haves her?</string>
<string name="28688">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps. I want more gold, however.</string>
<string name="28689">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe. Me wants more gold.</string>
<string name="28690">Aye, I&apos;m interested.</string>
<string name="28691">Yeah, me interested.</string>
<string name="28692">I want her released.</string>
<string name="28693">Me wants her released.</string>
<string name="28694">She doesn&apos;t, actually.</string>
<string name="28695">She not interest me at all.</string>
<string name="28696">I just wanted to know that, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="28697">Me just wants to know, is all.</string>
<string name="28698">Not interested.</string>
<string name="28699">Me not haves interest, no.</string>
<string name="28700">I want Evaine released, as well.</string>
<string name="28701">Me wants Evaine released, too.</string>
<string name="28702">I want to get into the Host Tower.</string>
<string name="28703">Me wants to get into wizard tower.</string>
<string name="28704">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; How about you make me a better offer?</string>
<string name="28705">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You makes me better offer, maybe?</string>
<string name="28706">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="28707">Me want to ask you questions.</string>
<string name="28708">I suppose I&apos;ll have to kill you.</string>
<string name="28709">Me have to kill you, me guessing.</string>
<string name="28710">Nothing at all.</string>
<string name="28711">Me does nothing.</string>
<string name="28712">1000 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="28713">1250 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="28714">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; 1500 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="28715">Forget it. I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="28716">You forgets it. Me not interested.</string>
<string name="28717">I want to get into the Host Tower.</string>
<string name="28718">Me wants to get into wizard tower.</string>
<string name="28719">What about Elynwyd&apos;s sister, Evaine? Do you have her?</string>
<string name="28720">What about elf&apos;s sister, Evaine? You haves her?</string>
<string name="28721">I want Evaine released, as well.</string>
<string name="28722">Me wants Evaine released, too.</string>
<string name="28723">I want her released.</string>
<string name="28724">Me wants her released.</string>
<string name="28725">She doesn&apos;t, actually.</string>
<string name="28726">She not interest me at all.</string>
<string name="28727">I just wanted to know that, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="28728">Me just wants to know, is all.</string>
<string name="28729">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="28730">Me has questions.</string>
<string name="28731">I want to get into the Host Tower.</string>
<string name="28732">Me wants to get into wizard tower.</string>
<string name="28733">What about Elynwyd&apos;s sister, Evaine? Do you have her?</string>
<string name="28734">What about elf&apos;s sister, Evaine? You haves her?</string>
<string name="28735">I want Elynwyd&apos;s sister released, as well.</string>
<string name="28736">Me wants elf&apos;s sister, Evaine, released.</string>
<string name="28737">I&apos;ve changed my mind.</string>
<string name="28738">Me change mind, not work for you.</string>
<string name="28739">I&apos;ll go now.</string>
<string name="28740">Me go now.</string>
<string name="28741">I want her released.</string>
<string name="28742">Me wants her released.</string>
<string name="28743">She doesn&apos;t, actually.</string>
<string name="28744">She not interest me at all.</string>
<string name="28745">I just wanted to know that, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="28746">Me just wants to know, is all.</string>
<string name="28747">What do you hope to get out of all this?</string>
<string name="28748">What you thinks you gets if you win?</string>
<string name="28749">Do you know what&apos;s going on in the Host Tower?</string>
<string name="28750">You know what going on in wizard tower?</string>
<string name="28751">Where do I find Baram?</string>
<string name="28752">Where me finds Baram?</string>
<string name="28753">What do you know about Baram&apos;s defenses?</string>
<string name="28754">What you knows &apos;bout Baram defenses?</string>
<string name="28755">I want to talk about something else.</string>
<string name="28756">Me wants to talk &apos;bout something else.</string>
<string name="28757">Why would Luskan need a war leader?</string>
<string name="28758">Why Luskan needs war leader?</string>
<string name="28759">Not yet, no.</string>
<string name="28760">No news yet, no.</string>
<string name="28761">I do. Baram is dead.</string>
<string name="28762">Yup. Baram dead, now.</string>
<string name="28763">Actually, Baram made me a very good counter-offer... </string>
<string name="28764">Uh-huh. Baram gaves me good counter-offer... </string>
<string name="28765">Just to let you know why I&apos;m going to kill you.</string>
<string name="28766">Just so you knows why me killing you.</string>
<string name="28767">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I thought maybe you&apos;d sweeten your offer... </string>
<string name="28768">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me thinking you could makes better offer... </string>
<string name="28769">1500 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="28770">2000 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="28771">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; 2500 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="28772">It doesn&apos;t matter. I&apos;m going to kill you anyway.</string>
<string name="28773">It not matter. Me kill you anyway.</string>
<string name="28774">Yes, I have his head here.</string>
<string name="28775">Me has head here.</string>
<string name="28776">Err... no, I don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="28777">Uhhh... no, me not haves head.</string>
<string name="28778">What about Evaine?</string>
<string name="28779">What of elf girl, Evaine?</string>
<string name="28780">I want Evaine released, as well.</string>
<string name="28781">Me wants Evaine released, too.</string>
<string name="28782">What of Elynwyd&apos;s sister, Evaine? Do you have her?</string>
<string name="28783">What of elf&apos;s sister, Evaine? You haves her?</string>
<string name="28784">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think I deserve a larger reward, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="28785">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me thinks me deserved bigger reward.</string>
<string name="28786">That&apos;s it? We&apos;re done?</string>
<string name="28787">That it? We all done?</string>
<string name="28788">Good. Time to kill you, now.</string>
<string name="28789">Is good. You dies, now.</string>
<string name="28790">Fine. But this isn&apos;t over.</string>
<string name="28791">This not over!</string>
<string name="28792">I killed one High Captain, Kurth... I can just as easily kill another.</string>
<string name="28793">Me kills one High Captain... easy to kills two.</string>
<string name="28794">What do I care? I have other plans.</string>
<string name="28795">Me not care. Gots other stuff to do.</string>
<string name="28796">Greetings, stranger. You&apos;ve been rather the trouble-maker, haven&apos;t you? You&apos;ve cut through my men rather efficiently. I can respect that.</string>
<string name="28797">In fact, I could use someone as strong as you to get rid of Baram for me. Not an easy task, I grant, but I&apos;d reward you well. What would you say to that?</string>
<string name="28798">Ahhh, that&apos;s a shame really. Do let me know if you change your mind.</string>
<string name="28799">Well, let&apos;s see. I have a few magic items here that might interest you... they are worth a great deal. Plus 1000 gold pieces on top of that?</string>
<string name="28800">All you&apos;d have to do is bring me Baram&apos;s head. Would that interest you?</string>
<string name="28801">I&apos;d be more than willing to answer your questions... *if* you agree to kill Baram.</string>
<string name="28802">Oh? You don&apos;t say? I find that hard to believe... High Captain Suljack was supposed to be dead, as well, but I&apos;ve had it on good authority he&apos;s quite alive.</string>
<string name="28803">You wouldn&apos;t happen to have his head, would you? I&apos;d consider that definitive proof.</string>
<string name="28804">So you&apos;ve already spoken to Baram... and the little rat had the same idea I had, did he? Well, well. What do you plan to do, then, stranger?</string>
<string name="28805">The elf girl? Why... yes, I do. Quite a pretty lass, that one. Why would she interest you?</string>
<string name="28806">Hmmm... you want me to give her up, do you? Very well. Bring me Baram&apos;s head and you can have her.</string>
<string name="28807">Fair enough. What about my original offer, then? Baram&apos;s head in exchange for the reward... ?</string>
<string name="28808">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Greedy, are we? Ha ha... I could learn to like you. Very well: 1250 gold pieces, no more. What do you think now?</string>
<string name="28809">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Now, now, stranger... 1000 gold is a lot of coin, and that&apos;s *if* you can do the job. Are you interested or not?</string>
<string name="28810">The which? Ah... you mean the Host Tower of the Arcane, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="28811">Now why would you want to get into there? I suppose it&apos;s no concern of mine... if you wish to kill yourself, it&apos;s your business.</string>
<string name="28812">Regardless, I&apos;m not about to cross the tower by giving you my own papers. Baram has his own, however... accept my offer and you can take his, if you wish.</string>
<string name="28813">And should you get any ideas about continuing your path past this portcullis... I&apos;d forget them, were I you.</string>
<string name="28814">Well... you can certainly try. Attempt to open this portcullis and you&apos;ll discover just what defenses I can muster.</string>
<string name="28815">Hah! I&apos;d be willing to answer your questions, perhaps... if you weren&apos;t working for that little rat, Baram. So what&apos;s it going to be?</string>
<string name="28816">Well, then... either that shows your good sense or Baram&apos;s wasted his coin.</string>
<string name="28817">Either way, you&apos;ve come quite far enough. Attempt to come pass this gate and I&apos;ll just have to assume you intend to carry out your agreement. Understand?</string>
<string name="28818">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmmm... I just might, at that. What is the little rat paying you?</string>
<string name="28819">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hah! I wouldn&apos;t trust that you&apos;d keep your end of the bargain for a second!</string>
<string name="28820">I see. Well, then... either you&apos;re more loyal to the rat than he deserves or simply too dumb to choose the right side.</string>
<string name="28821">Is that so? I can offer you more, then... 1500 gold pieces. Plus a magic item or two, to make it interesting. All for Baram&apos;s head... what do you say?</string>
<string name="28822">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Fine. 2000 gold pieces. Plus a magic item or two, to make it interesting. All for Baram&apos;s head... what do you say?</string>
<string name="28823">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sure he&apos;s not paying you so much. I will, however... 1500 gold, plus a few magic items, all for Baram&apos;s head. What do you say?</string>
<string name="28824">Now why would you want to get into there? I suppose it&apos;s no concern of mine... if you wish to kill yourself, it&apos;s your business.</string>
<string name="28825">Regardless, I&apos;m not about to cross the tower by giving you my own papers. Baram has similar ones, however... accept my offer and you can take his, if you wish.</string>
<string name="28826">The which? Ah... you mean the Host Tower of the Arcane, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="28827">The elf girl? Why... yes, I do. Quite a pretty lass, that one. Why would she interest you?</string>
<string name="28828">Hmmm... you want me to give her up, do you? Very well. Bring me Baram&apos;s head and you can have her.</string>
<string name="28829">Fair enough. What about my original offer, then? Baram&apos;s head in exchange for the reward...?</string>
<string name="28830">Good to hear! Let&apos;s hope you can settle the matter for me... and then all of us will be that much happier.</string>
<string name="28831">Now, then... I imagine you have some questions for me, yes? Or are you ready to go and give that little rat what he deserves?</string>
<string name="28832">The which? Ah... you mean the Host Tower of the Arcane, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="28833">Now why would you want to get into there? I suppose it&apos;s no concern of mine... if you wish to kill yourself, it&apos;s your business.</string>
<string name="28834">Regardless, I&apos;m not about to cross the tower by giving you my own papers. Baram has similar ones, however. Once you&apos;re finished with him, take his... and I&apos;ll certainly not wonder where it&apos;s gone.</string>
<string name="28835">The elf girl? Why... yes, I do. Quite a pretty lass, that one. Why does she interest you?</string>
<string name="28836">Hmmm... you want me to give her up, do you? Very well. But only once you&apos;ve brought me Baram&apos;s head. No sooner.</string>
<string name="28837">Then why even bring her up? She certainly isn&apos;t the first woman I&apos;ve taken for my... personal use.</string>
<string name="28838">Very well. I hope to see Baram&apos;s head soon.</string>
<string name="28839">Is that so? I see. Rather foolish decision, if you ask me. Let me know if you change your mind.</string>
<string name="28840">Ask away.</string>
<string name="28841">Aye? What do you wish, then?</string>
<string name="28842">Ha ha! That&apos;s a rather forward question, isn&apos;t it? Most people simply assume I want to rule the city... or have gone insane.</string>
<string name="28843">It&apos;s far more than that, naturally. The High Captain who survives to the last will become Luskan&apos;s war leader... and that shall be me.</string>
<string name="28844">Now that would be telling. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll know soon enough.</string>
<string name="28845">Only a little. There has been a bloody power struggle within the tower as of late, and a new Archmage Arcane has arisen.</string>
<string name="28846">I&apos;ve met the mage once, only. His name is Maugrim... quite an interesting fellow. Seems to hate Neverwinter something fierce, it seems.</string>
<string name="28847">In the sewers, of course, where we drove him to. He&apos;s got himself walled up in a little fortress down there, surrounded by necromancers.</string>
<string name="28848">The only good entrance I know of is east of the slums, across the bridge. That is, no doubt, heavily guarded.</string>
<string name="28849">Little. You should know, however, that Baram has infected himself with lycanthropy. I don&apos;t call him a rat for nothing.</string>
<string name="28850">He&apos;s spread the disease to most of his men, as well... and no doubt has had his necromancers whipping up undead like mad.</string>
<string name="28851">How he arrays them all in his fortress, I&apos;m not so sure of... but you should be aware of what you&apos;ll be facing.</string>
<string name="28852">Back again, are you, stranger? Have you changed your mind and given my offer some thought, perhaps?</string>
<string name="28853">Oh... one more thing, stranger. No matter what deal we have, should you try to enter my base I&apos;ll assume your intentions are hostile. But of course we needn&apos;t worry, yes?</string>
<string name="28854">Ahhhh, so the stranger returns! Do you have news?</string>
<string name="28855">Ahh, that is a shame. I was so looking forward to feeding Baram&apos;s head to the dogs. Perhaps soon, yes?</string>
<string name="28856">A-ha! So it is pleasant news you bring!</string>
<string name="28857">You&apos;ll have to forgive me if I&apos;m a bit skeptical. I&apos;ve been told that Suljack is dead, and yet I have it on good authority that he&apos;s alive and well... despite all attempts to the contrary.</string>
<string name="28858">You have, have you? I think you&apos;ve been trying to play me all along. Well, then, stranger... good for you. Well done.</string>
<string name="28859">However you think your schemes will turn out, attempt to take one foot into my base and you will quickly discover otherwise.</string>
<string name="28860">Oh *did* he? Somehow he found the time to negotiate with you while you fought him, I take it? Why are you even telling me this?!</string>
<string name="28861">You&apos;ve made a very... big... mistake, fool! Turn around right now, while you yet live... for if you step a foot past this door you shall suffer the consequences!</string>
<string name="28862">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;re walking a thin line, stranger. (sigh) What is the rat paying you now?</string>
<string name="28863">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Absolutely not! I will not be played like a lute!</string>
<string name="28864">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Gah! Fine! 3000 gold pieces... but no more! I will be played no further... do not even *think* of bringing up the subject of your reward again!</string>
<string name="28865">For that kind of coin, I expect the job to be done forthwith! Go and do it before I lose my patience!!</string>
<string name="28866">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Bah! You are lying to me through your teeth. I&apos;ll give you 2500 gold and not a copper more!</string>
<string name="28867">(sigh) Very well. 2000 gold pieces it is... but no more. I will tolerate no more of your playing us one against the other.</string>
<string name="28868">(sigh) Very well. 2500 gold pieces it is... but no more. I will tolerate no more of your playing us one against the other.</string>
<string name="28869">What is it now? I trust you bring me word of Baram&apos;s death, correct?</string>
<string name="28870">For the reward you&apos;ve been promised, I expect to see Baram&apos;s head... soon. Go and do it before I change my mind about you.</string>
<string name="28871">Ah. Well, until I see the rat&apos;s little head up close, I&apos;ll not believe he&apos;s dead for a second.</string>
<string name="28872">So if Baram is actually dead, I&apos;m sure you won&apos;t mind running back to wherever it is you left him and fetching his head for me, now, would you?</string>
<string name="28873">Perhaps you thought I was joking when I said I wished Baram&apos;s head. I&apos;m not... run back to wherever you left him or you&apos;ll receive no reward.</string>
<string name="28874">It should not be a difficult matter... unless he&apos;s *not* dead at all. Either way, I can offer you quite a reward for doing so.</string>
<string name="28875">Really? Do show me.</string>
<string name="28876">Ahhhh, yes... that is, indeed, Baram&apos;s head. I&apos;d heard the rat had been recently killed, I simply wasn&apos;t sure you were the one who&apos;d done it.</string>
<string name="28877">So be it, stranger... you&apos;ve earned your reward. Here is the gold you were promised, and the items. Take them and go.</string>
<string name="28878">What about her? Oh... you didn&apos;t actually think I was going to release her, did you? Foolish &lt;man/woman&gt;!</string>
<string name="28879">The girl&apos;s been a source of endless pleasure and amusement. Since I&apos;m the last High Captain, I can do what I like... and I&apos;ll be holding onto her, thank you.</string>
<string name="28880">As for you and I, our business is done. Off you go... before you get hurt.</string>
<string name="28881">Now, now... that wasn&apos;t part of our agreement, was it? And even if it was, I doubt I&apos;d be releasing her now, anyway.</string>
<string name="28882">You know of her? Well, no matter. If you&apos;re thinking of getting her released, I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s simply impossible, no matter what your feelings might be to the contrary.</string>
<string name="28883">And why would that be? You&apos;ve been given what you were promised. Be thankful I don&apos;t have you hanged for murder.</string>
<string name="28884">As the last surviving High Captain, the city is mine... and the army that goes with it! Ha ha ha! At last!!</string>
<string name="28885">We are very done. Now that I am the last High Captain, I have plenty of business to attend to. You have done well... now off you go.</string>
<string name="28886">Oh? Don&apos;t be a fool, stranger. I am the last High Captain and I have much to plan for... be smart and run along, now.</string>
<string name="28887">Oh, but it is. Come into my base and you&apos;ll be killed, to put it simply. Now... if you&apos;ll excuse me, I have things to attend to.</string>
<string name="28888">Take one step in here and you&apos;ll be gutted like a rat. I am no Baram, after all. Now... if you&apos;ll excuse me, I have plans to make.</string>
<string name="28889">Good. Go and do... whatever it is you&apos;re doing. If you&apos;ll excuse me, I have plans to make.</string>
<string name="28890">We have no further business, you and I! Take one step into my base and you&apos;ll pay the consequences, fool!</string>
<string name="28891">Our business is done. Begone!</string>
<string name="28892">Are you a prisoner here?</string>
<string name="28893">Stand back! I&apos;ll have no tricks out of you!</string>
<string name="28894">Calm down. I&apos;m certainly not with Kurth.</string>
<string name="28895">You kept in prison?</string>
<string name="28896">Stand back! No tricks!!</string>
<string name="28897">Me not with Kurth. You calm down now.</string>
<string name="28898">Of course I&apos;m not here to punish you.</string>
<string name="28899">Me not here to punish, no.</string>
<string name="28900">How do I know you&apos;re actually a prisoner, that this isn&apos;t some ruse?</string>
<string name="28901">I&apos;d appreciate some information, first.</string>
<string name="28902">What reward would I get for letting you go?</string>
<string name="28903">Would you be able to find your way out on your own?</string>
<string name="28904">I&apos;m not here to rescue you. Get out of my way.</string>
<string name="28905">How I knows you not lying?</string>
<string name="28906">Me have questions, first.</string>
<string name="28907">Is there reward for letting you go?</string>
<string name="28908">You find way out on own?</string>
<string name="28909">Me no rescuer. Get lost.</string>
<string name="28910">I never said that. Killing is fun! Ha ha ha!!</string>
<string name="28911">Why would I hurt you? Go, I said.</string>
<string name="28912">I don&apos;t know. Is there anything in it for me for helping you?</string>
<string name="28913">Never say that! Hurting fun! HA ha Ha!!</string>
<string name="28914">Why me hurt you? Go, I say.</string>
<string name="28915">Don&apos;t know. What in it for me?</string>
<string name="28916">I don&apos;t trust you. Time to die!</string>
<string name="28917">No believe! Die! Die!!</string>
<string name="28918">Yes, I could use some information.</string>
<string name="28919">You&apos;re of no use to me. Get lost.</string>
<string name="28920">Yes, tell me. That good.</string>
<string name="28921">You no use to me, then. Go.</string>
<string name="28922">Then flee to safety. The way behind me is clear.</string>
<string name="28923">Perhaps you should accompany me. It would be safer that way.</string>
<string name="28924">Then run. Way behind is clear.</string>
<string name="28925">No, you come with me. Safer.</string>
<string name="28926">Just how did you end up prisoner here?</string>
<string name="28927">What do you know about this place?</string>
<string name="28928">Tell me what you know about Kurth.</string>
<string name="28929">All right. I&apos;m done with you now.</string>
<string name="28930">How you end up in prison?</string>
<string name="28931">What you know of this place?</string>
<string name="28932">What you know of Kurth?</string>
<string name="28933">Me done with you.</string>
<string name="28934">But why wouldn&apos;t he just kill you?</string>
<string name="28935">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you have any clue as to what might have caused his madness?</string>
<string name="28936">Do you know where Kurth is?</string>
<string name="28937"></string>
<string name="28938">What sorts of allies does Kurth have?</string>
<string name="28939">Are there any other prisoners?</string>
<string name="28940">Why they keep you alive?</string>
<string name="28941">Me look for Kurth.</string>
<string name="28942">What kind of friends Kurth have?</string>
<string name="28943">You see other prisoners?</string>
<string name="28944">You... you aren&apos;t with High Captain Kurth, are you? No, I&apos;d remember you, I&apos;m sure... </string>
<string name="28945">I... you aren&apos;t here to punish me again, are you? You... I don&apos;t remember you from the army... </string>
<string name="28946">Ahhh! Please don&apos;t hurt me! Please... tell Kurth I haven&apos;t tried to escape, I swear!</string>
<string name="28947">Yes... I used to be in Kurth&apos;s army, but... but I tried to flee when he went insane. I suppose I should be thankful I&apos;m even alive. Do... do you think you could free me, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="28948">I&apos;m unarmed and unarmored, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. And even if I wasn&apos;t, I wouldn&apos;t fight for Kurth anymore. He threw me in here when I tried to flee. Do... do you think you might free me?</string>
<string name="28949">That... that is a relief, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Kurth has gone insane, he has... he threw me in here when I tried to flee his army. Could... could you let me out of here, you think?</string>
<string name="28950">So... you&apos;ll let me go? You&apos;re not going to hurt me or anything?</string>
<string name="28951">I don&apos;t know much, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... but I&apos;ll tell you whatever I can.</string>
<string name="28952">I don&apos;t know. I haven&apos;t got a thing to attack you with... and if you let me go, I&apos;ll just leave! All I want to do is get away from here, I swear!</string>
<string name="28953">I don&apos;t have any gold. Kurth didn&apos;t leave me with anything at all. I... I guess I could tell you about this place, some, or maybe about Kurth... </string>
<string name="28954">I think so. I&apos;d rather die trying then sit around waiting for Kurth to let some demon eat me, or... or worse.</string>
<string name="28955">Lying? About what? Oh... about being a prisoner.</string>
<string name="28956">Ahhh! I... I haven&apos;t anything to fight with, even! Someone help me!!</string>
<string name="28957">Th-thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. All I want is to be away from this war and this hellish city. And Kurth... I hope he gets what he deserves!</string>
<string name="28958">That... that&apos;s very kind of you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, but I couldn&apos;t ask you to do that. I&apos;ll bet you&apos;re heading toward more of Kurth&apos;s men, too... and that&apos;s the last place I want to be.</string>
<string name="28959">High Captain Kurth has gone mad... he&apos;ll do anything, kill any of us, to kill the other High Captains. I... I tried to flee, to get away, and he caught me and threw me in here.</string>
<string name="28960">I guess the wizard wouldn&apos;t give it to Kurth, because the High Captain had us invade the place and kill the old man.</string>
<string name="28961">He&apos;s a really strong fighter, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. He&apos;s gone mad, too. I&apos;ll tell you right now, though... he won&apos;t negotiate with you once you&apos;re in here... he&apos;ll be out for blood!</string>
<string name="28962">He killed plenty others, so I don&apos;t know. He said something about... about giving me to some demon, though. I... I don&apos;t want to think about it... </string>
<string name="28963">No... no, not really. Although there was this fellow who visited the High Captain one night, now that I remember. Kurth called him Maugrim. All this business began right after that.</string>
<string name="28964">Somewhere beyond the jeweled door... you know, the one across the main hall outside the prison. You should be careful, though... there&apos;s all kinds of monsters back there. Big ones. They just keep coming through the portal.</string>
<string name="28965"></string>
<string name="28966">I... I think one of them was a priestess of Auril, I&apos;m not sure. There&apos;s some soldiers Kurth recruited... and some demons... lots of demons. They all come through a portal that was made by the wizard who lived here before Kurth took over.</string>
<string name="28967">There were a few. I don&apos;t know what happened to them, though. There was a girl, too... what was her name? Evaine? Kurth kept her close... haven&apos;t seen her in a long time.</string>
<string name="28968">I served as one of Kurth&apos;s soldiers... from before this whole thing started. There aren&apos;t many of us left... most of his army is made up of... of monsters and demons now.</string>
<string name="28969">Not too much. This whole place used to belong to some wizard, I think. The wizard has some portal that he could bring demons and such through... and Kurth wanted it.</string>
<string name="28970">Don&apos;t you worry about me. I... I think I know a way out of here. Just... thank you for your kindness. I hope Kurth gets what he deserves!</string>
<string name="28971">What kind of reward?</string>
<string name="28972">What reward you mean?</string>
<string name="28973">Kurth made me the same offer, actually.</string>
<string name="28974">Kurth gaves same offer, too.</string>
<string name="28975">Kurth is already dead, actually.</string>
<string name="28976">Kurth dead, already.</string>
<string name="28977">Hah! I&apos;ve no interest in working for you.</string>
<string name="28978">Me haves no interest in working for you.</string>
<string name="28979">I want to ask you some questions, first.</string>
<string name="28980">Me wants to ask questions, first.</string>
<string name="28981">What about Londa&apos;s children? Do you have them?</string>
<string name="28982">You haves Londa&apos;s kids?</string>
<string name="28983">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps. I want more gold, however.</string>
<string name="28984">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe. Me wants more gold.</string>

<string name="28999">I want to ask you some questions.</string>

<string name="29001">I suppose I&apos;ll have to kill you.</string>
<string name="29002">Me have to kill you, me guessing.</string>

<string name="29045">Me wants to talk &apos;bout something else.</string>
<string name="29046">Why would Luskan need a war leader?</string>
<string name="29047">Why Luskan needs war leader?</string>
<string name="29048">Not yet, no.</string>
<string name="29049">No news yet, no.</string>
<string name="29050">I do. Kurth is dead.</string>
<string name="29051">Yup. Kurth dead, now.</string>

<string name="29058">1500 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="29059">2000 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="29060">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; 2500 gold pieces.</string>

<string name="29072">What of Londa&apos;s kids? You haves them?</string>
<string name="29073">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think I deserve a larger reward, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="29074">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me thinks me deserves bigger reward.</string>
<string name="29075">That&apos;s it? We&apos;re done?</string>
<string name="29076">That it? We all done?</string>
<string name="29077">Good. Time to kill you, now.</string>
<string name="29078">Is good. You dies, now.</string>
<string name="29079">Fine. But this isn&apos;t over.</string>
<string name="29080">This not over!</string>
<string name="29081">I killed one High Captain, Baram... I can just as easily kill another.</string>
<string name="29082">Me kills one High Captain... easy to kills two.</string>
<string name="29083">What do I care? I have other plans.</string>
<string name="29084">Me not care. Gots other stuff to do.</string>
<string name="29085">That&apos;s horrible! You&apos;ll never get away with this!</string>
<string name="29086">That horrid! You nots get away with it!</string>
<string name="29087">It&apos;s good that ye&apos;ve decided t&apos; speak with me. Me name be Baram, the one an&apos; only true High Captain of Luskan. Ye&apos;ll have t&apos; excuse me fer speaking to ye through an illusion... the way ye&apos;ve cut through me men, one can&apos;t be too careful.</string>
<string name="29088">Ye&apos;re good, I&apos;ll grant ye that. As a matter o&apos; fact, ye&apos;re good enough that I&apos;d be willing t&apos; offer ye a sweet l&apos;il reward should ye care to take care of Kurth for me... that *other* High Captain.</string>
<string name="29089">Ach, &apos;tis a shame. Ye come back an&apos; speak t&apos; me if ye change yer mind, aye?</string>
<string name="29090">Ah-ha! So ye are interested, after all. That be good t&apos; know. Well, now... what would make fer a fair offer? 1000 gold pieces an&apos; some items of magical power, t&apos; boot?</string>
<string name="29091">I&apos;d be more than willing to give you that if ye could actually rid me of that pest, Kurth, an&apos; bring me his head. What do ye say to that?</string>
<string name="29092">I dinna like questions. Especially when they comes from people who dinna work fer me. I made ye an offer... do ye want it or nay?</string>
<string name="29093">The very possibility fills me with glee, I must admit. Ye&apos;ll have t&apos; pardon me if I&apos;m a wee bit skeptical on that, though. News o&apos; Kurth&apos;s death has preceded him more &apos;n once.</string>
<string name="29094">Now... if ye had his actual head. That&apos;d be proof I could accept. There be only one mug like his, after all.</string>
<string name="29095">What?! By Mask&apos;s damnable arse, that musclebound pig has to die! Bah! So why did ye speak t&apos; me? What do ye plan t&apos; do?</string>
<string name="29096">Eh? Who are ye... ahhhh, the brats from the Whitesnow manor, aye? Yes... I has them. Why do ye ask?</string>
<string name="29097">Hmmm... aye, aye I can do that. If ye really care about them brats, I&apos;ll release &apos;em to ye once ye bring me Kurth&apos;s head. If ye&apos;re interested in me offer, that is... </string>
<string name="29098">Why would ye even care? Bah. What about me original offer, then... Kurth&apos;s head in exchange for yer reward, aye?</string>
<string name="29099">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Aye, I figured you&apos;d be askin&apos;. All right, then, &lt;lad/lass&gt;... 1250 gold pieces fer Kurth&apos;s head. How about that?</string>
<string name="29100">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; More gold? Can you even perform the task, you think? Kurth is no easy target, after all. No, I think the 1000 gold pieces shall be fine. Are you interested or no?</string>
<string name="29101">Ye&apos;re speaking of the bloody Host Tower o&apos; the Arcane, ain&apos;t ye?</string>
<string name="29102">One could ask why someone like ye&apos;d be interested in goin&apos; into that bloody place. Would them wizards want to know, ye think? Heh heh... no worries, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, I&apos;ve no reason to speak to &apos;em.</string>
<string name="29103">Just in case they don&apos;t like whatever yer interest is, however, I don&apos;t think I can provide me own pass to ye. Why don&apos;t ye take Kurth&apos;s, then, instead? He has one... an&apos; without his head, he&apos;ll not need it.</string>
<string name="29104">And before ye get it in yer head to come any further into me base, I&apos;d advise ye not to. If ye comes through this door, I&apos;ll be thinkin&apos; yer out to no good... an&apos; treat ye as such.</string>
<string name="29105">Is that so, aye? Well, then... come through yon door, there, an&apos; we&apos;ll see what ye&apos;re truly made of.</string>
<string name="29106">Heh heh... ye want t&apos; ask me questions, do ye? I might answer a few, if ye weren&apos;t working for the pig. So what&apos;ll it be, aye?</string>
<string name="29107">Pfft. That be it? Well, I could not care less, then. Kurth &apos;as wasted his coin on ye, it seems.</string>
<string name="29108">Run along, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, if ye has a brain in yer head. Come through this door an&apos; into me base an&apos; ye&apos;ll be sorry... that much ye can be sure of.</string>
<string name="29109">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ooooh, this be good! All right, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, ye&apos;ve got me interest piqued. What is the pig paying ye?</string>
<string name="29110">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Bah! I&apos;m not about t&apos; start playin&apos; *that* game!</string>
<string name="29111">O-ho, just toyin&apos; with me, were ye? Ye think ye&apos;re so smart?</string>
<string name="29112">Heh heh... that be it, aye? I can do far better for ye. 1500 gold pieces... plus a few magic items thrown in. If ye bring me Kurth&apos;s head on a platter. How does &apos;at strike ye?</string>
<string name="29113">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Aye? Heh heh... he be more desperate then I thought. All right, then, &lt;lad/lass&gt;... 2000 gold pieces an&apos; some magic items thrown in, all fer Kurth&apos;s head. How does &apos;at strike ye?</string>
<string name="29114">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Heh heh... ye take me fer a fool, do ye? I&apos;ll give ye yer 1500 gold pieces, sure enough, an&apos; some magic items thrown in... if ye gets me Kurth&apos;s head. How does &apos;at strike ye?</string>
<string name="29115">One could ask why someone like ye&apos;d be interested in goin&apos; into that bloody place. Would them wizards want to know, ye think? Heh heh... no worries, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, I&apos;ve no reason to speak to &apos;em.</string>
<string name="29116">Just in case they don&apos;t like whatever yer interest is, however, I don&apos;t think I can provide me own pass to ye. Why don&apos;t ye take Kurth&apos;s, then, instead? He has one... an&apos; without his head, he&apos;ll not need it.</string>
<string name="29117">Ye&apos;re speaking of the bloody Host Tower o&apos; the Arcane, ain&apos;t ye?</string>
<string name="29118">Eh? Who are ye... ahhhh, the brats from the Whitesnow manor, aye? Yes... I has them. Why do ye ask?</string>
<string name="29119">Hmmm... aye, aye I can do that. If ye really care about them brats, I&apos;ll release &apos;em to ye once ye bring me Kurth&apos;s head. If ye&apos;re interested in me offer, that is... </string>
<string name="29120">Why would ye even care? Bah. What about me original offer, then... Kurth&apos;s head in exchange for yer reward, aye?</string>
<string name="29121">Aye, now, that sounds just grand, it does! I&apos;ll be looking forward t&apos; spitting on that thug&apos;s head, I will.</string>
<string name="29122">Now... do ye wish to run off an&apos; do the deed now, or do ye have somethin&apos; else fer me?</string>
<string name="29123">Ye&apos;re speaking of the bloody Host Tower o&apos; the Arcane, ain&apos;t ye?</string>
<string name="29124">Now why would you want to get into there? I suppose it&apos;s no concern of mine... if you wish to kill yourself, it&apos;s your business.</string>
<string name="29125">Just in case they don&apos;t like whatever yer interest is, however, I don&apos;t think I can provide me own pass to ye. Why don&apos;t ye take Kurth&apos;s, then, instead? He has one... an&apos; without his head, he&apos;ll not need it.</string>
<string name="29126">Eh? Who are ye... ahhhh, the brats from the Whitesnow manor, aye? Yes... I has them. Why do ye ask?</string>
<string name="29127">Hmmm... aye, aye I can do that. If ye really care about them brats, I&apos;ll release &apos;em to ye once ye bring me Kurth&apos;s head, no sooner.</string>
<string name="29128">Why would ye even care? I certainly don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="29129">Aye! Ha ha! Bring me that pig&apos;s head! I canna wait t&apos; laugh at it good an&apos; hard, ha ha!</string>
<string name="29130">Aye? Well, &apos;tis a shame. Should ye change yer mind, come an&apos; talk to me again.</string>
<string name="29131">Aye? Well... I be not so fond o&apos; questions, but ye can ask.</string>
<string name="29132">Aye, suit yerself.</string>
<string name="29133">Why do ye need t&apos; know? Hah! It be no small matter, ye know. I infected myself with lycanthropy so I could get this far, so I could get the prize we&apos;ve all been seeking!</string>
<string name="29134">The High Captain that lives t&apos; the last will be the one that becomes Luskan&apos;s war leader! An&apos; that&apos;s t&apos; be me... no doubts about it.</string>
<string name="29135">Heh heh... that be for me t&apos; know, an&apos; for everyone else t&apos; find out. When it&apos;s time.</string>
<string name="29136">Aye, a bit. Them bloody wizards have been killin&apos; each other, just like we have in the city. I think they be finally done... not sure, o&apos; course, as it could always start up again.</string>
<string name="29137">They got themselves a new Archmage Arcane, fer the moment. Maugrim be his name. Bloody cheerless fellow, if ye ask me. All &apos;e thinks about is Neverwinter an&apos; how he wants t&apos; destroy it. Don&apos;t know why.</string>
<string name="29138">Well, the bloody pig has gone an&apos; walled himself up in the West Harbor with all &apos;is men... everyone knows that. Coward, he is.</string>
<string name="29139">There be an entrance, however, in the wall right next to &apos;is old tower. That&apos;s where his men come an&apos; go from, anyhow. A dangerous path, though, an&apos; well-guarded.</string>
<string name="29140">Pfeh. Kurth be all about brawn, mostly. His Bloody Hands be nothin&apos; but brute fighters, an&apos; that be all he believes in.</string>
<string name="29141">I hear he&apos;s gone an&apos; allied himself with them priestesses of Auril, the cruel ice goddess. Not like &apos;im at all... he must be getting desperate. Heh heh, all the better, methinks.</string>
<string name="29142">I don&apos;t know where he puts &apos;is men, or how many he has. Ye&apos;ll have to discover that for yerself.</string>
<string name="29143">So ye&apos;ve come back, have ye? Changed yer mind about me offer?</string>
<string name="29144">But let me tell ye this: if ye tries t&apos; come into me base any further, I&apos;ll consider it a double-cross an&apos; treat ye as such, aye? I&apos;ll be watching ye... </string>
<string name="29145">I have a feelin&apos; that it be my lucky day. How about it? Have ye good news?</string>
<string name="29146">Ach, well, I s&apos;pose I shouldn&apos;t be so impatient. I be so lookin&apos; forward t&apos; pissin&apos; on that brute&apos;s stinkin&apos; head, though.</string>
<string name="29147">Well, that be the kind o&apos; news I like t&apos; hear!</string>
<string name="29148">I suppose I should not be so quick t&apos; believe it. People have a way, lately, of surviving the loss o&apos; their heads. Strange business, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="29149">Aye, I thought as much. Ye&apos;ve been playing me all along, haven&apos;t ye? Don&apos;t think I haven&apos;t noticed.</string>
<string name="29150">Do as ye like, then. Know this, however: ye take one step past this door an&apos; ye&apos;ll be dead before ye know it.</string>
<string name="29151">What were ye e&apos;en doing talkin&apos; to him?! Ye were supposed t&apos; be killin&apos; him, as I recalls! Bah! Why did ye e&apos;en come back, then?</string>
<string name="29152">Ye&apos;ve made a sorry mistake, ye little guttersnipe! Take a step beyond the door an&apos; we&apos;ll see just what yer made of!</string>
<string name="29153">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ye&apos;re walkin&apos; on me last nerve, ye are. Bah! What is the pig paying ye now?</string>
<string name="29154">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Ye think I&apos;ll be hagglin&apos; fer yer services like some fishwife at the bloody market? Hah!</string>
<string name="29155">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Aye, then. 3000 gold pieces is my offer. Not another word about yer reward, tho... if ye e&apos;en think about double-crossin&apos; me again, I&apos;ll have ye split open from end to end.</string>
<string name="29156">Now, then... fer that kind o&apos; coin, I expect prompt service. Go an&apos; fetch me the pig&apos;s head!</string>

<string name="29408">That&apos;s rough, but I&apos;m not really interested in getting my throat slit by a gang of thugs. Goodbye.</string>

<string name="29413">Me too busy for rescue. You find someone else.</string>
<string name="29414">Oh, I didn&apos;t see you there. You startled me.</string>
<string name="29415">I bid you farewell my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="29416">Good &lt;quarterday&gt; to you.</string>
<string name="29417">As you wish.</string>
<string name="29418">Oh, you are so sweet. My name is Jaheel. And what do they call a handsome &lt;lad/lass&gt; such as yourself?</string>
<string name="29419">Thank you for your concern, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. My name is Jaheel. What is your name?</string>
<string name="29420">You seem like a very lonely person. My name is Jaheel. What is your name?</string>
<string name="29421">A fitting name for one as fascinating as you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. (sigh) I only wish my mind could dwell on more pleasant conversation. Is there something I can help you with?</string>
<string name="29422">Thank you &lt;FirstName&gt;. I only wish I could give you all of my attention. My mind is focused on darker thoughts. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="29423">A man of mystery. While I love an intrigue, today is just too bleak a moment in my life to give you proper attention. Can I help you?</string>
<string name="29424">I could think of nothing more pleasant than to while away a day chatting with you... if only it was not such a terrible day.</string>
<string name="29425">I guess I could, although my mind is occupied with worry about this terrible day.</string>
<string name="29426">On this dark day I&apos;m not sure I can answer any questions coherently, but I will try.</string>
<string name="29427">I wish I could help you, kind &lt;man/woman&gt;, but my mind is overwrought and it is very difficult for me to focus on anything other than my own troubles.</string>
<string name="29428">Oh dear. When I saw you, I thought maybe this is the &lt;man/woman&gt; to save me from this terrbile day! I am so distraught, I couldn&apos;t possibly think clearly enough to give you directions.</string>
<string name="29429">It is so horrible. I was supposed to bring my little brother Neva into town to buy him a birthday present for his tenth birthday. He was so excited he kept running ahead of me.</string>
<string name="29430">Oh my, but you are a brave, powerful adventurer aren&apos;t you! If you want a job, maybe you could help me?</string>
<string name="29431">My poor, blunt, slightly dense friend, I guess I could tell you.</string>
<string name="29432">I imagine it is because he had his birthday money in his purse. He had 10 gold pieces to spend for his birthday. That is a lot, so the bandits probably figured he was from a wealthy home and they want to ransom him.</string>
<string name="29433">Yes. I quietly followed them to some standing stones in the hills just outside of Charwood. I thought for sure they would catch me, but I was lucky.</string>
<string name="29434">I have 300 gold, which I would reward anyone who could save my baby brother.</string>
<string name="29435">Oh, my poor brother. (sigh) I did think that maybe you would prove to be my hero. I guess I will have to find one who truly has a brave spirit.</string>
<string name="29436">Go away if you will not even try.</string>
<string name="29437">My hero! Thank you so much for being brave. I must admit, that if you are able to rescue my baby brother, there are rewards besides gold that I would be willing to discuss.</string>
<string name="29438">I know Neva is being held at a bandit camp near some standing stones just outside of Charwood, but I have no idea how many people are holding him or what exactly to expect.</string>
<string name="29439"></string>
<string name="29440">Please hurry. Bring him back to me safely.</string>
<string name="29441">Well met, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Have you had any progress? Have you found Neva yet?</string>
<string name="29442">Hello, are you with &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;?</string>
<string name="29443">Thank you so much, my bravest. I shall pray for your swift and safe return.</string>
<string name="29444">Bless you brave one. I shall pray for your swift and safe return.</string>
<string name="29445">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Obviously I have hired the right &lt;man/woman&gt; for the job. You should be well prepared with 100 gold to assist you.</string>
<string name="29446">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; How mercenary of you! I will give you the reward I have promised when you return with my brother. Now go be a hero!</string>
<string name="29447">I can&apos;t believe how commanding you are. I hope we can discuss that later, but for now I will give you 100 gold.</string>
<string name="29448">Please find him quickly. I enjoy speaking with you, but I could be much friendlier if I wasn&apos;t so worried about Neva.</string>
<string name="29449">Neva might be dead soon! Please hurry, if only so that you can claim your reward.</string>
<string name="29450">I notice you don&apos;t have the ring that I gave you. I certainly hope you didn&apos;t lose it... Neva might fear to join you if he thinks it is a trap.</string>
<string name="29451">I am glad you still have the ring I gave you. Be brave my hero!</string>
<string name="29452">It is in the hills just outside of Charwood. If you search carefully you should find it.</string>
<string name="29453">I see that &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; has turned Neva&apos;s ring over to you. Are you the hero helping me now? What can I help you with?</string>
<string name="29454">I guess my brother could use all the help he can get. How can I assist you?</string>
<string name="29455">He is at a bandit camp near some standing stones in the hills just outside of Charwood.</string>
<string name="29456">Please be quick my hero. I will pray for you.</string>
<string name="29457">But Neva could be dead soon. I hope you will hurry, if only to claim your reward.</string>
<string name="29458">I&apos;m sorry, but I really must be leaving. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="29459">I&apos;m sorry. I just thought you might have been asked to help me.</string>
<string name="29460">I guess more help is better than less. </string>
<string name="29461">Thank you so much for offering, kind &lt;man/woman&gt;, but &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; has already agreed to help me. </string>
<string name="29462">Of course if you were the one to rescue Neva, then you would be the one to claim the reward. I would also like to add that gold is not the only reward I might offer a brave man like you.</string>
<string name="29463">I must go now. Please hurry, my brother&apos;s life is dear to me.</string>
<string name="29464">You are back so soon? Have you found my little brother?</string>
<string name="29465">I have no desire to speak with you. Leave me.</string>
<string name="29466">He ran over a hill, when all of a sudden I heard him scream. I ran as fast as I could to the top of the hill, but as I got close, I could hear men&apos;s voices. </string>
<string name="29467">I dropped to the ground and peeked over the crest of the hill. Neva was surrounded by a group of thugs. They picked him up and carried him off, laughing to themselves.</string>
<string name="29468">I simply don&apos;t know who to turn to. The guards are busy with their own troubles and I need someone who can rescue him quickly.</string>
<string name="29469">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Who&apos;s &quot;they?&quot;</string>
<string name="29470">Don&apos;t waste my time.</string>
<string name="29471">What do you wish, exactly?</string>
<string name="29472">I don&apos;t know about &apos;hero...&apos;</string>
<string name="29473">What you wants?</string>
<string name="29474">Me no big hero...</string>
<string name="29475">Outta me way!</string>
<string name="29476">That&apos;s very nice of you... thank you.</string>
<string name="29477">No, keep it. I don&apos;t need it.</string>
<string name="29478">It very nice of you. Me thanks you.</string>
<string name="29479">You keep ring. Me not needs it.</string>
<string name="29480">Very well. Thank you.</string>
<string name="29481">Can&apos;t you take no for an answer?</string>
<string name="29482">Okay. Me thanks you.</string>
<string name="29483">Back off - me say no.</string>
<string name="29484">Give me one good reason not to look into the cult... </string>
<string name="29485">Who says I&apos;m looking into cult business, anyway?</string>
<string name="29486">I think you&apos;d better mind your own business... </string>
<string name="29487">Are you part of the cult? What do you know about them?!</string>
<string name="29488">Yuh? Gimme a reason not to look into cult, den... </string>
<string name="29489">Uh, me no int&apos;rested in cult bus&apos;ness, yuh?</string>
<string name="29490">Me think you better mind yer own bus&apos;ness, yuh?</string>
<string name="29491">Thanks for the advice. I&apos;ll keep it in mind... </string>
<string name="29492">Yuh, thanks for advice. Me keep it in mind... </string>
<string name="29493">I am &lt;FirstName&gt;. Why do you ask?</string>
<string name="29494">Me &lt;FirstName&gt;. Why you want knowing?</string>
<string name="29495">Is there a point to this?</string>
<string name="29496">There be point to this, maybes?</string>
<string name="29497">Yes, that&apos;s me.</string>
<string name="29498">Yeah, that me.</string>
<string name="29499">Just what is it you want, exactly?</string>
<string name="29500">Just what you wants?!</string>
<string name="29501">So far as I know, there is only one &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="29502">Me thinks me is only &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="29503">I&apos;ve told you who I am. Now, stop with these questions.</string>
<string name="29504">Me says name already. You stop ask question so much.</string>
<string name="29505">It was a group effort, but yes, I was involved.</string>
<string name="29506">Me not is only person, but yeah, me helps save day.</string>
<string name="29507">Why does it feel like you&apos;re prying into my personal matters?</string>
<string name="29508">Me wonders why you thinks this is your business.</string>
<string name="29509">That&apos;s what I&apos;ve heard. I don&apos;t know many details.</string>
<string name="29510">Me not know all story, but me hears that, yes.</string>
<string name="29511">Look, is there a point to all of these questions?</string>
<string name="29512">Me wonders where this going. So many question.</string>
<string name="29513">Yes, Aribeth de Tylmarande. I am working for her.</string>
<string name="29514">Me works for Aribeth. She is nice paladin lady.</string>
<string name="29515">I don&apos;t feel comfortable answering a question like that.</string>
<string name="29516">Me doesn&apos;t like that question. Me not answers.</string>
<string name="29517">This seems to be an excessive amount of questions, doesn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="29518">Why me gets asked this many question? You write book?</string>
<string name="29519">I&apos;m sorry, but you&apos;ve asked entirely too many questions. I cannot answer further.</string>
<string name="29520">Me can&apos;t answer this many question!</string>
<string name="29521">Whoa, they told me you were ugly but... Ah, no matter. You&apos;re the hero of Neverwinter, I suspect.</string>
<string name="29522">They said you was plain-looking all right, but you&apos;re the hero of Neverwinter, that much is sure.</string>
<string name="29523">Wow, they told me you had a fine face but... gosh, you&apos;re the hero of Neverwinter, that much is sure.</string>
<string name="29524">What?...uh, the folks around the inn, that&apos;s all I meant.</string>
<string name="29525">I&apos;m sorry, I... just wanted to make sure it was really you. I want to thank you. I&apos;ve family in Neverwinter, and you saved their lives when you cured the plague. I wanted to give you this ring as a token of my gratitude.</string>
<string name="29526">Hmm, guess heroes don&apos;t have to be bright, do they... </string>
<string name="29527">I don&apos;t know if it is magical, but it&apos;s always brought me luck. I hope it brings you luck, too. Thank you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;... and farewell!</string>
<string name="29528">But, uh... it is a very nice ring! Please take it! That&apos;s why I wanted to find you, after all, to give it to you for all you&apos;ve done!</string>
<string name="29529">Very well, I guess you&apos;re not as much of a hero as I had thought. How rude!</string>
<string name="29530">I beg to differ - you saved an entire city from a certain and horrible demise. Surely such a person deserves consideration as a hero.</string>
<string name="29531">Hey ugly, I think you&apos;d better stop looking into this cult business... </string>
<string name="29532">Look, I think you&apos;d better stop looking into this cult business... </string>
<string name="29533">Hey friend, I think you&apos;d better stop looking into this cult business... </string>
<string name="29534">All I know is that you&apos;re in way over your head, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Consider yourself warned, &apos;hero&apos;!</string>
<string name="29535">You saved Neverwinter, you&apos;re the big hero, everybody loves you. Why gamble all of that away? The odds aren&apos;t in your favor, anyway.</string>
<string name="29536"></string>
<string name="29537">Don&apos;t be a fool! You&apos;ve been nosing around, asking questions. The entire North knows what you&apos;re up to by now.</string>
<string name="29538">You do that. Ignore my advice and suffer the consequences. Consider this your fair warning, &apos;hero&apos;!</string>
<string name="29539">Oh, it&apos;s very much my business, actually. We won&apos;t tolerate your interference any further. Consider this your fair warning, &apos;hero&apos;!</string>
<string name="29540">I warned you but you just wouldn&apos;t listen.</string>
<string name="29541">Err... well, I suppose I should know for sure that you are who I think you are. I don&apos;t want to make a mistake, after all.</string>
<string name="29542">Really! You are actually &lt;FullName&gt;, then, yes?</string>
<string name="29543">So... you are the &lt;FullName&gt; from Neverwinter, yes? The hero who saved the city? You do look the part, but I must be sure!</string>
<string name="29544">Did you cure the plague? I mean, were you one of the ones rounding up the reagents and everything?</string>
<string name="29545">Is it true that there was a cult behind the plague, then? That this cult had fabricated it?</string>
<string name="29546">Isn&apos;t that awful? Who would ever do such a thing? I suppose you&apos;re here looking for those cultists, then? With that paladin of Lord Nasher&apos;s?</string>
<string name="29547">What about Aarin Gend, the spymaster? Is he trying to coordinate the search with Aribeth for whomever unleashed the plague? What do you know so far?</string>
<string name="29548">I&apos;ll be seeing you.</string>
<string name="29549">You don&apos;t seem stunned at all. What is your name?</string>
<string name="29550">Why thank you, kind sir. Mind if I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="29551">Well, thank you. Why don&apos;t you tell me your name?</string>
<string name="29552">Thanks for the compliment. Could you answer some questions?</string>
<string name="29553">You expect me to buy that line? What&apos;s your name?</string>
<string name="29554">Yeah, whatever. I have a question.</string>
<string name="29555">You be nice! Tell me you name?</string>
<string name="29556">That nice. Me have questions.</string>
<string name="29557">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="29558">They call me &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="29559">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. But please just call me &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is a pleasure to meet you Tarran.</string>
<string name="29560">My name isn&apos;t important right now.</string>
<string name="29561">Me is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="29562">Me called &lt;FullName&gt;. But you call me &lt;FirstName&gt;. I glad meet you.</string>
<string name="29563">You no ask name. You not need know.</string>
<string name="29564">What&apos;s so terrible about today?</string>
<string name="29565">I wish I could help you, but I am in need of a job. Do you know of anything?</string>
<string name="29566">Have you heard anything about the cultists who started the plague in Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="29567">I&apos;d love to hear about your troubles, but just now I need some directions.</string>
<string name="29568">You tell me &apos;bout cult who start plague?</string>
<string name="29569">Me need good job.</string>
<string name="29570">You no whine! You help me find stuff.</string>
<string name="29571">Oh mister, why so sad?</string>
<string name="29572">I am sorry your day is so dark. Might I ask for your name?</string>
<string name="29573">Who you?</string>
<string name="29574">What dark subjects are those?</string>
<string name="29575">Why do you think the bandits took him captive?</string>
<string name="29576">Do you know where the bandits took him?</string>
<string name="29577">Are you offering a reward for his rescue?</string>
<string name="29578">I would love to rescue him for you.</string>
<string name="29579">That&apos;s rough, but I&apos;m not really interested in getting my throat slit by a gang of thugs. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="29580">Why bad guys keep brother?</string>
<string name="29581">Where they take brother?</string>
<string name="29582">You pay for rescue maybe?</string>
<string name="29583">Me tough guy, me rescue brother!</string>
<string name="29584">Me too busy for rescue. You find someone else.</string>
<string name="29585">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you think I might be able to get an advance on that reward? To help me buy supplies for a rescue?</string>
<string name="29586">I&apos;ll do it, but words don&apos;t have any value. I want some gold up front to prove you have any. Now!</string>
<string name="29587">I will do my best.</string>
<string name="29588">Neva is as good as rescued. Do not worry good man.</string>
<string name="29589">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me need gold first, please.</string>
<string name="29590">Me no think you have reward. You pay some now to show.</string>
<string name="29591">Me go try best.</string>
<string name="29592">Neva be safe soon. Me get him.</string>
<string name="29593">I can&apos;t remember where you said that bandit camp was.</string>
<string name="29594">Not yet, but I&apos;m working on it.</string>
<string name="29595">Don&apos;t rush me. I&apos;ll save him eventually.</string>
<string name="29596">Me forget where Ninvi... er... Nivi... where brother be.</string>
<string name="29597">No, but me working on it.</string>
<string name="29598">Me do soon, or maybe later.</string>
<string name="29599">Tell me where he can be found.</string>
<string name="29600">You tell me where he be.</string>
<string name="29601">Not yet, but I&apos;m working on it.</string>
<string name="29602">Just be patient. I&apos;ll get to it in good time.</string>
<string name="29603">No, but me working on it.</string>
<string name="29604">Me do soon, or maybe not.</string>
<string name="29605">No I am not with &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="29606">Yes, I&apos;m with &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="29607">Me not with &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="29608">Yep - me with &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="29609">Why don&apos;t you tell me about your troubles, so that I can assist you.</string>
<string name="29610">Me help, if you tell what me do.</string>
<string name="29611">Why do you think the bandits took him captive?</string>
<string name="29612">Do you know where the bandits took him?</string>
<string name="29613">Are you offering a reward for his rescue?</string>
<string name="29614">I would love to rescue him for you.</string>
<string name="29615">That&apos;s rough, but I&apos;m not really interested in getting my throat slit by a gang of thugs. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="29616">Why bad guys keep brother?</string>
<string name="29617">Where they take brother?</string>
<string name="29618">You pay for rescue maybe?</string>
<string name="29619">Me tough guy, me rescue brother!</string>
<string name="29620">Me too busy for rescue. You find someone else.</string>
<string name="29621">Oh, hello my lady. Your smile stunned me for a second.</string>
<string name="29622">I bid you farewell my lady.</string>
<string name="29623">Good &lt;quarterday&gt; to you.</string>
<string name="29624">As you wish.</string>
<string name="29625">My name is Tarran and it is a distinct pleasure to meet you, my lady. What may I call you?</string>
<string name="29626">It would be my pleasure. My name is Tarran. And what do they call you, besides perfect?</string>
<string name="29627">You seem like a very lonely person. My name is Tarran. What is your name?</string>
<string name="29628">A beautiful name for a beautiful woman. I only wish I could fully appreciate such beauty on a terrible day like today.</string>
<string name="29629">Thank you &lt;FirstName&gt;. I only wish I could give you all of my attention. My mind is focused on darker thoughts. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="29630">A &lt;lord/lady&gt; of mystery. While I love an intrigue, today is just too bleak a moment in my life to give you proper attention. Can I help you?</string>
<string name="29631">I could think of nothing more pleasant than to gaze into your eyes and converse for hours, if only it was not such a terrible day.</string>
<string name="29632">I guess I could, although my mind is occupied with worry about this terrible day.</string>
<string name="29633">On this dark day I&apos;m not sure I can answer any questions coherently, but I will try.</string>
<string name="29634">I know little of that, and my mind dwells on other dark subjects. I can answer you no better I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="29635">My dear &lt;lord/lady&gt;. While my mind is plagued with the troubles this day has brought, I am afraid my directions would be completely incoherent.</string>
<string name="29636">I am ashamed. I was supposed to bring my little brother Neva into town to buy him a birthday present for his tenth birthday. He was so excited he kept running ahead of me.</string>
<string name="29637">I take it that you are an adventurer? Perhaps I could employ you to assist me with a serious problem?</string>
<string name="29638">I will tell you, though I fear you may not understand.</string>
<string name="29639">I imagine it is because he had his birthday money in his purse. He had 10 gold pieces to spend for his birthday. That is a lot, so the bandits probably figured he was from a wealthy home and they want to ransom him.</string>
<string name="29640">Yes. I quietly followed them to a camp near some standing stones in the hills just outside of Charwood. I would have gone in myself, except for this wounded hand. </string>
<string name="29641">I have 300 gold, which I would reward anyone who could save my baby brother.</string>
<string name="29642">Oh, my poor brother. (sigh) I did think that maybe you would help me out. I guess I will have to find one who truly has a brave spirit.</string>
<string name="29643">Go away if you will not even try.</string>
<string name="29644">Your beauty is outshone only by your bravery. I must admit, that if you are able to rescue my baby brother, there are rewards besides gold that I would be willing to discuss.</string>
<string name="29645">I know Neva is being held at a bandit camp near some standing stones just outside of Charwood, but I have no idea how many people are holding him or what exactly to expect.</string>
<string name="29646">Here. This ring will show Neva that I sent you. Please take care of it.</string>
<string name="29647">Please hurry. Bring him back to me safely.</string>
<string name="29648">Well met, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Have you had any progress? Have you found Neva yet?</string>
<string name="29649">Hello, are you with &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;?</string>
<string name="29650">Thank you so much, my bravest. I shall pray for your swift and safe return.</string>
<string name="29651">Bless you brave one. I shall pray for your swift and safe return.</string>
<string name="29652">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Obviously I have hired the right &lt;man/woman&gt; for the job. You should be well prepared with 100 gold to assist you.</string>
<string name="29653">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; How mercenary of you! I will give you the reward I have promised when you return with my brother. Now go save my brother!</string>
<string name="29654">I can&apos;t believe how commanding you are. I hope we can discuss that later, but for now I will give you 100 gold.</string>
<string name="29655">Please find him quickly. I enjoy speaking with you, but I could be much friendlier if I wasn&apos;t so worried about Neva.</string>
<string name="29656">Neva might be dead soon! Please hurry, if only so that you can claim your reward.</string>
<string name="29657">I notice you don&apos;t have the ring that I gave you. I certainly hope you didn&apos;t lose it... Neva might fear to join you if he thinks it is a trap.</string>
<string name="29658">I am glad you still have the ring I gave you. Be brave my hero!</string>
<string name="29659">It is in the hills just outside of Charwood. If you search carefully you should find it.</string>
<string name="29660">I see that &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; has turned Neva&apos;s ring over to you. Are you the person helping me now? What can I help you with?</string>
<string name="29661">I guess my brother could use all the help he can get. How can I assist you?</string>
<string name="29662">He is in a bandit camp near some standing stones in the hills just outside of Charwood.</string>
<string name="29663">Please be quick my hero. I will pray for you.</string>
<string name="29664">But Neva could be dead soon. I hope you will hurry, if only to claim your reward.</string>
<string name="29665">I&apos;m sorry, but I really must be leaving. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="29666">I&apos;m sorry. I just thought he must have asked you to help me.</string>
<string name="29667">I guess more help is better than less. </string>
<string name="29668">Thank you so much for offering, kind &lt;lord/lady&gt;, but &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; has already agreed to help me. </string>
<string name="29669">Of course if you were the one to rescue Neva, then you would be the one to claim the reward. I would also like to add that gold is not the only reward I might offer a brave &lt;man/woman&gt; like you.</string>
<string name="29670">You must go now. Please hurry, my brother&apos;s life is dear to me.</string>
<string name="29671">You are back so soon? Have you found my little brother?</string>
<string name="29672">I have no desire to speak with you. Leave me.</string>
<string name="29673">He ran over a hill, when all of a sudden I heard him scream. I ran as fast as I could to the top of the hill, but as I got close, I could hear men&apos;s voices. </string>
<string name="29674">Being alone, I dropped to the ground and peeked over the crest of the hill. Neva was surrounded by a group of thugs. They picked him up and carried him off, laughing to themselves.</string>
<string name="29675">I would try to rescue him myself, but I wounded my hand last year and am unable to hold a sword properly. The guards are busy with their own troubles and I need someone who can rescue him quickly.</string>
<string name="29676">Master Maugrim don&apos;t like meddlers... But Vardoc take care of dat.</string>
<string name="29677">Nothing. I&apos;m good.</string>
<string name="29678">Nuttin&apos;. Me good.</string>
<string name="29679">Could you tell me about some of your customers?</string>
<string name="29680">You tell me about da people here, yuh?</string>
<string name="29681">The elf, Elaith.</string>
<string name="29682">The wizard, Wanev.</string>
<string name="29683">The merchant, Alhelor.</string>
<string name="29684">The boy, Ander.</string>
<string name="29685">The adventurer, Albie.</string>
<string name="29686">The adventurer, Darktongue.</string>
<string name="29687">The adventurer, Peren.</string>
<string name="29688">Dat elf, Elaith.</string>
<string name="29689">Dat wizard, Wanev.</string>
<string name="29690">Dat merchant, Al-hello.</string>
<string name="29691">Dat boy, Ander.</string>

<string name="29693">Dat monster-basher, Darktongue.</string>
<string name="29694">Dat monster-basher, Peren.</string>
<string name="29695">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="29696">Uh, me forget.</string>
<string name="29697">Could I have an ale?</string>
<string name="29698">Me get ale, yuh?</string>
<string name="29699">I&apos;ve got another drink order.</string>
<string name="29700">There ya go.</string>
<string name="29701">What would you like?</string>
<string name="29702">I know you&apos;re good, honey. I was just thinking you might be thirsty.</string>
<string name="29703">All right, but no loiterin&apos;.</string>
<string name="29704">Our regulars are made-up of Elaith, Wanev, Alhelor, Ander, Albie, Darktongue, and Peren. Alhelor&apos;s a merchant, Wanev&apos;s a wizard, and Ander&apos;s just a boy. The rest think of themselves as adventurers. &apos;Cept Elaith. He&apos;s just an elf.</string>
<string name="29705">Sure thing, hon. Anything else?</string>
<string name="29706">If you say so. Anything else?</string>
<string name="29707">He&apos;s a dangerous-looking one, ain&apos;t he. Not mean, though - Just protective of that little girl of his. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29708">Yeah, looks like he&apos;s left. I wasn&apos;t on duty but one of the girls said there was a commotion, a bit of magic, and he was gone... Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29709">Lecherous old bastard, he is! Keeps staring down my blouse every time I wipe tables. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29710">Aye, he&apos;s gone for the night, thank goodness. Must have found some fool lass to take home with him. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29711">Him? He showed up shortly before Sir Karathis led all those poor boys astray. A bit of a werewolf hunter himself, it seems. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29712">He left a while back, looking tired. Check with Ander, I&apos;m sure he has a better idea where old Alhelor went. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29713">Poor chap, that one. Had all &apos;is friends turned into werewolves and now he hangs about here, helping that Alhelor pawn his wares. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29714">He ain&apos;t here, is he... That&apos;s strange. Ever since the incident, he&apos;s been scared to set foot outside the place. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29715">The little guy? He&apos;s new here, like you. Seems like a nice enough fellow, if a little too smart for his own good sometimes. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29716">He checked out a little while back. He seemed obsessed with the goings-on in Thundertree, so maybe you can find him there. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29717">The dwarf fellow, right? Yeah, he&apos;s new and cheap as a rat-ridden bed! Five ales and counting and not a single tip! Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29718">Hmph. He left without settlin&apos; his account. Said he had some leads in Luskan. Good riddance, I say. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29719">Aye, now there&apos;s a gentleman if ever I knew one. Always a please and thank you, ma&apos;am, and a few extra coins on the table. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29720">He said he was off to see the Wood. Told me he&apos;d be back soon but no word of him. I hope the good fellow&apos;s all right. Anyone else?</string>
<string name="29721">Coming right up... </string>
<string name="29722">I&apos;m afraid we have to cut you off until you&apos;ve sobered up a bit.</string>
<string name="29723">Sorry, you don&apos;t have enough gold on you.</string>
<string name="29724">Sure. Let me tell you who they are, and then you can tell me who you&apos;re curious about. Sound fair, handsome?</string>
<string name="29725">Sure. Let me tell you who they are, and then you can tell me who you want the gossip on. Sound fair?</string>
<string name="29726"></string>
<string name="29727"></string>
<string name="29728"></string>
<string name="29729"></string>
<string name="29730"></string>
<string name="29731"></string>
<string name="29732">We&apos;re playing werewolves!</string>
<string name="29733">Aaaah! It&apos;s Karathis the werewolf!</string>
<string name="29734">My brother says there are criminals and werewolves about but I bet you could give them a whupping.</string>
<string name="29735">Okay, me go now, den.</string>
<string name="29736">Goodbye.</string>

<string name="29742">Who&apos;s Wanev and where does he live?</string>
<string name="29743">What happenin&apos; here in town?</string>
<string name="29744">Kara-dis? Who he?</string>
<string name="29745">Could you answer a few questions for me?</string>
<string name="29746">Does Port Llast have a ranger or druid I could speak with?</string>
<string name="29747">Where can I find an inn?</string>
<string name="29748">Where can I hire on some adventurers?</string>
<string name="29749">Know where I can find a priest?</string>
<string name="29750">Where can I find a store around here for magical or regular supplies?</string>
<string name="29751">So what&apos;s been happening around town lately?</string>
<string name="29752">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; So what&apos;s a girl like you doing in a town like this?</string>
<string name="29753">Thanks, that&apos;s everything.</string>
<string name="29754">Me tree-friend. There other tree-friends here? Ranger and druid?</string>
<string name="29755">Me want place to sleep and drink.</string>
<string name="29756">Me want helpers for adventurin&apos;.</string>
<string name="29757">Me want healer priest.</string>
<string name="29758">Do you get a lot of adventurers in town?</string>
<string name="29759">You gots other adventurers?</string>
<string name="29760">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Who&apos;s Shaldrissa?</string>
<string name="29761">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Who this Shaldrissa you mentioning?</string>
<string name="29762">Could you help me find a few places?</string>
<string name="29763">Me need help find places.</string>
<string name="29764">I&apos;m looking for some people.</string>
<string name="29765">Me look for certain people.</string>
<string name="29766">I have some other questions.</string>
<string name="29767">Me gots other questions.</string>
<string name="29768">He was so handsome, all of us girls were so in love with him! He said he was a werewolf hunter and he took the boys out on a raid.</string>
<string name="29769">My pa&apos;s friend, Haljal, runs the Cracked Anvil between the crossroads and the river. I don&apos;t know much about adventuring stuff but I&apos;m sure he&apos;d have what you need.</string>
<string name="29770">Everything&apos;s been different since Karathis took Urth and the other boys away. Nothing feels safe here anymore.</string>
<string name="29771">Another day, another adventurer. You don&apos;t look as tough as some of them have looked, though.</string>
<string name="29772">Hmn. You definitely don&apos;t look as tough as some of the other adventurers that have come through here. What do you want?</string>
<string name="29773">You, on the other hand, look tougher than any of the adventurers that have been through here so far. Or at least nicer. Not that I care.</string>
<string name="29774">Very well... and what might they be?</string>
<string name="29775">Bye.</string>
<string name="29776">He has a tower out toward Charwood somewhere, but I haven&apos;t been there. </string>
<string name="29777">He&apos;s a disgusting little wizard who keeps a cottage here in town. He&apos;s always trying to convince us local girls to visit. </string>
<string name="29778">And that won&apos;t change as they get older, either... You&apos;ll get used to it, dear.</string>
<string name="29779">There&apos;s Ballard. He&apos;s in the grove to the northeast. He says the birds sing songs about me sometimes.</string>
<string name="29780">The Alliance Arms, up at the north reach, is the only inn in town. The ale&apos;s no good but the conversation&apos;s always good... Ma doesn&apos;t like it when I go there.</string>
<string name="29781">Mm, the Mayor runs a mercenary outfit at the barracks, near the town&apos;s center. They double as the town guard when things get rough around here.</string>
<string name="29782">Sure. Neurik runs the temple at the crossroads and he&apos;s really nice... I like it that your Lady Aribeth is here now, too, all tough and graceful and the like.</string>
<string name="29783">Oh, sometimes I dream of going places. Most of us girls have spent a night or two at Wanev&apos;s just to see what it&apos;s like... </string>
<string name="29784">Don&apos;t get too dirty. Your mother doesn&apos;t want to spend every evening getting the stains out of your clothes.</string>
<string name="29785">What do you know? You&apos;re just a girl!</string>
<string name="29786">Yeah, and one day I&apos;m going to be Mom to a brat like you, aren&apos;t I? Tyr has no mercy... </string>
<string name="29787">The boys are being dumb!</string>
<string name="29788">And you&apos;re surprised by this?</string>
<string name="29789">They never play games that we want to play!</string>
<string name="29790">More so now that Neverwinter has the plague. All the sick people or scared-y people come here now. I don&apos;t like it. You people stink. No offense.</string>
<string name="29791">Hey, you... about me being mean a little - I was just playing with you; you&apos;re pretty neat. But don&apos;t let it go to your head. Bye!</string>
<string name="29792">Can I get a drink, please?</string>
<string name="29793">Um... excuse me. Can I get a drink?</string>
<string name="29794">All righty, there you go: one &quot;yummy&quot; drink.</string>
<string name="29795">Ooh, I feel all sorts of light-headed. Woops! Hee hee. I like it. Can I get another drink, please?</string>
<string name="29796">I think you&apos;ve had enough.</string>
<string name="29797">Are you sure your Mr. Eisenfeldt approves? Fine, what will you have?</string>
<string name="29798">The same thing you&apos;ve been bringing. These drinks are so yummy!</string>
<string name="29799">Back in a moment.</string>
<string name="29800">I&apos;ll be with you in a moment.</string>
<string name="29801">Don&apos;t go too far. I&apos;ll probably want another!</string>
<string name="29802">Shaldrissa is probably the only one that likes your type, anyway. She thinks you&apos;re all going to take her away. If it would shut her up, I wish it would happen.</string>
<string name="29803">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; She&apos;s just some girl that can&apos;t be happy with where she is now. But one day she&apos;ll get her wish.</string>
<string name="29804">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; And why would I tell you? Why not go find her and talk to her yourself. She&apos;s around somewhere. I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll be oh-so-excited.</string>
<string name="29805">She&apos;ll wake up with dirt in her hair and clothes that smell awful and she&apos;ll come crying back to Port Llast.</string>
<string name="29806">We all make fun of him behind his back but we still go to the cottage. It&apos;s much bigger and more exotic on the inside than it appears to be from outside. Must be magic, I guess. </string>
<string name="29807">What are you looking for?</string>
<string name="29808">Who are you looking for?</string>
<string name="29809">As for magical supplies, there&apos;s this creepy place behind the Alliance Arms up on the hill. Some of the boys throw ale jugs at it at night, sometimes, but I&apos;m always too scared. I hear there&apos;s a witch there.</string>
<string name="29810">The only one who came back was Ander. He&apos;s at the Alliance Arms, if you want to hear the story.</string>
<string name="29811">A dead man, maybe... </string>
<string name="29812">A dead man, maybe... </string>
<string name="29813">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; If it&apos;s something I can help with, though... </string>
<string name="29814">Could I ask you a few questions?</string>
<string name="29815">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="29816">Step aside, peasant. I&apos;ve got business.</string>
<string name="29817">Me got questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="29818">Nuthin&apos;. It&apos;s okay.</string>
<string name="29819">Grrr. You in me way... </string>
<string name="29820">Does Port Llast have a ranger or druid I could speak with?</string>
<string name="29821">Where can I find an inn?</string>
<string name="29822">Where can I hire on some adventurers?</string>
<string name="29823">Is there any place that sells magical and regular supplies?</string>
<string name="29824">Know where I can find a temple?</string>
<string name="29825">Have any news about the surrounding region?</string>
<string name="29826">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Any interesting characters in town?</string>
<string name="29827">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Not the Wailing, huh?</string>
<string name="29828">Me tree-friend. Der other tree-friends here? Rangers and Druids?</string>
<string name="29829">Me want place to sleep and drink.</string>
<string name="29830">Me want helpers for adventurin&apos;.</string>
<string name="29831">Me want magic stuff and supplies.</string>
<string name="29832">Me want healer temple.</string>
<string name="29833">What happenin&apos; outside town?</string>
<string name="29834">Okay. Me go now, den.</string>
<string name="29835">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Yuh? No Wailin&apos;?</string>
<string name="29836">Not dead man, no.</string>
<string name="29837">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s okay. Me here to help, yuh?</string>
<string name="29838">Not dead man, no.</string>
<string name="29839">Thanks, that&apos;s everything.</string>
<string name="29840">Where is the inn that this Alhelor and Mr. Craulnober are staying at?</string>
<string name="29841">Where inn they stay at is?</string>
<string name="29842">I need directions.</string>
<string name="29843">Me want directions.</string>
<string name="29844">I&apos;m looking for some people.</string>
<string name="29845">Me want find certain peoples.</string>
<string name="29846">I have other questions.</string>
<string name="29847">Me gots other questions.</string>
<string name="29848">Howdy Haljal. How&apos;s business?</string>
<string name="29849">Could be better. What can I do for ya?</string>
<string name="29850">I&apos;ve got a plow that needs fixing. Think you could take a gander at it?</string>
<string name="29851">Sure. Bring it in tomorrow and I&apos;ll have a look.</string>
<string name="29852">Will do. Thanks.</string>
<string name="29853">Howdy Neurik. Spare a few potions?</string>
<string name="29854">Cow&apos;s still sick then, is she?</string>
<string name="29855">Ayup. I reckon it&apos;s just the weather we&apos;ve been having but better safe than sorry.</string>
<string name="29856">Better safe than sorry. Have a potion, then, and Tyr be with you.</string>
<string name="29857">Howdy Missus.</string>
<string name="29858">Why, aren&apos;t you all charm after a day of gallivanting about town.</string>
<string name="29859">Haljal says he&apos;ll fix the plow tomorrow and I picked up a potion for the cow. See? I been busy.</string>
<string name="29860">Busy flirtin&apos; with the barmaids at the Alliance Arms, too, no doubt... Well, make sure you take the plow in to Haljal tomorrow, then.</string>
<string name="29861">Did you milk the cow?</string>
<string name="29862">She wouldn&apos;t let me. She&apos;s all sick, remember?</string>
<string name="29863">Just checking, is all.</string>
<string name="29864">Yes, papa.</string>
<string name="29865">Did you bring in the wood, son?</string>
<string name="29866">Sure did, pa. I did it this morning, honest.</string>
<string name="29867">You&apos;re not lyin&apos; to me again, are ya?</string>
<string name="29868">Papa! I brought it in, I swear. The gnomes must have taken it! </string>
<string name="29869">You and yer gnomes. I don&apos;t wanna hear another word of it, all right? Now get about yer business.</string>
<string name="29870">So what did you do today, kids?</string>
<string name="29871">We played monsters. I got to be the wolf man!</string>
<string name="29872">You did not! You were playin&apos; soldiers an&apos; thieves. I saw you!</string>
<string name="29873">Was not!</string>
<string name="29874">Was too!</string>
<string name="29875">I don&apos;t care, girls have cooties anyway!</string>
<string name="29876">Yes&apos;m.</string>
<string name="29877">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The Eisenfeldts have grown all sullen since they lost their boy, Urth, that&apos;s all. Never leave their farmhouse. I&apos;ve been tillin&apos; their lands for them when I can - I don&apos;t know what else to do... </string>
<string name="29878">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Now don&apos;t you go tryin&apos; to pry it outa me. A man&apos;s entitled to his private thoughts, ain&apos;t he?</string>
<string name="29879">As if this town didn&apos;t have enough bullies... The Eisenfeldts have grown all sullen since they lost their boy, Urth, that&apos;s all. They never leave their farmhouse.</string>
<string name="29880">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Now don&apos;t you go tryin&apos; to pry it outa me. A man&apos;s entitled to his private thoughts, ain&apos;t he?</string>
<string name="29881">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I think they&apos;re keepin&apos; secrets from you Neverwintans and don&apos;t want anybody nosin&apos; about. Mark my words, you can&apos;t trust a Luskan half as far as you can throw an ogre.</string>
<string name="29882">A few pails short of a honey wagon, are you?</string>
<string name="29883">A few pails short of a honey wagon, are you?</string>
<string name="29884">Shove off - I&apos;ve got work to do or the Missus will have me hide.</string>
<string name="29885">Eh? Oh, you&apos;re that hero they be talkin&apos; about. Whaddaya want?</string>
<string name="29886">Howdy, friend.</string>
<string name="29887">All right, I&apos;ve got work to do anyway.</string>
<string name="29888">We be simple folk here. Take your ego elsewhere.</string>
<string name="29889">A few pails short of a honey wagon, are you?</string>
<string name="29890">What kind of questions?</string>
<string name="29891">Aye, Ballard keeps a grove in the northeast corner of town. Has more concern for his bears than my cows, mind you.</string>
<string name="29892">You can find the Alliance Arms just south of the north gate. Gets a little rowdy every now and then but the servin&apos; girls are nice.</string>
<string name="29893">There&apos;s the mercenary barracks in the northwest end of town. Mayor Kendrack runs the show there.</string>
<string name="29894">There&apos;s a place up atop a hill in the northeast that sells magical supplies, but I haven&apos;t ever needed to go up there.</string>
<string name="29895">Neurik heads the temple in the northwest of town. He&apos;s Tyrran - a good man - gives me potions sometimes to help my cow when she goes sick.</string>
<string name="29896">Rumor is that Luskan&apos;s sealed its gates to anyone comin&apos; in. Some figger they came down wit&apos; the Wailing but I thinks different.</string>
<string name="29897">Well, there be Alhelor the wolf-hunter&apos;s mechant and Mr. Craulnober who both spend their time at the inn. You should go and speak with them. An&apos; then there&apos;s the Eisenfeldts but... but I&apos;m no gossip, you hear?</string>
<string name="29898">As if this town didn&apos;t have enough bullies... Look, I just think Luskan&apos;s keepin&apos; secrets from you Neverwintans, that&apos;s all. They don&apos;t want anybody nosin&apos; about.</string>
<string name="29899">What are ya lookin&apos; for?</string>
<string name="29900">Who are you looking for?</string>
<string name="29901">As for normal equipment, the Cracked Anvil in the west of town be the only real store here.</string>
<string name="29902"></string>
<string name="29903"></string>
<string name="29904"></string>
<string name="29905"></string>
<string name="29906"></string>
<string name="29907">My mommy says there&apos;s criminals loose all over the place.</string>
<string name="29908">My mommy says everyone is dead in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="29909">You look funny!</string>
<string name="29910">Girls are better than bo-oys!</string>
<string name="29911">My brother&apos;s werewolf game is so stoopid.</string>
<string name="29912">The boys were playing &apos;Soldiers and Thieves!&apos; Jimmy was playing Stirge the Baby Thief but he couldn&apos;t think of any good riddles!</string>
<string name="29913">Get away from me, you&apos;re creepy.</string>
<string name="29914">The boys were playing &apos;Soldiers and Thieves!&apos; I saw them!</string>
<string name="29915">Okay, me go now, yuh?</string>
<string name="29916">Out of my way, money-grubber.</string>
<string name="29917">Nevermind.</string>

<string name="29919">Urgh, you in me way... </string>
<string name="29920">Uh, me go now.</string>
<string name="29921">I don&apos;t like thinking about snapping your neck but that won&apos;t stop me... </string>
<string name="29922">No, you tell! You tell or me crush you!</string>
<string name="29923">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; If you&apos;re a sword for hire, where else have you served?</string>
<string name="29924">You mercenary. Me pay you, you follow, yuh?</string>
<string name="29925">Me want healer priest.</string>
<string name="29926">Thanks, that&apos;s everything.</string>

<string name="29928">Me want place to sleep and drink.</string>
<string name="29929">What type store around here?</string>
<string name="29930">Any other towns nearby?</string>
<string name="29931">Could you answer a few questions for me?</string>
<string name="29932">Does Port Llast have a ranger or druid I could speak with?</string>
<string name="29933">Where can I find an inn?</string>
<string name="29934">You&apos;re a mercenary. That mean you&apos;re for hire?</string>
<string name="29935">Know where I can find a priest?</string>
<string name="29936">What kind of stores do you have around here?</string>
<string name="29937">Are there any other towns in the region?</string>
<string name="29938">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; What can you tell me about Luskan?</string>
<string name="29939">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Luskan? What that like?</string>
<string name="29940">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="29941">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="29942">I&apos;m looking for some people.</string>
<string name="29943">Me look for certain kind of people.</string>
<string name="29944">Could you answer some other questions?</string>
<string name="29945">You answer other stuff?</string>
<string name="29946">For regular items, try the Cracked Anvil, east of the barracks, along the road. It stocks all of the basic items you&apos;ll need. Haljal has some special stuff set aside for his fellow dwarves, too, I hear.</string>
<string name="29947">That said, some of my pals here in the barracks still have a taste for adventure and are hungry for work. It&apos;s the building behind me here.</string>
<string name="29948">Well, there is Charwood to the south. Never been there myself, though. They&apos;re a quiet folk, from all acounts, and don&apos;t stray far from home. </string>
<string name="29949">What can I do for you, citizen? Always ready to help a hero.</string>
<string name="29950">You look like more of a troublemaker than a hero to me, but I guess they say you are, so who am I to argue...</string>
<string name="29951">One of the Mayor&apos;s Merry Men, at your service!</string>
<string name="29952">I suppose I could.</string>
<string name="29953">Watch your mouth, citizen.</string>
<string name="29954">Stay out of trouble, citizen.</string>
<string name="29955">That&apos;s &apos;cause your brow&apos;s blocking the view, pal... </string>
<string name="29956">You&apos;re the boss, citizen... </string>
<string name="29957">Check the northeast of town, a fella named Ballard.</string>
<string name="29958">A few of us maintain quarters at the Alliance Arms - south of the northern gate into town. The ale&apos;s not great but the sheets are clean.</string>
<string name="29959">Not me, I&apos;ve had my fill of monsters. Mayor Kendrack pays my room and board and I guard Port Llast from drunken sailors and whatever monsters wander by. That&apos;s enough excitement for me. </string>
<string name="29960">Temple of Tyr in the northwest part of town, there. Pretty hard to miss.</string>
<string name="29961">I was in Neverwinter for a while before the Wailing and even working a pirate gig in Luskan before they kicked all of us foreigners out.</string>
<string name="29962">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; When I left, the High Captains were fighting tooth and nail against each other, vying for the Arcane Brotherhood&apos;s attention. I doubt it&apos;s any different now, either.</string>
<string name="29963">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, not something I like to think about much... </string>
<string name="29964">Whoa, stand down citizen. I don&apos;t like thinking about it but I don&apos;t like an uproar, either.</string>
<string name="29965">When I left, the High Captains were fighting tooth and nail against each other, vying for the Arcane Brotherhood&apos;s approval. Things probably aren&apos;t much different now, either.</string>
<string name="29966">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Admittedly, it&apos;s good to share my stories with a &lt;race&gt; companion.</string>
<string name="29967">When I left, the High Captains were fighting tooth and nail against each other, vying for the Arcane Brotherhood&apos;s attention. I doubt it&apos;s any different now, either.</string>
<string name="29968">What are you looking for?</string>
<string name="29969">Who are you looking for?</string>
<string name="29970">Then there&apos;s Eltoora Sarptyl&apos;s up on the hill in the northeast corner of town. A lot of the townsfolk don&apos;t like that it&apos;s there but, to be honest, it&apos;s put a lot of money into people&apos;s pockets around here.</string>
<string name="29971">Who are you?</string>
<string name="29972">What&apos;s the discussion about here?</string>
<string name="29973">Who you be?</string>
<string name="29974">Why you not make nice-talk with other guy?</string>
<string name="29975">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="29976">Let me go talk to the dock master.</string>
<string name="29977">That&apos;s it. You&apos;re going to Neverwinter, or I&apos;m doing some damage.</string>
<string name="29978">I spoke with the dock-master, and I want you to change your mind.</string>
<string name="29979">Me goes and talks with dock-master.</string>
<string name="29980">Me hurts you bad, if you no go Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="29981">Me spoke with dock-master. Me wants change you mind.</string>
<string name="29982">Nevermind. I&apos;ll talk to him again.</string>
<string name="29983">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; What if I pay you to cover your costs?</string>
<string name="29984">Tell me the truth. I want details.</string>
<string name="29985">Me wants hearing whole story. True stuff, yeah?</string>
<string name="29986">I don&apos;t really care. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="29987">(yawn) Was you speakings? Me leaving. Bye.</string>
<string name="29988">But I know it is. I&apos;m *from* Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="29989">Me talks to dock-master again.</string>
<string name="29990">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me wonders if you think of starving peoples. Starves so you get rich.</string>
<string name="29991">Me from Neverwinter. It&apos;s okay. Me fixed plague.</string>
<string name="29992">Actually, let me go talk to the dock-master.</string>
<string name="29993">Me talks with dock-master, again.</string>
<string name="29994">300 gold. Take it or leave it.</string>
<string name="29995">Me offers 300 gold. You take, yeah?</string>
<string name="29996">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; 50 gold should cover the costs, yes?</string>
<string name="29997">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; 100 gold will make you go Neverwinter, yeah?</string>
<string name="29998">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; 100 gold... will that get you to Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="29999">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me gives you 50 gold to take to Neverwinter.</string>
