<string name="2">Victory is mine!</string>
<string name="3">I suggest you hear me out.</string>
<string name="4">Wretched creature! Do you think to defy me? </string>
<string name="5">Attack! Kill them all!</string>
<string name="6">I&apos;ll swallow your soul!</string>
<string name="7">May the hells take you!</string>
<string name="8">Steady now... This is going to hurt...</string>
<string name="9">I&apos;m hurt?  Quickly now... Fix this!</string>
<string name="10">Don&apos;t make me call you again... Assist me!</string>
<string name="11">Well... What have we here?</string>
<string name="12">Yes.</string>
<string name="13">No.</string>
<string name="14">Next time, I won&apos;t be so pleasant.</string>
<string name="15">Oh, you can bet I have something to say about that...</string>
<string name="16">You&apos;ll beg for death before I&apos;m through...</string>
<string name="17">Lay them low!  Attack!</string>
<string name="18">Mess with me, will you?</string>
<string name="19">That&apos;s it - you&apos;re dead! </string>
<string name="20">Time to put a hurt on.</string>
<string name="21">I could use some patching up.</string>
<string name="22">I need help!  Now!</string>
<string name="23">This looks like trouble.</string>
<string name="24">It&apos;s too much!  Get out of here!</string>
<string name="25">Why don&apos;t you save us both some time and start begging now.</string>
<string name="26">I need you by my side!</string>
<string name="27">Stop here for a moment.</string>
<string name="28">Ohh, damn..</string>
<string name="29">It&apos;s poison... damn.</string>
<string name="30">Hey, wha... you distracted me!</string>
<string name="31">Okay, this is not going to work.</string>
<string name="32">This way.</string>
<string name="33">What&apos;s this?  </string>
<string name="34">Fall in here!</string>
<string name="35">One side, one side!</string>
<string name="36">I need this open.</string>
<string name="37">Look around.</string>
<string name="38">Shh.  We need to be quiet.</string>
<string name="39">Got it, no problem.</string>
<string name="40">Can&apos;t do it, chief.</string>
<string name="41">All done.</string>
<string name="42">Ooof, my knees are buckling!</string>
<string name="43">Mmmm?</string>
<string name="44">Greetings!</string>
<string name="45">Yep.</string>
<string name="46">Nah.</string>
<string name="47">Stop!</string>
<string name="48">Okay, we all need rest now.</string>
<string name="49">We. Are. Wasting. Time.</string>
<string name="50">Travel well.</string>
<string name="51">Thanks.</string>
<string name="52">Sweet merciful crap!</string>
<string name="53">Alright!</string>
<string name="54">Hey!</string>
<string name="55">Yeah, sounds good.</string>
<string name="56">No - won&apos;t work.</string>
<string name="57">When I&apos;m done even the buzzards won&apos;t want you.</string>
<string name="58">Please subdue them, if you would be so kind.</string>
<string name="59">You&apos;ll wish you hadn&apos;t!</string>
<string name="60">Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.</string>
<string name="61">If that&apos;s the way you want it, then.</string>
<string name="62">If you would be so kind as to heal me...</string>
<string name="63">Help, help!</string>
<string name="64">Looks like bad folk ahead.</string>
<string name="65">I&apos;m afraid we must be leaving.</string>
<string name="66">Not the sharpest of swords, are you?</string>
<string name="67">Please guard me.  Much thanks</string>
<string name="68">Hold for a second, please.</string>
<string name="69">Death approaches me.</string>
<string name="70">I have been poisoned.</string>
<string name="71">Humph, not used to that happening.</string>
<string name="72">Doesn&apos;t look like this will work.</string>
<string name="73">This way, please.</string>
<string name="74">Hmm, how interesting.</string>
<string name="75">If you could all come over here, please.</string>
<string name="76">Pardon..</string>
<string name="77">Could you be so good as to open this?</string>
<string name="78">Now let&apos;s all look around us.</string>
<string name="79">Quiet, eveyone.</string>
<string name="80">But of course.</string>
<string name="81">Sadly, I cannot.</string>
<string name="82">All done.</string>
<string name="83">This is more than I can bear.</string>
<string name="84">Mmmhmm?</string>
<string name="85">Hello there.</string>
<string name="86">Yes</string>
<string name="87">No.</string>
<string name="88">Don&apos;t move!</string>
<string name="89">We should rest now.</string>
<string name="90">This is unproductive.  Let us move on.</string>
<string name="91">Fare well to you.</string>
<string name="92">Why, thank you!</string>
<string name="93">Oh, fiddlesticks!</string>
<string name="94">How exciting!</string>
<string name="95">If I may...</string>
<string name="96">Very astute!</string>
<string name="97">Um, no.</string>
<string name="98">You would do well to leave.  Now.</string>
<string name="99">Trust in Mystra and bring them down!</string>
<string name="100">My art will bring you low.</string>
<string name="101">You will rue the day you invited my attack!</string>
<string name="102">Prepare to face the judgement of Mystra!</string>
<string name="103">Mystra, send your healing power to me!</string>
<string name="104">Help! Help!</string>
<string name="105">There they are! We&apos;ll easily destroy them.</string>
<string name="106">Oh goddess! We&apos;re all going to die! </string>
<string name="107">I don&apos;t believe that you are worth my time.</string>
<string name="108">Quick, hurry, protect me!</string>
<string name="109">Stop and wait right there.</string>
<string name="110">Mmph!</string>
<string name="111">Unnh!</string>
<string name="112">Ah!</string>
<string name="113">Mystra, take them, not me!</string>
<string name="114">Oh no! Quick, I need an antidote! Help!</string>
<string name="115">What? What just happened -- that&apos;s inconceivable!</string>
<string name="116">Well, this is what happens when you don&apos;t use magic.</string>
<string name="117">Oh, for heavens&apos; sake, follow me.</string>
<string name="118">Pay attention!</string>
<string name="119">Everyone gather around me.</string>
<string name="120">Stand aside, peasant.</string>
<string name="121">This mechanical device doesn&apos;t merit the energy of a knock spell. One of you deal with it.</string>
<string name="122">Don&apos;t just stand there, look around more carefully.</string>
<string name="123">Do I have to waste an invisibility spell, or do you think you can manage to stay hidden?</string>
<string name="124">Of course I can do that!</string>
<string name="125">That&apos;s not worth my time.</string>
<string name="126">It&apos;s done.</string>
<string name="127">This is too much weight! Aren&apos;t there hirelings to carry these things for us?</string>
<string name="128">Yes?</string>
<string name="129">Yes, hello.</string>
<string name="130">Yes, of course.</string>
<string name="131">No, certainly not.</string>
<string name="132">Stop!</string>
<string name="133">Isn&apos;t this enough for one day? I need to refresh my spells.</string>
<string name="134">Well, this is special.</string>
<string name="135">Oh, goodbye.</string>
<string name="136">Thank you for giving that into my keeping.</string>
<string name="137">Shar take you!</string>
<string name="138">By my art, we have triumphed!</string>
<string name="139">Stop and listen to me.</string>
<string name="140">That&apos;s a splendid idea.</string>
<string name="141">I hardly think that&apos;s wise.</string>
<string name="142">Don&apos;t force me to use my powers against you.</string>
<string name="143">For the glory of Mystra, attack! Smite them down! Destroy the evil ones! Strike-- hey, wait for me!</string>
<string name="144">In Mystra&apos;s name!</string>
<string name="145">Have at you!</string>
<string name="146">Mystra grant me strength!</string>
<string name="147">In the Lady&apos;s name, I beg you for healing.</string>
<string name="148">Mystra, let help come to my side now!</string>
<string name="149">Look! Evil creatures to smite! Let&apos;s go attack!</string>
<string name="150">Let us press onward and die in glorious battle!</string>
<string name="151">Dare you face me, evil creature? I bet you don&apos;t!</string>
<string name="152">Guard me as we fight, and I shall do the same for you!</string>
<string name="153">Hold your ground! </string>
<string name="154">I can feel Mystra&apos;s arms reaching out to embrace me...</string>
<string name="155">Oh, ugh! Poison creeping through my veins!</string>
<string name="156">Mystra must not have wanted that to work.</string>
<string name="157">My sword may have failed me, but my faith remains strong!</string>
<string name="158">Come, follow me!</string>
<string name="159">Look over here, quickly!</string>
<string name="160">All of us should come together at once.</string>
<string name="161">Please move over, won&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="162">Hmm, this won&apos;t open. Does anyone have a knock spell?</string>
<string name="163">I don&apos;t see anything around, but maybe you might!</string>
<string name="164">Even though this seems to call for stealth, I think we should charge ahead!</string>
<string name="165">Of course I can do that!</string>
<string name="166">Of course I can do that! Well, actually, I can&apos;t. I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="167">I&apos;m finished!</string>
<string name="168">Ouch, this is as heavy as I imagine the weight of a guilty conscience would be.</string>
<string name="169">Yes?</string>
<string name="170">Hello!</string>
<string name="171">Yes, of course!</string>
<string name="172">No. </string>
<string name="173">Let&apos;s stop for a moment.</string>
<string name="174">Can we stop for a while? I need to perform my devotions.</string>
<string name="175">Surely there&apos;s some evil out there we could be smiting...</string>
<string name="176">Mystra keep you!</string>
<string name="177">May Mystra bless you for your kindness!</string>
<string name="178">May Mystra condemn it to the bleakest hell!</string>
<string name="179">For the glory of Mystra!</string>
<string name="180">Wait, I have something to say to you.</string>
<string name="181">Yes, that&apos;s a splendid idea!</string>
<string name="182">Yes, that&apos;s a wonderful idea... I think.</string>
<string name="183">Don&apos;t make me come over there and hurt you.</string>
<string name="184">For Jotunheim!</string>
<string name="185">You can expect no mercy!</string>
<string name="186">Your death will be glorious.</string>
<string name="187">Gods preserve me, I need healing!</string>
<string name="188">Quickly now, aid me!</string>
<string name="189">Why do you disturb me?</string>
<string name="190">Yes.</string>
<string name="191">No.</string>
<string name="192">You can see yourself out.</string>
<string name="193">Victory is mine!</string>
<string name="194">You had better believe I have something to say about that.</string>
<string name="195">You cannot hope to defeat me.</string>
<string name="196">Let slip the dogs of war! Well get to it, dogs!</string>
<string name="197">Taste  true power!</string>
<string name="198">My magic will make short work of you!</string>
<string name="199">I will destroy you.</string>
<string name="200">I need healing.  Now.</string>
<string name="201">A little help would be appreciated!</string>
<string name="202">Looks like trouble.  Excellent.</string>
<string name="203">You can&apos;t possibly win. I&apos;m leaving.</string>
<string name="204">Is that your face or has your neck thrown up?</string>
<string name="205">Protect me, would you? Thanks.</string>
<string name="206">Hold it!</string>
<string name="207">Look what your incompetence has led to!</string>

<string name="694">The Neverwinter Nights Configuration Utility has detected that this computer is running Windows XP.

The default video drivers installed with Windows XP do not include OpenGL support, which is required to run Neverwinter Nights. Please ensure that the installed video drivers support OpenGL. Contact your video card manufacturer for information on how to obtain and install adequate drivers before trying to run Neverwinter Nights or the BioWare Aurora Neverwinter Nights Toolset.

To test OpenGL compatibility, the Neverwinter Nights Configuration Utility will now perform several tests. These tests may fail and cause the program to crash if the installed video drivers do not support OpenGL.

Would you like to skip with the OpenGL tests?

Press &quot;No&quot; to proceed with the tests if the installed video drivers support OpenGL. Press &quot;Yes&quot; to skip the OpenGL tests. If there is any doubt whether the system includes adequate OpenGL support, please press &quot;Yes&quot;.</string>

<string name="1182">Good. They deserved it.</string>
<string name="1183">Good. Them guards deserve it!</string>
<string name="1184">Why you go there?</string>
<string name="1185">What that mean? One of many?</string>
<string name="1186">What are you going to do with the spear now, Daelan?</string>
<string name="1187">What you do with spear now, Daelan?</string>
<string name="1188">And what about you?</string>
<string name="1189">And what happen to you?</string>
<string name="1190">I&apos;m going to miss you, Daelan.</string>
<string name="1191">So you mean you&apos;re just going to abandon me now?</string>
<string name="1192">Me gonna miss you, Daelan.</string>
<string name="1193">So now you gonna take off and just leave me?</string>
<string name="1194">I doubt you will find any other axeman for hire who is my equal. You have a noble and honorable bearing, so I will reduce my normal fee. Only 150 gold pieces and I am your willing servant.</string>
<string name="1195">Yes, &lt;Sir/Madam&gt;. Is there something you need?</string>
<string name="1196">If you feel that&apos;s best. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="1197">At what distance do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="1198"></string>
<string name="1199">Of course. Under what circumstances would you like me to heal you?</string>
<string name="1200">Are you certain? There will be no refunds on the fee you paid me earlier. Do you really want me to leave?</string>
<string name="1201">As you wish. If you need me you can always find me here... unless I join up with someone who has need of my skills, that is.</string>
<string name="1202">Greetings, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I see you are not yet infected by the plague that ravages Neverwinter. Among such suffering and misery we who are not yet afflicted must be grateful for our health.</string>
<string name="1203">You will not regret this, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. My skills are yours to command.</string>
<string name="1204">I doubt you will find any other axeman for hire who is my equal. Only 200 gold pieces and I am your willing servant.</string>
<string name="1205">I doubt you will find any other axeman for hire who is my equal. Only 250 gold pieces and I am your willing servant.</string>
<string name="1206">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You seem like an honorable &lt;man/woman&gt; to work for. 100 it is, and all my skills are yours to command.</string>
<string name="1207">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps we could split the difference and settle on 125?</string>
<string name="1208">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry, 150 is my final offer. If you do not wish to hire me I&apos;m certain others shall.</string>
<string name="1209">I am no &lt;man/woman&gt;&apos;s slave! I will serve you as a henchman - there is an important difference.</string>
<string name="1210">I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities; according to the orders you have given me. Any time you wish to issue new orders you have only to speak to me again.</string>
<string name="1211">I doubt you will find another axeman for hire who is my equal. Since we&apos;re both &lt;race&gt;, I&apos;m willing to cut my normal fee. Only 150 gold pieces and I am your loyal servant.</string>
<string name="1212">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You seem like an honorable &lt;man/woman&gt; to work for. 150 it is, and all my skills are yours to command.</string>
<string name="1213">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I should not be so quick to judge you an unfit employer. Very well, 200 it is and all my skills are yours to command.</string>
<string name="1214">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps we could split the difference and settle on 175?</string>
<string name="1215">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps we could split the difference and settle on 225?</string>
<string name="1216">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry, 200 is my final offer. If you do not wish to hire me I&apos;m certain others shall.</string>
<string name="1217">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry, 250 is my final offer. If you do not wish to hire me I&apos;m certain others shall.</string>
<string name="1218">As you wish.</string>
<string name="1219">Then we shall part ways, though I will wait here in case you reconsider and wish to join me again. Farewell, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="1220">If you feel that is best. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="1221">How far away do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="1222">Very well, I shall stay reasonably close to you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="1223">Very well, I shall stay a medium distance away from you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="1224">Very well, I shall stay a reasonably far distance away from you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="1225">Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="1226">Was there anything else?</string>
<string name="1227"></string>
<string name="1228"></string>
<string name="1229"></string>
<string name="1230">I shall do as you have asked.</string>
<string name="1231">Very well, I will no longer search while we are moving.</string>
<string name="1232">Very well, I will search whenever we are moving.</string>
<string name="1233">Very well, I will travel in stealth mode.</string>
<string name="1234">Very well, I will no longer travel in stealth mode.</string>
<string name="1235">Very well, I will open any locked door or chest that you fail to open.</string>
<string name="1236">Very well, I will no longer attempt to open locked doors or chests.</string>
<string name="1237">That is unfortunate, but I must earn a living through my skills. I cannot work for free. Is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="1238">I see you have returned, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. What brings you back to the Trade of Blades?</string>
<string name="1239">Greetings and well met. You are &lt;FullName&gt;, aren&apos;t you? The one responsible for saving the city of Neverwinter. Your deeds have become something of a legend.</string>
<string name="1240">Greetings once more, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. It is I, Daelan Red Tiger, warrior of the Uthgardt Red Tiger tribe. Remember? </string>
<string name="1241">&lt;FirstName&gt;! It is a pleasure to see you again, though not altogether unexpected. I had heard that Aribeth recruited you to stamp out the foul cult that was responsible for the plague. </string>
<string name="1242">I bid you welcome, &lt;FullName&gt;. I have heard many tales of your exploits in Neverwinter and Luskan. You are truly a &lt;man/woman&gt; of great honor. </string>
<string name="1243">Greetings and well met, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is good to look upon you once more. No doubt Aarin Gend has brought you here to aid in the search for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="1244">I bid you welcome once more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Have you need of a skilled warrior? I am eager to join in the search for the Words of Power. </string>
<string name="1245">I have been waiting for you - I suspected you would return. Do you need me to join with you once more?</string>
<string name="1246">I serve another another master now. I have nothing further to say to you. </string>
<string name="1247">I found passing from this world unsettling - as was my return to life. Yet I sense there has been no permanent harm done. Do you need me to join you once more, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="1248">I am not one to boast of my own abilities, yet the skill and ferocity of the Uthgardt tribes are well known throughout the North.</string>
<string name="1249">IGNORE THIS STARTING CONDITION. THIS IS USED AS A TRASH FOR UNWANTED LINKS. DO NOT DELETE THESE LINKS. </string>
<string name="1250">As you wish, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Come back if you ever wish to hire a warrior of great skill and honor.</string>
<string name="1251">I am Daelan Red Tiger of the Uthgardt tribes of the frozen North. But it has been over a year since I left my people and came to Neverwinter. Now I earn my living as a blade for hire.</string>
<string name="1252">With my friends dead there was no reason to stay in the docks. Not with things getting... worse. Now I earn a living with my axe as a freelance mercenary.</string>
<string name="1253">I am no stranger to battle or bloodshed, but I am a warrior with honor. I will not undertake any sinister mission. Had I desired such work I could have found employment back at the docks.</string>
<string name="1254">Aribeth&apos;s reputation is well known throughout the city, so I have no fear your mission will bring dishonor to me. I will work for you, if we can agree upon a fair price for my services.</string>
<string name="1255">I can understand that. If you are working for Aribeth then I am certain your &apos;mission&apos; must be of great importance.</string>
<string name="1256">The quarantine trapped ships in port, swelling the number of pirates and other criminals in the district - men with no honor. And with the city guard focused on the plague, these evil men have seized control of the docks.</string>
<string name="1257">Before I left I heard talk in the district of an auction to be held at Jim Seedy&apos;s tavern. Something besides the usual stolen merchandise, illegal goods and helpless slaves sold at his filthy den of sin.</string>
<string name="1258">There is little else I can tell you about the docks, but I know the district is dangerous. If you intend to go there you would be wise to take along a hired blade.</string>
<string name="1259">I do have some knowledge of the docks district, as I worked there before the plague. It was a dangerous and sinister place when I left... though I suspect things have only grown worse since then.</string>
<string name="1260">Your are modest to share the praise, though it does nothing to diminish the honor you have rightly earned.</string>
<string name="1261">I am Daelan Red Tiger, a noble warrior from the Uthgardt tribes of the north. No doubt your mission here is the same as mine: to aid Aribeth in stamping out the cult that was responsible for the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="1262">Ummm... yes I already know that you work for Aribeth. By the way, you are... drooling. </string>
<string name="1263">If you find yourself in need of a strong warrior to aid you, come back and speak to me. My blade is ready to aid you in this mission. </string>
<string name="1264">It seems Lord Nasher is determined to root out the cult that brought so much suffering to his city. He has ordered all the mercenaries in Neverwinter to come to Port Llast to join in the search.</string>
<string name="1265">I answered the call without hesitation. I lost many friends to the plague and I am eager to avenge their deaths. The cowards who unleashed this curse must be made to pay.</string>
<string name="1266">I would accomplish little by dashing off on my own. My orders were to come here and help any who might need my blade.</string>
<string name="1267">Your reputation is well known, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am no great hero such as you, but I am a skilled warrior of the Red Tiger tribe.</string>
<string name="1268">My people are well known for their bravery, honor, and ferocity in battle. I could be of great service to you in seeking out this cult, if you would have me.</string>
<string name="1269">I have heard nothing of the cult, though many suspect - as I do - that answers might be found in the city of Luskan.</string>
<string name="1270">That city has long been an enemy of Neverwinter. An evil blight upon the north, it is widely acknowledged as the home of murders and thieves - a place with no honor!</string>
<string name="1271">It would not surprisie me to discover links to the cult in that breeding den of evil, though I admit there is no evidence pointing to Luskan.</string>
<string name="1272">Of course I will bow to your lead, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am honored to join my blade to the cause of such a great hero.</string>
<string name="1273">I will follow you and carry out your orders to the best of my abilities. If you wish to issue new orders, simply speak to me again.</string>
<string name="1274">My abilities have improved from practice. Give me a few seconds to rest and I&apos;ll be ready to show you what I&apos;ve learned.
</string>
<string name="1275">My strength is in weapons not words, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1276">As you wish. We should probably continue with your mission in any case.</string>
<string name="1277">I would ask, &lt;FirstName&gt;, that before I tell you about myself you tell me something of yourself. Among my people it is said that in knowing our companions we come to know ourselves.</string>
<string name="1278">I admit that I fight only for gold, but I know nothing of your motivations. Why do you serve Neverwinter during these darkest of times?</string>
<string name="1279">You are an honorable &lt;man/woman&gt;, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I too seek honor here in Neverwinter, though of a different sort.</string>
<string name="1280">So you seek to make a name for yourself here, &lt;FirstName&gt;? A noble cause, and one I am familiar with. </string>
<string name="1281">It would seem we are both nothing but ruthless mercenaries. Yet even in serving for gold we may perform great deeds of honor.</string>
<string name="1282">I came to this city to make a name for myself, &lt;FirstName&gt; - to forge a legend that even the tribe of my mother would hear. Instead I found myself guarding crates and barrels against common thugs.</string>
<string name="1283">Yet even in the sordid world of the docks my reputation spread. Several captains asked me to join their crews. Perhaps if the plague had not come the name Daelan Red Tiger would have become a legend on the high seas.</string>
<string name="1284">Perhaps it is for the best. Had I joined a ship&apos;s crew it is unlikely the Uthgardt would ever have heard of my accomplishments. My place is here, in the North.</string>
<string name="1285">This is the land of my birth, and this is where I must fulfill my destiny. I will bring no honor to my mother&apos;s name by fleeing on a ship!</string>
<string name="1286">Only if I stay can I hope to redeem the shame of my father&apos;s blood and end my exile!</string>
<string name="1287">In the time we have been together you have respected my request for privacy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Now I feel I am ready to tell you the rest of my tale.</string>
<string name="1288">*Sigh* I suppose you deserve to know the rest of the story, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have kept this weight upon my heart, but we are in this together.</string>
<string name="1289">I know I shall probably never find my mother&apos;s brooch again, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I shall not give up hope. Without it my vision quest will never be revealed to me.</string>
<string name="1290">Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, the things I said before... the words were... this is not the time to speak of such things. Perhaps later I will speak more of this. But not now.</string>
<string name="1291">There are no great secrets about me, &lt;FirstName&gt;; I am what I am. My father was an orc and my mother was an Uthgardt of the Red Tiger tribe.</string>
<string name="1292">Some in the cities fear us. They call us bloodthirsty savages, but they are ignorant of our ways. We are fierce warriors of great courage and honor, even if they do not understand.</string>
<string name="1293">I will not lie - I was never allowed to forget about my father&apos;s tainted orc blood. Yet if the tribe did not embrace me, at least they tolerated me.</string>
<string name="1294">Like the other young boys of our tribe I ran and climbed and swam and grew strong. I learned to hunt and fish. I learned the lore of our tribe. And most importantly I learned the honor of a warrior.</string>
<string name="1295">With my mother&apos;s death the time came for me to prove myself worthy of the tribe. I left in search of glory and honor in the outside world, to prove my spirit was true. I went to Luskan.</string>
<string name="1296">I suppose I owe you an explanation of my days in Luskan, &lt;FirstName&gt;, after all we have been through together.</string>
<string name="1297">You have been a true friend to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have been reluctant to speak to you of this, but you did help me recover my mother&apos;s brooch. Perhaps you can help me with this as well.</string>
<string name="1298">I will not abandon the search for the cultists behind the plague; I have pledged my blade to you and it is yours as long as you need me.</string>
<string name="1299">This is not the time to speak of such things, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We must focus on rooting out the cult responsible for the Wailing Death. Perhaps we can speak of this later... when the time is right.</string>
<string name="1300">There are some who claim Aribeth betrayed Neverwinter out of grief, others say she seeks to avenge Fenthick&apos;s death out of some perverse sense of justice.</string>
<string name="1301">Neverwinter turned its back on her, the city rejected her and its people cast her out. There is no pain so great as being turned away by those you most want to take you in.</string>
<string name="1302">Perhaps not, but Aribeth no doubt felt that they did. The people blamed Fenthick enough to kill him, how could she not feel they despised her as well?</string>
<string name="1303">No doubt he thought it best to calm the people and keep Aribeth from suffering their wrath as Fenthick had. But in her grief she would have seen it as a cold and brutal rejection - a symbolic banishment.</string>
<string name="1304">We should focus on finding the Words of Power for Aarin Gend. But I suppose I could spare some time to share with you the legend of my people I mentioned earlier.</string>
<string name="1305">I promised to tell you the rest of the tale of Uthgar&apos;s Spear when the time was right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That time has now come.</string>
<string name="1306">Do not fear, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As long as you seek the Words of Power my blade shall serve you. And in serving you, perhaps I will find Uthgar&apos;s Spear. </string>
<string name="1307">Perhaps later I will tell you the tale, but now is not the time for me to speak of this. We must focus on finding the Words of Power for Aarin Gend if we are to save Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="1308">Forgive me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I... I cannot speak of this anymore. It is too... painful.</string>
<string name="1309">Among my people there is nothing we value more than friendship. You have proved yourself a true friend, &lt;FirstName&gt;, so I give you this amulet as a sign of the bond we share.</string>
<string name="1310">Yes! Yes, that is the blood-soaked blade that has haunted my dreams! Then... the one who wields it is dead?</string>
<string name="1311">I can never properly repay you for this gift, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but please take this small token of my gratitude. It was a gift from my mother before she died.</string>
<string name="1312">That was partly the reason I stayed so long at the docks, hoping I might somehow discover the brooch. I am certain it is somewhere in the docks district, even now - if it was not burned on the bonfires of the plague corpses. </string>
<string name="1313">&apos;Go&apos;, he said with his dying breath. I could do nothing more for him, so I fled before my actions were discovered. I left Luskan that night, a man saved from himself by another&apos;s sacrifice.</string>
<string name="1314">There is a lesson in the fall of the Uthgardt, a lesson Neverwinter would do well to heed. There is hope for the city yet, just as there is hope for the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="1315">This is how I must prove myself worthy of my tribe, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I must find Uthgar&apos;s spear - though I do not know where to look.</string>
<string name="1316">I am grateful for all you have done for me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I did not follow you here. Make no mistake, Daelan Red Tiger is his own man. </string>
<string name="1317">I know we went our separate ways, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but it seems the gods have seen fit to bring us together once more.</string>
<string name="1318">It seems Lord Nasher is determined to root out the cult that brought so much suffering to his city. He has ordered all the mercenaries in Neverwinter to come to Port Llast to join in the search.</string>
<string name="1319">When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists.</string>
<string name="1320">Farewell, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. My blade is at your service if you require the aid of a skilled and honorable warrior.</string>
<string name="1321">Then I shall bid you farewell. If you ever find yourself in need of a skilled and honorable warrior come speak to me again.</string>
<string name="1322">I would be honored to join my blade to your cause.</string>
<string name="1323">I have heard nothing of the cult, though many suspect - as I do - that answers might be found in the city of Luskan.</string>
<string name="1324">From what I have heard, your deeds go far beyond the scope of mere duty. I only hope my own fame is one day as widely spread as yours, &lt;FullName&gt;. </string>
<string name="1325">Farewell. If you find yourself in need of a courageous warrior, come speak to me again. </string>
<string name="1326">Yes, he has hired on dozens of mercenaries to aid him in this cause. We are to scour the North for the Words of Power, before they fall into the enemy&apos;s hands. </string>
<string name="1327">Though I am an Uthgardt warrior, born in the wild, I have lived in Neverwinter for nearly a year and the city is dear to my heart. I will do everything within my power to defend her walls.</string>
<string name="1328">I have heard nothing of these Words, though recent events concerning the Uthgardt Elk tribe might be worth investigating. </string>
<string name="1329">Though a capable warrior, I fear I would have little success on my own, &lt;FirstName&gt;. However, I would be honored to join my blade to your cause, if you would have me.</string>
<string name="1330">I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me. Any time you wish to issue new orders you have only to speak to me again.</string>
<string name="1331">Then I bid you farewell. If you change your mind, come speak to me again. </string>
<string name="1332">After Aribeth&apos;s betrayal I meant to travel the north in search of the quest to prove myself to my tribe. Yet even as we parted ways I suspected we would meet once more, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1333">I find your anger inexplicable, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I come from a proud people and I will not subject myself to such abuse. Perhaps we can speak again when you are in a better mood.</string>
<string name="1334">And then I heard of Aarin Gend&apos;s call for all those who would serve the cause of Neverwinter to join the Lords&apos; Alliance here at Beorunna&apos;s Well - a holy place to the Uthgardt. I thought it might be a sign from my gods.</string>
<string name="1335">After all you have done for Neverwinter I knew you would be here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That is why I came, to join with you once more. I feel our fates are bound together.</string>
<string name="1336">Then once more my blade is yours to command, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1337">As you wish, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you change your mind you can find me here.</string>
<string name="1338">I have heard nothing of these Words, though recent events concerning the Uthgardt Elk tribe might be worth investigating.</string>
<string name="1339">My blade is yours to command.</string>
<string name="1340">If you change your mind you can find me here.</string>
<string name="1341">My blade is yours to command.</string>
<string name="1342">If you change your mind you can find me here.</string>
<string name="1343">My tribe is noble, but small. Among them there was little chance for a young warrior to prove himself or earn a wife.</string>
<string name="1344">But I am young and strong and my people are renowned for their skill in battle. Here in Neverwinter I found work on the docks as a guard for the cargo and shipments being transported.</string>
<string name="1345">There are some in the city who call my people savages and barbarians, but they know nothing of the Uthgardt. We are great warriors and hunters, following the herds and living off the land.</string>
<string name="1346">The coming of the plague changed everything. The quarantine halted all incoming or outgoing ships. There was no work and no money. I should have left the docks then.</string>
<string name="1347">Many of the dock workers were afflicted - men I had come to know as friends. I stayed to ease their suffering, but in the end I could do nothing to save them from the Wailing Death. </string>
<string name="1348">The word spread quickly on the street. Perhaps I could have learned more before I left, but I had no interest in such transactions. I am a warrior, not a smuggler.</string>
<string name="1349">My father was an orc, and the blood of his inhuman race is in my veins. But I was raised by my mother among the tribes of the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="1350">There is little I can tell you about the city. Since the plague I have spent most of my days here seeking employment.</string>
<string name="1351">An Uthgardt warrior knows no fear, but I will not dishonor my tribe. I refuse to serve these men! I will not become a common thug or murderer! </string>
<string name="1352">Please forgive me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I became... lost in the moment. The drums of glory momentarily distracted me from the task at hand. It will not happen again.</string>
<string name="1353">As you command, &lt;Sir/Madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="1354">I... I mentioned my exile to you before, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The truth is, I did not willingly leave the Uthgardt to come to Neverwinter. The tribe cast me out.</string>
<string name="1355">I am a monstrous half-breed. As a child it was obvious my blood was tainted: I was violent and savage. It was only because of the pleas of my mother that the tribe did not slay me as an abomination while still an infant.</string>
<string name="1356">You don&apos;t understand. Not only am I different, I am half *orc*. The orcs are my tribe&apos;s most hated enemies; for generations they have warred with the Uthgardt. How could my tribe welcome me when I am a living reminder of their worst foe?
</string>
<string name="1357">I... I never knew my father. My mother never spoke of him, though I saw the pain in her eyes whenever I asked. But where the pain came from, I could not say.</string>
<string name="1358">Some in our tribe said he was a vile beast who forced himself on my mother during a raid. Others claimed my mother loved him and welcomed him to her bed, then wept when he was murdered by the warriors who discovered them.</string>
<string name="1359">The truth I shall never know, for it died with my mother last winter. At her death the tribe cast me out. Can you blame them? Why waste good provisions on a half-breed bastard yet to prove himself in the world?</string>
<string name="1360">My mother died last year and her tribe cast me out. Perhaps they feared I might betray them because of my father&apos;s vile, tainted blood. Or perhaps my existence reminded them of the crimes of their past.</string>
<string name="1361">I... I never knew my father. My mother never spoke of him, though I saw the pain in her eyes whenever I asked. But where the pain came from, I could not say.</string>
<string name="1362">Some in our tribe said he was a vile beast who forced himself on my mother during a raid. Others claimed my mother loved him and welcomed him to her bed, then wept when he was murdered by the warriors who found them together in her tent.</string>
<string name="1363">Whatever the truth, it died with my mother. As did my link to the tribe. I am no longer welcome there. Can you blame them? A half-breed bastard child yet to prove himself to the world?</string>
<string name="1364">I bear my tribe no ill will. They had little choice; until I prove myself they cannot be certain where my loyalties lie. Once I show the spirit of the Uthgardt is pure within me the Red Tiger tribe will welcome me back.</string>
<string name="1365">It is as you say. Until I prove myself the tribe cannot be certain where my loyalties lie. Once I show the spirit of the Uthgardt is pure within me the Red Tiger tribe will welcome me back.</string>
<string name="1366">And it is not as if they abandoned me in the cold. They gave me food and weapons before they sent me out into the world to prove myself. And a sacred talisman of the tribe once carried by my mother... </string>
<string name="1367">You are a half-orc, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You know the hatred that follows our kind. You know how the world sees us.</string>
<string name="1368">I thank you for your kind offer, but there is little you can do for me right now.</string>
<string name="1369">If I cannot turn to a fellow half-orc for help, then who in this world can I turn to? There is something troubling me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1370">My quest to prove my worth as an Uthgardt warrior has not yet begun, and already I fear I have failed.</string>
<string name="1371">We are both warriors, after all. If I cannot turn to my &lt;brother/sister&gt;-in-arms for aid, who in this world can I count on? There is something troubling me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1372">If I cannot turn to a fellow adventurer, who in this world can I turn to? There is something troubling me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1373">I am not the first Red Tiger warrior to be exiled in this way, though most who undertake a vision quest do so as punishment for committing some crime or transgression against the tribe.</string>
<string name="1374">I would tell you the details of my quest, &lt;FirstName&gt;, if I knew them myself. However, the quest is not known to me yet.</string>
<string name="1375">When the warrior is sent from the tribe he is given a special talisman. This talisman must remain by his side, for its magic brings the visions, and the visions illuminate his quest.</string>
<string name="1376">My talisman was a simple brooch worn by my mother, one of sentimental and spiritual value. Alas, I fear my quest will never be complete now, as the talisman - the key to my visions - is lost.</string>
<string name="1377">It happened shortly after I started work at the docks. I tried to keep a vigilant guard over the talisman, but the district is crawling with pickpockets and cutpurses.</string>
<string name="1378">Ever since it was stolen I have sought the brooch, but how can one locate such an object? It is unique, but of little monetary value. It may be that the thief who stole it threw it away when he realized how little it was worth.</string>
<string name="1379">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But for now we should return to the task at hand. Aribeth is counting on you.</string>
<string name="1380">Of course not, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. My blade is yours to command, as always.</string>
<string name="1381">I am afraid I cannot be much help in this matter, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know a little of the docks district but otherwise I know nothing of the city.</string>
<string name="1382">I cannot begin to guess where the cult we seek is hiding, though I suspect such evil could be found in the streets of Luskan.</string>
<string name="1383">I have little knowledge of these lands. My tribe is far from here, though I did pass through the Elk tribe territory near Fort Ilkard on my journey to Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="1384">When I first came to Neverwinter I worked as a guard in the docks district. It was a den of filth and sin, crawling with every kind of criminal. When the plague came things got even worse. </string>
<string name="1385">Ships were quarantined, trapping the crews in the city; many of these men are pirates and brigands. The numbers of dishonorable, dangerous men in the district swelled.</string>
<string name="1386">Between this and the plague, the city guard lost control of the district. Thugs and thieves rule the docks now.</string>
<string name="1387">Yes, we must get back to your mission. Aribeth is counting on you.</string>
<string name="1388">Before I left I heard talk of an auction to be held at Jim Seedy&apos;s tavern. Something unusual; not the standard contraband and slaves.</string>
<string name="1389">The word spread quickly on the street. Perhaps I could have learned more before I left, but I had no interest in such transactions. I am a warrior, not a smuggler.</string>
<string name="1390">There is nothing else I can think to tell you.</string>
<string name="1391">My mother&apos;s brooch! Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt; - I can never repay you for this gift.</string>
<string name="1392">I have no gold or treasure to reward you, but there is one thing I can offer. A small token, perhaps, but it is all I have.</string>
<string name="1393">Because of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, my vision quest can continue. I will keep my mother&apos;s brooch by my side so it may guide me on my quest.</string>
<string name="1394">But until I receive a vision to guide me on my quest I will remain by your side. Once more I thank you for finding my mother&apos;s brooch, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1395">I wish I had more to give you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know it might not look like much, but among the Uthgardt such an offering is considered a great gift.</string>
<string name="1396">That city is an evil place. Thieves and killers walk the streets in broad daylight, and gangs of thugs spread fear and violence in the name of the High Captains.</string>
<string name="1397">Luskan is run by several High Captains who each control sections of the city. An uneasy truce exists between these groups most of the time, but skirmishes and battles between the different factions are common.</string>
<string name="1398">If not for the threat of the Arcane Brotherhood, the High Captains&apos; simmering rivalry would boil over into open warfare.</string>
<string name="1399">I understand. We must keep our efforts focused on rooting out those responsible for the Neverwinter plague.</string>
<string name="1400">The wizards and necromancers of the Brotherhood are the true rulers of Luskan, or so it is said. The seat of Luskan&apos;s power lies in the dark bowels of the Host Tower, base of the Arcane Brotherhood.</string>
<string name="1401">I don&apos;t really know any more about the Arcane Brothers. There are some secrets in the world I am content not to delve into.</string>
<string name="1402">I don&apos;t know if the cult we seek is in Luskan, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I do know the city is a dangerous, violent place. More than that I can&apos;t really say.</string>
<string name="1403">I suppose the only way to find anything out for sure is to investigate. Rumors and guesses won&apos;t get us any closer to finding the cult.</string>
<string name="1404">The Elk tribe are of the Uthgardt people, as was my mother&apos;s own tribe, though their territory is to the south of Neverwinter. Like all the Uthgardt they are hunters and warriors who live off the land.</string>
<string name="1405">I have only met the leader of the Elk Tribe once, a great chieftain named Zokan Thunderer. He struck me as a noble and honorable man - a true Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="1406">I cannot imagine why the Elk tribe would suddenly ally itself with the Luskan forces. I sense there is something more to this, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1407">We Uthgardt are warriors, not savages. It is not our way to slaughter settlers and wage war upon Fort Ilkard without justification.</string>
<string name="1408">There is something strange behind the Elk tribe&apos;s alliance with Luskan. The only way you will solve this mystery, &lt;FirstName&gt;, is by going to Fort Ilkard.</string>
<string name="1409">After we parted ways in Neverwinter, I returned to the Trade of Blades to offer my skills for hire. It was there I was approached by Lady Aribeth on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.</string>
<string name="1410">Our instructions were simply to make ourselves available to whomever requires our assistance. So, in that spirit, is there anything I can do for you?</string>
<string name="1411">That city has long been an enemy of Neverwinter. An evil blight upon the North, it is widely acknowledged as the home of murders and thieves - a place with no honor!</string>
<string name="1412">It would not surprise me to discover links to the cult in that den of evil. Is there anything else I can help you with, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="1413">I am eager to have my revenge on the cult that loosed its plague on Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="1414">I am Daelan Red Tiger, a noble warrior of the Uthgardt Red Tiger tribe. No doubt you are here on the same mission Aarin Gend has assigned to me and my fellow mercenaries: to find the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="1415">The Elk tribe has allied itself with the Luskan forces. As incredible as it sounds, they have attacked Fort Ilkard and the settlers&apos; farms to the south.</string>
<string name="1416">I am of the Red Tiger tribe, but there are values and beliefs common to all the Uthgardt people. We are warriors and hunters, not bloodthirsty savages. The Uthgardt are a people of honor.</string>
<string name="1417">I believe some evil force is at work, a dark taint that has polluted the noble spirit of the Elk tribe. There can be no other explanation for their actions.</string>
<string name="1418">The Elk tribe has allied itself with the Luskan forces. As incredible as it sounds, they have attacked Fort Ilkard and the settlers&apos; farms to the south.</string>
<string name="1419">I am of the Red Tiger tribe, but there are values and beliefs common to all the Uthgardt people. We are warriors and hunters, not bloodthirsty savages. The Uthgardt are a people of honor.</string>
<string name="1420">I believe some evil force is at work - a dark taint that has polluted the noble spirit of the Elk tribe. There can be no other explanation for their actions.</string>
<string name="1421">I only mention the Elk tribe because you ask, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you allow me to join you once more, I will of course follow wherever you choose to go.</string>
<string name="1422">I know nothing of my father; my mother would never speak of him. But I was raised among the Red Tiger tribe in the customs and traditions of the Uthgardt people. I do not know what more I can tell you.</string>
<string name="1423">We Uthgardt are a simple but noble people. We hunt the herds and live off the land; we worship the gods of our ancestors and the totems of our tribes.</string>
<string name="1424">It was the closest city to our tribe, though I knew nothing of its foul, rotten character. If I had I would not have gone.</string>
<string name="1425">I have tried to forget my time in that accursed city, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The memories are not... pleasant.</string>
<string name="1426">As I told you, I went to Luskan in search of glory and honor - but there is no honor to be found in that wretched city.</string>
<string name="1427">At first I found a warm welcome in Luskan. Half-orcs are accepted there as nowhere else, and I quickly found work as a soldier serving one of the High Captain rulers of the city.</string>
<string name="1428">It was bloody, brutal work. Soldiers from different factions were always battling in the streets. Many men died by my hand during my weeks there.</string>
<string name="1429">I killed them because I was paid to kill them. Because they served a different master. There was no honor in these battles, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Only senseless, shameful death.</string>
<string name="1430">You don&apos;t understand, &lt;FirstName&gt;. All the killing, all the bloodshed - I *liked* it. It stirred my soul. Each morning I could taste the coming battles on my tongue and feel the rush of combat in my veins. </string>
<string name="1431">I reveled in the slaughter like an animal, like a beast. It fed the dark taint of my father&apos;s orc blood, and left a stain on my soul.</string>
<string name="1432">I do not know how far I would have fallen, had fate not intervened and saved me from myself.</string>
<string name="1433">My fury in battle earned me a promotion, and I was sent to the Luskan flesh markets to guard the slaves in their stockades.</string>
<string name="1434">My first night at the stockades, the guards brought in a new batch of slaves. Among them was an old man, naked and feeble. I recognized the tattoos on his face as the markings of an Uthgardt holy man.</string>
<string name="1435">I did not know him; he was from another tribe. But seeing him brought in, hands shackled behind his back, brought shame crashing down upon me.</string>
<string name="1436">At first I did nothing. The old man looked at me as he passed, and I saw in his eyes that he knew I was of the Uthgardt - and he knew what I had become.</string>
<string name="1437">Without warning the old man threw himself at the nearest guard; a foolish gesture of defiance, for he was still shackled and bound. He was knocked to the floor, and the guards began to beat him.</string>
<string name="1438">My world vanished beneath a veil of blood-red rage. When I came to my senses I stood bathed in gore; the other guards in the stockade all lay dead by my hand. </string>
<string name="1439">The old man lay bleeding on the floor, stabbed by one of the guards during the fight. As I crouched over him I saw his wounds were fatal. He gazed up at me and spoke in a voice choked with blood: &apos;Free the others.&apos;</string>
<string name="1440">With my axe I hacked away the chains of the other slaves in the stockades. Once they had all fled into the night I returned to the old man&apos;s side.</string>
<string name="1441">I thank you for your words, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And I would like to believe you. But I know what I did in Luskan. I know what vile appetites I fed.</string>
<string name="1442">I cannot deny my father&apos;s blood is within me. I can only hope to overcome this blight so that I may someday prove my spirit worthy of the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="1443">Only then will my tribe welcome me back. Until then this is my burden to bear... one of many.</string>
<string name="1444">I know the bloodlust is within me. I know what I am, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I cannot accept it.</string>
<string name="1445">Your words are unduly harsh, but you need not fear, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My blade shall never fail you in your time of need.</string>
<string name="1446">Forgive me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You have been a good friend to listen to my tale, but there are some things I am not yet ready to share with you.</string>
<string name="1447">I was not completely honest with you about the reasons I left my tribe. It is true I was sent away to prove myself. But there was another reason as well.</string>
<string name="1448">My mother&apos;s death was a violent one; she was brutally slain in a bandit raid on our camp. And I have vowed not to return to my tribe until I avenge her murder.</string>
<string name="1449">I was out hunting with a band of warriors when the attack came. The raiders hid and waited for us to leave, and then sneaked in with the advantage of numbers.</string>
<string name="1450">My tribe was outnumbered nearly two to one, but they managed to drive the attackers off. Three of our warriors fell in the battle - as did my mother.</string>
<string name="1451">Do you remember when I told you of my vision quest - how my mother&apos;s brooch would bring me dreams to guide my quest? Last night I had a dream.</string>
<string name="1452">My mother&apos;s spirit sent me this vision, I am certain of it. In my dream I saw a terrible axe dripping blood from its notched blade; it was the weapon used to slay her. If I can find the axe I will know I have found her killer.</string>
<string name="1453">You may think me a fool, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I believe I will find that axe. I must, or my mother&apos;s spirit will never truly be at peace!</string>
<string name="1454">You need not concern yourself. I shall follow your commands as always, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1455">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. With a friend like you by my side I have no doubt my mother&apos;s death will be avenged.</string>
<string name="1456">They told me there was a sinister dwarf among the bandits - one of many who escaped the battle. Then it is... over. My mother is avenged, and her spirit can finally rest. </string>
<string name="1457">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt; - once again you have proven yourself to be the greatest of friends. Words cannot properly explain the... the gratitude I feel.</string>
<string name="1458">I regret that I can offer you nothing as a reward but my thanks, my friendship, and my courage in battle.</string>
<string name="1459">Thank you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My mother is avenged and her spirit is at peace.</string>
<string name="1460">As I said, I regret I can give you nothing more. Now let us return to the task at hand. My mother is avenged, but those behind the Wailing Death must still be dealt with!</string>
<string name="1461">There are even those who say she was driven mad by Fenthick&apos;s execution, and is not aware of what she&apos;s doing. But I think something else drives her now.</string>
<string name="1462">And then lord Nasher sent her to Port Llast with Aarin Gend. It was obvious Lord Nasher wanted an excuse to send her away from the city.</string>
<string name="1463">I am not saying what Aribeth did was right, or even justified. But there is a tale among the Uthgardt, an ancient legend of consequences and betrayal.</string>
<string name="1464">Fenthick&apos;s execution and Aribeth&apos;s betrayal remind me of a tale of my own people. I only hope Neverwinter does not suffer the same fate as the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="1465">Many of my people&apos;s customs would be familiar to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We too are called barbarians, for we are tribal hunters and warriors who live off the land.</string>
<string name="1466">In ancient times all the Uthgardt tribes were one, a mighty nation under the great hero-king Uthgar.</string>
<string name="1467">Our people were indomitable in battle - none dared stand against Uthgar when he wielded his great spear. It is said no weapon could harm him when he brandished the spear over his head.</string>
<string name="1468">But against our greatness the armies of our enemies massed - goblins, orcs, ogres, and other creatures too foul to mention. A dark host marched forth from the mountains to battle Uthgar and his people.</string>
<string name="1469">According to the tale, there was a young boy who desired nothing more than to be a great hero of the Uthgardt. When news of the invasion came, he swore he would join the ranks of men as a warrior.</string>
<string name="1470">He was a mere child, not even a youth, and the warriors told him to stay with the woman and infants. But the boy was brave and stubborn, and he would not accept this.</string>
<string name="1471">The night before the battle, the boy crept into Uthgar&apos;s tent and stole his magic spear. Then the boy marched out in the darkness to face the horde alone. </string>
<string name="1472">But he was a child. He did not even know where he was going, and he soon became lost in the woods. In the morning, Uthgar woke to find his spear gone. He was forced to march against the enemy without it.</string>
<string name="1473">The battle raged fierce and bloody and many warriors fell before the enemy broke and fled. But even victory came with a terrible cost, for Uthgar - father of our people - was felled by an arrow through the eye.</string>
<string name="1474">After many days the boy found his way back to the camp. Those who saw him with the spear quickly understood what had happened and they blamed him for Uthgar&apos;s death. They cast him out forever, banishing him from the tribe.</string>
<string name="1475">The boy fled, taking the spear with him. He had only wanted to prove himself a warrior, he had only wanted to help defend the tribe. His motives were honorable.</string>
<string name="1476">But his actions had tragic consequences, and the Uthgardt could not forgive him. Just as Neverwinter could not forgive Fenthick. But the tale does not end there.</string>
<string name="1477">The boy vanished; he was never seen again - and neither was Uthgar&apos;s Spear, the symbol and source of the Uthgardt nation&apos;s power and might.</string>
<string name="1478">Without the spear my people were vulnerable, and our enemies fell upon us. The great nation of the Uthgardt was splintered into small tribes. Never again would we know the glory of our past.</string>
<string name="1479">Had the Uthgardt forgiven the boy, he and the spear would have remained and the empire would have stayed strong. Had Neverwinter forgiven Fenthick, Aribeth might not have betrayed the city she loved.</string>
<string name="1480">There is more to the legend of Uthgar&apos;s Spear, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1481">As you know, I am on a vision quest to prove myself a true Uthgardt warrior. Last night I had a vision to guide me on my quest.</string>
<string name="1482">I have seen the spear in my dreams. According to the legends of my people, the Uthgardt tribes will never be united until Uthgar&apos;s Spear is found.</string>
<string name="1483">I have come to believe it is the will of the gods that I stay by your side. You found my mother&apos;s brooch; you avenged her murder. I cannot help but feel you are destined to help me in this as well.</string>
<string name="1484">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your promise means much to me, for you are a &lt;man/woman&gt; of true honor. I know my quest will end in success.</string>
<string name="1485">But for now we must focus on finding the Words of Power. Aarin Gend is counting on us.</string>
<string name="1486">I have vowed to serve you as long as you have need of my blade, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will not forsake that vow.</string>
<string name="1487">Yes - this is the spear from my dreams! Uthgar&apos;s Spear! Because of you I can return to my people with proof my spirit is worthy of the Red Tiger tribe!</string>
<string name="1488">The talisman has powerful magical properties, though I know it is hardly a suitable reward for all you have done for me. Alas, the only other thing I can offer you is my continued service.</string>
<string name="1489">I long to return to my people, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and reclaim my place among my tribe. But I will not abandon you, or break my promise to serve.</string>
<string name="1490">As long as you have need of me I will stay by your side and aid you in the search for the Words of Power. Only after they have been recovered will I return to my tribe.</string>
<string name="1491">I suspect the Uthgardt are much like your people, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We are both barbarians, are we not?</string>
<string name="1492">But I also vow that I will not rest until I find the axe with the notched blade that slew my mother. </string>
<string name="1493">Now let us return to the task at hand - those behind the Wailing Death must still be dealt with!</string>
<string name="1494">I will bring Uthgar&apos;s Spear back to my tribe and present it to our Council of Elders. I have no doubt they will declare my spirit worthy of the Red Tiger tribe.</string>
<string name="1495">I imagine my chieftain will summon an inter-tribal council so that all the Uthgardt tribes will know the artifact has been found. This is an event of great importance to my people, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1496">According to the legends, the return of Uthgar&apos;s Spear heralds the return of Uthgar himself, to be born among our tribes. They say it signals a return to the glory of our ancient past.</string>
<string name="1497">I cannot say for certain. Perhaps I will be hailed as a hero and showered with riches and honors by the chieftains of my people.</string>
<string name="1498">Or perhaps I will simply be welcomed back into the tribe. The elders could allow me to take a wife and raise a son of my own amongst the Uthgardt people.</string>
<string name="1499">Either would be pleasing to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have proven myself worthy and for the first time I feel truly at peace with my place in the world.</string>
<string name="1500">I am beginning to wonder if I chose a poor &lt;master/mistress&gt; to serve. I became... lost in the moment. It will not happen again.</string>
<string name="1501">Your words are cruel, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You speak the truth, but you do so only to hurt. Among my people such cruelty is frowned upon.</string>
<string name="1502">I think we need to change your tactics.</string>
<string name="1503">I think I&apos;ll do better off on my own.</string>
<string name="1504">I want to change the distance you stay away from me.</string>
<string name="1505">Stay close.</string>
<string name="1506">Keep a medium distance.</string>

<string name="1915">We may come across some ashes, who knows?</string>
<string name="1916">Keep your mind on your duty to me.</string>
<string name="1917">I really doubt Halasahr would be happy with that... </string>
<string name="1918">Me haves ashes of Uthgardt. Maybe they&apos;s okay?</string>
<string name="1919">We could finds ashes. Who knows?</string>
<string name="1920">You keeps mind on stuff you do for me.</string>
<string name="1921">Me doubt wizard be happy for that... </string>
<string name="1922">Thank you, Tomi.</string>
<string name="1923">That&apos;s it? A ring?</string>
<string name="1924">Me thank you for this, Tomi.</string>
<string name="1925">This be all? Me get ring?</string>
<string name="1926">You want to become a wizard now?</string>
<string name="1927">Oh... I wouldn&apos;t look him up, if I were you.</string>
<string name="1928">You&apos;re not going anywhere!</string>
<string name="1929">You wants to be wizard now?</string>
<string name="1930">Oh... me suggest you not looks him up.</string>
<string name="1931">You not goes anywhere!</string>
<string name="1932">I rather doubt you&apos;ll find anyone else of my skill available, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. You seem like a fine sort of &lt;man/woman&gt;, however, so let me say, ummm, 150 gold pieces?</string>
<string name="1933">Eh? What can Tomi do for ya?</string>
<string name="1934">If you feel that&apos;s best. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="1935">Oh? How far do you want me?</string>
<string name="1936"></string>
<string name="1937">Sure can. When do you want me to heal ya, then?</string>
<string name="1938">Wha-aat? Are you kidding me? You want to break up a great team?</string>
<string name="1939">Well, fine. Tomi Undergallows has better things to do. I&apos;m sure someone will hire me any day now.</string>
<string name="1940">Why, hullo there! You have the smell of a prospective employer about you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Not that it&apos;s easy to smell anything with all the burning corpses in this city, mind you. Never seen this many flies outside of a Calimshite alehouse.</string>
<string name="1941">Good, good! I smell adventure at hand! Or I need to wash my socks, one of the two... </string>
<string name="1942">I rather doubt you&apos;ll find anyone else of my skill available, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. 200 gold pieces seems like a fair bargain, don&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="1943">I rather doubt you&apos;ll find anyone else of my skill available, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. I think, ummm, 250 gold pieces should be sufficient.</string>
<string name="1944">Oh dear, it seems that the brain squirrels have been storing their nuts again.</string>
<string name="1945">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmmm... how about we split the difference. 125?</string>
<string name="1946">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Do I look like I just got off the last boat from the Moonshaes? I know how dangerous you adventurous types are. 150 or no love from Tomi!</string>
<string name="1947">Slave? Whoooa, I charge way more for *that*. Remember... the word is &apos;henchman&apos;. &apos;Lackey&apos; and &apos;peon&apos; will also do... and no, I won&apos;t call you &apos;&lt;master/mistress&gt;&apos;.</string>
<string name="1948">I&apos;ll tag along with you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, as best as I know how... unless you tell me otherwise. If you want me to do something different, just give me a shout, aye?</string>
<string name="1949">I rather doubt you&apos;ll find anyone else of my skill available, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Tell you what, however... since you&apos;re a fellow halfling, I&apos;ll be glad to work out a deal. 150 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="1950">Oh, ...the things I&apos;m going to do to you.</string>
<string name="1951">Specify if this creature can be damaged but cannot die</string>
<string name="1952">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmmm... how about we split the difference. 175?</string>
<string name="1953">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmmm... how about we split the difference. 225?</string>
<string name="1954">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Do I look like I just got off the last boat from the Moonshaes? I know how dangerous you adventurous types are. 200 or no love from Tomi!</string>
<string name="1955">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Do I look like I just got off the last boat from the Moonshaes? I know how dangerous you adventurous types are. 250 or no love from Tomi!</string>
<string name="1956">Fair enough. Back to the adventure!</string>
<string name="1957">Oh, fine, fine. I&apos;ll hang about here for a little while, then, just in case you change your mind.</string>
<string name="1958">If you feel that is best. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="1959">How far away do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="1960">All righty! Close it is. Just make sure you keep up with the laundry, aye?</string>
<string name="1961">Okey-dokey. Medium distance it is.</string>
<string name="1962">What? Do I smell? Well, fine, have it your way, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="1963">Something else?</string>
<string name="1964">Something else?</string>
<string name="1965"></string>
<string name="1966"></string>
<string name="1967"></string>
<string name="1968">You&apos;re the boss.</string>
<string name="1969">But what if we miss something? Like... like gold! But fine, fine... I won&apos;t argue with ya.</string>
<string name="1970">I can do that! Consider my beady little eyes peeled!</string>
<string name="1971">Yep. Just remember that I&apos;m still about, okay? The high-pitched scream will be me.</string>
<string name="1972">Hmph. Well I guess I don&apos;t have to skulk *all* the time.</string>
<string name="1973">Absolutely! My lockpicks are twirling and ready to go!</string>
<string name="1974">I guess if you *think* you don&apos;t need my help... </string>
<string name="1975">You were expecting me to work for free? What do I look like? An elf?! Pfffft! Come back when you find a few coins.</string>
<string name="1976">So you&apos;ve come back, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;! Looking for a short lad to tickle your feet? Or did ya change your mind about needing a rogue at your side?</string>
<string name="1977">Hullo there! &lt;FullName&gt;, isn&apos;t it? Wow... the savior of Neverwinter! Would you sign my napkin? It&apos;s a bit greasy... and mind the chicken... </string>
<string name="1978">Heya, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;! Decided to wander back to Tomi Undergallows once again, did ya?</string>
<string name="1979">Well, now, if it isn&apos;t &lt;FirstName&gt;! Glad I am to see you! Isn&apos;t the country wonderful this time of year? So much better than the city with all that... umm... burning and dying. You know.</string>
<string name="1980">Heya, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. You&apos;re that &lt;FirstName&gt;, ain&apos;t ya? Mister Gend told me you&apos;re some kind of hero, the savior of Neverwinter or sommat.</string>
<string name="1981">Nice to see ya again, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. That cheerful Gend fellow brought you here, too, huh? Looking for some Words of Power or sommat?</string>
<string name="1982">Hullo again, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Decided you gots need for a sneak-thief to accompany you now, huh?</string>
<string name="1983">I figured they&apos;d drag your carcass back here eventually, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. You need me to come with ya again?</string>
<string name="1984">Sorry... I&apos;m here with someone else, don&apos;t&apos;cha know.</string>
<string name="1985">It was so strange, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... there was this bright tunnel, and my mother was there... and then it was like &apos;yoink! Not yet, stupid!&apos; and I was back here. Weird, huh? So do ya need my help again?</string>
<string name="1986">So let&apos;s negotiate a bit, shall we? I can place my superior skills of theft, lockpicking and swordplay at your disposal for any task you choose, providing you can provide me with a nice payment now.</string>
<string name="1987">IGNORE THIS STARTING CONDITION. THIS IS USED AS A TRASH FOR UNWANTED LINKS. DO NOT DELETE THESE LINKS. </string>
<string name="1988">Oops! I hear that&apos;s the first sign of the plague. Tsk. If you don&apos;t die some wretched death, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, come back sometime and we&apos;ll make a deal, aye?</string>
<string name="1989">I can forgive you for not having heard of me, however. I hail most recently from Calimport... and that&apos;s a long way for even my reputation to travel. I give it another week, personally.</string>
<string name="1990">Fortunately, my stay in Neverwinter&apos;s fine prison system was a short one. I didn&apos;t arrange for my escape, oddly enough, but I was glad for it nevertheless.</string>
<string name="1991">Oh? A mission, is it? My little pinky toes are quivering with curiosity! Or is that my danger sense? Hmm... that would go a long way toward explaining my recklessness. Oh well. What kind of mission are you on?</string>
<string name="1992">So not only a mission, but a legitimate heroic deed performed for the benefit of a cute elf. I hear ya, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. I&apos;d be glad to help out... for the right price.</string>
<string name="1993">Ahhh, which makes you some kind of secret agent for the lovely elven lass? Must be exciting! I&apos;d be glad to help out... for the right price.</string>
<string name="1994">The exact goings-on within the prison I&apos;m not entirely aware of, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. To tell the truth, I had only been in the prison for a few days and was just starting to think about how depressing life was when it all began.</string>
<string name="1995">I really can&apos;t say. Some of the other fellows were talking like there was some powerful prisoner who was controlling the warden and making him do these things... sounds too strange to me.</string>
<string name="1996">Come to think of it, I saw more than a few people getting attacked in the street in broad daylight. If you head to that part of town, you might want to take someone along who knows the roads, aye?</string>
<string name="1997">I know a little bit about the Peninsula district, however. It&apos;s all a bit fleeting, seeing as I was running through it at the time, but what do you expect from someone who escaped from the prison there?</string>
<string name="1998">Modesty, eh? How&apos;s that working out for ya? If I were you, I&apos;d take advantage of the notoriety while you have it. Three months from now they&apos;ll turn you away from the door at McBarnaby&apos;s, saying &quot;&lt;FirstName&gt; who?&quot;</string>
<string name="1999">Me, I&apos;m Tomi Undergallows. Grin to my friends... Tomi Grin to my other friends. I&apos;ve been hired by Miss Aribeth, there, to help find these nasty cultist-types.</string>
<string name="2000">Yes, I... know that. You&apos;re drooling on my napkin, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... </string>
<string name="2001">Uh-huh. Toodle-loo!</string>
<string name="2002">Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?</string>
<string name="2003">Anyhow, Miss Aribeth heaped a bunch of coin on me to come join this search. Pretty sweet job, so far.</string>
<string name="2004">Well, I wouldn&apos;t get a lot done running off on my own, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Heck, I was just told to come here and wait until somebody needed me.</string>
<string name="2005">I&apos;m no hero like you are, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... though I am a darn good rogue, if I do say so myself.</string>
<string name="2006">This town is kind of boring. So far I&apos;ve counted fourteen chickens that crossed the road. I suppose, if you needed me, I&apos;d be happy to tag along with ya.</string>
<string name="2007">Nothing more than anyone, no. You ask me, though, Luskan&apos;s the place to look.</string>
<string name="2008">Oh, aye. The city has pirates and thieves galore... anyone with any kind of bad reputation is more than welcome there, I assure you. Been there a few times, myself.</string>
<string name="2009">What better place for a frog to hide than amongst toads? Not that I&apos;ve any evidence to back that up, or anything.</string>
<string name="2010">All righty, then, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... I&apos;m all yours. If ya need me to do something other than what I&apos;m doing, just give me a shout.</string>
<string name="2011">I&apos;m always useful. Seeing as I&apos;ve gained a bit of skill, though, let me sit down for a moment... then I can show you what I can do now.</string>
<string name="2012">Oh? What did you have in mind, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="2013">Okey-dokey. We got plenty to keep us busy, anyway, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="2014">Well... maybe just a little. After all, it&apos;s not like there&apos;s enough employers alive right now that I have them beating down my door, aye? And anyway... I didn&apos;t have to chase you, much.</string>
<string name="2015">Yeah, well, what&apos;s a halfling supposed to do? Me, I go where the money is.</string>
<string name="2016">Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?</string>
<string name="2017">I&apos;ve already been paid by Miss Aribeth... and good coin, too, I might add. You&apos;d think this Nasher fellow belched gold at will.</string>
<string name="2018">Okey-dokey! If you find yourself in need of a rougue, I&apos;m already bought and paid for... just need to know where the party is.</string>
<string name="2019">Besides a bath? Suit yourself, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2020">Well, isn&apos;t it a coincidence that I happen to be a good rogue? Fine... this one-rabbit town was beginning to bore me, anyway.</string>
<string name="2021">Nothing more than anyone, no. You ask me, though, Luskan&apos;s the place to look.</string>
<string name="2022">Uh-huh. Fame can be a tricky mistress, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. I should know, as Tomi&apos;s a halfling who&apos;s been on the lips of everyone in Calimport... an&apos; paid the price, too.</string>
<string name="2023">Aye, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Run off and do your hero business.</string>
<string name="2024">Well, I don&apos;t know if &apos;working&apos; is really correct. I was, ah, caught doing something I shouldn&apos;t somewhere where I wasn&apos;t supposed to be. So Mister Gend didn&apos;t leave me much choice.</string>
<string name="2025">Not that I mind all that much, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. This is an easy job, come to think of it.</string>
<string name="2026">Me? Heck no. You might want to trot off to the Coldwood and check it out, though.</string>
<string name="2027">Sheesh. What do I look like? Some bloodhound? Tell ya what... if you need my help, I&apos;d be happy to search with you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2028">Hokey-dokey, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2029">Well, it&apos;s up to you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Trot on back if ya change your mind.</string>
<string name="2030">I was gonna take a long hike and look around for my old friend, Sammy... I bet he&apos;s around here somewheres... but somehow I knew we&apos;d bump into each other again.</string>
<string name="2031">Well, it&apos;s not like I&apos;m shadowing ya or anything, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. If I were, you wouldn&apos;t see me at all. Have it your way, though.</string>
<string name="2032">Well, to make the story short I kind of was caught doing something I shouldn&apos;t when I was somewhere I shouldn&apos;t have been... so Mister Gend said I had to come and help here, or else.</string>
<string name="2033">Figures that you&apos;d be here, too, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, with you being a great hero and all. Bet you didn&apos;t have to come like I did, either.</string>
<string name="2034">Hokey-dokey, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2035">Well, it&apos;s up to you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Trot on back if ya change your mind.</string>
<string name="2036">Me? Heck no. You might want to trot off to the Coldwood and check it out, though.</string>
<string name="2037">Great! Let&apos;s, um, avoid that tunnel for a bit, though, aye?</string>
<string name="2038">Okey-dokey. You know where I&apos;ll be.</string>
<string name="2039">Lead the way!</string>
<string name="2040">Well, you know where I&apos;ll be, then.</string>
<string name="2041">You know how it goes, I&apos;m sure. Rob some over-fat human caliph with piggy lips, kiss his daughter as a lark before you escape with the loot, and suddenly you&apos;re the most wanted man in Calimshan.</string>
<string name="2042">How was I supposed to know that he was so sensitive about his daughter? I still say it was worth it. That took flair, and I have flair! Too bad Neverwinter didn&apos;t treat me any better, at first.</string>
<string name="2043">Nothing too wrong with having a bit of a reputation, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Keeps the flies from settling, if you know what I mean. If the heat gets too high, you just step out of the kitchen, right?</string>
<string name="2044">Neverwinter seemed a fine enough city for an enterprising young halfling like myself... on the surface, anyway. You&apos;d be surprised at what people get away with, here.</string>
<string name="2045">They can take a perfectly innocent man, accuse him of simple pickpocketing, and throw him in prison without even so much as a trial. Or not a very fair one, anyway. That judge was mean.</string>
<string name="2046">More likely he was brain-sick with the plague. The entire Peninsula district is in an uproar, however. I don&apos;t think the local constabulary has it under control, either.</string>
<string name="2047">Unless you&apos;re sneaking up for a good backstab or in the sack with a pretty miss, I really don&apos;t see the need for restraint. Silence is for the dead... although I hear they can be a bit chatty, too, at times.</string>
<string name="2048">Questions, eh? To be honest, I&apos;m not that big on Neverwinter just yet. I was trying to make some contacts earlier, but they just kept *dying*. How annoying is that?</string>
<string name="2049">I left the area quickly, of course, and wound up here at the temple... nice safe place t&apos; be. Last I heard, them prisoners were all tearing up the Peninsula district, making a royal mess. Mmm, not the lawyers, though... they were just overcharging.</string>
<string name="2050">Hmm. I guess I can tell you a bit about the Peninsula district, if you want... but I&apos;m not very familiar with the rest of the city.</string>
<string name="2051">Well, if I was a cult, you know where I would hide? Luskan. The City of Sails, home to every pirate, smuggler, lawyer and all-around ne&apos;er-do-well north of Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="2052">Whoa... I don&apos;t know much about these areas, myself. I&apos;m just following you, remember, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;? Although I guess I know a bit about the Coldwood... </string>
<string name="2053">Well... the prison itself be the most prominent part of the district, aye? Anything interesting that goes on there is bound to be tied up with the prison, somehow.</string>
<string name="2054">When I escaped, a bunch of the fellows being held there had taken the warden over... and the prison, too. There was something fishy about the whole thing.</string>
<string name="2055">You&apos;d think the city guard would take control of the prison back... but they&apos;ve got too much on their plate with the plague, I guess.</string>
<string name="2056">Okey-dokey.</string>
<string name="2057">No, I don&apos;t think so, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Best to avoid the district altogether.</string>
<string name="2058">I mean, who would notice a few extra murders in a place like that? Last time I was there, if the pirates weren&apos;t chopping people up in the streets, the High Captains were.</string>
<string name="2059">Aye. There be five High Captains, ex-pirates all, who rule the city with an iron fist. Why there&apos;s five and not just one, I have no idea.</string>
<string name="2060">Mind you, they don&apos;t really rule Luskan. Anyone who knows anything about Luskan knows that the Arcane Brotherhood really runs the show.</string>
<string name="2061">Hokey-dokey. You go do your hero thing, then.</string>
<string name="2062">Ahhh, it&apos;s just some group of evil wizards bent on dominating the world. You know... the usual wizard stuff. They&apos;re led by some guy called the &apos;Archmage Arcane&apos;, I think.</string>
<string name="2063">If I remember right, they&apos;re all bottled up in the Host Tower, which sits just off the coast on a little island. Never come out, very secretive... that sort of thing.</string>
<string name="2064">Well, Luskan&apos;s not a very welcoming place... especially for us demi-humans. It&apos;s mostly all just really nasty human folk with no better place to be.</string>
<string name="2065">If the cult is there, they could be anywhere, I&apos;m guessing. Seems to me that somebody in Luskan would know something, though.</string>
<string name="2066">Well, I passed through there a few months back. Had a little gnome for a guide who talked and talked about the places we passed through. Couldn&apos;t get the little bugger to shut up, really.</string>
<string name="2067">There&apos;s some orcs round those parts who serve some great chieftain who calls himself a king. Obould or somethin&apos;. Merciless and nasty fellow.</string>
<string name="2068">Anyway, he mentioned a few ruins in the woods. Really old ones, too. One of them belonged to a wizard who collected strange things... maybe she was fond of words? I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="2069">I hear they&apos;ve been busy attacking merchants and caravans an&apos; the like. Maybe they&apos;re mixed up with the cult, an&apos; maybe they know more about them magic words. Worth a shot, I suppose.</string>
<string name="2070">My guide said there&apos;s lots of places in the Coldwood which are really old, places where nobody goes anymore. If these Words of Power are old and lost... I don&apos;t know, maybe it&apos;s the place to look for &apos;em.</string>
<string name="2071">After you and I went our separate ways, Miss Aribeth there approached me and gave me plenty of money to hop along on this pony ride of hers. We&apos;re all supposed to help with the search.</string>
<string name="2072">I was just told that I&apos;m supposed to help out wherever I can. How sweet and unspecific is that? I, uh, don&apos;t suppose you actually want something, do you?</string>
<string name="2073">Oh, aye. The city has pirates and thieves galore... anyone with any kind of bad reputation is more than welcome there, I assure you. Been there a few times, myself.</string>
<string name="2074">What better place for a frog to hide than amongst toads? Not that I&apos;ve any evidence to back that up, or anything.</string>
<string name="2075">This job of Miss Aribeth&apos;s... looking for them cult fellows... it&apos;s been pretty sweet so far. Haven&apos;t had to do much &apos;cept stare at people all suspicious-like.</string>
<string name="2076">But who am I to tell ya what to do? Mister Gend says you&apos;re here to do the same as the rest of us: find these Words of Power. I wonder if anyone&apos;s checked the library... </string>
<string name="2077">Well, there&apos;s always tales of strange things out in those woods. I passed through more than a month back, and I remember seeing some ruins off the path.</string>
<string name="2078">My guide said they belonged to some wealthy mage who locked herself away in there long ago... and that she used to collect a lot of strange things. So who knows?</string>
<string name="2079">I heard about a whole lot of orcs in the area, too, serving some big fella who calls himself King Obould. Could be they could tell ya about them magic words, who knows?</string>
<string name="2080">Well, there&apos;s always tales of strange things out in those woods. I passed through more than a month back, and I remember seeing some ruins off the path.</string>
<string name="2081">My guide said they belonged to some wealthy mage who locked herself away in there long ago... and that she used to collect a lot of strange things. So who knows?</string>
<string name="2082">Old acquaintance of mine is in that area, too. Name&apos;s Vaash. I wouldn&apos;t trust him further than I could throw him (which ain&apos;t far), but he knows the Coldwood well.</string>
<string name="2083">Well, you strike me as a bit of a rogue yourself, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Sometimes a reputation deserves to be run from, aye? Like a giant ogre with big feet and poor eyesight.</string>
<string name="2084">Oh, I don&apos;t think the Calimshites would mind, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. The way they dress, it be a kindness to talk instead about their foul ale.</string>
<string name="2085">Oh, to be honest, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, I be far more frightened to take a swig of Calimshite ale. You&apos;d be lucky to wake up three days later hugging the back end of a camel, I&apos;d wager.</string>
<string name="2086">Heh... it means I be bloody glad to be out of Calimshan and anywhere else, even here! Now, about that employer business... </string>
<string name="2087">Me? Why, I&apos;m none other than the renowned rogue, Tomi Undergallows! &quot;Grin&quot; to my friends, &quot;Tomi Grin&quot; to the lasses, and &quot;that damned halfling&quot; to anyone in a position of respectable authority.</string>
<string name="2088">Well, I use the word &quot;kissing&quot; loosely, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Trouble was, the lass was set to marry the Pasha&apos;s son... so long as she was a virgin. Ah, well.</string>
<string name="2089">Technically, I suppose I am. Trust me, however: they have so many other things to worry about in that prison, even if they thought I wasn&apos;t dead they wouldn&apos;t trouble with me.</string>
<string name="2090">Considering my profession, that&apos;s quite a fine line you draw there. Have it your way, however. If you change your mind, we&apos;ll chat again.</string>
<string name="2091">The warden of the place began babbling some nonsense and started releasing all the prisoners. Even the truly despicable types: murderers, politicians, lawyers, you name it.</string>
<string name="2092">Aww, now that is a shame. Well, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, don&apos;t let zombies eat your brains or anything. I hear it&apos;s bad for one&apos;s health.</string>
<string name="2093">Oh? It&apos;s a bit strange to have you ask me that, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Most people think they know Tomi Undergallows well enough through his reputation.</string>
<string name="2094">In Calimport, the tales of my deeds were the daily fodder of old men in the taverns. I do not speak of heroic acts, however... I am a halfling of the underworld, if you remember.</string>
<string name="2095">Ha ha! Don&apos;t get me wrong, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... I may not be the heroic type, but it&apos;s not as if I run about stealing children and kicking puppies.</string>
<string name="2096">No, no, Tomi Undergallows may follow the scent of gold and fame wherever it leads, but I&apos;ve no dastardly tales to singe the ears off the pious just yet.</string>
<string name="2097">Then you&apos;re a &lt;man/woman&gt; after my own heart. While there&apos;s often good reasons to do anything, the best are always gold and fame.</string>
<string name="2098">I&apos;ve done plenty, myself, in search of those two. Had both in ample quantities and lost them more than once, you know.</string>
<string name="2099">Oh, nothing so sordid and evil as you might guess. I&apos;ve had fame and fortune a&apos;plenty more than once... and lost it all just as often.</string>
<string name="2100">My most famous exploit, in fact, is one of the reasons I chose to come to Neverwinter when I fled from Calimshan.</string>
<string name="2101">You see, I&apos;d spent the larger part of my years in Calimport in the employ of a powerful medusa. She was a great power in the city&apos;s underworld and that is no small feat for anyone, statue-making gaze or no.</string>
<string name="2102">Quite serious. She had a fine head for business and was as ruthless as any cold-hearted shiyk. Not as good with the face-to-face negotiations, though, if you take my meaning.</string>
<string name="2103">True. She was a spiteful one, I&apos;ll grant you that. Had a great head for business, though, and a bad hair day that could bite you back.</string>
<string name="2104">I was in her employ to run... errands. Burglaries, message deliveries, walking her cat, assassinations, that sort of thing. I did my job well, too, and was well-known for it.</string>
<string name="2105">The job that made me famous, however, was the last one she gave me. I was to infiltrate the house of the famous vizier Sabbalan Viheyed... and kill him!</string>
<string name="2106">If it&apos;s any consolation, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, I doubt I killed anyone who didn&apos;t deserve it. In Calimport, you do what you can to survive.</string>
<string name="2107">I was, though not in the manner you&apos;re probably suspecting. There&apos;s far more to that story than I&apos;ve told.</string>
<string name="2108">We&apos;ve business to undertake, I suppose. Perhaps I&apos;d best tell the rest of the story another time. What do you say to that, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="2109">Wow, you&apos;re more impatient than a drunk cameldriver in line at the salt market, aren&apos;t you? Ask me another time and I&apos;ll tell ya everything.</string>
<string name="2110">Hokey-dokey. Lead on, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;!</string>
<string name="2111">Well, as I recall, you are the one who asked... so that&apos;s entirely up to you. Lead on!</string>
<string name="2112">What&apos;s this? Oh, right. Where was I? Was I telling you about my infiltration of the house of the great vizier Sabbalan Viheyed? Yes, I believe I was.</string>
<string name="2113">This was no ordinary mission, my friend. Sabbalan had stymied the efforts of my medusan patroness for many years... he was a mage of no little power.</string>
<string name="2114">Sending me to kill him was both a vote of confidence in my abilities and, I thought, a near-certain sentence of death. Looking me in the eyes would have been cleaner.</string>
<string name="2115">It was not as if I were given a choice. With my patroness, you had the option of succeeding or of becoming the newest addition to her garden statuary.</string>
<string name="2116">Oh, yes, of course. To be honest it was what I lived for at the time. Tomi the Daring, they called me! The possibility of being turned into a statue if I failed did put things into perspective, to boot.</string>
<string name="2117">I did say it was the job that made me famous, didn&apos;t I? And anyway... the threat of being turned into a short statue was rather an incentive to succeed.</string>
<string name="2118">Perhaps it&apos;s fortunate that us halflings aren&apos;t given much credit. I was able to squirm my way into the vizier&apos;s service as a kitchen boy, and nobody gave me a second thought.</string>
<string name="2119">For over a month, I was pleased to serve the vizier his meals. I spent my time studying him, looking for a way to kill him cleanly... and he barely even noticed my presence.</string>
<string name="2120">I would have, I suppose... except that he ate his meals with his daughter, and that made things a bit complicated.</string>
<string name="2121">Normally, yes. The vizier ate his meals with his daughter, however, and er... she did notice me.</string>
<string name="2122">About the vizier? No, not really. He was a cruel man with political ambitions. His daughter, on the other hand... well, that&apos;s a different story.</string>
<string name="2123">His daughter... ahhh, the sweet lass. Saida was her name. Human, to be sure, but she never looked down upon me.</string>
<string name="2124">I suppose I delayed killing Sabbalan at the time just to continue being around her, though I didn&apos;t think that at the time. There was just one more excuse after another.</string>
<string name="2125">The months grew longer, and Saida and I grew closer. She couldn&apos;t resist my charms, of course, heh... no lass can, when I put my mind to it. We had to be secret about it... I was, of course, just the kitchen boy.</string>
<string name="2126">Oh, aye, I dreaded the thought of it, but my patroness was already threatening to turn me into a statue and let the pigeons have their way with me.</string>
<string name="2127">Oh, aye. I couldn&apos;t let Saida find out who I was... yet my patroness was growing impatient. Wait too long and I&apos;d be a Tomi statue with the pigeons having their way with me.</string>
<string name="2128">Oh, I don&apos;t know about that. I thought so at the time, sure enough. My patroness kept threatening to turn me into a statue and let the pigeons have their way with me, however.</string>
<string name="2129">I was young and foolish and stupid, however... three traits that are great in a buxom lass but poor in an assassin. I decided I couldn&apos;t hurt Saida by killing her father and told my patroness to go look in the mirror.</string>
<string name="2130">Needless to say, she didn&apos;t take it well.</string>
<string name="2131">Well, she&apos;s an evil woman with snakes for hair and a look that killed... what do you think she did about it?</string>
<string name="2132">The girl wasn&apos;t going anywhere... trust me, I tried. Come to think of it, the mage wasn&apos;t all that easy to kill, either... </string>
<string name="2133">Well, fortunately you don&apos;t turn your closest friends into pottery. My patroness wasn&apos;t exactly the life of the party, you know.</string>
<string name="2134">My medusa patroness decided to take matters into her own hands, of course. Heh... if I&apos;d known, I would have left Calimport a lot earlier.</string>
<string name="2135">Hey, hey hey! Slow down there, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;! Don&apos;t you go getting ahead of yourself or anything, sheesh.</string>
<string name="2136">It certainly didn&apos;t look that way at the time, I&apos;ll grant you that, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2137">At any rate... it&apos;s a bit of a story. I&apos;ll tell you the rest some other time. Let&apos;s just keep on with your quest, for now.</string>
<string name="2138">Oh, fine, fine. Picture this, then, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;: there I was lying in the arms of my human sweetie, completely unaware my angry patroness was on her way.</string>
<string name="2139">I was also unaware that at the same time my sweetie&apos;s father, the vizier, had been tipped off to my presence by an old rival of mine.</string>
<string name="2140">Both the wizard and the medusa were descending on the tower determined to kill me, and I was contentedly asleep in the hay, naked as a jaybird.</string>
<string name="2141">Yes, well, being naked in the hay can leave you picking straw out of your... oh, you probably mean the coming-to-kill me thing. No, no, that wasn&apos;t good.</string>
<string name="2142">You&apos;d think so, but you&apos;d be wrong. All I knew at the time was that sleeping in hay isn&apos;t as comfortable as you&apos;d think, even with a gal on your arm.</string>
<string name="2143">Ha ha! Wait, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... it&apos;s about to get much worse than that.</string>
<string name="2144">So I am lying there with my big smile, aye? Suddenly, BAM! The door to the loft flies open, and there is the great vizier full of rage!</string>
<string name="2145">Oh, no. I&apos;d already taken her virtue, and I wasn&apos;t aware of any honor, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. No, no, I hid behind her and screamed in terror like a banshee. Not the most heroic picture, I&apos;ll admit.</string>
<string name="2146">Fought him? With what, my dashing smile? I hid behind his daughter and screamed in terror like a banshee. Not the most heroic picture, I&apos;ll admit.</string>
<string name="2147">I darted through his legs and fled naked into the streets. Before I knew it, the vizier was chasing me through half the city, firing off lightning bolts and curses at a rapid pace.</string>
<string name="2148">My patroness was also a bit miffed to see us breeze past her, and she too took up the chase. Her fury grew and grew as we stayed ahead of her.</string>
<string name="2149">I ran for all I was worth, but bugger me if that wizard couldn&apos;t move those skinny little legs of his! The medusa finally found him throttling me angrily atop the largest building in the Market Sabaan.</string>
<string name="2150">Well, my patroness was mad enough that she was determined to be the one to murder me first. She and vizier yanked me between them like some tug-of-war, and all I could do was gurgle helplessly!</string>
<string name="2151">They shouted threats and screamed at each other until the medusa lifted her veil! The vizier saw this and launched himself at her, casting a deadly spell as he flew!</string>
<string name="2152">He hit her squarely and they both flew over the edge of the rooftop! I would have been gladly rid of them both, but alas poor Tomi was catapulted right along with them!</string>
<string name="2153">We hit three canopies on the way down and finally landed square in the middle of the market! The vizier&apos;s spell had worked, as the medusa was dead... but not before he had been turned into a statue. A broken statue, by that time. And there I sat, naked and stunned but otherwise unhurt.</string>
<string name="2154">Well, sure, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. The crowd assumed I had killed a powerful medusa and a famous wizard... bare-handed, no less. I was in no condition to argue.</string>
<string name="2155">Hmph. I wish! The entire crowd assumed I had killed a powerful medusa and wizard bare-handed... and I was in no condition to argue.</string>
<string name="2156">Word spread rapidly, of course... and the story grew. You wouldn&apos;t believe some versions I heard. Sadly, the constabulary believed them.</string>
<string name="2157">I was a wanted man for murdering the vizier. Good for my reputation, perhaps, but bad for my health. His daughter wasn&apos;t too impressed, either.</string>
<string name="2158">You&apos;d think so, but no... she just didn&apos;t want to shack up with a wanted halfling. I had to prove my innocence!</string>
<string name="2159">Well, she didn&apos;t miss her father like I thought she would... she just wasn&apos;t about to marry a wanted halfling. I had to prove my innocence!</string>
<string name="2160">That&apos;s why I decided to come to Neverwinter. One of my oldest friends lives here and is a forgery master! I was hoping he&apos;d make some documents to clear my name in Calimport.</string>
<string name="2161">Sadly, I suspect Belman&apos;s fallen victim to the plague. Can&apos;t find him anywhere. So... that means no evidence and no marriage for poor li&apos;l Tomi.</string>
<string name="2162">Oh, who cares about him? I just want those documents. Maybe he finished them before he croaked. *Sigh* I can only hope.</string>
<string name="2163">Oh, I bet he is. Belman was never very lucky. I just hope he finished those documents before he croaked.</string>
<string name="2164">Oh, there&apos;s not much story left to tell, is there, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;? I&apos;m just hoping we&apos;ll come across Belman&apos;s documents someday.</string>
<string name="2165">That&apos;d be nice of ya, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Until then, let&apos;s just go about your quest, aye?</string>
<string name="2166">Fat chance of that, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Let&apos;s get back to your quest, then, shall we?</string>
<string name="2167">Wha-aat? You&apos;re kidding, right? Let me see that! Hmmm... Hayden, Lord Friedling. &apos;Halfling&apos;. Yep, that&apos;s my old monicker.</string>
<string name="2168">And it really is Belmar&apos;s work, after all. Just my luck that it would be his crappiest work ever! I&apos;d be laughed out of Calimport if I tried to use this!</string>
<string name="2169">Ah, well, that&apos;s life. Saida had the biggest buck teeth, anyway... don&apos;t know what I was thinking. I suppose I should thank you for saving me the effort, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2170">Hmmm... come to think of it, here. Let me give ya this in return. It was a ring that the vizier wore that I, um, managed to slip off his finger before he got stoned.</string>
<string name="2171">Yeah, well... the vizier seemed to value it. Said it had great magic in it, but it never did nothing for me. Maybe it&apos;ll bring you luck.</string>
<string name="2172">At any rate, I don&apos;t have to worry about finding stupid Belmar anymore. I would have had to kill him for being an idiot, anyway.</string>
<string name="2173">Let&apos;s just keep on with your quest, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, aye?</string>
<string name="2174">Naaahhh, I&apos;m not in the mood to talk more about that. Let&apos;s just keep going with your quest, aye?</string>
<string name="2175">Well, there&apos;s only so much you can know about me, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Tomi Undergallows be the most famous halfling rogue in all of Calimport... that about sums it up.</string>
<string name="2176">Oh, I&apos;ve my tales of treachery and deceit, the likes of which have been told to wide-eyed little Calimshite children for many years... but I doubt you&apos;d be interested in that.</string>
<string name="2177">Gee, let me think... what might have made me offer to tell a story? Oh, I know! You asked for it! Sheesh.</string>
<string name="2178">Have it your way, though, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Might want to check for bunches in your panties before we&apos;re off.</string>
<string name="2179">Wow, you get little bossy when you want a story, aye? Well, all right, have it your way.</string>
<string name="2180">Well, let&apos;s see. Tomi&apos;s had a bunch of friends and a bunch of enemies in his time. There&apos;s only been one who&apos;s been both: my arch-nemesis, Samuel Bumbleheart!</string>
<string name="2181">Sammy and I were pals dating back to the good old days when we used to run wild through the streets as wee little urchins, stealing avacados and pinching purses.</string>
<string name="2182">Fame was always Sammy&apos;s thing. He&apos;s always loved attention, ever since he did that striptease in the half-orc bar to keep from being pummelled, I&apos;ve always thought he was a bit of a diva.</string>
<string name="2183">When I started to gain a bit of notoriety of my own, however, Sammy become a mite jealous. Poor lad.</string>
<string name="2184">Mmmm... naw, not so much. It&apos;s a bit hard to pick a pocket when you have twenty suspicious eyes on you. Great with the lasses, though, I&apos;ll admit.</string>
<string name="2185">We used to be when we were tots, sure, but the plain fact is Sammy&apos;s not such a good rogue. So clumsy and wobbly, it&apos;s a shame to call him a halfling sometimes.</string>
<string name="2186">Sammy was content for awhile, but he&apos;d get mad when folks always recognized me first. The guards would chase me down the street and he&apos;d complain, &quot;Why didn&apos;t they chase ME?&quot;</string>
<string name="2187">Oh, he tried to show me up as a thief. Not being very good, however, it only landed him in prison. In Calimshan, that means you&apos;re as good as hung.</string>
<string name="2188">I busted him out the first time, but that only embarrassed him. No good deed goes unpunished, you know... so Sammy had to take action!</string>
<string name="2189">Well, the truth is I didn&apos;t really mean to break him out. It was an accident... the kind that brings down half the prison and causes a mass escape. Happens all the time, trust me.</string>
<string name="2190">So Sammy concocts this plan to have l&apos;il Tomi thrown in prison... just like he&apos;d been. He was going to steal the most fabulous gem in Calimshan and I was to take the blame for it!</string>
<string name="2191">Ahhhh, Sammy. Maybe he still resented my stealing both his lady friends. Hmm... actually, I stole his wife, too. Naaaah, that was years and years before.</string>
<string name="2192">I didn&apos;t say that Sammy was the smartest halfling on the block. In his mind, having me stuck in a Calimshite prison and ravaged daily by burly convict cell-mates was worth almost any price.</string>
<string name="2193">Well, with my reputation, who wouldn&apos;t believe him? For one of Sammy&apos;s plans, it was right brilliant. He was such an angry, angry little halfling.</string>
<string name="2194">Anyway, since Sammy wasn&apos;t so skilled, he had to get some help. Ended up leveraging himself to a rather nasty elf by the name of Reegar.</string>
<string name="2195">Reegar was good... he was also the meanest rogue in Calimshan, and Sammy had to practically become his servant to get him to agree. Reegar was also a pretty good pal of mine, though Sammy didn&apos;t know that.</string>
<string name="2196">Thing was, I&apos;d already been planning to heist that jewel myself all along. When Reegar tipped me off to Sammy&apos;s plan, I laughed so hard I just about peed in my britches.</string>
<string name="2197">I don&apos;t know why Sammy was so mad, really. He just seemed to lose it completely... all that shouting and turning red in the face, it was just so sad.</string>
<string name="2198">After all, he&apos;d only broken a couple of legs... he could still walk, even if it was with a limp. Could I be held completely to blame?</string>
<string name="2199">At any rate, Sammy decided enough was enough. It was time to ruin his best pal, Tomi, once and for all.</string>
<string name="2200">Of course I was! I mean... so what if I was the one who did the job he got arrested for? So what if I slept with his lady friend while he was in prison? We were buds!</string>
<string name="2201">And what better way to become famous than to take down the notorious Tomi Undergallows!</string>
<string name="2202">Sammy came up with a plan! Not the brightest plan, I suppose... he was never much of a planner. </string>
<string name="2203">His last plan, in fact, was a heist that ended up with him being left naked and cold on a ship to Maztica. Well... all right, I did forget to go pick him up... but it was HIS plan.</string>
<string name="2204">This plan would be different, however! Hee hee... or so he thought. I&apos;ll have to tell you about it sometime, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2205">Right-o! I was telling you about Sammy&apos;s big plan to ruin ol&apos; Tomi, wasn&apos;t I? Ahhhh, yes.</string>
<string name="2206">Aye, well, he was a fellow to pity, at times. Once I remember I left Sammy in the Dark Bazaar by accident. He showed up three days later, pitch-white and devoid of hair. Ha ha! Those were the days... </string>
<string name="2207">I did the only thing I could, of course. I made a plan of my own, and went ahead with the heist.</string>
<string name="2208">Until the night of the heist, I didn&apos;t let on that I knew what Sammy was up to. He acted all innocent, of course... didn&apos;t say a word to me, even told me to get lost.</string>
<string name="2209">It was quite a ruse, I tell you, but I saw through it all! He was no friend of mine, after all... he had become my arch-nemesis!</string>
<string name="2210">Dumb? What&apos;s so dumb about it? Friendship! Betrayal! It has all the classic elements I promised! The fact that I was the victim in all this is beside the point.</string>
<string name="2211">Wha-aat? Why would you think that? Well... there was that one time I told Rok the Crusher that Sammy stole his hammer, and not me, but Sammy forgave me after he healed, I swear!</string>
<string name="2212">Exactly! Like a cunning serpent, he had hidden himself as my friend! Never would I have suspected simple Sammy, the childhood pal I had de-pantsed in front of the Molikai girl&apos;s choir!</string>
<string name="2213">Still... I&apos;d only wanted to teach Sammy a lesson. What happened to him the night of the heist was quite tragic.</string>
<string name="2214">Aye, it&apos;s terrible. The one thing I truly regret in my life... </string>
<string name="2215">Aye, laugh if you wish, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, but it&apos;s truly awful. The one thing I regret in my life... </string>
<string name="2216">Aye, it&apos;s hard to hear. Terrible. The one thing I truly regret in my life... </string>
<string name="2217">I shall have to tell you about it... sometime. *Sigh* Let&apos;s... let&apos;s just go on with your quest. I don&apos;t want to think about Sammy any longer.</string>
<string name="2218">Aye... the night of the jewel heist, right? *Sigh* I suppose you&apos;ve been a fine friend, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. I can tell you about it.</string>
<string name="2219">The gem we were after was no other than the fabled &apos;Star of Calimshan&apos;. It&apos;s not the most valuable ruby in the land, but certainly one of the more notorious.</string>
<string name="2220">According to legend, the pashas of Calimshan gifted it to their wives on their wedding night, and the stone glows from within... filled with the tears of their lost innocence. Or so the story goes.</string>
<string name="2221">My daring plan... and Sammy&apos;s... was to pluck this stone from the depths of the royal palace, from the very chambers of the syl-pasha&apos;s wife, herself.</string>
<string name="2222">The ruby&apos;s value is more in the fame one would get, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. The syl-pasha would never rest until he captured whoever was responsible fro its theft.</string>
<string name="2223">I wasn&apos;t actually sure. I was still getting used to the idea that Sammy had turned into my arch-nemesis for no reason at all.</string>
<string name="2224">Oh, aye. What would be far worse, however, would be the syl-pasha&apos;s reaction. Taking it would be one thing... surviving long enough to enjoy it would be something else.</string>
<string name="2225">At any rate, the night came. Sammy and Reegar stole into the palace ahead of me, with Sammy having no idea of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was quite easy to follow.</string>
<string name="2226">I remember being impressed at the time that things were going so well... no guards alerted, no problems whatsoever. I thought maybe Sammy&apos;s foul luck had finally turned, for once.</string>
<string name="2227">Well, of course Sammy tripped over a fold in the carpet and took a spill into a suit of armor. It fell over him into two others and the resulting clatter would have woken Nebuchadnezzar&apos;s dead brother-in-law.</string>
<string name="2228">Poor Reegar turned white as a virgin&apos;s dainty bottom when he saw the horde of soldiers charging down the hall. He leapt out the window without first considering we were over the lion pit. Poor fella.</string>
<string name="2229">The guards ran right past the pile of armor... didn&apos;t even think to look for a small halfling buried under there, lucky for Sammy.</string>
<string name="2230">Oh, I suppose. It&apos;s not as bad as that time we tried to rob the merchant guild and I knocked over that vat of alchemist&apos;s fire and torched all of Sammy&apos;s body hair off.</string>
<string name="2231">I am shocked and dismayed that you think that, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Did Sammy deserve that time I accidentally sold him into slavery to the Altooshans? No, of course not!</string>
<string name="2232">Anyway... give ol&apos; Sammy some credit for stubbornness, he climbed out from under that armor and still came for the ruby. Found me plucking it from its pedestal, in fact.</string>
<string name="2233">He was surprised to see me, to say the least. I decided to give him a piece of my mind, as I recall. &quot;Why, Sammy,&quot; I said, &quot;why did you betray me? I&apos;ve never done anything to you!&quot;</string>
<string name="2234">What do you mean? Oh, I admit... I made one or two mistakes in the past, but Sammy and I were pals! Not anymore, of course, now that Sammy&apos;d turned traitor.</string>
<string name="2235">I never got to hear his response. Oddly, he just turned all purple and his eyes bulged out and he spluttered a lot. Looked rather like some outraged kobold.</string>
<string name="2236">The guards ran in just then and it was pandemonium. There was fighting and screaming and running... last I remember, I dived into the sea and woke up three days later on freighter bound for Tharsult.</string>
<string name="2237">Want to hear the funny part? For all that Sammy was a terrible thief, he was a wonderful pickpocket. Stole the ruby off me, he did, and I had nothing to show for all that.</string>
<string name="2238">Not sure, exactly. I&apos;d heard he&apos;d ended up on a slave ship and somehow got sold to one of the High Captains in Luskan. Poor sod.</string>
<string name="2239">Me, I&apos;d like to track down that ruby one of these days. The Star of Calimshan... ahhh, it&apos;d still be worth it, to make me famous.</string>
<string name="2240">Ha! There&apos;s not much more to it. One of these days, I&apos;ll find the Star of Calimshan. Maybe find out what happened to Sammy, too... I&apos;ve decided to forgive him.</string>
<string name="2241">Thanks, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;! You&apos;re quite a friend, yourself! Now let&apos;s get on with your quest, shall we?</string>
<string name="2242">Ain&apos;t that the truth! It takes a special kind of man to have that much forgiveness in his heart. I think Sammy will be pleased.</string>
<string name="2243">By Brandobaris&apos;s hairy feet! It is! Where in Faerun did you find that?</string>
<string name="2244">Huh. So Sammy did make it up hereabouts, after all. Probably slaved away in some wizard&apos;s kitchen until he slipped into a vat of ale and drowned. Ah, well.</string>
<string name="2245">Thanks for finding it, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... it&apos;ll take up a nice spot on my mantle. If I had a mantle, that is.</string>
<string name="2246">Wish I had something &apos;side from some pocket lint to pay ya back. All I can offer you is my thanks and friendship in return.</string>
<string name="2247">You have a point there, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Now let&apos;s find your cultists and kick some zealot butt!</string>
<string name="2248">You&apos;re a good &lt;man/woman&gt;, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Now let&apos;s find your cultists and kick some zealot butt!</string>
<string name="2249">Ahhh, no worries, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;! We&apos;ll find your cultists, sure enough... Sammy can wait.</string>
<string name="2250">Nahhh, this isn&apos;t the time, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. We have cultists to find and cut into little cultist-sized bits, don&apos;t we?</string>
<string name="2251">Funny you should ask that, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. I was an urchin on the streets of Calimport, first an&apos; foremost... and that&apos;s where I learned me street-smarts... but it wasn&apos;t always that way.</string>
<string name="2252">In fact, when I was a tender young lad a kindly human wizard saw great promise in me and took me in. I was his apprentice, in fact, for quite some time.</string>
<string name="2253">That&apos;s where I met my best friend Sammy, after all... he was another apprentice. I would have been a full wizard, myself, if things had worked out.</string>
<string name="2254">You&apos;re making fun of me, now, aren&apos;t you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;? Ha ha! It&apos;s true, though. When it came to books and studying, I may as well have been a Sahuagin in the desert.</string>
<string name="2255">Well, you know... you can take the lad out of the street, but you can&apos;t take the street out of the lad. I wasn&apos;t much for books and studying and all.</string>
<string name="2256">That wizard... what was his name? Halasahr? He saw something in me that I never saw. Said I would make a wizard whether I liked it or not.</string>
<string name="2257">I thought I would make a wonderful thief if I could be invisible and fly around all the time... I just couldn&apos;t wait! Halasahr had all these pretty things in his tower, unfortunately.</string>
<string name="2258">Now you sound just like him. Oh! And the beatings that man would apply! He wasn&apos;t the most patient sort himself, you know.</string>
<string name="2259">Well, you may think so, but ol&apos; Halasahr was quite the taskmaster. One line mispronounced and I&apos;d be black and blue for days! He should have been a fighter with that arm.</string>
<string name="2260">Of course I stole them! What kind of a rogue do you think I am? Got a good price on the streets, too, even Halasahr beat me black and blue by the time I returned.</string>
<string name="2261">Once I swiped Halasahr&apos;s spellbook and sold that for a pretty price. Boy, was the old man furious! There was a storm brewing around his tower by the time I got back!</string>
<string name="2262">Of course I had to lie and say that Sammy took the book. Hmmm... come to think of it, that&apos;s how Sammy got kicked out of his apprenticeship.</string>
<string name="2263">Well, he wasn&apos;t much of a wizard... and ol&apos; Sammy wasn&apos;t my friend back then, anyway. I made it up to him by becoming his pal later, once I stopped being an apprentice.</string>
<string name="2264">Heh... the end of my apprenticeship is quite the story, itself. I should tell you that sometime, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, if you&apos;re interested.</string>
<string name="2265">That would be later, though. Right now we got a city to save, right?</string>
<string name="2266">Was I telling a story, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;? Oh, right... about the end of my apprenticeship with Halasahr.</string>
<string name="2267">Well, wizards are a funny lot, you know. No self-respecting thief would go poking his nose into places where it&apos;s sure to get cut off, but wizards run like moths into bonfires.</string>
<string name="2268">Halasahr was no different. He didn&apos;t want me to find out, of course, but I had a way of sneaking around his tower without him knowing... and I saw him summoning demons.</string>
<string name="2269">Why does any wizard summon demons? Power, knowledge, succubus booty? Who can tell? Maybe he needed a chess partner.</string>
<string name="2270">Sure. Big, red, bat wings, bad breath, infernal contract. Shoot, that was in the opening paragraph of &apos;the Apprentice Essentials&apos;. I am from Calimshan, you know.</string>
<string name="2271">I don&apos;t know about evil. We are talking about Calimshan, here. I knew of two noblemen alone who had a succubus doing their housecleaning.</string>
<string name="2272">Anyway, this demon seemed harmless enough. Halasahr and it had some laughs, and it tickled the mage&apos;s belly until he was giggling like a schoolgirl.</string>
<string name="2273">So after Halasahr dismissed it and left, I decided I would call up this demon and see just how much riches he could give me. It really didn&apos;t seem like such a big thing at the time.</string>
<string name="2274">Sheesh, you make it sound like we got married and ran off to the Dales to live in bliss. I only summoned it once, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, gosh.</string>
<string name="2275">Aren&apos;t they the ones that give you three wishes? After you rub their bellies or something? I never much paid attention to my studies, you know.</string>
<string name="2276">Of course I did! I mean... the bottle was just sitting there, looking all lonely. If Halesahr was a responsible wizard he would have locked it away. So I wasn&apos;t at fault for anything I did.</string>
<string name="2277">So I read a bit of the wizard&apos;s book and summon the demon, right? Well... the demon looks all surprised to see me and he just laughs and laughs and laughs.</string>
<string name="2278">I ask him what&apos;s so damn funny, right? He says, &quot;Why you, little one!&quot; He has this big, booming voice... and all I can think is &apos;boy, I am gonna be SO rich!&apos;</string>
<string name="2279">Well, I shout at him and demand that he make me rich, right? And he laughs again. So I say he better make me powerful, then... figuring that&apos;s maybe just as good.</string>
<string name="2280">So he laughs again! Finally he calms down and he says okay and gives me a magic wand. Says that will give me all the power I need... and &apos;poof!&apos; he&apos;s gone.</string>
<string name="2281">Boy, that wand got me into so much trouble... </string>
<string name="2282">Hey! I can handle my magic perfectly well! Well... usually. Well, okay, nevermind.</string>
<string name="2283">Why? It was all perfectly innocent. Who was I to look a gift horse in the mouth, after all?</string>
<string name="2284">Heh... I&apos;ll have to tell you what the wand did sometime later, maybe. Let&apos;s just say Halasahr wasn&apos;t happy about it.</string>
<string name="2285">Anyway... I&apos;m sure we&apos;ve more important things to do. Right, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="2286">Ahhhh, I guess there&apos;s no harm in it. It was such a big mess, though, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2287">If you&apos;ll remember, the wee demon had given me a wand, aye? So after he left, I decided that it needed to be tested out.</string>
<string name="2288">Aye, exactly. It was exhilirating, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... the power at my disposal! I had my apprentice chores to do, and I decided the wand should do them for me!</string>
<string name="2289">I animated a broom to do my bidding, and it began to clean the floors! I used the wand to make a bucket that never ran short of water!</string>
<string name="2290">I made the tables walk, the cauldrons dance, the chairs four-step... it was marvelous! I waved my wand and everything came to life!</string>
<string name="2291">Oh, you think so, do you? When was the last time you summoned up a big demon who gave you a gift, huh? Happens all the time, does it?</string>
<string name="2292">Well, he wasn&apos;t around, naturally. Considering the source of the wand, I didn&apos;t exactly want to advertise it.</string>
<string name="2293">Well... the broom was the first problem. It began cleaning more than the floors. It started sweeping the shelves, knocking Halasahr&apos;s components about, breaking things. I couldn&apos;t make it stop!</string>
<string name="2294">In a panic, I hacked the broom apart with an axe... but then both halves became brooms! I kept hacking and hacking... and suddenly the room was filled with brooms! They were breaking everything!</string>
<string name="2295">In my haste, I knocked over the bucket... and suddenly the tower began filling up with water! The table was attacking me... I couldn&apos;t do anything! The tower was being destroyed! Chaos! Chaos! Oh, the humanity!</string>
<string name="2296">And then Halasahr came back... </string>
<string name="2297">Well, no... he didn&apos;t try to kill me. The way he looked down at me, all disappointed and angry... I thought I&apos;d pee my britches.</string>
<string name="2298">No... no, he wasn&apos;t pleased. He looked down at me all mad and disappointed. He was so scary I thought I&apos;d pee my britches.</string>
<string name="2299">He snatched the wand from me and he broke it... and that made all the madness stop. Oh, and he yelled and yelled at me... he practically threw me out of the tower and told me never to come back.</string>
<string name="2300">The bright news is, I hear Halasahr told some writer about it and the writer thought it was so amusing, he made a play! Think it will be a musical?</string>
<string name="2301">You know, I do feel a bit bad about the whole thing. Not for me... I knew I was no wizard. I feel bad for Halasahr. He did treat me pretty good, all things considered.</string>
<string name="2302">He had a bunch of rare components destroyed that night. Worst of all was these ashes... the ashes of a great warrior. They were for his longevity potion.</string>
<string name="2303">I&apos;ve always thought I should try to make it up to him one day... find him those ashes, maybe. Unless he&apos;s gone and died of old age.</string>
<string name="2304">Well... I&apos;ve been thinking about it. I&apos;d really like to find those ashes sometime... the ashes of a warrior hero. I owe it to Halasahr, don&apos;t you think?</string>
<string name="2305">Either way, I figure I&apos;ll stick by your side so long as you&apos;re on your quest. You found me the documents and the ruby... maybe we&apos;ll find the ashes, too. Maybe it&apos;s meant to be.</string>
<string name="2306">Aye, who knows? Either way, I&apos;m happy toodling along after you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Lead on!</string>
<string name="2307">Oh, keep your knickers on, already. I said I&apos;d come along with ya, didn&apos;t I? Sheesh. Some people&apos;s children.</string>
<string name="2308">But you never know, do you? Heck... maybe I could even track my old friend Sammy down one day. Think he&apos;d be happy to see me?</string>
<string name="2309">Well... now maybe they would, at that. Let me think. Aye... aye, I think that would serve for Halasahr&apos;s longevity potion just fine!</string>
<string name="2310">Thank you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Here... since you&apos;re such a friend, let me give you this. It&apos;s a powerful ring that I stole from Sammy way back. Maybe you could use it.</string>
<string name="2311">Well... it&apos;s the only thing I stole off Sammy that was valuable enough for me to keep. The rest of the stuff I got rid of long time ago. That should be worth something.</string>
<string name="2312">Aye, it&apos;s not a problem, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... least I could do. It&apos;s the only thing I stole off Sammy that was valuable enough for me to keep.</string>
<string name="2313">I&apos;ll send these ashes off to Halsahr as soon as I get the chance. Hmmm... I wonder if he&apos;ll still accept an apprentice at my age?</string>
<string name="2314">Sure! Why not? With some magic at hand, I could be the greatest thief that Calimport has ever known! Again! Ha ha!</string>
<string name="2315">Oh, why not? You don&apos;t think he&apos;d still hold a grudge do you? I could learn from him and become the greatest thief Calimport has ever known! Again! Ha ha!</string>
<string name="2316">Oh, don&apos;t you worry your little head about it, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. I&apos;m not leaving until your quest is good and done.</string>
<string name="2317">Let&apos;s get under way, then, my friend! We&apos;ll find your Words of Power and put an end to evil... for even more adventure awaits us afterwards, I&apos;m sure of it!!</string>
<string name="2318">Maybe later, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Right now we&apos;ve got stuff that needs doing, don&apos;t we?</string>

<string name="2845">Many-Starred Cloak</string>
<string name="2846">These masterfully crafted cloaks, stitched on both sides with glittering stars, are the guild emblem of the sorcerers and wizards of Neverwinter&apos;s fabled Cloaktower. Loyal to Lord Nasher, the Cloakwizards are vital to the city&apos;s defense and carry themselves with the appropriately cautious air that such a duty entails.</string>

<string name="2850">Horse Hair Helmet</string>
<string name="2851">Stag Helmet</string>
<string name="2852">Watchman&apos;s Helm</string>
<string name="2853">It is unclear if these magic headpieces were created by clerics of Helm, god of guardians, or if they acquired their name by a more convenient circumstance. Whatever the case, they are highly prized by guards and sentries. All cast a visible glow of one sort or another, and many magically hone the wearer&apos;s senses. Needless to say, rogues have also taken to wearing them, proving the old proverb that &apos;what&apos;s good for the goose is good for the gander.&apos;</string>
<string name="2854">Thieves&apos; Hood</string>
<string name="2855">Bards and rogues alike are known to reminisce on &quot;the glory days,&quot; and the stories of an ancient guild so magnificent it outfitted even its lowliest members with the most incredibly wondrous wares. Though there is little contained in historical documents to verify such a golden age, the occasional discovery of one of these Thieves&apos; Hoods is enough to keep the tale in circulation.</string>
<string name="2856">Shukenja Helm</string>
<string name="2857">The Shukenja are a monastic order known for their subtlety and magic power. Though rank-and-file brothers fight with a staff and wear no armor, elite members of the order are known to wear Shukenja Helms into battle to augment their sorcerous abilities. Over the years these monks have spread through the Realms, and today many of their helms can be found in the hands of the order&apos;s allies and enemies.</string>
<string name="2858">Thayvian Circlet</string>
<string name="2859">Thayvian Circlets were created by the Red Wizards to help them fend off the aggressive Luskan Brotherhood. Though designed only to augment spellcasting abilities, they have the additional benefit of improving the wearer&apos;s hardiness, reflexes, and willpower. Since their introduction, the conflict between the two groups has been markedly restrained.</string>
<string name="2860">Golden Circlet</string>
<string name="2861">Creatures that attack the mind are the stuff of nightmares, so it is not surprising that items protecting against them might acquire some of their disrepute. Golden Circlets, for example, have been linked to a claim that when the drow first retreated underground they fed on intellect devourers, and that eating such a creature without wearing a circlet produced a mind flayer. This is all, of course, nothing more than superstitious tavern talk.</string>
<string name="2862">Large Shield +1</string>
<string name="2863">This magic shield grants additional protection to its wearer, but it doesn&apos;t bear the hallmarks of any specific maker.</string>
<string name="2864">Shield of the Holy</string>
<string name="2865">These shields are first mentioned in ancient liturgies of Lathander, in which the Morninglord&apos;s champions bear radiant shields against an infestation of undead. The shields made their first appearance in modern times in dramatic fashion, appearing miraculously at the altars of several of the deity&apos;s temples in the Year of Smoldering Spells, 1020 DR. Since that time a number have been lost in battle, and not a few were stolen by foul creatures to prevent their use.</string>
<string name="2866">Shield of the Sun</string>
<string name="2867">Forged by clerics of the Mulhorandi sun god Horus-Re, these shields are constantly aglow with the golden fires of the sun. Depending on the skill and intent of the crafter, some Shields of the Sun carry more potent powers as well.</string>
<string name="2868">Mirror Shield</string>
<string name="2869">Often confused with the better-known Shield of Mirrors, which has been known to aid in the defeat of medusas and basilisks, Mirror Shields are most often seen on the arms of mage hunters. Aside from their silvered appearance, Mirror Shields are so named because they can reflect harmful spells cast against their wielder.</string>
<string name="2870">Dragon Shield</string>
<string name="2871">Evil dragons are fearful opponents, but luckily for the good races of the world every dragon carries the seeds of its own destruction. When a single dragon falls, its scales are turned into shields and armor sovereign against its own attacks. A gifted artificer can even combine scales from different dragon types to produce items that resist many forms of elemental attack. The famed Dragon Shields are of this sort, and are among the best equipment an ambitious dragonslayer can carry.</string>
<string name="2872">Uthgardt Holy Shield</string>
<string name="2873">The Uthgardt value strength above all, and these shields provide strength to spare. They also disdain fancy talk and fine words, and the shields do their best to make the wearer as barbaric as the wild men of the north.</string>
<string name="2874">Large Shield +2</string>
<string name="2875">Large Shield +3</string>
<string name="2876">Small Shield +1</string>
<string name="2877">Protector</string>
<string name="2878">This small shield proudly bears the mark of Luiren, homeland of the strongheart halflings. While few people think of halflings as possessing any real military tradition, the Luiren folk maintain well-organized militias led by the local clergy and supported with powerful divine magic. This shield likely belonged to an ordinary Luiren soldier who fell in defense of his homeland.</string>
<string name="2879">Hearth Shield</string>
<string name="2880">These famous shields, crafted by the dwarves of the Western Heartlands, are so called because they make even the fiercest blast of heat seem as comfortable and tolerable as a cozy hearth.</string>
<string name="2881">Dwarven Mirth</string>
<string name="2882">Among the dwarven people, the father of all bards was the Master Talesmith Simeron Steelhammer. Well-versed in his people&apos;s history and lore, he traveled extensively, spreading tales of their culture and achievements. Near the end of his long life, he returned one last time to his home in the Great Rift. From every lintel hung a version of this shield, commissioned by his clansmen to commemorate his homecoming.</string>
<string name="2883">Shield of the Wisp Hunter</string>
<string name="2884">Soggy Nurkel, legendary hero of the gnomes, is said to have lost himself while chasing swampland toads as a child. As the night fog settled in, will-o&apos;-wisps lured him this way and that through the dark swamp. Outsmarting them, however, he wove a magic shield from the marsh reeds, crushing them with it as he sneaked up on them through the mists. Replicas are made every ten-year as part of the festivities celebrating his life.</string>
<string name="2885">Mithral Shield</string>
<string name="2886">This small shield is crafted from strips of mithral pounded so thin they are nearly transparent. Despite its light construction, it provides substantial protection to the wearer and renders him immune to spells that limit his movement.</string>
<string name="2887">Small Shield +2</string>
<string name="2888">Small Shield +3</string>
<string name="2889">Tower Shield +1</string>
<string name="2890">Imaskari Shield</string>
<string name="2891">Often mistaken for relics of the ancient Imaskari civilization, these massive shields were actually used against them by their enemies. While large and unwieldy, they offered substantial protection against the spells of the mighty wizards of Imaskar. Those still in use today continue to be a thorn in the side of spellcasters throughout Faerun.</string>
<string name="2892">Shield of the Dragonslayer</string>
<string name="2893">Like many items designed to defeat dragons, these shields can be traced to the year of the Dracorage (1018 DR). They were built with immensely strong materials and techniques, and rumors put a castle engineer in charge of their construction. There may be some truth in this rumor, since the shields resemble reinforced castle gates more than ordinary armor plates.</string>
<string name="2894">Goblin Shield of Nulbish</string>
<string name="2895">Nulbish, a half-orc ranger, became a champion of the northern orc clans during their fateful Goblin Wars. Despite his half-human heritage, they appreciated his ferocity in battle and the rousing speeches he gave from atop his piled victims. When Nulbish was killed by a member of his father&apos;s own clan, the orcs squabbled for months over who should bear his shield. Numerous forgeries were crafted during this time and the fragile orc alliance eventually splintered.</string>
<string name="2896">Hastsezini&apos;s Shield</string>
<string name="2897">A legendary mercenary of Riativin, Hastsezini urged the city&apos;s five competing wizards to pool their valuables in a single storehouse where he could stand guard over them all. Such was the respect and fear he commanded that all agreed and not a single theft was ever attempted on his watch. Hastsezini showed no interest in the riches he guarded, perhaps because each of the five wizards was content to pay him a full wage.</string>
<string name="2898">Darksteel Tower Shield</string>
<string name="2899">For a brief period in its history, Darksteel Tower was ruled by a vicious coven of surface-roaming drow. From shadowed alcoves, high priestesses stood guard over the tower by night and day, wrapping their sensitive skin in swaths of black cotton. When Harpers finally destroyed the nest, these huge and ominous shields were all that survived of Darksteel Tower. Neither the blades nor magic of the Harpers could dent them.</string>

<string name="2967">This document seems to be official; the wax stamped with what appears to be the official seal of Lord Nasher and the delicately-written script spelling out a friendly endorsement for one &apos;Hayden, Lord Freidling&apos;. It appears to prove that Mr. Freidling worked as a coachman in Murann for the entire duration of the previous year... and so couldn&apos;t possibly have been present in the city of Calimport for an unmentioned crime.

<string name="3001">History of the Creator Races</string>
<string name="3002">In a time when the North was always warm and the seas of the world were deeper, empires of inhuman peoples dominated the lands of Toril. In the elven tradition, these were the days when the Iquar&apos;Tel&apos;Quessir, or creator races, tamed the wilds, built towering cities of stone and glass on the shores of the warm seas, spanned the wilderness with winding roads, and fought wars of extermination - such was their hatred toward each other. These were the Days of Thunder.

First of these ancient creators was a saurian race that built an extensive if short-lived civilization. Its survivors eventually became the naga, lizardfolk, troglodytes, and similar creatures.

Supreme among the creator races were the dragons, powerful enough to raid large cities of the other creator races with impunity. Dragons dominated the surface world, claiming vast areas of territory and battling each other for land, mates, and status. The great drakes only suffered setbacks when lesser races mastered magic, and they remain influential today despite the advances of such rabble.

Developing in the later stages of the civilization of the saurians was a race of amphibious shapechangers that crept onto the land to build their proud cities. These creatures contributed to the downfall of the saurians, but they themselves eventually fell into barbarism under pressure from sahuagin, merfolk, and tritons. The survivors of this race are the locathah and tako in the sea, and doppelgangers on the land.

Least known of the creator races are the sylvan people that populated the forests and other wooded areas, living in harmony with nature and leaving few traces. It is believed that their civilization fragmented after a great plague created by a draconic or demonic power. Their descendants are the sprites, korred, and other small woodfolk that populate secret parts of the Forgotten Realms today.

The last of the creator races, and the one that spent the longest time in a primitive state, are the humans. Always adaptable and ingenious, when circumstances allowed for their rise to prominence, humans make advances with incredible speed and efficiency. Of the five creator races, only they truly have a civilization today. The dragons war with each other as individuals, and the other kinds have vanished from the world.
</string>
<string name="3003">Wars of the Creator Races</string>
<string name="3004">In the ancient days, before the rise of the created races, great wars were fought by the creator races: the reptile creatures, the amphibians, and the avian peoples. Though most of these wars were fought against other races, many were fought between themselves as well, as they sought to gain dominance over one realm or another.

Only a few tales from this time survive. One recounts a group of reptile creatures that betrayed their own kind for the sake of control over a powerful temple. The traitors used the trust of the simple townsfolk to infiltrate the temple area, and then used raw force to breech the temple&apos;s defenses, murdering the loyal guardians before seizing control of the site. Once in control of the temple, the city&apos;s rulers were caught and slain and the attackers seized the reigns of the whole city. Their efforts were for naught; within the year, the city was burned to the ground by an army of the avian peoples.
</string>
<string name="3005">The Doombringers</string>
<string name="3006">The world was not always as it is now. There was a time before time, when the land was shaped by the will of the creator races. These were not gods, but the power and magic they wielded was greater than anything seen since. For ages they ruled unchallenged, but at the time of the great cooling a new threat emerged. The new races, the lesser beasts that would become you and I, had grown in confidence and power and began asserting themselves on the land.

One of the creator races - their name is now lost to the wastes, and let it never be found or spoken again - turned its awesome power to conquest, and brought forth the great warrior machines. They were fearsome to behold, and there was no doubt to their intent; they were the Doombringers, and they would unleash devastating power upon the world. The young races should have been trampled underfoot, but fate intervened.

The masters of the Doombringers had seen their empire pushed to the edges of the Realms, past the peaks of what would become the Spine of the World. They huddled in the lonely mountains, waiting for their old glory to return. But this race had upset the greater balance with their war machines, taking away the very life force of the earth around them. They did not heed the groaning of the stone until their great halls and vaults fell around them and closed them under the earth.

Entombed, the Creators could not mind their Doombringers, now standing idle before the forces that would destroy them; the lesser races, the earliest of us but not yet us. They were as ants beneath the giants, but they slowly brought them down. It was victory, but it was only the inattention of the masters that allowed it. They would not stay buried. The threat would surely come again and all lived in fear... until the forgetting.

Song and tale have passed the legends of the earliest times, but much has been lost of how we gained our foothold among giants. All we really know is that now we are the masters, the creators of things grand and beautiful, and whatever came before is gone. There are ants beneath our feet that we think nothing of... but it is best to remember that we were once as they, and above us were beings greater than we shall ever be. Let us be mindful, and not look away, lest our own Doombringers fall.
</string>
<string name="3007">The Sword Coast</string>
<string name="3008">Between Waterdeep and the Spine of the World lies a wedge-shaped piece of land along the coast of the Sea of Swords, roughly seven hundred miles north to south and almost two hundred miles across at its widest. At the western tip of the Spine of the World is Icewind Dale, the northernmost settled land in this part of Faer&#1099;n. The Long Road stretching from Waterdeep to Mirabar defines the eastern extent of the Sword Coast North.

The Sword Coast was the first part of the North to be inhabited by civilized people. Most of its area is covered in gently rolling grasslands, and herders and farmers found an easy living here. Sometimes the land touches the Sea of Swords in a pebble beach, but it more often meets the water in a series of sea caves, broken rock spits, and low cliffs marked by pillars of rock severed by the tireless waves. This terrain lends itself to smuggling, but it also forces ships that navigate close to the shore to be small and of shallow draft, and therefore they are vulnerable to the driving onshore storms that often pound the area.

Wooded hills and forbidding mountains bound the region to the east, and beyond this barrier is the expanse of the Dessarin river system.

Along the Sword Coast, the great trade towns of Leilon, Luskan, Neverwinter, Port Llast, and Waterdeep keep the area from descending into chaos. The central portion of the northern Sword Coast is underlain by several cavern systems; the Endless Caverns of the High Forest, the Underground River system of the High Moor (accessed from Dragonspear Castle far to the south), and the caverns under Mount Waterdeep that dwarves expanded into Undermountain.
</string>
<string name="3009">The City of Neverwinter</string>
<string name="3010">The City of Skilled Hands is a beautiful, relaxed place. It is a walled city of over 20,000, mainly humans and half-elves.

Craftsmen love the beauty of Neverwinter, and constantly try to outdo each other in striving for ever-increasing efficiency and beauty of design.

Many Harpers dwell in Neverwinter, as do a few skilled dwarven craftspeople of note. Many good-aligned spellcasters also make Neverwinter their home, including the Many-Starred Cloak, a band of wizards who support Lord Nasher&apos;s rule with their spells and some say hold the real power in the city. The &apos;Cloak also produces blastglobes for the 400-strong city militia. 

Neverwintans tend to be quiet, mannered, literate, efficient, and hard-working folk. Deadlines and precision are important in all they do. They respect not only the property of others, but also whatever interests another person holds important for personal happiness. &quot;Following one&apos;s weird&quot; is a Neverwintan saying for odd or reckless behavior. Everyone native to this city understands the need to do such. 

All in all, Neverwinter is perhaps the most cosmopolitan city in Faerun, escaping Waterdeep&apos;s slums and grasping competitiveness, and Silverymoon&apos;s harsher climate and heavier need for defense against orcs and other evils. Cities in Amn and Calimshan commonly claim to be more civilized, but merchants who trade there all say that Neverwinter truly is civilized, unlike some showier rivals who, as the sage Mellomir once put it, &quot;have achieved decadence without the need for passing through civilization first.&quot;

Neverwinter is divided into several sections, called districts. They are the City Core, the Blacklake, the Docks, the Peninsula, and the Beggar&apos;s Nest. The City Core is the focal point of commerce, and houses Castle Never, the seat of government, and the Hall of Justice, a temple of Tyr. The Blacklake district is home to the nobility, while the Beggar&apos;s Nest is populated by many of Neverwinter&apos;s less wealthy citizens. The Peninsula is constructed around a prison complex, and the Docks district is home to one of the most extensive harbors of the Sword Coast.</string>
<string name="3011">The Neverwinter Wood</string>
<string name="3012">This hefty tome attempts a complete history of the Neverwinter Wood, but the crux of what is known is summed up in the following passage:

While many a tale has suggested that there are dark forces that call the wood their home, there is yet no definite answer as to what truly hides within. Many a glade has a guardian force watching over it, but never one so malevolent as is supposedly in residence there. These woods have never been logged by men, for they are feared and shunned by locals, and even orc hordes alter their course around and never through, though usually only after suffering a goodly number of stubborn casualties.

<string name="3013">The City of Luskan</string>
<string name="3014">The City of Sails is a dangerous place, a port city filled with pirates and bloodthirsty thugs. It straddles the mouth of the icy river Mirar and stands as the gateway to the mineral wealth of Mirabar.

Luskan is ostensibly ruled by five high captains: Taerl, Baram, Kurth, Suljack, and Rethnor. However, it is suspected that the real power in Luskan is wielded by the Arcane brotherhood from their island tower.

The seafaring merchants of Luskan have always been fierce, proud, and warlike. Over their long history they have feuded with the inland city of Mirabar, the coastal city of Neverwinter, and the island realm of Ruathym. Even today they sponsor pirates who prey on ships and ports up and down the Sword Coast. They also trade with Amn, Calimshan, and many other towns that prefer not to be associated with them, but will meet them on the neutral ground of offshore Mintarn.

The Mirar River divides the city into two major parts. The northern section is a walled enclave, consisting almost entirely of warehouses. The southern half of the city is much older. Outlying walled caravan compounds surround this heavily fortified section of the city.

There are three bridges that connect the two halves of the city. They are the Harbor Cross, Dalath&apos;s Span, and the Upstream Span. Five major island crowd the mouth of the Mirar, and the three closest to the south bank are developed. The major areas within Luskan are the Captains&apos; Close, the Harbor District, the Mirabar District, the Reach, and the Spans.

<string name="3015">The Trade of Blades</string>
<string name="3016">Penned by Augustavus Cale, founder of the notorious Trade of Blades guild and freehouse, this book appears to be a rather lengthy self-published rant on why the city guards of Neverwinter should not be wasting time trying to moderate the activities of mercenaries. His &quot;argument&quot; appears to be thinly veiled extortion, implying untold mayhem if the needs of these sellswords are not accommodated.

Excerpt:
Much has been made of the threat to our lands and homes posed by men and women of the sword, those that walk the roads with no ties to lord or lady. Many have argued that allowing these creatures to maintain quarters in Neverwinter is to invite trouble. I would say that to turn them away would bring double or triple hardship down upon the surrounding settlements. If you deny the mercenary his living, what recourse will he or she have but to turn to banditry?

Would it not make sense to allow the Trade of Blades to welcome them, thus imparting a sense of kinship with the city? Does it need to be said that having them here for our hire is far better than turning them away and into the arms of our enemies? It is in the best interests of Neverwinter that not only is the mercenary tolerated, but welcomed.</string>
<string name="3017">The Ghost of Conyberry</string>
<string name="3018">This haunted grove is the chief landmark in the Conyberry area. The ghost of Neverwinter Wood is actually a banshee, known as Agatha. This name is almost certainly a corruption of the elven surname Auglathla, which means &quot;Winterbreeze&quot; in one of the older elven dialects. She lairs in a grove in Neverwinter Wood, northwest of Conyberry. Her haunt is at the end of a path whose entrance is marked by a strand of birch trees.

At one time Agatha&apos;s lair was guarded by a magic mirror spell. This was set up to hide her real location, and give her time to hurl spells at intruders. The heroes Drizzt Do&apos;Urden and Wulfgar son of Beornegar shattered these defenses. The two adventurers then stole her treasure.

The banshee had amassed her treasure hoard by thieving in the night, slaying travelers, and pillaging old tombs and ruins. Since her wealth was stolen, she has taken to looting the Dessarin again, trying to rebuild her riches. She also seeks revenge for the theft, and so considers any adventurers fitting recipients of death.

Agatha&apos;s lair has new defenses now. Her spells enable her to charm the people of Conyberry into digging pitfall traps along the path to her lair. These servants have also been seen guarding her haunt. Other than this, Agatha does not bother the folk of Conyberry. Rather, she views them as allies. Agatha often uses her spells to bring them beasts for food in the worst winter weather. She also slaughters orcs and brigands who venture too near to the village. Folk in Conyberry regard Agatha almost affectionately as their guardian and friend. They often talk about her, and speculate on what she&apos;s up to.

<string name="3019">The Dessarin River</string>
<string name="3020">Long ago, before there were roads anywhere north of Tethyr, the Dessarin was known as the Road to the North. The river reaches up past Waterdeep to the Evermoors, and into the eastern end of the Spine of the World.

When humankind first explored the North, they chose the surprisingly fertile Dessarin delta for their first settlements. To this date, more humans live in the long, broad valley of the Dessarin than in any other part of the Savage Frontier. The farms and ranches of the delta feed the remote mining settlements of the North, and fall prey to the orc hordes that sweep down the Dessarin every decade or so.

This great river carves the rough hills of the central North into a broad, gentle valley. It is the principal route for trade and commerce in the region, linking Waterdeep near its mouth with Yartar and Silverymoon hundreds of miles upstream.

Minstrels sometimes describe the Dessarin as a sword thrusting up into the heart of the North. In fact, the river itself was once known as the Sword. This is important knowledge to those puzzling out Netherese and other ancient writings, trying to locate important sites or priceless treasure.

<string name="3021">The Rival Orc Tribes &amp; their Great Battles</string>
<string name="3022">One portal opened by Mulhorand&apos;s rebellious wizards led to a world populated by savage orcs. These orcs used the portal to invade Faer&#1099;n, overrunning many northern settlements and slaying thousands. The manifestations of the god-kings of both Mulhorand and Unther battled the orcs, and the orcs retaliated by summoning divine avatars of their own deities. During these conflicts, known as the Orcgate Wars, the orc god Gruumsh slew the Mulhorandi sun god Re, the first known deicide in the Realms. Many of the Untheric deities were slain as well. The human deities eventually prevailed and the orcs were slain or driven northward.

The deities Set and Osiris battled to succeed Re, and Set murdered his rival. Horus absorbed the divine power of Re and became Horus-Re, defeated Set, and cast the evil god into the desert. Isis resurrected Osiris. All of the Mulhorandi pantheon but Set united in support of Horus-Re. The two old nations paused to rebuild their power and lick their wounds. During this time the empires of Raumathar and Narfell rose in the battlefield territories to the north. In Unther, their chief god Enlil abdicated in favor of his son Gilgeam and vanished, and Ishtar, the only other surviving Untheric deity, gave the power of her manifestation to Isis and vanished as well. Gilgeam began his 2,000-year decline into despotic tyranny as the ruler of Unther.

<string name="3023">The Ruins of Illusk</string>
<string name="3024">The remnants of the ancient city of Illusk stand on the southern shore of the Mirar, in the lee of Closeguard Island. All that remains of this once-proud city are a few shattered towers and toppled statues choked with creepers and thick brush. These ruins are bounded to the north by Luskan&apos;s busy market and to the south by the city&apos;s noisy slums, and bisected by the Darkwalk, the street that leads to the Dark Arch. The Darkwalk is named for the haunted reputation that clings to the ruins of Illusk.

Fear of the magical traps and guardian monsters, as well as the sleepless undead, has kept most of the tombs and treasure undisturbed. Still, a few enterprising rogues have escaped the ruins with spellbooks, scrolls, magic armor, and rich caches of gems and coins. The dead far outnumber these lucky few though, and Luskanites have a saying: &quot;Only the most desperate try to rob the dead of Illusk.&quot; 

Luskanites rarely brave the overgrown northern ruins, even in the full light of day. There are persistent rumors of slave traders kidnapping folk and taking them below (a fate often threatened for unruly children by Luskanite mothers). No known maps of the underground chambers and passages exist, and no Luskanite will admit to knowing their ways.

<string name="3025">Famous Citizens of the Sword Coast</string>
<string name="3026">The Sword Coast North is home to some of the most noteworthy personalities of the Realms. Many won their fame with deeds of great honor, but others are known for the depths of their depravity and wickedness.

The officers of Neverwinter fall into the first camp. Lord Nasher Alagondar, Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, Watchknight Desther Indelayne, and Abbot Fenthick Moss are celebrated for their kindness and wisdom, and each of these heroes has taken the safety of Neverwinter as his or her sacred duty

On the more sinister side, the five High Captains of Luskan are some of the most cruel and ruthless warriors in the region. High Captains Taerl, Baram, Kurth, Suljack, and Rethnor are each vicious combatants, and together they enforce their will with merciless efficiency. 

The most powerful and feared spellcasters on the Sword Coast are members of the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan. Among their number are Jaluth Alaerth, Ornar of the Claw, and Deltagar Zelhund. Little is known of the Brotherhood&apos;s actual role in governing Luskan and the surrounding areas, and the members themselves are loath to discuss their activities.

The untamed lands outside the cities hold countless other instances of fame and infamy alike. King Obould Many-Arrows, for instance, reigns over his orc tribes with an iron fist while such well-known rakes and ne&apos;er-do-wells as Elaith &apos;The Serpent&apos; Craulnober move constantly from hamlet to hamlet to avoid detection.
</string>
<string name="3027">Helm&apos;s Hold</string>
<string name="3028">Less than a day&apos;s travel southeast of Neverwinter is Helm&apos;s Hold, a fortified monastery dedicated to the God of Guardians. It was founded around the middle 1340s DR (Dale Reckoning) by Dumal Erard, a retired member of the Company of Crazed Venturers of Waterdeep. It has grown to a watchful community of over 700 faithful. The people here grow their own crops, herd their own cattle, dig deep wells for their own water, and patrol the area with vigilance. They will give shelter to any travelers beset or weakened by brigands or monsters.</string>
<string name="3029">Luskan&apos;s Arcane Brotherhood</string>
<string name="3030">The dangers of Illusk pale in comparison to the Host Tower of the Arcane - the home of the Arcane Brotherhood. This magically created stone structure is built to resemble a giant tree or an open human hand. It rises into a central spire surrounded by four spires at the points of the compass. All are of equal height, and each bristles with many lesser spires, balconies, and branching turrets.

The Arcane Brotherhood is a mercantile company and spellcaster&apos;s guild. It maintains several safe houses in Luskan and in other cities of the North, and at least one fortress somewhere in the mountains north and east of Luskan. The Host Tower, however, is the seat of its strength.

Hard information on the upper echelons of the Arcane Brotherhood is very difficult to come by. It is clear, though, that some of the senior wizards have recently been destroyed or trapped in forms from which they can&apos;t escape, communicate, or work magic. Some have been moved behind the scenes, and some have left the Brotherhood to pursue their own aims - lichdom, mastery in other lands or planes of existence, and so on. Even still, it should be noted that current activities of the Zhentarim, the Cult of the Dragon, and the Red Wizards of Thay reveal that they haven&apos;t managed to place agents or even spies in any positions of importance within the Brotherhood.

The Brotherhood has been known to change with menacing rapidity, as its internal feuds tend to be deadly. Travelers are advised to avoid even coming to the attention of this evil, manipulative group.
</string>
<string name="3031">Uthgardt Barbarians</string>
<string name="3032">The Uthgardt are a race of black-haired and blue-eyed humans who are descendants of the Northmen, Netherese, and a few savage tribes. 

The Uthgardt are presently divided into scattered tribes, each named after the beast totems which Uthgar conquered - Black Lion, Thunderbeast, Red Tiger, Blue Bear, Great Worm, Sky Pony, Tree Ghost, Black Raven, Griffon, and Gray Wolf. Although civilization has come north in waves throughout history, much of Uthgardt land is wild and untamed. Their lands extend north into the mountains of the Spine of the World, south to Stone Bridge, east to Cold Wood, and west to Neverwinter Wood.

Although some tribes have embraced agriculture and fixed habitations, the Uthgardt have few stable villages. Most tribes wander the wilderness in small clans or family groups and live within a few weeks&apos; travel of their ancestor&apos;s mounds. Tradition is the centerpiece of Uthgardt life, and this blind devotion to their heritage keeps them savage and primitive. Strength is everything to the Uthgardt, and civilization is a weakness that cannot be tolerated. Among the Uthgardt, men are warriors and hunters - women tend to gathering and family needs. They have no written language and no art beyond geometric carvings and clothing decoration. Their religion and philosophy focus on war, plunder, and survival. Their superstitious nature extends to a deep distrust of magic - particularly arcane magic.

The Uthgardt have little to do with city folk, other than as prey, though some tribes have made &quot;civilized&quot; alliances. Both lone travelers and large caravans are considered ripe fruit for plunder. Though they attack civilized folk and frequently fight amongst themselves, they&apos;re quick to unite - even with non-Uthgardt - against their ancestral enemy: the orcs.

<string name="3033">The Origin of Magic</string>
<string name="3034">Long ago, magic was more raw and potent than it is today. The great civilizations of the creator races were based on endless experimentation with these energies, and during their long rules they created many new forms of life.

The cruel and decadent creator races chose to release their monstrous mistakes rather than destroy them. Most died in the jungles, yet many lived and - as thought awakened in them - they hid from their creators. When the end came at last, it was they - not the old races - who seized control of Faer&#1099;n. 

And so it was that the first of the elves, the dragons, the goblin races, and an endless list of creatures of a new age took possession of their heritage. Their creators - the ancestors of the lizardfolk, bullywugs, and aarakocra - declined into savage barbarism, never to rise again.

Sages speculate about the &quot;overnight&quot; destruction of the creator races. There are wildly diverging theories, but all agree that a rapid climate change occurred, creating a world unsuitable to them. Many believe the change resulted from a cataclysm the races unleashed upon themselves. Proponents of this theory point to the Star Mounts in the High Forest, whose origins are most likely magical and otherworldly. The elves believe that around this time the greater and lesser powers manifested themselves, aiding the new races and confounding the survivors of the creator races. There was civilization in the North during this time period, yet little more than tantalizingly vague myths survive.

<string name="3035">Return of the Beast</string>
<string name="3036">At first glance, this ragged tome appears to detail the ancient history of the Sword Coast. Closer inspection reveals the words &quot;Return of the Beast&quot; scrawled across the original title in an almost childlike hand. Whole sections of the book are crossed out and replaced by an indecipherable code, and weird sketches fill the margins. At one point the unnamed second author breaks into near-coherence, though the entry is obscured by some sort of fluid or slime:

&quot;... a slow change. After ages of waiting the BEAST that ruled the land returns to take back their world [from the] upstarts. The BEAST will make slaves of the five crowns, and put whole races to the lash: the elves, the dwarves, and the kingdoms of men will all fall as one...&quot;
</string>
<string name="3037">Wind by the Fireside</string>
<string name="3038">&quot;Wind by the Fireside&quot; is a poem that has changed much over the ages - that much is clear to those who have studied it - but it is not known how much it has been altered, or why the alterations have taken place. Many scholars assume that these changes are representative of the natural evolution of language, as well as modern innovations of style. Little is known about the actual history of the poem, though some believe it to have some bearing upon the creator races of Faer&#1099;n. Others have speculated that it may have been written as an ode by a follower of some ancient religion. The popular version sung in Neverwinter is noted as the following, though other regions have variations in theme.

So as you shiver in the cold and the dark,
Look into the fire and see in its spark - 
My eye
Watching over you.

As you walk in the wind&apos;s whistling claws.
Listen past the howling of the wolf&apos;s jaws.
My song
Comes to you.

And when you&apos;re lost in trackless snow,
Look up high where the eagles go.
My star
Shines for you.

In deep, dark mine or on crumbling peak,
Hear the words of love I speak.
My thoughts
Are with you.

You are not forsaken
You are not forgotten.
The North cannot swallow you.
The snows cannot bury you.
I will come for you.
Faer&#1099;n will grow warmer,
And the gods will smile
But oh, my love, guard yourself well - 
All this may not happen for a long, long while.
</string>
<string name="3039">Religions of the Sword Coast</string>
<string name="3040">The deities of Faer&#1099;n take an active interest in their world, channeling power through their clerics and other worshipers and sometimes intervening directly in the affairs of mortals. At the same time, they have their own plots, conflicts, intrigues, and alliances with other deities, powerful mortals, and outsiders such as elemental lords and demons. In their pettiness the deities of the Realms appear almost mortal, and some were once mortals who won the divine spark through great heroism.

Worship is the lifeblood of the gods, and a deity can actually die if his believers lose faith. To keep their worship strong, the gods work through their clerics to recruit new worshipers and keep the flames of faith alive. In return, their clerics are rewarded with spells and other manifestations of the divine will.

Many of the deities of Faer&#1099;n are specific to a certain race, such as Corellon Larethian (elves) and Moradin (dwarves) or a profession, such as Cyric (thieves) and Mystra (spellcasters). Others hold sway over aspects of nature, such as Umberlee (storms). Some deities are more central to certain locations, such as Helm&apos;s Hold, though it is fairly common to see more than one deity honored in larger towns, such as Neverwinter&apos;s devotion to Tyr and Helm, or Luskan&apos;s worship of Auril, Umberlee, and Tempus. 
</string>
<string name="3041">The Northern Four Adventuring Troupe</string>
<string name="3042">The Northern Four is the name of a band of adventurers that have each gone on to become key citizens of the Sword Coast. Led by Nasher Alagondar, who became Lord of Neverwinter, the group also consisted of Dumal Erard, who went on to found and watch over Helm&apos;s Hold, Ophala Cheldarstorn, matron of the Moonstone Mask who was thought to be an important figure among the mages of the Many-Starred Cloak, and Kurth, who has become a High Captain of Luskan.

The band adventured together successfully for many years, and spawned many tales in their adventures around the region. One popular tale depicts the successful rescue of the Black Raven Tribe from a foul white dragon. As a symbol of gratitude from the tribe, Nasher was gifted with the noted Neverwintan Morregence as a &quot;debt-child.&quot;

The success of the troupe eventually came to an end with a leadership struggle between Nasher and Kurth. Ophala was torn between her love for Kurth and her loyalty to Nasher, but after Kurth left, Ophala settled in Neverwinter, unwilling to compromise her hatred for Luskan and its Arcane Brotherhood; many assume that she still bears resentment against Nasher for the way things turned out. Regardless, Nasher and Erard have remained close, and Ophala still serves her Lord loyally. The same cannot be said of Kurth, who has joined forces with an army that would love nothing more than to see Neverwinter destroyed.
</string>
<string name="3043">Port Llast</string>
<string name="3044">This village of 700 is found on the High Road between Luskan and Neverwinter, and sides with the latter in the feud between the two cities. Fifty men-at-arms from the City of Skilled Hands, bolstered by 30 of the Lords&apos; Alliance troops, aid the local militia in guarding the town from brigand raids and the harassment of Luskan. The Lords&apos; Alliance troops are mainly from Elturel and Baldur&apos;s Gate, so that a Luskan attack would risk war with two economically powerful cities.

Port Llast is a city of skilled stonecutters and has a fine harbor. The stonecutters work at quarries on the coastal headlands just south of the village. Other than harborage and stonecutting, there is little else to recommend it to the traveler today, for it is a tense, suspicious place, always expecting treachery or attack from Luskan. Today Port Llast is ruled by the soldier Kendrack, who recently replaced Haeromos Dothwintyl as First Captain. Haeromos was killed during the battle to protect Port Llast from a Sahuagin invasion. 

In the distant past, when Luskan was held by orcs and duergar, Port Llast was a thriving city. It was the last port in human hands as one sailed north (hence the name). In those days, it was home to 14,000 miners and explorers eager to find gold, gems, and all the rest of the fabled mineral wealth of the North. The city was eventually smashed by orc raids, and the shattered remnants of the old walls still ring it, though much stone has been used to repair local homes or has been taken away and sold. Port Llast&apos;s outer reaches are overgrown by scrub forest or are used as gardens or graveyards.
</string>
<string name="3045">Uthgar&apos;s Legacy</string>
<string name="3046">Uthgar is the legendary founder and namesake of the Uthgardt barbarians of the Savage Frontier. Some of their legends claim that he is the son of Beorunna, and others that he is descended from Tempus. All the legends agree that Uthgar was a proud, strong warrior who lived three times a normal human life. He ascended to watch over the Uthgardt for all eternity after taking fatal wounds in a one-on-one battle with a frost giant named Gurt. Uthgar mastered all the primeval beast spirits in individual combat, passing down the divine gifts he gained from that mastery to his people, the Uthgardt, at his death. The Uthgardt tribes all follow a beast totem, representing one of the beasts that Uthgar bested.

Historical evidence suggests that Uthgar was probably a Ruathym Northman named Uther Gardolfsson. Uther led a long raiding career - including looting fabled Illuskan - before founding his barbarian dynasty. No one denies that Uthgar or Uther did indeed ascend to divinity on his deathbed, sponsored by the god of war, who admired his fighting spirit.

<string name="3047">The Imps&apos; Prison</string>
<string name="3048">Popular legends tell of sylvan creatures luring men within trees, where exists entire kingdoms, known as the faerie realms. A less-popular legend tells of a similarly mischievous group of imps.

According to the tale, these imps lure people into their realms by taunting them with something that they may desire, such as wealth or pleasure. Once the person follows, entranced by the whisperings of the imps, he finds himself within a twisted abyss, bereft of hope or the possibility of escape.
</string>
<string name="3049">The Time of Troubles</string>
<string name="3050">When Ao cast out the gods from heaven, their avatars walked the earth, interacted with mortals (some more ruthlessly than others), and scrambled to find a way to return to their homes. Known as the Time of Troubles, the Godswar, or the Avatar Crisis, this period in the history of Faer&#1099;n is the most chaotic in recent memory.

Sudden mortality wreaked havoc on the deities. Mystra was destroyed and her essence merged with the land, causing magic to function erratically and creating many areas of wild and dead magic. Gond the Wonderbringer fell to earth as a gnome on the shores of Lantan. Grateful for the sanctuary offered by the city, he taught its citizens the secrets of smoke-powder. Tymora appeared at her temple in Arabel and it is thought that her presence there spared the city from destruction. Ibrandul, god of caverns, was slain by Shar and his portfolio stolen. 

Helm retained his divine power and was commanded by Ao to guard the path back to the outer planes. Due to his success in this endeavor, blame for much of the Godswar&apos;s destruction is laid at his feet. Malar battled Nobanion and was hunted by Gwaeron Windstrom. Shaundakul battled and destroyed the avatar of a minor orc deity. Sharess took the form of the favorite concubine of the pasha of Calimport and was liberated from the growing influence of Shar by Sune. The Red Knight appeared in Tethyr, helping that nation defeat monsters raiding from the Wealdath. 

Hoar slew Ramman, Untheric god of war, but lost his foe&apos;s portfolio to Anhur. Clangeddin Silverbeard battled Labelas Enoreth over a misunderstanding. Waukeen vanished and custody of her portfolio was claimed by her ally Lliira. The avatar of the godling Iyachtu Xvim, half-demon offspring of Bane, was imprisoned under Zhentil Keep. Gilgeam, the god-king of Unther, was slain by his rival Tiamat, ending his two-millennia rule of that nation.

Bhaal, the god of murder, was greatly weakened at the time of the Godswar and existed only as a murderous force that could possess living beings. When Bane challenged Torm, the Black Lord slew all of the assassins in Faer&#1099;n and absorbed their essence, further weakening Bhaal. 

Forging an alliance with Myrkul, Bhaal kidnapped the mortal Midnight and discovered one of the tablets of fate. But at the Boaraskyr Bridge Bhaal was killed by the mortal Cyric with the sword Godsbane (the avatar of Mask). Cyric absorbed some of Bhaal&apos;s power, while the rest went into the Winding Water, poisoning it.

Leira, goddess of deception and illusions, was slain by Cyric with Godsbane and her portfolio absorbed by him. Cyric later broke Godsbane, greatly weakening Mask.

Bane was destroyed by Torm during a battle in Tantras, and his portfolio was given to Cyric by Ao. Torm himself was destroyed in the conflict with Bane, but because at the time his realm was actually Toril and because he died in service to his ethos (obedience and duty), lord Ao restored him to life and reinstated him as a deity.

Myrkul&apos;s avatar battled Midnight, and she destroyed him. Midnight became the new incarnation of Mystra, absorbing the essence of the previous goddess from the land. Cyric became the new god of strife, tyranny, murder, and death, holding the portfolios of the slain Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul (years later he lost the portfolio of death to the mortal Kelemvor when he was temporarily driven mad by an artifact he created).

The close of the Avatar Crisis brought a change to the way deities relate to their followers. By Ao&apos;s decree, a deity&apos;s power is related to the number and fervor of his worshippers, and so deities could no longer afford to ignore their faithful. While the Godswar reshaped the land and altered the Faer&#1099;nian pantheon dramatically, the accountability of divinity is the most powerful legacy of the Time of Troubles.

<string name="3051">The Nether Scrolls</string>
<string name="3052">Long ago, an unknown adventurer discovered a set of magic writings that held vast secrets of magic. These writings came to be called the Nether Scrolls. Taken together, they granted insight into the mysteries of spellcasting, the creation of magic items and constructs, the relations and structure of the planes, and even the making of artifacts. Although all of the Nether Scrolls were lost or stolen over the following 2,000 years, by then the information they contained had changed Netherese society forever.

The lords of Netheril developed forms of magic never before seen in the world. The mythallar was a invention by the Netherese wizard Ioulaum that gave power to nearby items, negating the need for expenditure of a spellcaster&apos;s energy to create magic items. The mythallar also allowed the creation of flying cities, formed by slicing off and inverting the top of a mountain. Netheril&apos;s people took to the skies in these flying enclaves of magic, safe from human barbarians and hordes of evil humanoids. Every citizen wielded minor magic, and the Netherese traded with nearby elven and dwarven nations, expanding the reach of their empire greatly.
</string>
<string name="3053">The War of Light and Darkness</string>
<string name="3054">Lord Ao created the universe that now holds the world of Toril. After this creation, there was a period of timeless nothingness, a misty realm of shadows that existed before light and darkness were separated. Eventually this shadowy essence coalesced to form twin beautiful goddesses, polar opposites of each other, one dark and one light. The twin goddesses created the bodies of the heavens, creating Chauntea, the embodiment of the world Toril. Toril was lit by the cool radiance of the goddess Selune, and darkened by the welcoming embrace of the goddess Shar, but no heat yet existed in this place.

Chauntea begged for warmth that she might nurture life and living creatures upon her form, and this caused the twin goddesses to become divided in intent. The two fought, and from their divine conflict the deities of war, disease, murder, death, and others were created.

Sel&#1099;ne reached beyond the universe to a plane of fire, using pure flame to ignite one of the heavenly bodies so that Chauntea would be warmed. Shar became enraged and began to snuff out all light and warmth in the universe. Desperate and greatly weakened, Sel&#1099;ne tore the divine essence of magic from her body and hurled it at her sister, tearing through Shar&apos;s form and pulling with it like energy from the dark twin. This energy formed Mystryl, the goddess of magic. Composed of light and dark magic but favoring her first mother, Mystryl balanced the battle enough to establish an uneasy truce between the two sisters.

Shar, who remained powerful, nursed a bitter loneliness in the darkness and plotted her revenge. Sel&#1099;ne waxed and waned with the light, but drew strength from her allied daughters and sons, and even interloper deities from other planes. Their battle continues to this day.

<string name="3055">Waterdeep</string>
<string name="3056">Waterdeep, often called the City of Splendors, lies on the southwestern edge of the North. It boasts a population of almost a million and a half, though the actual number varies seasonally. In times of busy trade, the city hosts five times this number. Almost every surface-dwelling race has representatives here, and many have taken up permanent residence. The halfling population grows annually, promising to become the largest nonhuman race in residence. To match the racial variety, most religions have shrines or temples.

Waterdeep was first used as a trading site more than two millennia ago. As recently as one thousand years ago, permanent farms had sprung up in the area. The first mention of a Waterdeep (not as a city, but as a collection of warlords) occurred just 400 years ago.

The city was truly established as a going concern by 1032 DR, the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep, and the date from which Northreckoning is counted. The city grew spectacularly, such that by 1248 DR both the City of the Dead and the guilds had been developed. The guildmasters seized control soon afterwards, ushering in a period of unrest and bitter conflict known as the Guildwars. These wars ended only when the two surviving guildmasters brought in their own period of misrule. Not until 1273 DR was the present system of government instituted, with the establishment of the Magisters and the secret Lords of Waterdeep firmly reestablished in power.

Since that time, the city has continued to grow and prosper. Members of every race come from all over the Realms to earn hard coin in the City of Splendors. Over the years these successful merchants have set up guilds and become nobility themselves. The secretive Lords of Waterdeep police the city with a light hand, exercising polite authority by means of the city guard, city watch, and over 20 black-robed magistrates. As a result, Waterdeep has grown tolerant of different races, religions, and lifestyles. This in turn has encouraged commerce, and Waterdeep today is a huge, eclectic city, one of the most vibrant and prosperous in the whole of Faer&#1099;n.

<string name="3057">The Adventures of Grin, Richard, and Wu-Wei </string>
<string name="3058">Circumstance; she is a goddess in her own right for all she casts upon us. Witness the trials of our three heroes, and know of what I speak. Have knowledge first of young Wu-Wei, sheltered monk of the elven race. Thrown to the winds that he might find a path, instead he found a briar, but with good friends to share the pricking of his fortune.

Joined with him were Grin and Richard, young and true, and in that order. They came with dreams and hopes for fortune; their homes long lost behind them, their bridges burning literal. In time they would address what cast them out, but food and aching feet would first need their attention.

Wayward went they all, breaking trail where dungeons hide. Tales had told of treasure here and treasure there, and they forgot that tales tell tales most of all. Lost they got, and plenty of it.

Then one morn they cracked the dawn, and adventure didn&apos;t hide. They needed no scouting skill, no premonition; it landed in their lap, or rather, their camp. A tower, stretching high above as though yawing with them as they woke, somehow seeming just as surprised that its doorstep was there, as they were to be on it.

It was most peculiar, and a cheer went up, for that was what they wanted! Of course it wasn&apos;t right; it was adventure, and adventure, most of all, takes you where you shouldn&apos;t be. Up they clambered clamoring, sure of what must be done. They would search it well from top to tine, ready to let each corner yield its treasure. Wayward buildings scream of wizards and careless alchemy; there had to be something within, some fortune to walk away with.

Walk away, it did. Grin and Wu were first to sprint the stairs, while Richard lagged behind. The air was wrong for headlong joy, and the walls were unwisely damp, and he thought to himself that something just wasn&apos;t right with this instant tower. The topmost rooms would reveal why, ceding no treasure, no gems, and no captured maidens. Instead, there was a mouth, and not just any mouth, but the very worst kind of mouth, it being one that they were already in. Understanding dripped down their spines. The tower was not a tower; what it was, was hungry. Mimic. A bloody great mimic.

Our heroes lived, of course, for I would not wish to profit in their story had they met a tragic end. Although, truth be told, if they had skin on their teeth before their escape, they have surely lost it now, but gained a bit of trepidation and wisdom in its place. Remember well what has been told, and learn from their misfortune. Look for something long enough and you will find it; look for something without understanding, and it will find you.

<string name="3059">The Rise &amp; Fall of Netheril</string>
<string name="3060">To the east, on the sandy shores of the calm and shining Narrow Sea, human fishing villages grew into small towns and then joined together as the nation of Netheril. Sages believe the fishing towns were unified by a powerful human wizard who had discovered a book of great magic power that had survived from the Days of Thunder - a book that legend calls the Nether Scrolls. Under this nameless wizard and those who followed, Netheril rose in power and glory, becoming both the first human land in the North and the most powerful. Some say this discovery marked the birth of human wizardry, since before this time mankind had only shamans and witch doctors. For over 3,000 years Netheril dominated the North, but even its legendary wizards were unable to stop their final doom.

Doom for Netheril came in the form of a desert, devouring the Narrow Sea and spreading to fills its banks with dry dust and blowing sand. Legend states when the great wizards of Netheril realized their land was lost, they abandoned it and their countrymen, fleeing to all corners of the world and taking the secrets of wizardry with them. More likely, this was a slow migration that began 3,000 years ago and reached its conclusion 1,500 years later.

Whatever the truth, wizards no longer dwelled in Netheril. To the north, the once-majestic dwarven stronghold of Delzoun fell upon hard days. Then the orcs struck. Orcs have always been foes in the North, surging out of their holes every few tens of generations when their normal haunts can no longer support their burgeoning numbers. This time they charged out of their caverns in the Spine of the World, poured out of abandoned mines in the Graypeaks, screamed out of lost dwarfholds in the Ice Mountains, raged forth from crypt complexes in the Nether Mountains, and stormed upward from the bowels of the High Moon Mountains. Never before or since has then been such an outpouring of orcs.

Delzoun crumbled before this onslaught and was driven in on itself. Netheril, without its wizards, was wiped from the face of history. The Eaerlann elves alone withstood the onslaught, and with the aid of treants of Turlang and other unnamed allies, were able to stave off the final days of their land for yet a few centuries more.

In the east, Eaerlann built the fortress of Ascalhorn and turned it over to refugees from Netheril as Netherese followers built the town of Karse in the High Forest. The fleeing Netherese founded Llorkh and Loudwater. Others wandered the mountains, hills, and moors north and west of the High Forest, becoming ancestors of the Uthgardt and founders of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar.

<string name="3061">The Leadership of Neverwinter</string>
<string name="3062">The city of Neverwinter was originally founded by Lord Halueth Never. This great lord was laid to rest - so local tavern tales swear - on a huge slab of stone encircled by a ring of naked swords laid with their points radiating outward. These magic blades animate to attack all intruders if the precise instructions graven in cryptic verses on the flagstones are not followed.

Today Neverwinter is ruled by Lord Nasher Alagondar, an amiable and balding warrior who keeps his city firmly in the Lords&apos; Alliance. Lord Nasher has laid many intrigues and magical preparations against attacks from Neverwinter&apos;s warlike rival town, Luskan. Nasher doesn&apos;t allow maps of the city to be made. This is to keep the spies of Luskan busy and add a minor measure of difficulty to any Luskanite invasion plans. 

The royal badge of the city is a white swirl - a sideways &quot;M,&quot; with points to the right. It connects three white snowflakes; each flake is different, but all are encircled by silver and blue halos.

Lord Nasher is always accompanied by his bodyguard, the Neverwinter Nine. These warriors are entrusted with the many magic items Nasher accumulated over a very successful decade of adventuring.

<string name="3287">Drow Shortsword +1</string>
<string name="3288">Drow Shortsword +3</string>
<string name="3289">Balor Sword</string>
<string name="3290">Greenstone</string>
<string name="3291">As its name indicates, this gem is generally green in color. Typical samples, however, have a pattern of overlapping edges that range from yellow-green to almost black. When polished, they have a beautiful play of light within their crystalline structure.</string>
<string name="3292">Fire Agate</string>
<string name="3293">Fire agate forms in thin brown layers that refract the incoming light, giving the gem its &quot;fire.&quot; The refraction often forms patterns reminiscent of a dragon&apos;s scales, which makes it prized by sorcerers who claim to trace their lineage back to dragonkin. A well-cut stone has its outer layers polished and ground away until only the fire is visible.</string>
<string name="3294">Amethyst</string>
<string name="3295">The most valued amethyst crystals are a milky, wine-dark purple. Some say that the original Amethyst was a young priestess favored by both Sune and Selune. The two goddesses fought over the girl and, in their folly, destroyed her. A single glance from Selune turned the girl into moonlight, all silver and transparent. As the struggle continued, a goblet of wine fell from Selune&apos;s feasting table, splashing onto Amethyst and granting her the gemstone&apos;s characteristic purple hue.</string>
<string name="3296">Phenalope</string>
<string name="3297">A singularly beautiful stone, phenalope is dusty pink in color, dramatically marked with black streaks. Even when mounted in jewelry, phenalope maintains a rough texture, pocked with tiny holes that cannot be polished out. For some, this is part of the stone&apos;s attraction, and they wear it as a symbol of their own tenacious natures.</string>
<string name="3298">Diamond</string>
<string name="3299">This transparent crystal is the hardest substance found in nature. The most valued color is a clear bluish-white; most lesser stones are clear white or off-white, but other less valued color varieties are known, among them mauve, pink, peach, and chartreuse. Due to its hardness, the gem is always faceted rather than polished.</string>
<string name="3300">Ruby</string>
<string name="3301">Bright and beautiful, the ruby is famous for its clear and bloody hue. To some it is the gem of love, to others the gem of revenge. To all it is unquestionably precious, and the largest, most flawless specimens are more highly prized than diamonds. The goddess Sune is said to sometimes wear rubies in her wild hair.</string>
<string name="3302">Malachite</string>
<string name="3303">Favored by druids for its graceful and natural beauty, malachite is known for its strikingly ornamental bands of light and dark green that alternate throughout the entire stone. Painters have also been known to crush the gem and use it as a pigment. Adventurers have discovered that the gem bubbles and dissolves readily in acid, making it an effective - if expensive - means of identifying certain dangerous substances.</string>
<string name="3304">Sapphire</string>
<string name="3305">The blue sapphire is twin to the more precious ruby in all respects but color. In most stones, the sparkling blue color must be brought out by exposure to great heat. Once &quot;cooked,&quot; the color change is permanent and does not otherwise affect the much-treasured durability of the gem.</string>
<string name="3306">Fire Opal</string>
<string name="3307">Unlike their more common cousin, fire opals are full of vibrant hues: hot yellows, oranges, and reds so bright they almost cast their own light. Some believe that these gems derive their glow from a supernatural source, and not a few sages have claimed that each gem is a tiny portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire. However, scholars claim it is just the way the gem refracts the light around it.</string>
<string name="3308">Topaz</string>
<string name="3309">Best known in its pale, orange-yellow form, topaz is an attractive gem that appears in well-formed, multifaceted crystals. These crystals can reach an incredible size, and specimens weighing several hundred pounds are not unknown. The largest stones are customarily reserved for gifts on state occasions, and only the greatest master gemcutters are allowed to work them.</string>
<string name="3310">Garnet</string>
<string name="3311">Often called the &quot;Poor Man&apos;s Ruby,&quot; the common garnet is nevertheless a distinct and attractive blood-red gem in its own right. The violet form, also called rhodolite, is the rarest, most prized, and most valuable form of the stone.</string>
<string name="3312">Emerald</string>
<string name="3313">Prized for their vibrant green color, emeralds are fragile and need to be protected from the impacts and extreme temperature changes common to adventuring life. It is a highly prized gem by the wealthy and royalty alike.</string>
<string name="3314">Alexandrite</string>
<string name="3315">One of the world&apos;s rarest and most coveted gems, alexandrite takes on a brilliant green hue when under indirect sunlight but turns blood-red when exposed to candlelight. Loretellers claim that all alexandrite comes from the body of the oldest son of Silvanus, the Forest Father. A common nursery rhyme goes &quot;Silvanus&apos; wife went mad one night, murdering her child by candlelight.&quot;</string>
<string name="3316">Aventurine</string>
<string name="3317">When cut and polished, aventurine is alluring as its name. It resembles misty quartz, but contains glistening flecks of green that give it a unique sheen. The witches of Rashemen are said to use aventurine for invocations, evocations, and spirit work.</string>
<string name="3318">Fluorspar</string>
<string name="3319">A common but beautiful gem, flourspar comes in many colors - each of them nicely set off by the stones&apos; glassy luster. Best known in its purple hues, which are commonly mistaken for amethyst, flourspar is the much softer of the two and will scratch, chip, and even burn easily.</string>
<string name="3320">Girdle of Holy Might</string>
<string name="3321">A group of these girdles was originally created for the Sword Coast Legion, a league of clerics who fought the orc multitudes in the Year of the Black Horde, 1235 DR.</string>
<string name="3322">Belt of Hill Giant Strength</string>
<string name="3323">This wide belt is made of thick leather and studded with iron. It grants the wearer the strength of a giant and the ability to make devastating melee attacks.</string>
<string name="3324">Ceremonial Uthgardt Belt</string>
<string name="3325">In an attempt to keep the thriving Uthgardt clans under control, a long-forgotten gathering of druids inflicted them with a virulent pox. This disease soon spread out of control, and far from curbing their numbers actually threatened their extinction. To maintain the balance, these same druids created a number of these ceremonial belts to ensure the survival of the clan&apos;s leaders. Ultimately the Uthgardt survived the plague, though the incident did not improve their opinion of outsiders.</string>
<string name="3326">Encircling Scale</string>
<string name="3327">A required item for all students of the Encircling Scale, a thieves&apos; guild with many enemies, belts such as this are practical, if not particularly fashionable. A popular tale among the ranks has the vainglorious spouse of the guild leader falling to poison because she refused to wear one, although members of more sinister intent are inclined to blame her rich inheritance as the cause of her downfall.</string>
<string name="3328">Sash of Shimmering</string>
<string name="3329">When the wizard Midnight saw her abilities grow so great as to assume a station amongst the gods, her soul drank magic straight from the fabric of the weave. She ascended, abandoning much of her mortal self and belongings, though they too were transformed. The sash she wore absorbed so much energy that it sundered, and each of the many pieces became a powerful item in its own right, protecting the wielder from magical attack.</string>
<string name="3330">Belt of Inertial Barrier</string>
<string name="3331">Hoisure the Prudent was a cunning pirate who sought every advantage he could for his men. He commissioned a number of these belts at great expense, and with his men so equipped quickly took control of great tracts of coastline. Although he ruled with remarkable restraint and wisdom for many years, eventually his enemies gained the upper hand, and he remains a villain in the eyes of history.</string>
<string name="3332">Belt of Frost Giant Strength</string>
<string name="3333">Belt of Fire Giant Strength</string>
<string name="3334">Blessed by priests of Shaundakul the Windrider, these boots seem to make even the most arduous journey easier and more pleasant. This is accomplished not by increasing the wearer&apos;s speed, but by making him hardier and more resistant to pain. Numerous versions of these boots exist, their power varying largely in accordance with the priest who blessed them.</string>
<string name="3335">Boots of Striding +1</string>
<string name="3336">Several pairs of this type of boot were made for elven battalions during the Year of Singing Arrows, 884 DR. The scouts equipped with this stealthy footwear turned the tide of at least two major battles against Sembian mercenaries.</string>
<string name="3337">Boots of Elvenkind</string>
<string name="3338">Feryl Dragonhunter was a monster of a man who, with four kills to his credit, thought he had perfected the art of dragon slaying. He aided his efforts by creating magical equipment from his previous victories, including several different boots he mockingly called his Dragon Slippers. Amazingly, Feryl was not defeated by his preferred enemy, but was surprised by a small band of goblins on his way to a hunt.</string>
<string name="3339">Dragon Slippers</string>
<string name="3340">Legend holds that the mage who created the Gargoyle Boots trapped the spirit of an actual gargoyle within them. Unfortunately, the boots couldn&apos;t protect the nameless wizard from the vengeance of the gargoyle&apos;s mate. As there are multiple variations on the Gargoyle Boots, it is assumed that the tale is, though entertaining, a mere fabrication - an interesting way to explain the magical toughness that the boots provide.</string>
<string name="3341">Gargoyle Boots</string>
<string name="3342">&quot;You can hide, but you cannot run!&quot; This was the calling card of a deadly Sword Coast assassin who purportedly moved with such speed that his targets couldn&apos;t respond, even if on horseback. These boots were the source of his ability, though it is also believed that he formed an elite guild wherein each member was equipped identically, thus explaining why he was not just fast, but could seemingly appear in several places at once.</string>

<string name="3348">Bracers of Dexterity +1</string>
<string name="3349">Bracers of this type were likely developed in Kara-Tur to aid masters of the martial arts. Legends speak of visitors from the Far East bringing these items with them on their journeys, though details remain sketchy.</string>
<string name="3350">Bracers of Armor +1</string>
<string name="3351">These items at first appear to be simple wrist or arm guards, but they surround the wearer with an invisible field of force, and grant protection just like mundane armor. They are likely from the armory of some disbanded militia.</string>

<string name="3359">Bracers of Armor +5</string>
<string name="3360">Bracers of Locking Grip</string>
<string name="3361">Henisevan le Daliya - a boyish, effeminate noble - had the curious goal of becoming a master swordsman. To counter his limp grip (and avoid &quot;unsightly muscle growth&quot;), he had the court wizards craft several pairs of bracers, each locking hand-to-blade. All was well until a clever strike from the young noble drew the blood of his opponent. Distraught, Henisevan spent his remaining days in an isolated tower - accompanied by only fresh fruit and fawning men.</string>

<string name="3366">Wondrous Gloves</string>
<string name="3367">Maynard, a young genius of a bard (but with little wisdom to spare), found himself the victim of theft when the magic gloves that enhanced his memory were stolen. Instead of outwitting the rogues, Maynard simply recreated the gloves - over and over again. The finished product was stolen each time, and this eventually evolved into an odd working partnership, though never once did Maynard realize he was in business supplying his Wondrous Gloves.</string>
<string name="3368">Gloves of the Rogue</string>
<string name="3369">The elderly Oghmanyte Milladolin found that age was affecting her and her fellows quite rapidly, causing their hands to shake and preventing them from performing many of their priestly duties. With Oghma&apos;s blessings, Milladolin created magical gloves that steadied their hands and heightened their muscle control. Years later, a young Oghmanyte was caught for thievery - guilty of using the gloves. Word spread, and soon the gloves themselves were stolen away.</string>
<string name="3370">Harp of Charming</string>
<string name="3371">These beautiful instruments are constructed of mithral and silver to produce the purest, clearest tones. They are often strung with the hair of harpies or nymphs, to harness these creatures&apos; innate charm abilities.</string>
<string name="3372">Harp of Haunting</string>
<string name="3373">Carved from old bones and strung with the bowstrings of dead heroes, these grim instruments are not often put on display. They are brutally effective in combat, however, and several famous bards have used them when circumstances made it necessary.</string>
<string name="3374">Harp of Pandemonium</string>
<string name="3375">Like their namesake plane, these instruments produce shifting, disconsolate tones that seem to penetrate the ear and confuse the senses. When strummed by a talent, these random notes coalesce into fields of pure chaos, turning dedicated enemies into dazed idiots.</string>
<string name="3376">Scabbard of Blessing</string>
<string name="3377">Most scabbards of this type were created by a long-forgotten order of paladins and militant clerics, but today they see use by all sorts of warriors, both good and evil.</string>
<string name="3378">Meat</string>
<string name="3379">Skin</string>
<string name="3380">Amulet of Natural Armor +1</string>
<string name="3381">When old age forced his retirement from combat, the warrior Telenn became a tutor instead, instructing local youths in the fighting arts. His longtime interest in magic was rekindled and, as his skills improved, he began creating these amulets to prevent his students from injuring themselves. Eventually his work became so good that he gave up the quiet life and resumed adventuring, amulets in tow.</string>
<string name="3382">Talisman of Pure Evil</string>
<string name="3383">These sinister talismans border on the power of artifacts. Only an evil being may wear one, and even the most evil finds his dark soul being twisted and honed by the device as it turns him more and more fiendish with every passing day. Examples of these items appear in many different forms, suggesting multiple creators at different points in history. They are thankfully very rare.</string>
<string name="3384">Necklace of Prayer Beads</string>
<string name="3385">These necklaces are occasionally distributed among the faithful by powerful temples, both to reward their followers and entice new members to join. Necklaces of this type are usable only by divine spellcasters, including rangers and paladins as well as clerics and druids.</string>
<string name="3386">Talisman of Pure Good</string>
<string name="3387">These holy talismans border on the power of artifacts. Only a good creature may wear one, and even the most beatific finds his soul challenged and refined, as the device makes him more and more righteous with every passing day. Examples of these items appear in many different forms, suggesting multiple creators at different points in history. They are unfortunately very rare.</string>
<string name="3388">Amulet of Power</string>
<string name="3389">Ger&apos;baza was an ancient lich who sought more power than a mortal mind can fathom. Fusing captured souls to make the Amulet of Power, Ger&apos;baza was amazed at his own success and created countless variants. Common sense, however, failed him; while attempting to wear all of the necklaces in unison, Ger&apos;baza was quietly erased from existence. The amulets miraculously survived.</string>
<string name="3390">Scarab of Protection +1</string>
<string name="3391">A scarab is a stone amulet carved in the shape of a stout-bodied beetle. This particular example shields the wearer&apos;s person inside an invisible barrier. The strength of this barrier is determined by the power and skill of the creator of the item, and varies with each specimen. Scarabs are of a far southern design, though the original source is lost to history.</string>
<string name="3392">Periapt of Wisdom +1</string>
<string name="3393">Although it appears to be a simple pearl on a light chain, a Periapt of Wisdom is a powerful item. These items improve perception and insight, and are often used as meditative tools by high-ranking clergy of a faith.</string>

<string name="3421">Potion of Antidote</string>

<string name="3429">Potion of Eagle&apos;s Splendor</string>
<string name="3430">This potion restores life force drained by creatures that channel negative energy. The murky liquid glows when brought near a living being, but the ingredients are impossible to discern.</string>
<string name="3431">Potion of Lesser Restoration</string>
<string name="3432">This potion is a wonderful restorative, healing damage and curing most ill effects as though by a Heal spell. The flask is light, and only the tightly corked seal suggests there is liquid within.</string>

<string name="3453">Ring of Protection +1</string>
<string name="3454">This ring and several of its type were originally crafted to protect the sons of King Castter De&apos;wess, though the creator is unknown. The rings remained within that family for at least thirteen generations and were all lost within the space of one. Enmity between the King&apos;s heirs and those of the rings&apos; crafter are rumored to be the cause of their disappearance.</string>
<string name="3455">Ring of Elemental Resistance</string>
<string name="3456">When Galevaar the Bold tired of mundane enemies, he decided to invade the Abyss. He spent his fortune on a ring that made him proof against all forms of elemental damage, the first ring of this type. No one knows if the ring would have protected him in the 666 layers of the pit; his men mutinied at the open portal and pushed him through without any of his equipment. He has not been heard from since.</string>
<string name="3457">Ring of Invisibility</string>
<string name="3458">Though there are numerous examples of such rings, this one may have come from a set once owned by a master thief that worked Waterdhavian crowds in broad daylight, replacing purses with bags of sand. Once thought retired, it is now suspected that the so-called &quot;Sand Thief&quot; was eventually killed for not joining a local thieves&apos; guild, and that his rings were seized by a group that abused his methods liberally.</string>
<string name="3459">Ring of Regeneration</string>
<string name="3460">The lowly wizard Huhhus discovered an efficient way to distill troll flesh into a regenerative potion, but few people were willing to drink the vile liquid and it was considered a failure. Decades later, one of his students built upon these foundations to create a regenerative ring fueled by bits of troll ichor and brains. This external use caused far less nausea, and the invention met with success.</string>
<string name="3461">Ring of Magic Defences</string>
<string name="3462">These potent defensive rings are much in demand in urban areas, where duels between rival spellcasters are unfortunately common. Armed with one of these items, even a relatively inexperienced caster can withstand the attack of an archmage - albeit briefly.</string>
<string name="3463">Ring of Clear Thought +1</string>
<string name="3464">Tormented by voices that incessantly attacked his mind, young Resino of Beregost begged his local church to kill him. Understanding his pain but unable to identify any specific demonic influence, the church tried crafting rings that they hoped would clear his thoughts. Unfortunately, while the rings enhanced his senses they did nothing for the voices, and Resino eventually took his own life.</string>
<string name="3465">Ring of Holiness</string>
<string name="3466">Legend holds that this plain gold band was a gift from Ao to Helm as a reward for the God&apos;s stalwart service during the Time of Troubles. Helm, in turn, diluted and divided the ring and passed the gift on to his mortal followers. Scholars outside the church argue that Ao seems above emotion or gratitude, and chalk the story up to propaganda for the faithful.</string>

<string name="3475">Scholars and sages across the known world covet these rings and their cousins, the famed Rings of Insight. The Scholar&apos;s Ring introduces an innovation to the original design, adding a light source for hands-free reading in the dark of a basement library, or in a dungeon.

<string name="3508">As a child, Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande helped to save her home of Thundertree from the spells of a power-hungry Luskan wizard, doing so with the aid of this ring. Crafted by the elves of the Neverwinter Wood and given to her by the ranger Ansal Bloodshoulder, it was once a dear possession of hers... but no longer. On the road to becoming a paladin of Tyr, there have been times when she felt the need to break from her past - to shed certain parts of herself so that the light of the Just God would find her unburdened. For whatever reason, Lady Aribeth no longer chooses to recognize this ring as hers, and it has passed to other hands. Like its former owner, the silver band is graceful and resilient, elegant but with a hidden strength.</string>
<string name="3509">Instrument of the Winds</string>
<string name="3510">A sinister device bearing the souls of many who have played it, the Instrument of the Winds nonetheless produces a haunting tune. Some say its strings are fashioned of the silver cords that once linked its victims to this plane. Strung in a minor chord, it has maintained its perfect timbre over the years. Its best-known player was the young Alavar who tried to free the spirits of his parents from its grasp.</string>
<string name="3511">Storm Armor</string>
<string name="3512">In a plane far distant from our own, the renowned brassworker Gisnervi crafted this breastplate to be presented to the son of the sultan of the City of Brass on his seventh birthday.

Exiled to the material plane, Gisnervi befriended Samir, a blacksmith of Neverwinter, who was able break the curse and restore the brassworker&apos;s honor.</string>
<string name="3513">Moonstone Mask</string>
<string name="3514">Named after the storied Moonstone Mask of Neverwinter, these helmets were worn to aid the &quot;women of the Mask&quot; in their defense.

<string name="3515">Silvermane, heroine of the dwarves, had a jealous stepsister, Selarna, who she killed in battle. Selarna&apos;s spirit became trapped within the killing axe. From her vantage point within that blade, Selarna took her vengeance by provoking many subsequent wielders to kill their siblings. The curse was broken by the dwarf Skarlin, upon the killing of his brother Njal. Freed from Selarna&apos;s influence, the weapon has since been able to give life as well as take it.</string>
<string name="3516">Silvermane&apos;s Axe</string>
<string name="3517">Long ago, the formians built great subterranean cities and vast, cavernous empires. Societies of war, they reveled in the blood and glory of the gladiatorial pit, where slaves and prisoners fought for their cruel amusement. One such gladiator was the human Ajan, who stole the blade of his formian master and used it to escape to the surface with Zoe, his love. It is said that all who wield it are bound for greatness.</string>
<string name="3518">Blade of the Gladiator</string>
<string name="3519">In ancient times, the proud and quarrelsome wizard Valmaxian was a man of great power and prominence.

In a rage, Valmaxian descended into the Abyss and used the staff to battle the demon and rescue the woman he loved.</string>
<string name="3520">Staff of Valmaxian</string>
<string name="3521">This dagger was a gift from Targus, God of War, to Serreg of Neverwinter. It originally allowed its wielder to polymorph into many forms, but the magic gradually decayed and now it is the blade itself that polymorphs, from time to time, over the eons. It currently takes the shape of a greatsword and will likely remain as such for many years to come.</string>

<string name="3711">Armor of the Wolf</string>
<string name="3712">While tanned wolf hide does not offer the protection of other materials, skilled artisans can infuse these suits with the animal&apos;s spirit. Armor of the Wolf is especially prized among the Beast Cults.</string>
<string name="3713">Mirrored Armor</string>
<string name="3714">Many a stout warrior has been left unable to strike a blow against an opponent wearing this shining armor. It takes someone with a strong will to strike at his or her own reflection. While this armor does not offer much in the way of physical protection, it is an excellent defense against magic.</string>
<string name="3715">Armor of the Stars</string>
<string name="3716">This armor gleams with an iridescent inner light. It is said that the great Jerred Stormlord earned his name when he stood defiantly before an adult blue dragon while wearing such a suit. He gave no ground to the monster and its lightning breath never touched him. The name &apos;Stormlord&apos; was granted posthumously however, since the armor offers little protection against tooth and claw.</string>
<string name="3717">Armor of Fleetness</string>
<string name="3718">The infamous rogue Cromback was never seen without his Armor of Fleetness. As Cromback was in fact famed for being a very poor rogue, he was often seen fleeing from angry victims. He invariably outran his pursuers due to the magical properties of his armor, but met a tragic end when one mark had the presence of mind to string a bow.</string>
<string name="3719">Shadow Legion Armor</string>
<string name="3720">The Shadow Thieves of Amn are known to have deep pockets, and while they may employ countless gutter thugs and petty crooks, their elite core members are equipped very well indeed. Items such as Shadow Legion Armor have occasionally been recovered from events where their involvement was suspected, though guild leaders have never confirmed or denied ownership.</string>
<string name="3721">Aurumvorax Armor</string>
<string name="3722">This gold-hued armor is supposedly made from the hide of a ferocious aurumvorax, a six-legged wolverine-like beast that devours not only meat, but also precious metals. The diet of the creature gives its hide a spectacular finish and incredible protective qualities, a resilience shared by armor constructed from it.</string>
<string name="3723">The Great Oak</string>
<string name="3724">The treant Birch is not noted for his tolerance toward those who threaten his forest. When giants felled a grove of his oldest oaks, he vowed revenge and enlisted the aid of a group of rangers. To help his new friends, he infused their armor with all the protective energy he could muster. Their combined might was enough to soundly defeat the invaders, and giants of the north still tell of the angry forest spirits that drove them from the lowlands. The rangers&apos; suits have since scattered to the corners of the world.</string>
<string name="3725">Squire&apos;s Defense</string>
<string name="3726">The famed paladin Gareth Dragonsbane grew tired of losing squires to freak accidents. All sorts of misfortune befell his shield bearers, from being crushed by catapult stones to being trodden on by giants. He commissioned these suits of armor to give increased strength to his squires and hopefully prevent future losses. Nevertheless, only the bravest men ever applied for the job.</string>
<string name="3727">Black Flame Armor</string>
<string name="3728">Halfling artificers are credited with creating the best-known modern examples of this heat resistant armor, having apparently constructed a number of suits to combat a marauding efreeti some 50 years ago. The design has since been copied, though the great expense involved and the highly specific focus of the finished item means that copies are rarely seen on the market.</string>
<string name="3729">Kumakawa</string>
<string name="3730">In the right hands, the hide of a displacer beast can be tanned to a suit of potent magic armor. These particular suits were created by the famed artificer Kumakawa, whose experience at working these skins is greater than most. In addition to their protective quality, the suits endow the wearer with the exceptional reflexes of a wary predator.</string>
<string name="3731">Armor of Loyalty</string>
<string name="3732">When he angered a rival enchanter, the wizard Mekhari came under repeated attack from his own charmed or dominated bodyguards. This was expensive as well as dangerous, so he set about trying to counter the threat in a way that would not mean constantly killing his own men. With armor of this type Mekhari considered his men above reproach. He was proven wrong when his own lieutenant murdered him in a dispute over back wages.</string>
<string name="3733">Callurdan Smoothand&apos;s Armor</string>
<string name="3734">These suits are replicas of the armor worn by the Avatar of Callarduran Smoothand, and thus bear his name. Craftsmen of the svirfneblin, the deep gnomes, created these suits to honor this god of stone. Once donned, the armor gives its owner extraordinary resistance to magic. The gnomes have found this very useful in their ongoing wars with the drow.</string>
<string name="3735">Armor of Thorns</string>
<string name="3736">This unsettling suit of armor drinks the blood of an enemy and passes the life force to its wearer. Some have suggested that the armor harbors a malevolent intelligence or influence, because many warriors become ill after using such a suit for the first time. It could, however, just be the accompanying slurping sound that makes the process so disturbing.</string>
<string name="3737">Armor of Command</string>
<string name="3738">These impressive suits of armor are much in demand by nobles and generals. In addition to being beautifully made, they empower the wearer with an aura of respect and authority. Occasionally this property backfires, as when at the Battle of Moregrade a hapless sycophant was placed in charge of the defending army simply because he was wearing one of these suits.</string>
<string name="3739">Dragon Armor</string>
<string name="3740">Legends associated with armor of this type hearken to a time when armies would supposedly ally themselves with dragons, the great beast taking the fore in more important battles. Dragon Armor was developed in answer, and a troop of elite warriors in such gear apparently stood a good chance of victory. It should be noted that while this tale sounds fine repeated in a tavern over ale, it does not fare so well under historical scrutiny.</string>
<string name="3741">Armor of Horus-Re</string>
<string name="3742">Western scholars have little familiarity with the Old Empires or their long and storied history, even with items such as this providing a window into the culture. For instance, while the Armor of Horus-Re obviously venerates its namesake deity, its full significance can only be guessed at.</string>
<string name="3743">Broewende Family Armor</string>
<string name="3744">This armor, long a staple of the Broewende family, protects the user against many forms of attack. The original was most recently held by Lord Alain and could only be worn by those of his bloodline, but copies have apparently been fashioned for use by others. The design is meant to protect against a variety of spells and effects, though different examples may vary in power depending on who created them.</string>
<string name="3745">White Dragon Armor</string>
<string name="3746">White Dragon Armor is lightweight, strong, and highly resistant to cold. These suits are much sought after, but few smiths are willing to craft them. The necessary materials are rare and dangerous to acquire, and dragons have long memories where their kin are concerned. Most smiths would prefer not to even risk association with the trade in dragon hide.</string>
<string name="3747">Rainbow Armor</string>
<string name="3748">Armor of this type is not for those who wish to remain anonymous. More often it is associated with tales of the vain, and bards have even crafted songs about the appearance of &apos;rainbow warriors&apos; on a battlefield. The protective quality of the multihued surface is undeniable, but it is unfortunate that the mage who crafted these items was colorblind.</string>
<string name="3749">Armor of Comfort</string>
<string name="3750">The interlocking plates, greaves, and gauntlets of this armor appear heavy and cumbersome to wear. However, once the armor is donned it feels as comfortable and light as a well-tailored tunic. The armor also exudes a faint scent of lavender to cover up any unseemly warrior odors.</string>
<string name="3751">Elven Ceremonial Armor</string>
<string name="3752">Armor such as this has been the traditional battle vestment of surface elves for generations, and that is a very long time. While many troops might prefer the lighter elven chainmail for combat, these ceremonial armors are still potent protection. </string>
<string name="3753">Delver&apos;s Armor</string>
<string name="3754">Every profession has its hazards, and stonemasonry is no different. The dwarves of the delvers&apos; guild are often attacked while they work stone by goblins, trolls, and beasts that are best not spoken of. As protection, the guild has created armor for their members from the hides of goblins, trolls, and beasts best not spoken of.</string>
<string name="3755">Balduran&apos;s Armor</string>
<string name="3756">No one really knows what fate befell Balduran, the founder of Baldur&apos;s Gate, but people never grow tired of speculating. When his personal armor was found on the Sword Coast - supposedly recovered and sold by a group of adventurers - it only served to spark interest in him once again, and several copies of the suit were made to accommodate collectors and historians. In this way, it could be said, Balduran obtained a measure of immortality.</string>
<string name="3757">Gnomish Magnetic Armor</string>
<string name="3758">Like so many gnome inventions, this marvel of ingenuity had its origin in a profoundly stupid idea. Engineers needed a way to clean up the tacks that were cluttering the floor of their workshop. In their effort to create a field that repelled metal (thus sweeping the tacks into the corners), they instead discovered a field that repelled magic. Once they got over their disappointment, they began mass-producing the suits and selling them to their neighbors.</string>
<string name="3759">Red Dragon Armor</string>
<string name="3760">Nothing excites awe and envy like a suit of Red Dragon Armor, but such notoriety also has its downside. These suits are magnets for thieves, and worse, they draw the attention of vengeful dragons wherever the owner travels.</string>
<string name="3761">Blue Dragon Armor</string>
<string name="3762">The year of the Dracorage (1018 DR) brought great destruction to the Heartlands, but not just to the besieged residents. Dragons also fell, their enormous corpses like surreal punctuation on the battlefields. In the aftermath, scavengers took weapons and equipment from the dead, and the hides of the great beasts as well. Several suits of Blue Dragon Armor were created, but the makers remain as anonymous as the dragons whose scales were stripped.</string>
<string name="3763">Enkidu&apos;s Armor</string>
<string name="3764">The first example of this item was created for Enkidu, a famed warrior of Kara-Tur. None dared challenge him in fair combat, but he was often subject to sneak attacks from assassins, ninjas, and wu-jen. His armor was designed to prevent such cowardly action from succeeding, protecting the wearer as well as the honor of the attacker who would otherwise shame himself. Copies have been made, though they vary in power when compared to the original.</string>
<string name="3765">Cloak of the High Forest</string>
<string name="3766">The half-elf Jasswin is probably the best-known owner of one of these cloaks, since it played a significant part in his ascension to the post of Great Druid. He acquired the cloak after spending a season with no shelter, wanting to &quot;feel the land unhindered.&quot; He found the garment before the cold season set in, a gift from the wilds that carried a message both humbling and clear: he could appreciate the rain while still seeking shelter from it.</string>
<string name="3767">Nymph Cloak +1</string>
<string name="3768">Named for the creatures most closely associated with beauty, Nymph Cloaks are popular fodder for tavern tales among the common folk. The story usually involves some hapless noble couple spending a fortune on one or more such items so they can stand to look at one another. It always gets a big laugh among a copper-ale crowd, though most professional bards consider such pandering a tool of the unskilled.</string>
<string name="3769">Benzo&apos;s Luck</string>
<string name="3770">This item is named for Benzo&#8217;s Tale, a halfling favorite told to children leaving home. Ridiculed for his size, foolish Benzo tried to show off by challenging the largest dragon that he could find. He was squashed so flat that several suits of armor were cut from his original. While obviously untrue, would-be adventurers hearing this story tend to choose opponents carefully, especially after receiving a suit of Benzo&#8217;s Luck as a farewell gift.</string>
<string name="3771">Greenleaf</string>
<string name="3772">Through the years, elven craftsmen constructed many of these suits for the defense of their homes; the leather of the armor cleverly designed to blend with the forest. During the exodus of the Calling, some of this equipment found its way into the hands of adventurers, and from there, to black markets. It is not known what the elves think of this acquisition now that the Retreat has concluded.</string>
<string name="3773">Rogue Links</string>
<string name="3774">Armor of this type began to appear in the lands adjacent to Thay in the Year of Smoldering Spells, 1020 DR. An irremovable coating of soot has blackened it, dulling noise of movement and making it ideal for stealthy endeavors. Close examination, however, reveals that the charring was not the result of externally applied heat, and suggests the original owner suffered some sort of Thayvian-induced combustion. This lends a very morbid feeling to the suit.</string>
<string name="3775">Chainmail +1</string>
<string name="3776">This magic armor grants additional protection to its wearer, but it doesn&apos;t bear the hallmarks of any specific maker.</string>
<string name="3777">Doron&apos;s Mistake</string>
<string name="3778">Doron was a master dwarven smith, but even masters make mistakes. While disassembling a suit of &quot;worthless elven chain&quot; - for research, of course - he accidentally dropped several links into his forge, and that trace amount of mithral tainted everything he made until he could scour the thing from top to bottom. Each suit made during this time was infused with strange magic, but Doron threw them all on the trash heap, and was known to slap anyone he saw wearing one.</string>
<string name="3779">Elven Chainmail</string>
<string name="3780">These mithral chainmail suits are sought after by many, but rarely found outside of elven hands. Exquisite craftsmanship is a hallmark of the Fair Folk, and these suits are no exception.</string>
<string name="3781">Chainmail of Speed</string>
<string name="3782">Merko the Fleet was a firm believer that discretion is the better part of valor, and proved it in dozens of engagements he proudly outraced on foot with the help of his Chainmail of Speed. By the time of his death at a ripe old age, he had run from a dozen of the most influential battles of his time, and personally run from several famous villains. </string>
<string name="3783">Adamantine Breastplate</string>
<string name="3784">This armor bears the trademarks of drow workmanship, though it is obviously exceptional even by their standards. Several examples have been found in recent times, and scholars are unable to explain how these suits avoid the decay that normally afflicts adamantine after exposure to daylight. An obvious answer is that the items must have been intended for surface world excursions of great length and in great numbers, which is a disturbing possibility to consider.</string>
<string name="3785">Mithral Splint Mail</string>
<string name="3786">Close examination shows that these masterpieces of silvery metal share many elements, but none bears an identifiable maker&apos;s mark. This is less surprising than it might seem, since the more reclusive of master craftsmen often forego any public recognition, if only to keep charity cases knocking their doors off their hinges.</string>
<string name="3787">Copper Dragon Armor</string>
<string name="3788">This suit is crafted from the scales of a mature copper dragon, though most smiths refuse to work with the hides of these good-aligned creatures. A previous owner claimed that the dragon perished while fighting evil, and he reluctantly commissioned the suit as a tribute to its noble sacrifice. Several dragons have wondered aloud if this defense would excuse them wearing the hides of humanoid heroes. They suspect not.</string>
<string name="3789">Padded Armor +1</string>
<string name="3790">Leather Armor +1</string>
<string name="3791">Studded Leather Armor +1</string>
<string name="3792">Chain Shirt +1</string>
<string name="3793">Hide Armor +1</string>
<string name="3794">Scale Mail +1</string>
<string name="3795">Breastplate +1</string>
<string name="3796">Splint Mail +1</string>
<string name="3797">Banded Mail +1</string>
<string name="3798">Half Plate +1</string>
<string name="3799">Full Plate +1</string>
<string name="3800">Armor of Freedom</string>
<string name="3801">After his escape from magical imprisonment, the warrior-priest Archiel vowed he would never again be captured by sorcery. He devoted years to forging these suits of armor for himself and his companions, but ironically was waylaid by mundane means, and died chained to the wall of an ordinary cell.</string>
<string name="3802">Cloak of Protection +1</string>
<string name="3803">Cloaks of this sort are infused with protective spells, and are among the most popular and numerous magic items on the market. The original design may have originated in the earliest of arcane guilds, but the current makers of these items are varied and widespread.</string>
<string name="3804">Cloak of Movement</string>
<string name="3805">Golloth was a druid who enjoyed the company of spiders, studying the precision of their movements and meditating on the complexity of their webs. He spent much of his time protecting giant varieties of these creatures from the wrath of well-meaning adventurers, which alienated him from his fellow humans even more than a life in service to nature usually does. This cloak appears based on one that he had received from the Drow, a gift that allowed him to better walk among the arachnids.</string>
<string name="3806">Cloak of Elvenkind</string>
<string name="3807">Elven rangers and scouts are given cloaks like this one to help hide them while patrolling the borders of their lands. These cloaks vary in effectiveness, depending on the status of the original owner.</string>
<string name="3808">Chromatic Breastplate +1</string>
<string name="3809">This suit bears the mark of the dwarf Marrok, Master Blacksmith of Neverwinter&apos;s Shining Knight Arms and Armor. He forged it early in 1373 DR, to aid the heroes who sought to free his quarantined city from the virulent grasp of the so-called Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="3810">Scales of Truth +1</string>
<string name="3811">Whitebone Armor +2</string>
<string name="3812">Chromatic Breastplate +3</string>
<string name="3813">This suit bears the mark of the dwarf Barun, a Master Blacksmith who worked from a makeshift forge in the Uthgardt village of Beorunna&apos;s Well. He forged it late in 1373 DR, to aid the war effort against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer, who was then marching against the northern city of Neverwinter and the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="3814">Scales of Truth +3</string>
<string name="3815">Silverbone Armor +2</string>
<string name="3816">Banded Mail +2</string>
<string name="3817">Breastplate +2</string>
<string name="3818">Chainmail +2</string>
<string name="3819">Chain Shirt +2</string>
<string name="3820">Full Plate +2</string>
<string name="3821">Half Plate +2</string>
<string name="3822">Hide Armor +2</string>
<string name="3823">Leather Armor +2</string>
<string name="3824">Padded Armor +2</string>
<string name="3825">Scale Mail +2</string>
<string name="3826">Splint Mail +2</string>

<string name="3841">Cloak of Protection +3</string>
<string name="3842">Cloak of Protection +4</string>
<string name="3843">Cloak of Protection +5</string>
<string name="3844">Nymph Cloak +2</string>
<string name="3845">Nymph Cloak +3</string>
<string name="3846">Nymph Cloak +4</string>
<string name="3847">Nymph Cloak +5</string>
<string name="3848">Robe of Vecna</string>
<string name="3849">One of several items associated with the ancient lich, robes of this sort pale in comparison to the power of the better known and unique Eye or Hand of Vecna. Still, simply being kept in his presence was enough to impart substantial magical energies. </string>
<string name="3850">White Robe of the Archmagi</string>
<string name="3851">Most items of this type bear markings associated with one or more deities of good and order. Likely these are an attempt to encourage moral behavior among spellcasters, rewarding those who manage their power in responsible ways instead of lording their ability over others.</string>
<string name="3852">Grey Robe of the Archmagi</string>
<string name="3853">While garments like this have been found in almost every culture with a strong contingent of spellcasters, this example and most others in the Neverwinter area are believed to have originated within Ulcaster&apos;s School of Wizardry. The school presented no bias in its teachings, and hosted casters from all across the Sword Coast until its destruction some 200 years ago.</string>
<string name="3854">Black Robe of the Archmagi</string>
<string name="3855">Like many evil items, these robes are fashioned in great numbers by the Zhentarim and their minions. They are found far and wide across the Realms, and the more hands they touch, the more influence the Zhents enjoy.</string>
<string name="3856">Aslyferund Elven Chain</string>
<string name="3857">These fine mesh suits feel more like cloth than armor, yet many a killing blow has been turned aside by their links. Aslyferund, the most famous armorer of once-proud Myth Drannor, crafted many of these masterpieces personally, and it is rumored that the more powerful versions were created with the aid of a gold dragon.</string>
<string name="3858">Robe of Light</string>
<string name="3859">Robe of Acid Resistance</string>
<string name="3860">Robe of Cold Resistance</string>
<string name="3861">Robe of Fire Resistance</string>
<string name="3862">Robe of Electrical Resistance</string>
<string name="3863">No one knows when or where these arrows were made. It is rumored that each tip is made with a vampire tooth. That seems unlikely due to the number of quivers of these arrows that can be found.</string>
<string name="3864">Arrow of the Vampire</string>
<string name="3865">Fire Arrows burst into flames when fired, with an effect almost identical to a nonmagical arrow doused in oil and set alight.</string>
<string name="3866">Fire Arrow</string>
<string name="3867">This arrow not only pierces its target, it also releases a splash of alchemical acid on impact. </string>
<string name="3868">Acid Arrow</string>
<string name="3869">This arrow is crafted to bite deeply into its target, delivering additional piercing damage on impact.</string>
<string name="3870">Piercing Arrow</string>
<string name="3871">Ice Arrows give off a blast of frigid cold when they strike their target, flash-freezing armor and flesh alike.</string>
<string name="3872">Ice Arrow</string>
<string name="3873">Lightning Arrows explode in sparks on impact, inflicting electrical damage to their target.</string>
<string name="3874">Lightning Arrow</string>
<string name="3875">Ice-cold to the touch, these bolts have a short message imprinted on the shaft: &quot;Warning: A Touch of Frost.&quot;</string>
<string name="3876">Bolt of Frostbite</string>
<string name="3877">Lightning Bolts explode in sparks on impact, inflicting electrical damage to their target.</string>
<string name="3878">Bolt of Lightning</string>
<string name="3879">Bolts of this type can stun their targets, though potency and duration are determined by the power of the bolt&apos;s creator.</string>
<string name="3880">Paralytic Bolt</string>
<string name="3881">This bolt is crafted to bite deeply into its target, delivering additional piercing damage on impact.</string>

<string name="3884">Bolt of Fire</string>
<string name="3885">Giant&apos;s Bane</string>
<string name="3886">From the smallest of sources come weapons to strike at the largest of foes. These bullets are of halfling construction, and many a giant has fallen to them.</string>
<string name="3887">Bullet of Screaming</string>
<string name="3888">Many items of this type trace back to Jergain Hammerloud, a celebrated dwarven warrior once known for his bellowing battle cry. He was quite despondent after an injury cost him his voice, so clan priests crafted sling bullets that, as they said, would &quot;take his screams straight to the enemy.&quot; A symbolic gesture, but Jergain enjoyed them so much he used them until the day he happily fell on the battlefield.</string>
<string name="3889">Farel&apos;s Gold</string>
<string name="3890">Forced to use coins when he ran out of proper bullets during a long dungeon crawl, Farel Harod of Amn found, much to his surprise, that he rather preferred them to normal stones. He commissioned magic versions to improve their performance, and since then, similar items have popped up on a number of occasions.</string>
<string name="3891">Bullets of Smiting</string>
<string name="3892">These bullets are especially dense and weigh twice as much as ordinary specimens. When launched, they seem to accumulate even more mass on their way to the target, finally smashing into the unlucky victim with the force of a swung mace.</string>
<string name="3893">Fire Bullet</string>
<string name="3894">Fire Bullets burst into flames when fired, and inflict additional fire damage on their target.</string>
<string name="3895">Ice Bullet</string>

<string name="3897">Lightning Bullet</string>
<string name="3898">Lightning Bullets explode in sparks on impact, inflicting electrical damage to their target.</string>
<string name="3899">Battleaxe +1</string>
<string name="3900">A little-known section of ruined Illusk holds corpse after corpse from a barbarian invasion repelled ages ago. The clan is forgotten, but their surviving weapons seem to embody everything cruel and savage in warfare, and create fearful images in the minds of those who witness them.</string>
<string name="3901">Axe of Dead Illusk</string>
<string name="3902">These barbed and jagged blades have their origin in the personal armory of Mordan the Cold, 994-1021 DR, and each specimen is to be feared and respected. Even the slightest wound inflicted by one of these scourges requires quick attention or the victim will bleed to death. It is said that Mordan&apos;s soldiers moved through a battlefield striking only once, and whole legions fell in their wake.</string>
<string name="3903">Mordan&apos;s Withering Blade</string>
<string name="3904">The dwarven faithful of mighty Clangeddin have long fought with their god&apos;s might on their side. When his followers began to appear in greater numbers on the surface, wise Clangeddin created a few of these axes to give his champions power over the skies and clouds of their new land. A dwarf who comes into possession of one of these special boons is blessed indeed, for they are truly few in number.</string>
<string name="3905">Clangeddin&apos;s Wayward Axe</string>
<string name="3906">Torgin of the Light was a respected and prolific slayer of undead, which made his eventual descent into vampirism all the more tragic. His still-living companions saw the change as an insult to the life he once cherished, and vowed to destroy his undead form. To this end they crafted the Deepstone Progeny, adapted from the weapon that had previously served Torgin so well. History does not record the outcome of the battle between Torgin and his friends, but their axes are found across Faerun.</string>
<string name="3907">Deepstone Progeny</string>
<string name="3908">Gulen Rockfire was a respected and prolific slayer of undead, which made his eventual descent into vampirism all the more tragic to his cohorts. They saw the change as an insult to the life he once cherished, and vowed to destroy his undead form. To this end they crafted the Azure Progeny, a series of weapons adapting the design that had previously served Gulen so well. History does not recall the outcome of their battle.</string>
<string name="3909">&lt;Delete&gt;Azure Progeny</string>
<string name="3910">This weapon bears the mark of the dwarf Marrok, Master Blacksmith of Neverwinter&apos;s Shining Knight Arms and Armor. He forged it early in 1373 DR, to aid the heroes who sought to free his quarantined city from the virulent grasp of the so-called Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="3911">Sentinel +1</string>
<string name="3912">This weapon bears the mark of the dwarf Barun, a Master Blacksmith who worked from a makeshift forge in the Uthgardt village of Beorunna&apos;s Well. He forged it late in 1373 DR, to aid the war effort against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer, who was then marching against the northern city of Neverwinter and the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>

<string name="3915">Battleaxe +3</string>
<string name="3916">Greataxe +1</string>
<string name="3917">Weapons such as these not only protect against magical attack, they also improve the wielder&apos;s ability to research new spells and make him more aware of threats. Long research has traced their origin to the extinct Netherese civilization, but of their creator nothing is known.</string>
<string name="3918">Netherese Axe</string>
<string name="3919">So many tales surround these axes that it is difficult to determine which are true. They have been linked to kings, celestials, dark gods, and obnoxious dwarves, but in all cases they were used to destroy some meddlesome wizard or another. Scholars suggest that the weapons were created by a single person; someone wishing either the destruction of all spellcasters, or simply the troublesome ones.</string>
<string name="3920">Axe of the Culling</string>
<string name="3921">When Mulhorand&apos;s rebellious wizards opened Faerun to the invasion known as the Orcgate Wars, the avatars of the deities descended from the heavens to do battle. The avatar Re was slain in battle but used his dying breath to create hundreds of these greataxes. Known as Re&apos;s Redemption, each of them was dedicated to the slaying of orcs, and only with their help was the great horde forced northward.</string>
<string name="3922">Re&apos;s Redemption</string>
<string name="3923">Orcs tell of a great hero who wore no armor, and how the god Gruumsh gifted him with an axe to protect him in battle. He eventually became the avatar of that fearsome deity, and broke his weapon into many pieces to seed it among the orc hordes. Other cultures don&apos;t recognize the tale, but orcs don&apos;t care. After all, their legends also say that all the other races are born of swine, and what are the opinions of pigs worth?</string>
<string name="3924">Gruumsh Hand</string>
<string name="3925">This weapon bears the mark of the dwarf Marrok, Master Blacksmith of Neverwinter&apos;s Shining Knight Arms and Armor. He forged it early in 1373 DR, to aid the heroes who sought to free his quarantined city from the virulent grasp of the so-called Wailing Death.</string>

<string name="3930">Greataxe +3</string>
<string name="3931">This magic weapon has an enhancement bonus to attack and damage, but it doesn&apos;t bear the hallmarks of any specific maker.

</string>
<string name="3932">Handaxe +1</string>
<string name="3933">This came from Ember&apos;s Corps, a company of adventurers in service to a dwarven paladin. Each member held a weapon nearly identical to Ember&apos;s as a reminder to act as he would in any situation, keeping virtue in mind. Demons and fell creatures constantly drew his wrath, but pompous wizardry would not go unpunished either. Mages who over-planned would be threatened with Whirling Axe of Death, a &quot;spell&quot; that took very little time to prepare.</string>
<string name="3934">Ember&apos;s Axe</string>
<string name="3935">Craftsmen are constantly looking for more efficient ways to approach logging, but due to terrain and budget the hands-on approach still gives the best results. To that end, these items were developed to make the individual lumberjack more effective, but some have gone on to see secondary service as weapons of war. A magic &quot;sweet spot&quot; can potentially fell a tree in one swing, and make short work of an opponent as well.</string>
<string name="3936">Woodcutter&apos;s Axe</string>
<string name="3937">It was the Year of Slaughter, 1090 DR, and countless victims lay slain at the Battle of the Bones. Today the site contains layers of dry white bone, but at the time it was all blood and bile, oozing from each shattered corpse and saturating the fallen equipment. No amount of polishing has been able to restore any weapon retrieved from that dread place, or even begin to remove the taint acquired there.</string>
<string name="3938">Blood Rust Axe</string>
<string name="3939">Axes of this type were created as training tools for an organization of rangers and woodsmen, but their use has fallen out of favor. When combined with another weapon they grant agility and skill in the use of both at once, but it was found that some students relied too much upon them, and did not separately develop the skills that the items enhance.</string>

<string name="3944">Handaxe +3</string>
<string name="3945">Club +1</string>
<string name="3946">This was one of many such weapons distributed among a short-lived private militia in Waterdeep called the Watchmen&apos;s Club. No expense was spared for their equipment because the primary backers were a group of adventurous nobles who fancied that they were &quot;taking the night back from hoodlums and roustabouts.&quot; The movement folded when the pursuit fell out of fashion.</string>
<string name="3947">Watchman&apos;s Club</string>
<string name="3948">Strangely, the well-worn grip of this weapon is a furniture pattern from around 1200 DR, the club itself being a leg from the central table in a 500-seat festhall. The hall was the heart of a warrior clan, and the site of their last stand during the Year of the Black Horde. In the face of overwhelming orc hordes they fought with whatever means they could, but were ultimately lost to a man.</string>
<string name="3949">Will of the Lost</string>
<string name="3950">Encroachment on elven territory is not tolerated, though an exception is occasionally made for those who show proper reverence. Such is the case in the forest of Tethir, where a sect of druids have been welcomed and, on occasion, given special boons for their tireless work. While usually information, such a gift might also include an elven-crafted item like this one.</string>
<string name="3951">Tethir-Wood Cudgel</string>
<string name="3952">In the early days of exploration within the jungles of Chult, a Calimshan expedition clashed with a small tribe after removing artifacts from a burial site. A local shaman named Gol&apos;Kai killed a noble while trying to retrieve the sacred items, and the &quot;civilized&quot; invaders retaliated. The tribe did not survive. Weapons such as this were found in nearby villages soon after, accompanied by a silent apparition of Gol&apos;Kai, voiceless as his people.</string>

<string name="3960">Heavy Flail +1</string>
<string name="3961">Jergal was a depraved man who hated life and everything it entailed. Assembling a small army of like-minded mercenaries, he planned to sweep across Faerun with weaponry that inflicted diseases and curses upon their victims. Though the campaign started well, it ended quickly when one of the men caught Jergal&apos;s foul disease. Within days, Jergal and the others were dead.</string>
<string name="3962">Flail of Jergal</string>
<string name="3963">Even more frightening than this weapon&apos;s power in battle are the tales told by survivors of its attack. Witnesses claim that on impact an asp was seen to snake from the flail and add its venomous fangs to the weapon&apos;s strike. </string>
<string name="3964">Asp Flail</string>
<string name="3965">A disciple of Alaundo supposedly crafted these exquisite flails, and bards and sages agree that his intention was to craft a weapon for every star in every constellation. Whether he succeeded or not is still undecided.</string>
<string name="3966">Flail of Stars</string>
<string name="3967">A performer with the Circus of the Rose, Kintharsta offered a challenge to any member of the audience: to trade blows, their weapon versus his, until he or they conceded. He offered good odds and had many takers, but few could have hoped to win, thanks to the magic of his flail. He was paranoid of being caught without it, and had several copies crafted. Ironically, he was caught with the ringmaster&apos;s wife in the one situation he went unarmed, and was murdered with his flail just out of reach.</string>

<string name="3976">Created by Bertrand the Helper, these weapons saw use in many regal courts throughout the turn of the last century, though there is little in the way of documentation. They are the tools of the trusted deputy or valued assistant; the person who wields power behind the scenes. Neither the adviser nor the advised generally wish such a relationship known, so these items are usually kept a jealous secret.</string>
<string name="3977">Writ of the Vizier</string>
<string name="3978">Items from the Old Empires are difficult to catalog, because they deal with events unknown to much of Faerun. For example, these flails may date from the Orcgate Wars and the killing of the deity Osiris. At the moment of the god&apos;s death his avatar fell also, shattering his weapon. When Osiris was resurrected, each piece of that broken flail supposedly became a diluted duplicate of the original, though none of this can be proven. </string>
<string name="3979">Heirs of Osiris</string>
<string name="3980">If J&apos;elnyio of the Anvil had created just a few of these powerful weapons he might have enjoyed a natural death. Instead he produced as many as he could, hoping to shift the balance against evil in the world. The problem, of course, is that his efforts eventually drew attention from the very evil the flails were designed to fight, and balance was restored.</string>
<string name="3981">Flail of Destruction</string>
<string name="3982">Eberond, a late commander for the Zhentarim, formed an elite mercenary band of spellcasting warriors to pillage the ruins of Myth Drannor. To protect his men from hostile magic, he outfitted them with these spell-resisting flails. Despite the gifts and payment, the men had no intention of entering Myth Drannor, and instead traveled to Calimshan to retire off of the sale of their weapons.</string>

<string name="3989">Though his clan tried to dissuade him, the young dwarf Felirik refused to accept that he wouldn&apos;t make an exceptional rogue - despite the fact that he couldn&apos;t pick a lock to save his life. To combat his inadequacies, Felirik commissioned several Hammers of Blasting. What they lacked in subtlety, they more than made up for in effectiveness, annihilating the locks of chests and doors alike.</string>
<string name="3990">Hammer of Blasting</string>
<string name="3991">Runes identify this fine weapon as having been forged by the dwarven Daraz clan some 500 years ago. Hammers of this type were created for the defense of their homes against encroaching goblins and orcs, and each was wound with mighty spells. Unfortunately, fine weapons and dwarven courage were no match for the sheer number of orc invaders. The clan was extinguished, and their weapons were scattered throughout the known world.</string>
<string name="3992">Daraz Hammer</string>
<string name="3993">Legends abound of the Beast Lords and their insatiable bloodlust, each claiming that the creatures regularly rampage across the face of Faerun. These hammers were supposedly created in battle against such beasts, but specifics are unknown. Usually tales like these can be blamed on an imaginative bard with a gullible audience, but the story has stuck in lieu of facts.</string>
<string name="3994">Hammer of the Beast</string>
<string name="3995">A legacy that Thalantyr the Conjurer has said he would prefer to forget, these weapons are tied to his early adventuring career and a time when he was held captive by a mysterious, powerful creature. He has refused to say how the weapons have retained the heat of the forge they were crafted in, usually ending such inquiries with a frustrated &quot;pray you never find out.&quot;</string>

<string name="4001">Warhammer +1</string>
<string name="4002">A clan of svirfneblin deep within the Underdark created the Hammers of the Wisp to guard against vicious drow hunting parties. They hoped to model an item that could erupt with light, slowing or repelling their enemy. They were initially successful, and a dark elf group broke ranks the first time the weapons were used. No record of the deep gnome clan exists after that, however, and it is unlikely they survived the drow reprisal.</string>
<string name="4003">Hammer of the Wisp</string>
<string name="4004">The dwarven smith Silverblade forged the first of these hammers - purportedly combining a masterfully crafted warhammer with a Girdle of Giant Strength and Gauntlets of Ogre Power - as a gift for his military-bound son. Sadly, the son fell before the hammer&apos;s completion and, in grief, Silverblade took it up himself, dying in valiant battle. Recently, the dwarf Barun reassembled the device, leading to the creation of additional variants by other master smiths.</string>
<string name="4005">Hammer of Thunderbolts</string>
<string name="4006">During the Time of Troubles the walls between dimensions seemed particularly thin, and many creatures normally confined to other planes walked the face of Toril. Unfamiliar items appeared as well, including several of these weapons found after portals or rifts were sighted. The true origins of the Rift Hammers have never been explained, and superstitious folk refuse even to hold them for fear they retain the taint of the lower planes.</string>
<string name="4007">Rift Hammer</string>
<string name="4008">The zealous but good-hearted warrior known only as &quot;The Law&quot; gained fame when he created this set of magic weapons to arm the forces of law and discipline. Each was fueled by his burning desire to eradicate chaotic behavior and, as such, they became powerful tools in the maintenance of order.</string>

<string name="4015">A boon to the devout, this mace and others like it exude the grace and power of the Lady of Love, Sune. A service of great importance is usually required to warrant such a gift, as the creation of powerful items is costly to any faith.</string>
<string name="4016">Kiss of Sune</string>
<string name="4017">No one knows for certain where these maces originate. Perhaps they come from the outer planes to help the righteous of Faerun defend their home, or perhaps their arrival here is simply an accident. Regardless of their origin, they are unusually effective against creatures from other planes of existence.</string>
<string name="4018">Planar Mace</string>
<string name="4019">A set of these weapons was originally created for the Sword Coast Legion, a league of clerics and paladins who fought the orc multitudes in the Year of the Black Horde, 1235 DR.</string>
<string name="4020">Fist of the Legion</string>
<string name="4021">The most recent recorded appearance of one of these weapons was in the black markets of Amn, rightfully commanding an impressive price. Several such maces have been found over time, each with an array of elemental spells and effects woven through them. The creator remains elusive, though the name &quot;Petty&quot; is evident on each example. It is possible he is a smith on Toril, but his obvious understanding of planar forces suggests a more traveled origin.</string>
<string name="4022">Petty&apos;s Tempest</string>
<string name="4023">It is said that lieutenants in the armies of Algarond were given these weapons, but not told of the flaws in their design. Many of the wielders died, but all fought valiantly and were accorded the honor of heroes of the realm. The generals responsible for these flawed weapons escaped punishment, and today they are remembered among the revered dead.</string>

<string name="4030">These are the hallmark weapons of the fallen Lord Craghand of Unther, and are named for the fate he suffered. Lacking magical talent himself, Craghand employed a cadre of necromancers in an effort to extend his meager legacy. These wizards succeeded only in damning his court to an age of undeath. Now his mindless form stalks Faerun, his ageless skeletal body rising time and again even if destroyed.</string>
<string name="4031">Bone Phoenix</string>
<string name="4032">These weapons were supposed to be a great breakthrough for the orcs of Amn. Clan leaders liked the idea of rendering enemies helpless, but after the efforts of many shamans and several imprisoned human wizards, the project was abandoned. It seemed that in the hands of the orc elite, a hit strong enough to activate the ability often killed the target anyway, and the extra cost was deemed redundant.</string>
<string name="4033">Sleepwalker Kin</string>
<string name="4034">Circling Star morningstars are the creation of Lord Welther Huntsman, a retiring ranger who worried for the safety of his patrolled forests. Having amassed a small fortune in his career, he paid an artificer in Waterdeep to fashion these weapons and gifted them to carefully chosen successors, ensuring a continued reverence for the land.</string>
<string name="4035">Circling Star</string>
<string name="4036">These weapons were first used by Whyte&apos;s Legion, a fighting company so disciplined that when they marched, their synchronized front line appeared to be a single entity. When these tight formations met an enemy line, they would seem to fall back, deliberately exposing themselves to attack and naturally drawing the enemy inward. The illusion of enemy progress was shattered when a score of morningstars struck at once, beating them down as the legion closed around them.</string>

<string name="4043">Taralash was a skilled hunter renowned for his ability to track down even the fleetest of quarry by foot; few animals ever escaped once he had them in the sights of one of his mighty longbows. On his deathbed, when asked of his amazing hunting accomplishments, Taralash replied with honesty that &quot;any man can bend a blade with his hands, but a thinking man uses the forge; these longbows are that forge.&quot;</string>
<string name="4044">Taralash</string>
<string name="4045">This yew bow is more a work of art than a weapon of war. Fine engravings dance over the polished wood, and the bowstring gleams of gold, almost singing when drawn. Once thought a unique and singular example of elven craftsmanship, this theory was discarded when scholars verified half a dozen identical bows in the ruins of Myth Drannor.</string>

<string name="4047">This longbow was one of many made by a half-elven craftsman whose name has been lost to history. At one time there were several hundred in use by scouts who patrolled the Anauroch desert, but many have been lost or destroyed. Only a few are still known to exist, and these are highly prized and rarely find their way to the open market.</string>
<string name="4048">Ripper</string>
<string name="4049">The Pirate Isles of Nelanther are mere whimsy to most common people, and have spawned many a legend. One such tale tells of weapons able to launch arrows between the isles, a likely reference to the Longarm Bows of the region. </string>
<string name="4050">Longarm</string>
<string name="4051">These bows seem primitive at first glance, but behind the crude sinew and hide is a powerful weapon. They are most often found in the far North, but unfortunately, they are also most often found in the hands of a devotee of Auril, the Icemaiden. Most observers will get a good look at the point of the arrows before ever seeing the bow.</string>
<string name="4052">North Wind Bow</string>
<string name="4053">Longbow +2</string>
<string name="4054">Longbow +3</string>
<string name="4055">Shortbow +1</string>
<string name="4056">This bow and its kin are most famously linked to Hannable the White and his defense of Gulthmere Forest. He and his men went to the aid of local dryads and defeated legions of orcs, forcing them to abandon their destructive plans. Those of Hannable&apos;s force who left the forest were paid with these bows, while those who remained with the grateful dryads received less tangible, but no less enjoyable, rewards.</string>
<string name="4057">Eaglebow</string>
<string name="4058">A small village of halflings found itself the target of an evil knight&apos;s greed for their gold. The crafty halflings crafted a series of bows that were able to create illusions, making it appear as if an entire army defended the village. Sadly, the observant knight eventually realized the ruse, and the halflings were driven away from their treasure.</string>
<string name="4059">Phantom Bow</string>
<string name="4060">In 1099 DR, scholars attempting to verify tales of Tansheron the lich found only his ramshackle keep and withered husk. Evidence suggested a long siege by at least four distinct groups of adventurers, a campaign that eventually wore down his defenses. Presumably weapons of this type were among the loot claimed. The thin, frayed string of this bow appears unusable, but when it is drawn a solid, invisible arrow becomes tangible.</string>
<string name="4061">Tansheron&apos;s Bow</string>
<string name="4062">This bow is one of several attempts to recreate the wondrous elven Oathbow, which stopped the rampage of Kaoltooth the Aged during the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR. Made by human hand and not as powerful as the original, a Lesser Oathbow is still a very effective weapon.</string>
<string name="4063">Lesser Oathbow</string>
<string name="4064">This finely crafted bow has the notes of a soft lilting song carved at the grip. The earliest example of the type was found in 884 DR, but the maker was never identified. All are nearly identical except for the melodies, which were, until recently, invariably elven.</string>
<string name="4065">Lilting Note</string>
<string name="4066">Shortbow +2</string>
<string name="4067">Shortbow +3</string>
<string name="4068">Sling +1</string>
<string name="4069">Sling of Seeking</string>
<string name="4070">The gnomes who invented this device weren&apos;t known for courage, but their tale was heroic just the same. Defending their home against bugbear invaders, the gnomes hurriedly invented a set of slings so accurate they could be fired behind the wielder&apos;s back. So prepared, the gnomes taunted their attackers into a chase, and rained stones on them over their shoulders. Though many bugbears were killed, the gnomes were eventually caught and the village destroyed.</string>
<string name="4071">Sling of Arvoreen</string>
<string name="4072">Thought at first to have been blessed by the halfling god Arvoreen and granted to the heroic Tuckerby Lettleworp after the Battle of Moor Road, there have actually been a number of these items found. In fact, much like the tales of Littleman, it would seem that nearly every halfling village has a similar story about the acquisition of such an item. What this means regarding their true origins is unknown.</string>
<string name="4073">Sunlight Sling</string>
<string name="4074">These slings are the legacy of Endermin and his family, though they did not know their true importance. Endermin and his men had little hope of survival as they descended into ancient crypts to find his vampire-kidnapped fianc&#1081;e. Valiantly confronting the creature, their humble weapons suddenly erupted in a shower of light, bristling with magic the men had not known was there. The vampire fled, and the fianc&#1081;e was, thankfully, recovered.</string>
<string name="4075">Sling of Force</string>
<string name="4076">A tinker without a sense of proportion, the spunky Gendlesen Barstow worried that she wasn&apos;t strong enough for the adventuring life, and so built various magical slings to enhance her strength. Although her first versions were successful, all were stolen from her workbench and eventually scattered across Faerun.</string>
<string name="4077">Charming Sling</string>
<string name="4078">Servan and his sons made their living by removing &quot;pests&quot; from Waterdeep estates, be they badgers or bandits. Servan knew the value of appearances and went to great expense to spare his customers the harsh reality of death in or around their property. To be fair, his tales of peacefully luring creatures from their hiding places were mostly true. He simply neglected to mention the sling bullet that followed soon after.</string>
<string name="4079">Tempertuppin&apos;s Ever-Thrower</string>
<string name="4080">Bindle &quot;Eye-nock&quot; Tempertuppin based these weapons on one he supposedly saw a fire giant use, reportedly &quot;big enough to throw a donkey 300 paces.&quot; Questioning the accuracy of this account brings the predictable retort that &quot;you&apos;ll be sorry when a giant puts YOUR ass in a sling.&quot; He&apos;s a funny man, that Bindle.</string>
<string name="4081">Sling +2</string>
<string name="4082">Sling +3</string>
<string name="4083">Heavy Crossbow +1</string>
<string name="4084">These weapons were favored for siege work by the forces of King Shastir Longeve, and saw use in the removal of defensive forces taking cover behind battlements. As the king&apos;s fortunes waned so did the supply of these crossbows, and today only a scant few remain.</string>
<string name="4085">Crossbow of Accuracy</string>
<string name="4086">The enchantress Lady Gracia was fascinated by the legend of a celestial creature that fired love into a person&apos;s heart with magical bolts. Attempting to recreate the story she fashioned several launchers to duplicate this effect, but a bolt that would confer the spell proved difficult, and test couples lost their fascination for each other within hours or days. Regardless, Lady Gracia enjoyed the effort, and kept on playing matchmaker until her dying days.</string>
<string name="4087">Crossbow of Enchantment</string>
<string name="4088">As their name implies, Feywarden Crossbows were created for the sole task of defending the wild forests of Faerun. Legend has it that at the dawn of creation, a druid was assigned to each of the forests of the world and these were the weapons they held. Sentiment aside, it should be noted that the &quot;dawn of creation&quot; was an awfully long time ago, and these items bear design principles developed somewhat more recently.</string>
<string name="4089">Feywarden Crossbow</string>
<string name="4090">Grace was a serving maid in the household of Thomas, a Cormyrian noble. It was her misfortune to fall in love with her master, who took advantage of her and then cast her aside, ordering her from the house. Enraged, Grace shot him through the heart with a crossbow, for which crime she hanged. When the bow was later examined, it exhibited surprising properties and was eventually duplicated.</string>
<string name="4091">Graceblood Bow</string>
<string name="4092">These crossbows were used by the leaders of the Glorious Revolution, a popular uprising against the tyrannical Duke Bogob in the year 1217 DR. The oppressed workers in the fields rose up when they heard the rallying cry: &quot;You have nothing to lose but your chains!&quot; Unfortunately, the duke&apos;s well-armed knights were not fazed by idealism and oratory, and the rebellious peasants lost not only their chains, but their lives.</string>
<string name="4093">Glorious Revolution</string>
<string name="4094">Heavy Crossbow +2</string>
<string name="4095">Heavy Crossbow +3</string>
<string name="4096">Light Crossbow +1</string>
<string name="4097">Crossbows of this type draw their power directly from the wielder, a liability that can prove deadly. Guil de Lyons used the original for years, before falling to a bandit who was clever enough to engage Guil in melee. His captured weapon has apparently been studied and duplicated, as more examples have appeared since his defeat.</string>
<string name="4098">Crossbow of Affliction</string>
<string name="4099">Though the current owners of these weapons might like to believe they were handed down from Mielikki herself, Crossbows of the High Forest were actually created by a powerful group of rangers called the Underwood Company. It would be easy to assume divine involvement, however, due to the substantial magic present within each item.</string>
<string name="4100">Crossbow of the High Forest</string>
<string name="4101">The first example of this bejeweled item was created for ceremonial d&#1081;cor, and was never intended to see use. Experiments showed, however, that the weapon instilled great fear in its targets by releasing energy from the strange ruby used in its construction. The crossbow and the assistant who supplied the gem both disappeared soon after, and the weapon has been replicated many times since.</string>
<string name="4102">Ruby Crossbow</string>
<string name="4103">The townsfolk of New Mardale created these weapons when an evil enchanter threatened their home. According to legend, the caster who infused them with magic was inspired when she sighted a unicorn at the edge of town, and sought to embody the creature&apos;s spirit in a weapon of purity and defense.</string>
<string name="4104">Crossbow of the Unicorn</string>
<string name="4105">Menacing bows like this were once the property of the Dying Light, an order of assassins known for their stealth, subtlety, and lethal precision. So feared were they, it was said that their victims were, for all practical purposes, dead from the moment the Dying Light accepted the contract to end their lives. Though these bows remain, the Dying Light is but a memory, its membership having succumbed to Time, the ultimate assassin.</string>
<string name="4106">Crossbow of Murder</string>
<string name="4107">Light Crossbow +2</string>
<string name="4108">Light Crossbow +3</string>
<string name="4109">Double Axe +1</string>
<string name="4110">Beast worshippers from the isles west of Chult, the Red Tigers have proven very adaptive to outside interference, remaining active while other isolated peoples have disappeared. It is a talent that has served them well, and even the design of their weaponry seems cross-cultural. While mindful of their origins, they have incorporated, among others, both elven and dwarven ritual references, a combination neither group has cared to attempt on their own.</string>
<string name="4111">&lt;Delete&gt;Red Tiger Double Axe</string>
<string name="4112">Beast worshippers from the isles west of Chult, the Red Tigers have proven very resilient to outside pressure, remaining active while other isolated peoples have disappeared. It is a talent that has served them well, and even the design of their weaponry seems cross-cultural. While mindful of their origins, they have incorporated, among others, both elven and dwarven ritual references, a combination neither group has cared to attempt on their own.</string>
<string name="4113">Red Tiger Double Axe</string>
<string name="4114">Fear is the primary tool of oppression, and Ch&apos;ole of the Old Bones, a minor despot originally from Thay, took full advantage. He managed, for a time, to rule a small kingdom by threat alone, masquerading as a Lich by using illusion and magic weapons to instill the natural dread people feel toward the undead. His short reign ended when he drew the attention of a creature more familiar with the role.</string>
<string name="4115">Death Shroud Axe</string>
<string name="4116">To the displaced victims of an emerging bandit king staking a claim near The Shaar, the Ascorian Double Axe is a symbol of what a simple homegrown despot can accomplish with only a few dozen chests of ancestral pirate gold, a newly-hired personal army of mercenaries, and several puppeteer spellcasters schooled in the Shadow Weave. And they say one man can&apos;t make a difference any more.</string>
<string name="4117">Ascorian Double Axe</string>
<string name="4118">Equipped at great expense, the Bloodstone mercenaries were a company desperate to prove their worth, but fate placed them outside what should have been the defining moment of their careers. In 1090 DR they were supposed to play a part in the Battle of the Bones, but their enhanced staying power would go untapped. Their ship was swamped en route from Tethyr; they never made it to port, and the company remains a historical footnote.</string>

<string name="4123">Double Axe +3</string>
<string name="4124">Dire Mace +1</string>
<string name="4125">This mace is permanently bloodstained, a telltale trace of its many years spent bashing heads. The weapon would have been the bane of humanoids throughout its history, but those who wielded it seem to have been purposely left out of historic record.</string>
<string name="4126">Krotan&apos;s Skullcrusher</string>
<string name="4127">Ardulia the Agile was a man whose speed and skill at knife play made him exceptionally lethal in battle, and he repeatedly proved it by leading raids on settlements along the Sword Coast. He would often challenge the village leader for possession of the town, and with his speed, the duels were always quickly decided in his favor. Ardulia met his match one spring morn however, when he battled the priest Itgan, who wielded this mace. Ardulia seemed to stagger under each blow, slowing his pace to recoup and regain his breath. Without his speed, Ardulia was lost, and fell to the measured attacks of Itgan.</string>
<string name="4128">Ardulia&apos;s Fall</string>
<string name="4129">The Stoutcorps mercenary company of Rashemen has a faction that specializes in siege work, though terrain problems in the past have caused them to forego traditional castle-breaching equipment. They prefer muscle power over gadgetry, and boast that three of their finest equipped with these &quot;keys&quot; can breach a wall in moments, though it is by no means a subtle affair. </string>
<string name="4130">Stoutcorps Key</string>
<string name="4131">Coarse tracings of the orc gods mark these weapons as indelicate, to say the least. They are deeply ridged, viciously effective, and all too common at the forefront of an orc horde. The inclusion of some &quot;blunt magic&quot; makes them debilitating as well as damaging, and a deep muscle bruise from a solid hit can take a fighter to his knees in short measure.</string>
<string name="4132">Ebon Dire Mace</string>
<string name="4133">Ironwood Mace +1</string>
<string name="4134">Ironwood Mace +3</string>
<string name="4135">Dire Mace +2</string>
<string name="4136">Dire Mace +3</string>
<string name="4137">Quarterstaff +1</string>
<string name="4138">From the Lhespenbog reed-fields of east Shaar come Aiedo Wither-Sticks, the craft of Meng Aiedo. Though accustomed to working with tall grass bamboo, this eastern craftsman traveled across the inner plains plying his trade with whatever local materials were available. Swamp products tend to be darker in nature than his usual fare, however.</string>
<string name="4139">Aiedo Wither-Stick</string>
<string name="4140">A number of these staffs were recently discovered, apparently meant to be the chief arms of a force being assembled by a beholder secreted away beneath the city of Athkatla. Why an eye tyrant would wish to attack the sight of its enemy so specifically is not known, and petitions to the local government have gone unanswered, save for claiming it a matter for local churches to explain. </string>
<string name="4141">Negastaff</string>
<string name="4142">These items are said to manifest during times of great trouble, though the entity responsible varies depending on whose followers you question. Many have begun to think the staffs a gift of the combined gods of good alignment, deities that know their faithful must struggle, and that there is always a need for a healing hand.</string>
<string name="4143">Staff of Curing</string>
<string name="4144">These staffs all come from the workshop of Shago-Kahbo, a hermit who claims to have wandered the Anauroch desert for years at a time. He tells stories about &quot;the coming of the dust,&quot; possibly referring to the fall of Netheril, but he is otherwise nonsensical. Trying to find meaning in his tales would be no less difficult than finding the supposed plane-shifting Blackforest he so often babbles about.</string>
<string name="4145">Blackforest Staff</string>
<string name="4146">Grand Druid is the highest rank within the druidic hierarchy, a position that deals with global concerns instead of day-to-day troubles in the forest. When called to act directly, a Grand Druid has the option to hold a Staff of Ascension that is tailored to his need. When they leave their position the weapon is released into the world, so that it might benefit nature in the hands of others.</string>

<string name="4149">Quarterstaff +3</string>
<string name="4150">Two-Bladed Sword +1</string>
<string name="4151">These weapons belonged to the Lyons, a family that ruled in the early days of exploration around the Inner Sea. Patriarch Vargus created a sword for each of his many children, commanding that whosoever killed the finest beast with their blade would be named his successor. Daas, the weakest of the lot, immediately cut off his father&apos;s head. He claimed, as his siblings closed around him, that it was &quot;a reasonable interpretation of the rules.&quot;</string>
<string name="4152">&lt;Delete&gt;Sword of Lyons</string>
<string name="4153">These weapons belonged to the Lyons, a family that ruled in the early days of exploration around the Inner Sea.

<string name="4154">Sword of Lyons</string>
<string name="4155">With armor designed to frighten and fighting styles calculated to dazzle, the Corps of the Red Masque were an oddity on any battlefield. Incorporating eastern intimidation tactics and obscure illusion spells, they were known to have turned the tide of several battles with their appearance alone. When last seen, the entire company and all their signature equipment were traveling to the city of Sigil, a planar journey from which they have not yet returned.</string>
<string name="4156">Blade of the Red Masque</string>
<string name="4157">These swords were designed for an elite group of guardians meant to stand forever over the tomb of their unnamed master in a display of utter loyalty. One of these stalwart fellows would later drunkenly admit that the core of the group left before dust had time to settle on the door. These weapons have indeed seen heroic use in their day, but not at the hands of their original owners.</string>
<string name="4158">Sword of Bao</string>
<string name="4159">Blades of this type bear the marks of elven craftsmen, though the elves as a people are more commonly associated with smaller, more elegant weapons. Certain sects among them worship Corellon Larethian as a god of war, however, and in reverence to him they let no weapon of combat go untrained. Even so, it would still be a rare occurrence for such a weapon to actually see use on an elven battlefield.</string>
<string name="4160">Blade of Corellon</string>
<string name="4161">Uthgardt Ceremonial Blade +1</string>
<string name="4162">Uthgardt Ceremonial Blade +2</string>

<string name="4164">Two-Bladed Sword +3</string>
<string name="4165">With the power to restore life itself, these rods are prized indeed! It is not known if this particular example was created to aid in the good works of a saint or prolong the ills of an overlord, for such rods serve indiscriminately.</string>
<string name="4166">Rod of Resurrection</string>
<string name="4167">These twisted rods emanate an aura of evil even while inactive, and fill all who gaze upon them with unease. They are capable of projecting a wave of unspeakable horror upon a single foe, filling even the hardiest soul with acute dread, and were certainly created for nefarious use.</string>
<string name="4168">Rod of Terror</string>
<string name="4169">These devices are pleasant enough to look at, crafted of solid oak and highlighted with a modest gem or two. More importantly, the rods are potent magic items, capable of calming even the angriest of souls. In the hands of one with a quick tongue, the rods are more than worth their weight in gold.</string>
<string name="4170">Rod of Beguiling</string>
<string name="4171">These powerful items allow a wielder to quickly dispel the magic of friend or foe alike. Those who hunt spellcasters particularly prize them, although casters themselves are also quick to snatch them up on the open market.</string>
<string name="4172">Rod of Reversal</string>
<string name="4173">These long, thin rods can make their wielder become ethereal, and thus harder to engage in combat.</string>
<string name="4174">Rod of the Ghost</string>
<string name="4175">Enchantments abound in the realms of magic, but some have trouble with the incantations. This staff allows the user to charm or even dominate another, eliminating the need to study the spells.</string>
<string name="4176">Staff of Command</string>
<string name="4177">This type of staff is the pinnacle of the artificer&apos;s craft, and each one represents the culmination of decades of study by a master spellcaster. With the secrets of their creation all but lost, more such staffs are found in the horde of ancient dragons than the hands of living wizards.</string>
<string name="4178">Staff of the Magi</string>
<string name="4179">Staffs of this kind provide much needed protection for arcane spellcasters. The level of defense varies with each example, but all are useful. Most bear no specific maker&apos;s mark, created for utility rather than notoriety.</string>
<string name="4180">Staff of Defense</string>
<string name="4181">Staffs of Power are immediately familiar to most spellcasters, and are almost icons of arcane study. The inherent utility of such staffs has resulted in many being crafted or commissioned, and specific histories are usually lost in the crowd.</string>
<string name="4182">Staff of Power</string>
<string name="4183">The faithful teach that a Staff of the Holy is the will of a deity made manifest. While this is debatable, these items do tend to find their way to the hands of the truly righteous, by accident or design. Still, the number of these staffs in circulation makes the miraculous origin theory somewhat unlikely.</string>
<string name="4184">Staff of the Holy</string>
<string name="4185">Wands of Fire draw upon a discipline of magic that has been studied and venerated for centuries, one whose practitioners are so varied that there can be no determining where the concept originated. It can be said, however, that most modern refinements in the design of such items occurred in Thay, where worship of the Firelord Kossuth is widespread.</string>
<string name="4186">Wand of Fire</string>
<string name="4187">It was once thought that creating a Wand of Fear required the arm of a lich, but today that is scoffed at as peasant lore. While most examples do contain fragments of bone, the sample need not come from such a powerful undead creature. Ordinary skeletons serve just as well, and object far less to the procedure.</string>
<string name="4188">Wand of Fear</string>
<string name="4189">It is a popular bit of lore that the first wizard to encapsulate magical projectiles within an object like this was apparently drawn and quartered, accused of releasing arcane power to the masses. Most wizards and sorcerers scoff at this, citing that if every creator of wands were killed today, magic would indeed be a VERY exclusive club.</string>
<string name="4190">Wand of Missiles</string>
<string name="4191">Those who create items of this type are not quick to let their names be known, as they are often accused of cruelty or treacherous behavior. As useful as Wands of Paralyzation are, they are forever linked to tales of strong warriors rendered helpless and forced to endure gods know what, and that never sits well with a tavern crowd.</string>
<string name="4192">Wand of Paralyzation</string>
<string name="4193">The design of the average Wand of Frost owes much to the once mighty legions under Auril the Frostmaiden and, to a lesser extent, some of the more obscure elemental lords. Few producing them today are among those faithful however, and, for the most part, base their work on the arcane rather than the divine.</string>
<string name="4194">Wand of Negative Energy</string>
<string name="4195">Wands of Lightning are highly unstable, at least in the early stages of their construction. Many an inexperienced caster has found his laboratory the site of a sudden squall or charged fog, having failed to speak the proper incantations in just the right manner. It is said that elder wizards have allowed tomes with faulty rituals to be circulated, hoping to indirectly teach some humility.</string>
<string name="4196">Wand of Lightning</string>
<string name="4197">The powers of a Wand of Summoning owes much to the ancient spells crafted by followers of forgotten beast totems, though the modern example can hardly be called a divinely-inspired tool. Sorcerers and wizards take inspiration from many places, and the resulting mix of incantations often bears little resemblance to their original form.</string>
<string name="4198">Wand of Summoning</string>
<string name="4199">Each Wand of the Heavens is a focus point and reservoir for divine power. According to sages, this power flows directly from the cosmos in a thematic rather than denominational fashion, and is thus available to all. Naturally, some say that this meandering description is no less confusing than the wishes of the individual gods themselves. </string>
<string name="4200">Wand of the Heavens</string>
<string name="4201">The magic contained within a Wand of Stinking Cloud is quite volatile, and these items are said to have caused more accidental adventuring deaths than any other arcane item. The foul vapors can unexpectedly overwhelm a party, but the potential danger rarely stops buyers from buying. Dungeon delving is not a calling for the overly cautious.</string>
<string name="4202">Wand of Stinking Cloud</string>
<string name="4203">Of all the items sold to adventurers and militias, Wands of Arcane Disjunction cause the most dissent and argument among wizards and sorcerers. While the market cannot be denied, some find it disturbing that spellcasters sell the very thing that may mean the death of one of their kind. Sellers don&apos;t mind the debate. Controversy means an increase in demand.</string>
<string name="4204">Wand of Arcane Disjunction</string>
<string name="4205">Halberd +1</string>
<string name="4206">The history of this weapon is obscure, though all examples of the type seem to originate in the great wastes of the Anauroch desert, where vast storms of wind and sand charge the air with energy. Perhaps the smith who created these polearms wished them to be as formidable as that Great Sand Sea itself.</string>
<string name="4207">Arc Asunder</string>
<string name="4208">These weapons bear the mark of Atar of the Flame, high shaman of a northern cult that fell under the influence of a creature from the plane of fire. What this entity received in exchange for creating such powerful items is unknown.</string>
<string name="4209">Will of Atar</string>
<string name="4210">&quot;...a flood from the creature&apos;s black heart, and we dipped the weapons of victory, sanctified as custom demanded. Blessed they were, by the beast and by fate, as power took hold in the steel that felled her.&quot; Thus reads a journal excerpt of Captain Jeremiah Vale penned in the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR. Strangely, the creature described does not match a commonly known draconic variant, nor does it explain why the weapons involved would be altered so dramatically by exposure to its blood.</string>
<string name="4211">Dragon&apos;s Breath</string>
<string name="4212">These formidable weapons shimmer slightly at the blade, but are quite solid if tested. Not many adventurers wish to test them thoroughly, however, as they were apparently designed specifically to combat elementals. The sect that created these halberds refer to themselves as &quot;Purists Against the Pure,&quot; claiming that nothing is more unnatural than the manifestation of a single natural element. They seek to destroy such &quot;unbalanced&quot; creatures, though their own weapons seem similarly uniform.</string>

<string name="4215">Ravager +4</string>
<string name="4216">Halberd +2</string>
<string name="4217">Halberd +3</string>
<string name="4218">Scythe +1</string>
<string name="4219">This weapon is a vicious implement of war formed from the gnarled branch of a great oak and a monstrous blade of rough-finished cold iron. This example and several others were among the unwanted remnants of battles with demonic creatures, probably those under Malimshar or Gaulguth in the Weeping War. Left in the purest of groves for years on end, nature has leeched the evil away, leaving the pure material of the weapons behind to be her vessel.</string>
<string name="4220">Nature&apos;s Scythe</string>
<string name="4221">Scythes of this sort are truly awesome instruments of indifferent murder, created by the fanatical followers of Iyachtu Xvim just before his transformation and the rebirth of Bane. The faithful of the New Darkness wanted to ensure that no creature was beyond the touch of his fury, and even the name shows disdain for the gods that hold true domain over murder and death, former mortals that the Godson claimed were unworthy.</string>
<string name="4222">Death&apos;s Handmaiden</string>
<string name="4223">This item was modeled on Baron Gordaire Knightshold&apos;s weapon, a ceremonial scythe meant to make him look more rural and less a tyrant. His fledgling kingdom east of the Inner Sea faltered when a revolutionary movement adopted the symbol in their efforts to overthrow him. Each lieutenant in their league was paired with one of these far-more-functional duplicates to rally people behind them. There is little remaining of Gordaire&apos;s legacy.</string>
<string name="4224">King&apos;s Scythe</string>
<string name="4225">On the eve of war in Hillsfar, 679 DR, a militia force desperate for arms appropriated the wares of several traveling merchants. One of the wagons seized held weapons bound for the enemy, a score of scythes that radiated evil. Clerics tried to erase the taint within and render them useful, but the result was far from perfect. They were left as a &quot;Wicked Union&quot; of fell and fair, with neither satisfied completely.</string>

<string name="4232">Scythe +3</string>
<string name="4233">Spear +1</string>
<string name="4234">These spears belonged to Guul Shatterneck and his bandit kin, a group quite used to making short work of targets with their magical weapons. Unfortunately they chose to attack their last &quot;victims&quot; without properly investigating them first, and captured members of the Gray Wolf Tribe tore them limb from limb at the next full moon.</string>
<string name="4235">&lt;Delete&gt;Black Kumade</string>
<string name="4236">This weapon was a gift from the elven nation to the kingdom of Algarond after the declaration of peace between the two peoples in 1065 DR. Spears of this type are carefully crafted, and rumored to come from the wood of Evereska itself.</string>
<string name="4237">Heartwood Spear</string>
<string name="4238">These spears belonged to Guul Shatterneck and his bandit kin, a group quite used to making short work of targets with their magic weapons.

<string name="4239">Black Kumade</string>
<string name="4240">The Year of the Awakening, 1001 DR, saw the reemergence of many ancient evils as treasure-hungry explorers unearthed ruins in several locations. One such breach freed Sek&apos;coTul, a lich imprisoned beneath the Forest of Mir. He left for some unknown hold, but his opened tomb quickly tainted trees in the area. Druids cleansed the area with fire, but some of the wood was taken by a local mage and made into these spears.</string>
<string name="4241">Spear of Withering</string>
<string name="4242">Briarspikes look like they could have been plucked from some giant quill-covered beast, but the methods involved are very sophisticated and bear the hallmarks of Menold of Waterdeep. This may shed some light on his fate, as he was reported lost to an orc raid on his tower years ago. He may have attempted to buy his freedom with his services, but it would have only made him more valuable as a prisoner.</string>

<string name="4247">Spear +3</string>
<string name="4248">Kama +1</string>
<string name="4249">Not everyone on the battlefield is eager for a fight. The devout of Aido Glade seek out conflicts solely to ply their healing skills, trying to ease the suffering of the fallen while avoiding harm themselves. A Thread of Life kama aids in their efforts while marking them as impartial to the cause of the skirmish. They do not judge, knowing that some wars are inevitable. They tend to those in need, regardless of circumstance.</string>
<string name="4250">Thread of Life</string>
<string name="4251">There are very few examples of &quot;known&quot; peasant weapons, as most were adapted from farm implements in the absence of &quot;real&quot; martial blades, and by their nature are nondescript. There are exceptions, however, and from the defense of Kyo prefecture comes Hideo&apos;s Kama, created to bolster a group of farmers against marauding pirates. The farms survived, though Hideo himself, the architect of the plan, fell out of favor having spent his fortune on the effort.</string>
<string name="4252">Hideo&apos;s Kama</string>
<string name="4253">Strange as it may seem, this item bears markings that identify it as the equivalent of a courtly dagger, though it is obviously adapted from a simple farming implement. The leader who sponsored the creation of this and similar weapons likely began life in the fields, which suggests a rise to power quite outside traditional bloodlines of royalty.</string>
<string name="4254">Peasant Dynasty</string>
<string name="4255">Weapons of this type may have come from a series of destroyed villages in southern Calimshan, though details of that destruction are hard to come by. There are suggestions that a pestilence infested the crops of a small barony during harvest, causing dementia in the citizens and turning them against each other. Whatever the reason, whole communities are thought to have erupted in chaos, leaving behind nothing but their bloodstained tools.</string>
<string name="4256">Empty Fields</string>
<string name="4257">A palpable aura around this item marks it as tainted, perhaps rightly so, for all that is known of the Imaskari civilization points to a depth of depravity unmatched in modern times. Of course, such condemnation has had many years to fester, and while a goodly number of Imaskari may have been involved in necromantic studies, it is likely that their vilification springs from later societies elevating themselves through the slandering of others.</string>

<string name="4259">Kama +2</string>
<string name="4260">Kama +3</string>
<string name="4261">Kukri +1</string>
<string name="4262">This variant of the kukri is thought to be associated with worshippers of Akadi, greater power of the elemental plane of air, but this is unverified. These weapons do exhibit abilities that seem appropriate for her domain, but they lack the markings her followers are known to use. Likely these blades are from her realm, but draw their magical energy from elsewhere.</string>
<string name="4263">Ladymist Talon</string>
<string name="4264">A regional variant of a very exotic blade, Neverwinter Kukri are made by special order of the Calimshan Businessman&apos;s Embassy, and are presented to those who best represent their cultural interests within the area. Occasionally they are found on the black market, but never cheaply.</string>
<string name="4265">Neverwinter Kukri</string>
<string name="4266">These blades are occasionally brought to civilization by adventurers, along with tales of ruined temples and the gods of old. Likely this weapon fell under the domain of a sun- or star-worshipping sect, and while possibly far-reaching in their day, no official record detailing their practices has survived.</string>
<string name="4267">Cutting Star</string>
<string name="4268">A quick-cutting blade, suited to those who prefer to strike fast and retreat rather than stand toe to toe with their enemies. The name suggests a history with the Shadow Thieves of Amn, though it is not documented as some of their other tools are. The organization has many sub-guilds however, and this may have come from one of them.</string>
<string name="4269">Sharpshadow Blade</string>
<string name="4270">These assassin&apos;s blades may have originated with a single cult, or perhaps were the signature weapons of a guild for a time, but whatever the case, the makers took their work very seriously.</string>
<string name="4271">Messenger Blade</string>
<string name="4272">Kukri +2</string>
<string name="4273">Kukri +3</string>
<string name="4274">Sickle +1</string>
<string name="4275">The product of a summoning gone awry, the Blightbringer was a demonic creature unleashed in the Chondalwood centuries ago. Slain at great cost, the spot where it fell remained tainted for years, twisting anything that took root there. These abominations were meticulously removed and destroyed by local druids, and while the area eventually did return to normal, the tools used to tend it were corrupted over time, resulting in the sickles now called Blightbringer Lineage.</string>
<string name="4276">Blightbringer Lineage</string>
<string name="4277">Normally sickles are associated with druidic pursuits, but these items are dark and sinister, and would hardly have belonged to a neutral man or woman of the wood. Blacksoul Sickles speak of nighttime ritual and evil intent, and that is probably why their creator remains anonymous.</string>
<string name="4278">Blacksoul Sickle</string>
<string name="4279">This sickle is a pure weapon, crafted by hands careful to let nothing despoil the process of creation. A number of these items were made in memory of fallen heroes, though no specific individual was named. They seem to honor a higher concept instead, and each weapon is a tribute to those who fell unremembered and gave their lives in good faith hoping their sacrifice would mean something.</string>
<string name="4280">Sickle of Holy Mourning</string>
<string name="4281">A design easily traceable to Teneraard Treekin, hunter turned blacksmith turned ranger. He spent years making tools for servants of nature, eventually taking them up himself, but he never truly felt accepted in the role. His efforts, while admirable, were born of memories of his father standing over a Cloakwood stag, a species that was eventually hunted to extinction.</string>

<string name="4289">Bastard Sword +1</string>
<string name="4290">Legend states that the warrior Alesia brought the Nameless Light from the stars, although other tales claim it was forged by a grieving father, or was the weapon of a virtuous paladin. In truth, several such blades exist. They were created with the blessing of the Harpers, and each has had many stories from any number of owners. Perhaps that is their true power: they compel people to craft heroes of their own.</string>
<string name="4291">Nameless Light</string>
<string name="4292">Forged in smoldering brimstone fires and cooled in the blood of its creator, a Bloodletter blade is a typically evil weapon, the kind of sword that has inspired more than a little diabolical laughter while being waved in the face of one or another virtuous knight. It is possessed of thoroughly heinous life-stealing energies, but if the fates of its previous owners are any indication, its major characteristic could well be the attraction of &quot;comeuppance.&quot;</string>
<string name="4293">Bloodletter</string>
<string name="4294">The bane of the chaotic or morally suspect, a Lawgiver blade has but one purpose: to enforce the rule of law wherever that authority is challenged or questioned. Whether or not the concept of &quot;law&quot; coincides with the concept of &quot;justice&quot; is largely irrelevant, as the owners of these weapons often view the world in a very polarized fashion. There is right and there is wrong, and other details only serve to confuse the matter.</string>
<string name="4295">Lawgiver</string>
<string name="4296">Everyone knows the story: a blade, a dragon, a titanic struggle, and a virtuous knight saving hundreds, nay, thousands of lives! Yes, everyone knows a version of this tale, but how? Could one sword have traveled the world so completely? Perhaps there have been many, perhaps only a few, but it is likely that weapons such as this have become so &quot;well known&quot; in legend that their true histories are forgotten.</string>
<string name="4297">Dragonslayer</string>
<string name="4298">A line of black crystal runs the length of this blade, marking it the handiwork of Ortius of Gond, the Mad Tinker. Blades from his stock resonate unnaturally when struck, and although mortal ears can barely perceive the tone, they certainly suffer the effects well enough. The origin of the crystal is not clear, though Ortius was known to have bartered his services to planar creatures on occasion.</string>

<string name="4302">Bastard Sword +3</string>
<string name="4303">Dagger +1</string>
<string name="4304">Courtesan assassins were famous for using their wit and charm to infiltrate the intimate chambers of the enemy by the most disarming method imaginable: they were invited. The practice became infamous, which is likely why it is used so infrequently today.</string>
<string name="4305">Courtesan Blade</string>
<string name="4306">Weapons of this type are technically impossible, since their blades are made of nothing but razor-sharp ice crystals. Most sages agree they are kept frozen by some sort of link to the inner planes, but this is ultimately just speculation. Ice Talon daggers show a jagged blade and may have been part of a single larger weapon at one time, though the force required to shatter the magic blade must have been enormous indeed.</string>
<string name="4307">Ice Talon</string>
<string name="4308">This weapon is thoroughly evil, a quality undiminished by the number of duplicates that have been found in the past. It pulses with a sickening energy, and its moist and yielding grip seems almost alive in the hand. All of this adds to the discomforting thought that it may have been grown, not forged. There is no indication what the source of these items might be.</string>
<string name="4309">Leech</string>
<string name="4310">Tagget Coldspring was a smith and tinker who specialized in automated guardians. He did a brisk business in the rich southern lands of Amn, earning the praise of nobles and government institutions for his low-maintenance fortifications. His masterpiece was a griffin-shaped golem with talons that held their edge no matter what they struck. It was eventually recycled, the individual blades sold to finance a new creation.</string>
<string name="4311">Tagget&apos;s Talon</string>
<string name="4312">Necromancers have very little tolerance for jokes at their expense, so the reaction of Lord Agorn Deathknell to a precariously perched bucket of chum above his laboratory door was entirely predictable, as was the death of the pixie responsible. The surprising part, especially to Argon, was the retaliation of dozens of outraged fey folk, who never suffer a poor sport. A number of their blades were recovered from Agorn&apos;s carcass.</string>

<string name="4317">All gemswords feature a prismatic blade that is fractured throughout, but still magically maintains its shape. Tales speak of a great crystal from which these weapons can be split, but the plane-traveling souls who relate these stories are often suffering from dementia, having lost their faculties while navigating dimensional barriers.</string>
<string name="4318">Gemsword</string>
<string name="4319">Like all greatswords from the Land of Berserkers, these weapons are massively built, and so durable that some have survived for thousands of years. These swords are notable for their effectiveness against spellcasters, and history records that the land&apos;s Witch rulers expelled all known copies out of fear of their abilities.</string>
<string name="4320">Blade of the Rashemi</string>
<string name="4321">The Church of Lathander is a wealthy institution, and makes no secret of its affinity for adventurers. In their eyes, these people dare to bring light to the forgotten and secret places, and therefore they will always find safe haven in a house of the Morninglord. On occasion the church will grant a boon to a particularly favorable person, a weapon that will serve to light the dark paths ahead.</string>
<string name="4322">Shining Light of Lathander</string>
<string name="4323">Forged by deep gnome craftsmen of the Underdark, blades of this sort were thought lost until a specimen was recently seen in the company of Finihan&apos;s Raiders, a group of casual adventurers. That sword, Vermin&apos;s Bane, traveled widely as a result, and was last reported as having been stolen in a caravan raid north of Luskan.</string>
<string name="4324">Vermin&apos;s Bane</string>
<string name="4325">This suit bears the mark of the dwarf Marrok, Master Blacksmith of Neverwinter&apos;s Shining Knight Arms and Armor. He forged it early in 1373 DR, to aid the heroes who sought to free his quarantined city from the virulent grasp of the so-called Wailing Death.

</string>
<string name="4326">Harbinger Kin +1</string>
<string name="4327">This suit bears the mark of the dwarf Barun, a Master Blacksmith who worked from a makeshift forge in the Uthgardt village of Beorunna&apos;s Well.

<string name="4335">Divine Fury</string>
<string name="4336">If memory serves correctly, these weapons date to the stadium battles of old Kai Chen province, where promising warriors would test their skills against the greatest samurai of the day in ritual combat. If ever a challenger was victorious, he or she won the people&apos;s ovation and fame forever, symbolized by a Kaga-To katana. The blade is etched with a simple phrase: &quot;Tell me how you fight, and I will tell you what you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="4337">Kaga-To </string>
<string name="4338">Once thought a unique instance of the swordmaker&apos;s craft, several katanas of this type have now been linked to a ship that ran aground on the Sword Coast some years ago. All bear the markings of Master Hu Li, a great artificer from the east, but little else is known of him. </string>
<string name="4339">Master Li&apos;s Way</string>
<string name="4340">Besieged by a powerful wu-jen, Lord Sunang of Kara-Tur was forced into some very expensive alliances. Weapons like these were plentiful, but not cheap, and the strain of equipping his army against an ever-strengthening foe eroded his influence. In the end, Sunang&apos;s lands fell to their own weakness, not the swords of his enemy. Merchants may have supplied both sides with these same arms to extend their profits, but three centuries have hidden the answers.</string>

<string name="4349">A Soulrazor Minion is a shadow of the original Soulrazor sword, duplicated with meticulous effort by Khol of Zhentil Keep.

<string name="4350">Soulrazor Minion</string>
<string name="4351">Blades of this type hail from the workshop of Raegik Hammerhold, a Rashemar smith who refused to reveal the secrets of his craft to any but his chosen apprentice. It is unknown how many Angurvadal blades may exist, but it is certain there are no more being produced. Raegik discovered his student dealing with the Red Wizards of Thay, and is believed to have died in the ensuing battle.</string>
<string name="4352">Angurvadal (Flame Tongue)</string>
<string name="4353">A legacy blade, this Blessing of the Daystar is one of several recovered from the Sons of Light, a group of knights who fought in the latter days of the Weeping War, 713 DR. Their leader, Scottie Torilson, was possessed of the one true Daystar, and through it they received the blessing of Torm in their last hour. They went to their deaths for a strategically unimportant elven village, because duty demanded nothing less.</string>
<string name="4354">Blessing of the Daystar</string>
<string name="4355">A series of these weapons were constructed for the defense of the library fortress of Candlekeep some 200 years ago. The keep had acquired a tome detailing the imprisonment of the pit fiend Aegatohl, and a score of malevolent creatures came to claim it. A small horde was held at bay by the Knights of the Mailed Fist, along with the unexpected assistance of Devon&apos;s Privateers, a group of pirates. The tome was later destroyed. </string>

<string name="4362">Black Rider Quills take their name from a celebrated epic repeated in any bardic college worth its salt. The subject of the tale is dark, encouraging one to &quot;dance around in your bones,&quot; but it is referenced here solely to stimulate the muse. These blades were likely forged in tribute, and were probably not present for the events of the original story. It is not known if they were commissioned together or individually.</string>

<string name="4364">Black Rider Quill</string>
<string name="4365">A series of runes claim these blades are designed for the &quot;quick eradication of evil, that they will suffer no longer as creatures at odds with all that is good.&quot; A sweeping proclamation, one that suggests the involvement of a radical group no longer giving second thought to deadly force where villains are concerned. Certainly an unpopular stance in some quarters, though probably welcomed in others.</string>
<string name="4366">Mercykiller Blade</string>
<string name="4367">In recent years, a number of thieves&apos; guilds reported losing members to these blades, the weapons left as gruesome signatures impaled in the victims&apos; chests. The craftsman behind them was unknown, but the intent of the group using them was clear enough: to destabilize existing groups to facilitate their own expansion. It has been some time since the last killing, however, suggesting that the incursion was either abandoned or succeeded through less violent means. Members of the underground community have not been forthcoming with information.</string>

<string name="4369">Bandits who prey on honest travelers have need of weapons that are light and easily concealed - weapons such as this one. It is certain that, whatever its origin, this deadly rapier was not meant for honest purposes. Merely holding it in the hand produces a larcenous gleam in the eye, and thoughts of fat merchants with fatter purses spring to mind unbidden. This weapon is a boon for thieves and a bane of honest men.</string>

<string name="4378">Known blades of this configuration are traceable to the armory of Daavid Ali Fazeer, a merchant of renown 50 years ago.

<string name="4381">Scimitar of Speed</string>
<string name="4382">It is doubtful the victim of a Laughing Blade finds anything humorous about it. These items were created by master illusionist Daniel Suther, who wanted an interesting twist in the hedge maze he built.

Suther was eventually jailed after several deaths on his estate.</string>

<string name="4384">When the smithy guild of Endrab refused to admit Ula on the basis of her gender, she challenged their best weaponsmith to a contest to see who could forge the finer sword. She toiled for weeks, her workshop busy day and night, until she produced a flawless, beautiful scimitar. Enraged that a &apos;mere&apos; woman should best him, the guildsman hired assassins to do away with her. Ula&apos;s story has since inspired many more women to take up her profession, and make many copies of Ula&apos;s famous blade.</string>

<string name="4394">Spellcasters facilitate research by bartering magic, and though the practice does not usually span across planes, some resources just cannot be had locally. Such is the case for Ichthia, a sorceress currently peddling finely crafted implements of death. Though never seen, the cost of her shadowy aid is well known: she barters in souls, usually with people not aware of their worth. The original owners of a Neck-Knife are often dead on the inside themselves.</string>
<string name="4395">Ichthia&apos;s Neck-Knife</string>
<string name="4396">Swords of this type are boldly marked and clearly come from a single source, though the significance of that source remains hidden as yet. Known owners have not volunteered any revealing information, or even the cost they paid to acquire their weapons, if there was a cost other than a dangerous dungeon retrieval.</string>
<string name="4397">Breath of the Maiden</string>
<string name="4398">This is a swashbuckler&apos;s blade that has seen endless use in grand fights against &quot;big nasties&quot; sent forth by whomever. The Lucky Ones mercenary company commissioned these blades while still flush from their last big score. After their windfall they only adventured for the thrill of it, challenging each other to ever-greater feats of daring-do. Why are these weapons no longer with them? Sometimes the &quot;big nasty&quot; wins.</string>
<string name="4399">The Lucky One</string>
<string name="4400">Feyduster +1</string>
<string name="4401">Short Sword +2</string>
<string name="4402">Feyduster +2</string>
<string name="4403">This magic weapon has an enhancement bonus to attack and damage, but it doesn&apos;t bear the hallmarks of any specific maker.</string>
<string name="4404">Short Sword +3</string>
<string name="4405">Throwing Axe +1</string>
<string name="4406">These axes are so named because each strikes with a blast of thunder, often dazing or deafening the target. Though legend holds that the axes were a gift from the heavens themselves, they are too variable in power to have come from a single source. Most scholars agree that they were likely fashioned by several different artisans, perhaps in tribute to a lost original.</string>
<string name="4407">Thunderbeast Axe</string>
<string name="4408">The pride of the Thunderkind Corps until their dissolution in 1095 DR, these axes have seen battle countless times. Unfortunately, any individual acts of heroism accomplished with these weapons have been forgotten, forever overshadowed by a more dubious honor. Hangard&apos;s Axe is the only one of the lot individually remembered, losing its original name after a dwarf fond of ale made it famous by continually burying it in the foreheads of his friends.</string>
<string name="4409">Axe of the Coming Storm</string>
<string name="4410">These weapons supposedly came from a group of druids and rangers who appealed to Mielikki for aid in the defense of their wood. In answer, a flock of ravens descended, each transforming into a throwing axe capable of striking fear into the heart of its target. As with many such tales, the name of the group and even the location of the forest change with every teller.</string>
<string name="4411">Black Raven Axe</string>
<string name="4412">These items are vexing to modern sages, since their dwarven creator remains completely unknown. No dwarf yet encountered has claimed kinship with the mysterious smith, and further investigations are met with gruff explanations and eventually stony silence.</string>
<string name="4413">Rifthome Axe</string>
<string name="4414">These glowing red axes explode in flames when they strike their target. Like many such items, they are viewed by druids and rangers with suspicion, and by treants with open hostility.</string>
<string name="4415">Fire Axe</string>
<string name="4416">Throwing Axe +2</string>
<string name="4417">Throwing Axe +3</string>
<string name="4418">Dart +1</string>
<string name="4419">Dart of Stunning</string>
<string name="4420">Darts of this type can stun their targets, though potency and duration are determined by the power of the dart&apos;s creator.</string>
<string name="4421">Asp&apos;s Nest</string>
<string name="4422">Asp&apos;s Nest darts are vicious, their tips covered by a neatly arranged collection of fangs that deliver venom as effectively as snake&apos;s fang. These weapons may have originated with the beast tribes of the north, but their use has spread in recent times.</string>
<string name="4423">Ice Dart</string>
<string name="4424">Ice Darts give off a blast of frigid cold when they strike their target, flash-freezing armor and flesh alike.</string>
<string name="4425">Acid Dart</string>
<string name="4426">These darts have a stinging, indescribable odor about them. There also seems to be a faint hissing sound coming from their tips.</string>
<string name="4427">Dart of Accuracy</string>
<string name="4428">These precisely milled darts are balanced as well as the finest arrow, and seem to unerringly seek out their targets.</string>
<string name="4429">Dart +2</string>
<string name="4430">Dart +3</string>
<string name="4431">Shuriken +1</string>
<string name="4432">Stars of Ojy-do</string>
<string name="4433">Ojy was the spiritual guide for the village of Golden, but found himself pressed into work as a smith when bandits laid siege to the community. He fashioned these and other weapons so the defenders could fight back, and though he was unskilled in metalworking, he offered thanks to his guiding spirits for each successful hit of his hammer. That these stars still exist is a testament to the strength of his faith.</string>
<string name="4434">Dragon&apos;s Tail</string>
<string name="4435">Each weapon of this type bears the following inscription: &quot;As the tail of the Dragon sweeps across the sky, so too will these stars be unerring and true, if no other intent is meant or suffered.&quot; Of course, this ungainly text is actually the poor translation of a single elegant symbol. Is it any wonder that the creator of the item remains unknown, when such lengths must be taken to understand so small a thing?</string>
<string name="4436">Shining Light</string>
<string name="4437">Years ago, Vilaneux of the Iron Order was lost to a hurricane and stranded in then-unknown Kara Tur. He and his full plate armor were an oddity to locals, but he soon proved his commitment to justice. He became so respected that, when he died, his armor was cut into these Shining Light weapons in tribute. </string>
<string name="4438">Many Talons</string>
<string name="4439">&quot;The Calling&quot; was an evil that infested the Azaki assassins&apos; guild of Kara-Tur some 200 years ago. It corrupted a minor attendant, and elevated his family in exchange for gruesome service. The attendant&apos;s body eventually played host to the creature&apos;s soul, and in the chaos that followed it generated dozens of these weapons, apparently at will, before falling to an unknown sohei.</string>
<string name="4440">Grains of Sand</string>
<string name="4441">These are from the armory of Miri Shokiro, a warrior whose legacy is largely lost to history. What survives is the philosophy that defined her existence: &quot;Be the sand, and nothing but time will take you. The rocks must become it, the waves and wind must bear it, and those who would hold it find it slips through their grasp. Always some trace in a faraway nook, if never the whole is seen again.&quot;</string>

<string name="4532">Zombie corpse</string>
<string name="4533">A portal glows softly before you. You wonder where it leads.</string>
<string name="4534">Recall Portal</string>
<string name="4535">This hunched creature is fashioned from dark stone. From the corner of your eye it almost seems to move, but when you turn to face it, all is still.</string>
<string name="4536">Statue</string>
<string name="4537">The sarcophagus&apos; heavy lid is fashioned from unadorned stone.</string>
<string name="4538">Coffin</string>
<string name="4539">A sickly sweet smell emanates from the bubbling flasks and vials on this table. It appears to be the work of some form of alchemy.</string>
<string name="4540">A small altar rests before you. Age-old bloodstains have seeped into the stone, mingling with scorchmarks left from a long-extinguished fire.</string>
<string name="4541">Altar</string>
<string name="4542">A small altar rests before you. You catch your reflection in its polished gleam, feeling somehow at peace within its presence.</string>
<string name="4543">A small altar rests before you. The heavy stone seems stoic and firmly rooted, leaving you wondering how long it has been there.</string>
<string name="4544">The iron bars on this cage seem sturdy and well-fashioned. It would be a hard task to break them.</string>
<string name="4545">Cage</string>
<string name="4546">This sturdy blacksmith&apos;s anvil bears the dented sheen of long use. Something in you wonders what great weapons and armor have been shaped upon its well-worn surface.</string>
<string name="4547">The wicker bulls-eye of this archery target bears a fresh coat of paint.</string>

<string name="4551">Arrow-filled corpse</string>
<string name="4552">A heavy javelin sits in its groove, notched against the ballista&apos;s taut-drawn wire. You can imagine how a well-aimed shot might have the power to fell a dragon from the sky.</string>

<string name="4571">Bird Cage</string>
<string name="4572">A pool of blood leaves its mark upon this place.</string>
<string name="4573">Silks from far east, light cottons from across the sea, hand-spun wool from local herds, all of them jumbled together like close neighbors in a foreign land. </string>
<string name="4574">The books lay piled atop each other with little in the way of rhyme or reason, as if someone was interrupted while in the process of returning them to their place.</string>
<string name="4575">A dizzying array of written works, each catalogued according to some fashion you cannot fathom. A number of them appear to be written in foreign tongues altogether.</string>
<string name="4576">Bookshelf</string>
<string name="4577">Loosely nailed, this wooden crate appears intended for temporary storage.</string>
<string name="4578">Crate</string>
<string name="4579">The brazier gives off a hot glow. As you reach toward it, you can feel beads of sweat forming on the palm of your hand.</string>
<string name="4580">Sap still leaks from the rough-hewn tip of this battering ram. It appears to have been recently fashioned.</string>
<string name="4581">One of the axles has snapped, rendering this battering ram useless.</string>
<string name="4582">Wrecked Battering Ram</string>
<string name="4583">Broken in various places, this wagon has seen better days.</string>
<string name="4584">A small flock of butterflies have gathered here, fluttering delicately with the breeze.</string>
<string name="4585">The wood&apos;s rich grain adds an unexpected vibrancy to this humble cabinet. Whoever crafted it clearly did so with great love.</string>
<string name="4586">The smell of woodsmoke draws you closer to the dancing fire. The sap of a birch log burns blue at its center.</string>
<string name="4587">A thick stew cooks over the fire. It smells bland, though, and ill-prepared.</string>
<string name="4588">Something roasts over the crackling fire. Grease drippings feed the flames below.</string>
<string name="4589">Thick tallow candles burn low upon their iron stand. Small mounds have formed on the floor below, where the fallen tallow has accumulated.</string>
<string name="4590">The catapult is small but well-built. With a proper counterweight, it should be able to deliver its payload quite a ways.</string>
<string name="4591">This catapult appears to have collapsed where it stood, perhaps by retreating forces who didn&apos;t want it turned against them.</string>
<string name="4592">Wrecked Catapult</string>
<string name="4593">It is a simple chair but the grace of its lines speaks to the quality of its craftmanship.</string>
<string name="4594">Bound in iron and with a heavy lock, this heavy chest was obviously meant to protect something of value.</string>
<string name="4595">Strange runes and pictographs, likely arcane in nature, have been scorched into the sides of this hide-covered strongbox.</string>
<string name="4596">Metal studs poke through the woodwork of this ornate chest. Judging by the fine craftsmanship, this strongbox appears to have been intended for public display.</string>
<string name="4597">Low and flat, this chest seems to have been designed for the storage and filing of a merchant&apos;s accounts.</string>
<string name="4598">The antique drawer pulls are touched by rust and the drawers themselves fit ill within their sockets. It seems the damp air has not been kind to this piece.</string>
<string name="4599">With its bucket head and straw-filled chest, the combat dummy seems far from threatening.</string>
<string name="4600">Either he owned little to begin with or this man was stripped of all he had.</string>
<string name="4601">Corpse</string>
<string name="4602">Rats nibble on the corpse&apos;s fingers and scurry about his ears. It looks like the body has been here awhile.</string>
<string name="4603">In death, the face of the bare-chested man seems frozen with fear. You wonder what it was that killed him.</string>
<string name="4604">The rickety cot seems well-used. The loose-woven cotton holds the shape of unknown bodies.</string>
<string name="4605">Cot</string>
<string name="4606">The sofa seems warm and inviting, perfect for a short nap.</string>
<string name="4607">A small drawer extends beneath the gleaming tabletop. It probably doubles as a desk when there&apos;s the need.</string>
<string name="4608">The marble is smooth and cool to the touch. You find it hard to determine where the stone ends and the water begins.</string>
<string name="4609">The smoke has an acrid smell, as if something foul smoulders at its source.</string>
<string name="4610">The old wagon lies empty, abandoned, like a faithful pet that still expects its master to come home.</string>
<string name="4611">Wagon</string>
<string name="4612">A tarp covers the wagon&apos;s cargo, possibly cabbages being brought to market.</string>

<string name="4624">The fire crackles and burns, consuming everything within its scorching heat.</string>
<string name="4625">Flame</string>
<string name="4626">The fire burns strong, fanned anew with each gust of air.</string>
<string name="4627">The fire is small and slow-burning. It leaves behind a small scattering of ash.</string>
<string name="4628">A complex series of runes that look as if they may mean something to a wizard. Perhaps only to the wizard that made them in the first place, though.</string>
<string name="4629">Floor Design</string>
<string name="4630">A swirl of a vortex adorns the floor. Its meaning is not known to you.</string>
<string name="4631">This symbol seems to point the way. But for good or not, you do not know.</string>
<string name="4632">A slender lever rises from the floor, controlling some unseen mechanism below.</string>
<string name="4633">Floor Lever</string>
<string name="4634">A heavy lever protrudes out of the ground, controlling some unseen mechanism below.</string>
<string name="4635">The chains on these floor-bound shackles are chipped and marked as if someone had been pounding on them with a rock. Whoever it was, it doesn&apos;t appear that their efforts met with any success.</string>
<string name="4636">Floor-anchored shackles</string>
<string name="4637">The low footstool is bound in an exotic leather, possibly monstrous in its origin.</string>
<string name="4638">Hearty bellows fan the forge-borne flames. The air is blisteringly hot, leaving you feeling light-headed and not quite yourself.</string>
<string name="4639">The water tumbles into the pool below, the sound of its fall marking a cheerful note.</string>
<string name="4640">Flies buzz around the fetid corpse. The body is curled into a fetal position as if cold or in great pain.</string>
<string name="4641">Plague Victim Corpse</string>
<string name="4642">The torch paints its environs in warmer hues. You find yourself grateful for its glow. </string>
<string name="4643">Torch Bracket</string>
<string name="4644">Crates of goods rest easy in the wagon, dusty from their recent journey.</string>
<string name="4645">Scraps and detritus cling together in an unsightly pile.</string>

<string name="4647">Gnomish Contraption</string>
<string name="4648">If you listen closely, you can hear the brass gong resonating softly with your every step, as if acknowledging your presence.</string>
<string name="4649">A tuft of grass extends above the others, catching your eye.</string>
<string name="4650">Grass Tuft</string>
<string name="4651">The noose sways gently in the wind, as if searching for a corpse.</string>
<string name="4652">Gallows</string>
<string name="4653">The hay smells fresh and sweet, the product of some farmwife&apos;s labor.</string>
<string name="4654">Hay Bale</string>
<string name="4655">This granite headstone was carefully chiseled.</string>
<string name="4656">The sun-bleached corpse groans and shifts, a gust of wind giving it the brief appearance of unlife.</string>
<string name="4657">Impaled Human Corpse</string>
<string name="4658">Impaled Monster Corpse</string>
<string name="4659">This once-noble face now wears the gruesome mask of death. The eye sockets are bloodied and empty -- the ravens have already plucked the nectar out.</string>
<string name="4660">Impaled Human Head</string>
<string name="4661">Impaled Monster Head</string>
<string name="4662">You look about you, suspicious, but see nothing.</string>
<string name="4663">You can almost taste the hearty mead within the cask. It looks to have aged well.</string>
<string name="4664">The lamp post is pitted and scarred by the harsh night air.</string>
<string name="4665">This lectern is well-designed to hide the knocking knees of those who speak from it.</string>
<string name="4666">The sack seems small and poorly-sewn.</string>
<string name="4667">The sack seems plump and full.</string>
<string name="4668">The little sack is made of fine-spun cotton, tightly stitched.</string>
<string name="4669">The heavy sack dances with the sound of coins.</string>
<string name="4670">The satchel lies half-open, as if abandoned in the very act of being filled.</string>
<string name="4671">The satchel-clasp is hooked and drawn to ensure its contents don&apos;t spill out.</string>
<string name="4672">Blue sparks rise up from the ground like will-o&apos;-wisps on cool night air.</string>

<string name="4683">The dark stone of the pillar is inlaid with bands of gold.</string>
<string name="4684">Pillar</string>
<string name="4685">The rough-hewn beam shows the stains of countless sweaty hands and shoulders leaning up against it.</string>

<string name="4932">Me not know what guild is. You tell?</string>
<string name="4933">I&apos;ve never told you my name before.</string>
<string name="4934">Me not tell name. How you know?</string>
<string name="4935">I must be on my way.</string>
<string name="4936">Me go back to adventure-stuff now. Bye.</string>
<string name="4937">I would like to join the guild.</string>
<string name="4938">Me like to would join your guild.</string>
<string name="4939">Evaluate me for guild membership.</string>
<string name="4940">Me do something to be guild member. You judge me.</string>
<string name="4941">Okay, bye.</string>
<string name="4942">Have you special equipment available for guild members?</string>
<string name="4943">Yes.</string>
<string name="4944">No.</string>
<string name="4945">Here is my 200 gold. Let me take the test again.</string>
<string name="4946">You take gold. Me try again.</string>
<string name="4947">Farewell, then.</string>
<string name="4948">Maybe you gots special stuff for guild members?</string>
<string name="4949">Well, hello, &lt;FullName&gt;. I had heard there was a new magic adept in service to the city. The guild of the Many-Starred Cloak welcomes you.</string>
<string name="4950">Well, if *that&apos;s* the greatest of your curiosities, then this is going to be an interesting conversation - of that I am certain!</string>
<string name="4951">I should think it would be obvious. Within this tower is stored Neverwinter&apos;s collected experience with the art and discipline of magic.</string>
<string name="4952">We are the Many-Starred Cloak, and it is our goal to bring each student of magic to the heights of their potential.</string>
<string name="4953">We provide access to our magical inventories, as well as free passage throughout the Cloaktower. Would you care to become a part of our guild?</string>
<string name="4954">Well, far be it from me to keep you from your duties. Visit again when you have need of us. Farewell.</string>
<string name="4955">Hmm... I recognize you. You are one of the new recruits under Aribeth, are you not? I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FullName&gt;, but this is the spellcasters&apos; guild. It will not interest you.</string>
<string name="4956">Well, I&apos;m glad to hear that. But before you can join the guild, you have to be able to show competence in several important areas of ability.</string>
<string name="4957">For your first test, I need you to demonstrate to me that you can find knowledge on your own, and then apply it for unrelated requests.</string>
<string name="4958">To help you out, I will tell you where to start. Find me the following four items, and once you have done so, bring them to me.</string>
<string name="4959">Hello, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Are we back to continue on with our next round of challenges? Or did we have something else in mind?</string>
<string name="4960">The items may be found in the arcane laboratories of the Many-Starred Cloak, located throughout the city. The buildings are marked with sundials.</string>
<string name="4961">The four items that you must find are: a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood. Mark well the order.</string>
<string name="4962">Welcome, member. What do you require?</string>
<string name="4963">You were sent for four reagents, and you do not have them. Return when you do.</string>
<string name="4964">You were sent for four reagents and you have them. Well done. Now you shall face a test of mind and body.</string>
<string name="4965">You have not yet destroyed the golem in my second challenge.</string>
<string name="4966">You will be teleported to a room where you must destroy one of my automatons. Tools will be found there that will simplify the task.</string>
<string name="4967">Then return when you are.</string>
<string name="4968">Then step into the portal and the test will begin.</string>
<string name="4969">Congratulations. You have shown great ingenuity. By destroying my automaton you have earned a place in the Many-Starred Cloak.</string>
<string name="4970">You have tried to destroy the automaton and have failed. There is a penalty for failure, but it is more a token gesture of your intent to continue.</string>
<string name="4971">If you wish to take the test again, the penalty will lighten your purse. A 200 gold piece &quot;donation&quot; to the guild will do.</string>
<string name="4972">Use the knowledge from my first task and this test will be simple, but if you leave before the automaton is destroyed, you have failed. Are you ready?</string>
<string name="4973">You may take animal companions or henchmen, but you are being tested, not they. If they cause you to fail, it is still your failure. Keep them under complete control.</string>
<string name="4974">Take this key. Beware, as the laboratories are guarded against would-be initiates. Return to me when you have the four items.</string>
<string name="4975">I present you with the symbol of your guild. Wear this cloak with pride, and know that the guild stands ready to serve in future.</string>
<string name="4976">The four items that you must find are: a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood. Mark well the order.</string>
<string name="4977">Good day, I wish you well.</string>

<string name="5193">City safe. Prisoners all in prison, right?</string>

<string name="5197">Bah! Me look for gold. You can all rot.</string>
<string name="5198">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me good guy. It okay to talk.</string>
<string name="5199">What are you doing in my home? Oh, as if there isn&apos;t enough trouble around here.</string>
<string name="5200">Who are you? I hope you are a guard. We need more around here. There&apos;s trouble in the prison, and nobody&apos;s doing much about it.</string>
<string name="5201">Just wind your way up to the top o&apos; the Peninsula. The guards walk that path twice a day, though I suppose it&apos;s a fair bit more dangerous now.</string>
<string name="5202">If only they were! They prowl the streets with the gall to say... oh nothing! I don&apos;t know who to trust these days... </string>
<string name="5203">It ain&apos;t my business if you do or don&apos;t. I&apos;d think, though, that if you&apos;ve the power to help, you&apos;ve a duty to do it.</string>
<string name="5204">May the Wailing catch you, then. I won&apos;t share the same air you breathe.</string>
<string name="5205">It&apos;s good there are still decent folk about in these times. Best of luck to you, then.</string>
<string name="5206">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh very well. The prisoners who escaped are saying that it was the Head Gaoler himself who set them loose... </string>
<string name="5207">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I have to keep my mouth shut, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. My life might be on the line. Please, just leave me alone.</string>
<string name="5208">You would think that. Commander Alaefin is the Head Gaoler there. He&apos;s always been so kind to us... He was a good man once.</string>
<string name="5209">Oh nothing. I don&apos;t know who to trust these days... </string>
<string name="5210">Well, I don&apos;t want to confuse you. Just keep going up. You get to the top of the Peninsula, you&apos;ll be there. I imagine it&apos;s pretty dangerous right now, though.</string>

<string name="5285">What do you know about the prison riots?</string>
<string name="5286">What you know &apos;bout prison riots?</string>
<string name="5287">May Helm watch and bless you in this time of suffering.</string>
<string name="5288">You there, shall I bless you with this living water, once cupped within the Guardian&apos;s palm? It keeps the plague at bay, at least for a while.</string>
<string name="5289">May this child of the mortal realm be blessed, touched by the comforting waters that Desther has blessed in the name of Helm. Let the eye watch over your fate.</string>
<string name="5290">Go with comfort. I wish you well in the dark times ahead.</string>
<string name="5291">What would you care to know?</string>
<string name="5292">Watchknight Desther is a holy man, to be sure. He was appointed to watch over Neverwinter at Shieldmeet. A grand honor.</string>
<string name="5293">We all journeyed with him from Helm&apos;s Hold and arrived here scant days after Lady Aribeth declared the quarantine.</string>
<string name="5294">Yes... the holy symbol of Helm. Well, obviously it is an open gauntlet, which symbolizes the... the peace brought by having an armored protector. We are guardians.</string>
<string name="5295">And in the center of the palm is the eye. Eyes are very important. They see all, know all, speak to us. They watch and learn. Yes.</string>
<string name="5296">It is a horrible plague, grave in its implications and beyond the reach of any normal cure. </string>
<string name="5297">Yet the faithful pass unscathed - no Helmite suffers from its boils... we pass unfettered to administer our blessings of comfort.</string>
<string name="5298">I have temple services, if you require.</string>
<string name="5299"></string>
<string name="5300"></string>
<string name="5301"></string>
<string name="5302"></string>

<string name="5305">Yes, Helm protects the simple, too.</string>
<string name="5306">Yes, Helm protects the simple, too.</string>
<string name="5307">Noble one, shall I anoint you with this living water, once cupped within the Guardian&apos;s palm? It keeps the plague at bay, at least for a while.</string>
<string name="5308">You, with the... rough exterior, shall I cleanse you with this living water, once cupped within the Guardian&apos;s palm? It keeps the plague at bay, at least for a while.</string>
<string name="5309">The militia have kept me safe enough. I must say, though, that it&apos;s served as quite the distraction from any quest for a cure, don&apos;t you think?</string>
<string name="5310">In the end, it seems one of the Waterdhavian creatures was behind it all. The guards are cleaning up the last pockets of resistance now... </string>
<string name="5311"></string>
<string name="5312">Any good stores in the district?</string>
<string name="5313">Where can I find some healing around here?</string>
<string name="5314">That will be all, Gate Captain.</string>
<string name="5315">Me sell stuff here, right?</string>
<string name="5316">You heal me, yuh?</string>
<string name="5317">Me go, okay?</string>
<string name="5318">How did they escape?</string>
<string name="5319">Where&apos;s this prison?</string>
<string name="5320">Are any areas still safe?</string>
<string name="5321">Does the militia have a plan of attack?</string>
<string name="5322">Thanks for the warning.</string>
<string name="5323">How dey get out?</string>
<string name="5324">Where dis prison?</string>
<string name="5325">It still safe some places, yuh?</string>
<string name="5326">What da militia plannin&apos;?</string>
<string name="5327">Okay, me go now den.</string>
<string name="5328">Look, people feel uncomfortable enough just living around that prison, let alone tossing their money around near it. This place is a shopkeeper&apos;s nightmare, all right? </string>
<string name="5329">One of those new Helmites was performing his blessings somewhere to the southwest before all hell broke loose. Maybe he&apos;s still there now.</string>
<string name="5330">All right, then. Stay out of trouble.</string>
<string name="5331">You&apos;re a few wheels short of a wagon, aren&apos;t you... </string>
<string name="5332">Do I look like a Storekeep to you? I&apos;m not: I&apos;m a Gate Guard.</string>
<string name="5333">Don&apos;t go far - we need to talk, citizen.</string>
<string name="5334">If you&apos;re going onto the Peninsula, keep your head up. There&apos;s been a prison break and the place is crawling with trouble.</string>
<string name="5335">Rumor is that Captain Alaefin, the Head Gaoler, set them free. Makes no sense to me - he was a good man and ran a tight ship... </string>
<string name="5336">Southwest of here, at the top of the hill. It commands a great view of the harbor... not that the prisoners ever got to see it.</string>
<string name="5337">Sedos Sebile is the one in charge of the operation. The prisoners have her pretty much penned-in, but she&apos;s managed to secure a headquarters to the southeast.</string>
<string name="5338">If you&apos;re looking to help, I&apos;d recommend you go see her. She has better information on what&apos;s going on than I do.</string>
<string name="5339">For now everyone&apos;s just trying to figure out what&apos;s going on. Someone&apos;s going to have to go into that prison though, and get to the bottom of it. </string>
<string name="5340">If you want to thank me, go talk to Sedos Sebile at headquarters. We could definitely use your help cleaning up the Head Gaoler&apos;s mess... </string>
<string name="5341">Phew, it&apos;s been a hell of a day. I&apos;m just glad the prison break&apos;s been handled and dealt with.</string>

<string name="5474">You came just in time, friend. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="5475">Look, I&apos;m busy, okay?</string>
<string name="5476">Sedos? She&apos;s at the district headquarters. It&apos;s a building on the east side.</string>
<string name="5477">It&apos;s a building on the east side of the district.</string>
<string name="5478">Haven&apos;t you heard? There&apos;s been a prison break. The whole district&apos;s crawling with escapees and we&apos;ve got the ugly task of taking them down, dead or otherwise.</string>
<string name="5479">Well, &lt;FirstName&gt;, for anything beyond helping us take down these escaped prisoners and generally keep the peace, you&apos;d have to check with our superior, Sedos Sebile.</string>
<string name="5480">Then stay out of sight. This area&apos;s dangerous.</string>
<string name="5481">Need some help, citizen?</string>

<string name="5569">The Head Gaoler, is it?</string>
<string name="5570">Da Head Gaoler, huh?</string>
<string name="5571">Tunnels? What tunnels?</string>
<string name="5572">Huh? Tunnels?</string>
<string name="5573">Where&apos;s this estate?</string>
<string name="5574">Where dis &apos;state?</string>
<string name="5575">Who are you? What are you doing on the streets?</string>
<string name="5576">Who you be? What you doing out?</string>
<string name="5577">Do you need an escort to the district gates?</string>
<string name="5578">Me escort you to dis&apos;trick gates, yuh?</string>
<string name="5579">Ssh, follow me.</string>
<string name="5580">Just stay here for a moment.</string>
<string name="5581">Uh, you come wit&apos; me.</string>
<string name="5582">You stay here, yuh?</string>
<string name="5583">Thanks for the help, I was trying to make my way safely home when those brutes found me.</string>
<string name="5584">Bless Helm for adventurers! Things have gotten a lot better since the prison riots were finally put to rest!</string>
<string name="5585">Escapees from the prison. I heard one say that it was the Head Gaoler himself who freed them... I don&apos;t like the sound of it.</string>
<string name="5586">With the quarantine to deal with, too? They&apos;ve got their hands full, I&apos;m afraid. Us folk have to fend for ourselves.</string>
<string name="5587">Captain Alaefin, he&apos;s the Head Gaoler there. He runs a tight ship... or at least he used to. Some say he&apos;s the one who set these prisoners free.</string>
<string name="5588">Wha!? Here, it&apos;s all I&apos;ve got... Now leave me alone!</string>
<string name="5589">Thanks again, I&apos;ll do that... </string>
<string name="5590">Yes, Alaefin. He&apos;s a good man, I swear he is. Why, he&apos;d meet every afternoon in the tunnels with Lady Tanglebrook for a friendly game of chess... They&apos;re cousins, you know... </string>
<string name="5591">Lady Tanglebrook has always been leery about walking the streets in this district. Alaefin built the tunnels between the prison and her estate so they could continue their games there.</string>
<string name="5592">The Tanglebrook? It&apos;s at the far reach of the peninsula. As I said, though, she&apos;s right scared of the Wailing and she locked the door behind me when I left. </string>
<string name="5593">Maybe you could check in on her to make sure she&apos;s okay. Scared or no, I know she keeps a spare key hidden under her doormat for us.</string>
<string name="5594">Help me! Please, you have to help!</string>
<string name="5595">I&apos;m a maid for Lady Tanglebrook. I was on my way home from my morning shift when all of... of *this* erupted!</string>
<string name="5596">Would you? I was thinking I&apos;d never make it. I really must get to the Peninsula gates and tell Captain Kipp about what I have seen.</string>
<string name="5597">There&apos;s the district gates! Thanks so much for your help, my friend.</string>
<string name="5598">What, is there trouble about? I must get to the Peninsula gates and speak with Captain Kipp.</string>
<string name="5599">If you say so.</string>
<string name="5600">If you&apos;re leaving me here, oh please don&apos;t be long... </string>
<string name="5601">Now that the plague is everywhere, they hoped that continuing to use the tunnels would prevent her from being exposed to it. </string>
<string name="5602">Your attackers, who were they?</string>
<string name="5603">Are there not enough guards to keep you safe?</string>
<string name="5604">Who says I rescued you? Hand over your gold... </string>

<string name="5645">I am in service to Aribeth and the city guard.</string>
<string name="5646">Me works for Aribeth and city guard.</string>
<string name="5647">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5648">Me want to know about different city areas.</string>
<string name="5649">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="5650">I need infomation about Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="5651">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="5652">You know anything about bad plague?</string>
<string name="5653">Me wants information about Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="5654">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="5655">What do you know about attempts at a cure?</string>
<string name="5656">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="5657">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="5658">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="5659">What are the different areas of the city?</string>
<string name="5660">Tell me about the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="5661">Tell me about the Docks district.</string>
<string name="5662">Tell me about the Blacklake district.</string>
<string name="5663">Tell me about the Peninsula district.</string>
<string name="5664">What do you know about the leaders of Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="5665">Who run this place? You know about them?</string>
<string name="5666">Tell me about the City Core.</string>
<string name="5667">I just need to ask a few questions.</string>
<string name="5668">Me just wants ask few questions.</string>
<string name="5669">Don&apos;t question me. I go where I want.</string>
<string name="5670">You shut up. Me goes where me want.</string>
<string name="5671">I will leave.</string>
<string name="5672">Me leave.</string>
<string name="5673">You tells about City Core.</string>
<string name="5674">You tells about Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="5675">You tells about Docks district.</string>
<string name="5676">You tells about Blacklake district.</string>
<string name="5677">You tells about Peninsula district.</string>
<string name="5678">Back to the other areas.</string>
<string name="5679">Back to other areas?</string>
<string name="5680">How has Lord Nasher dealt with the plague?</string>
<string name="5681">Lord Nasher do stuff once plague happen?</string>
<string name="5682">How has Lady Aribeth dealt with the plague?</string>
<string name="5683">What Lady Aribeth do when plague happen?</string>
<string name="5684">I would hate to think that the times have turned a person of your stature to banditry. Why are you in my home?</string>
<string name="5685">Who are you? Why are you in my home? I don&apos;t want to think my fellow Neverwintans would stoop to banditry.</string>
<string name="5686">Must I worry about bandits as well as the plague? Give me a reason you are in my home or get out!</string>
<string name="5687">Obviously they have lowered their expectations for new guards. If you can form questions, please ask them and leave.</string>
<string name="5688">I see. I had heard they were recruiting from outside the city. Very well, I will speak with you. I trust this will be brief?</string>
<string name="5689">Not much. There&apos;s very little that I need to know except that it kills my friends and family.</string>
<string name="5690">Lord Nasher assures us that all efforts are being made to find a cure. Beyond that... I haven&apos;t heard anything.</string>
<string name="5691">Farewell. Please leave my home as you found it.</string>
<string name="5692">What is it you want to know? I am sure you would get better answers from your fellow guards. I am a simple citizen.</string>
<string name="5693">I can&apos;t say much. I live and work in the City Core. The Blacklake district is beyond my means, and I certainly have no business in the others.</string>
<string name="5694">I don&apos;t bother with the Beggar&apos;s Nest, the Docks, or the Peninsula. They were rough enough before the Wailing took hold.</string>
<string name="5695">Sorry, I really don&apos;t get out of the City Core much. Especially now with the plague everywhere. It&apos;s just not safe.</string>
<string name="5696">That is where you are now. It is the business center of the city. Really, this should all be evident to you after just walking around.</string>
<string name="5697">Home to the slums. The Beggar&apos;s Nest was poor enough before the Wailing. I don&apos;t want to think about what it would be like now.</string>
<string name="5698">Good. I don&apos;t need strange people invading my home.</string>
<string name="5699">I see no reason to answer. You invaded my home and haven&apos;t offered any explanation why. Just get out.</string>
<string name="5700">Well, it appears there is very little I can do to prevent you doing what you wish. Does this mean you intend to rob my home?</string>
<string name="5701"></string>
<string name="5702">You again? I&apos;m sorry, but is there really a reason for you to remain in my home?</string>
<string name="5703">Hmph. Outsiders hired to replace our dead. I suppose they expect me to trust you? I&apos;ll answer a few questions, but then you should leave.</string>
<string name="5704">I can&apos;t tell you anything about the place. I&apos;ve been lucky enough to save a few coins here and there.</string>
<string name="5705">I don&apos;t know much about it. I try to stay away from the rougher areas of the city. I hear talk about pirates, but I wouldn&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="5706">The Blacklake district is the wealthiest part of the city. I don&apos;t have much cause to go there. I can&apos;t afford to look like I belong there.</string>
<string name="5707">I&apos;ve got no reason to know anything about the Peninsula district. Only the roughest of our criminal element end up there.</string>
<string name="5708">It&apos;s worse than the Docks, I hear. I&apos;ve never been there, though.</string>
<string name="5709">Which district did you want to ask about? I don&apos;t know much.</string>
<string name="5710">I don&apos;t pay much attention to politics. I follow Lord Nasher as our leader, and Lady Aribeth of the Neverwinter Nine.</string>
<string name="5711">Lord Nasher has pledged any needed resources to curing the plague. He has been quite supportive, as any leader would when tragedy strikes.</string>
<string name="5712">Actually, I should say that it was his advisors that made his intentions known. Lord Nasher himself has wisely been locked away to protect against the plague.</string>
<string name="5713">Now, are we just about done? You are still in my home uninvited.</string>
<string name="5714">I don&apos;t know any specifics, but she has been on the front lines of everything, working with people, trying to organize.</string>
<string name="5715">The only people we see more are the Helmites, dispensing their blessings. I&apos;m not sure who they report to. Someone under Aribeth?</string>
<string name="5716">Does that suffice? Do you have more questions or will you leave my home now?</string>
<string name="5717">I&apos;ve heard of an increase in banditry, which is why I&apos;d like you to leave my home.</string>
<string name="5718">I am in service to Aribeth and the city guard.</string>
<string name="5719">Me works for Aribeth and city guard.</string>
<string name="5720">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5721">Me want to know about different city areas.</string>

<string name="5737">What do you know about the leaders of Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="5738">Who run this place? You know about them?</string>
<string name="5739">Tell me about the City Core.</string>
<string name="5740">I just need to ask a few questions.</string>
<string name="5741">Me just wants ask few questions.</string>
<string name="5742">Don&apos;t question me. I go where I want.</string>
<string name="5743">You shut up. Me goes where me want.</string>
<string name="5744">I will leave.</string>
<string name="5745">Me leave.</string>
<string name="5746">You tells about City Core.</string>
<string name="5747">You tells about Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="5748">You tells about Docks district.</string>
<string name="5749">You tells about Blacklake district.</string>
<string name="5750">You tells about Peninsula district.</string>
<string name="5751">Back to the other areas.</string>
<string name="5752">Back to other areas?</string>
<string name="5753">How has Lord Nasher dealt with the plague?</string>
<string name="5754">Lord Nasher do stuff once plague happen?</string>
<string name="5755">How has Lady Aribeth dealt with the plague?</string>
<string name="5756">What Lady Aribeth do when plague happen?</string>
<string name="5757">May I assist you? I don&apos;t want to be rude, but you *are* in my home uninvited.</string>
<string name="5758">Why are you here in my home? Please leave.</string>
<string name="5759">Why are you here? Are you a bandit? I have nothing worth your time. Please, just leave.</string>
<string name="5760">That doesn&apos;t mean you can invade my home... does it? I&apos;ll answer your questions, but I would like you to leave afterward.</string>
<string name="5761">Please, don&apos;t speak of it in my home. I&apos;ve been lucky enough to avoid it and I don&apos;t wish to tempt the fates.</string>
<string name="5762">The Helmites claim their blessings are a cure. I don&apos;t know. Everyday I see a few less of my neighbors around.</string>
<string name="5763">Farewell. Please leave my home as you found it.</string>
<string name="5764">I&apos;m not sure what you are asking about. It&apos;s a big city.</string>
<string name="5765">Well, I live in the City Core, so I don&apos;t get around much. There&apos;s four other districts, but I don&apos;t have much cause to visit them.</string>
<string name="5766">There&apos;s the Beggar&apos;s Nest, the Docks, the Peninsula, and Blacklake. I guess I could say something about them.</string>
<string name="5767">Not really. All I hear of is the plague and the death. It&apos;s almost too much. I don&apos;t want to know if there&apos;s anything else going on.</string>
<string name="5768">Why? That&apos;s where you are now. Couldn&apos;t you just walk around? Did you have to break into my home to learn that?</string>
<string name="5769">It&apos;s the poorest district. I don&apos;t give it much thought, really. Makes me feel bad, especially with it hit so hard by the Wailing.</string>
<string name="5770">Thank you. If times were better I might welcome... visitors, but not now.</string>
<string name="5771">You can&apos;t just barge into peoples&apos; homes and question them! What right do you have to do that?</string>
<string name="5772">And I am supposed to accept this? What do you want from me? Why bother with my little home?</string>
<string name="5773">What are we coming to? Threatened in my own home! Thief! Bandit! Get out of here!</string>
<string name="5774">Yes? Is there something else you need? I had hoped my previous answers were enough and you&apos;d leave.</string>
<string name="5775">I still don&apos;t know you. I never invited you into my home. Ask your questions if you want, but get out after.</string>
<string name="5776">I hear it&apos;s a busy place, but I guess it&apos;s pretty rough. Lots of transients come in on the ships. Pirates too.</string>
<string name="5777">I wish I could tell you about the Blacklake. I wouldn&apos;t be able to get the time of day from the people that live there. Stuffy nobles.</string>
<string name="5778">I wouldn&apos;t know anything about the Peninsula district. Good people stay away from it. That&apos;s where the prison is.</string>
<string name="5779">Which district did you want to ask about? I don&apos;t know much.</string>
<string name="5780">Oh, I don&apos;t know much about that sort of thing. Lord Nasher keeps the city peaceful and that&apos;s good enough for me. He&apos;s a good man.</string>
<string name="5781">Well, we don&apos;t see much of him now. Castle Never is locked up so he doesn&apos;t get the plague. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s doing all he can.</string>
<string name="5782">Lady Aribeth has been acting in his stead, I believe. She&apos;s a good woman. Keeps the rabble in line.</string>
<string name="5783">Does that suffice? I would like you out of here as soon as possible, please.</string>
<string name="5784">Oh, she is tireless. She&apos;s been organizing and... taking care of the dead. It must be a terribly straining job for her.</string>
<string name="5785">The guards are a bit shortstaffed, as you know. The Helmites are backing them up, I guess, but I don&apos;t know what they are specifically doing.</string>
<string name="5786">You are just fishing for questions now. Please, I told you I don&apos;t know much. Could you just leave?</string>
<string name="5787">Don&apos;t worry. I serve Aribeth and the city guard.</string>
<string name="5788">Me works for Aribeth and city guard.</string>
<string name="5789">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5790">Me want to know about different city areas.</string>
<string name="5791">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="5792">What do you know about Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="5793">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="5794">You know anything about bad plague?</string>
<string name="5795">Me wants information about Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="5796">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="5797">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="5798">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="5799">What are the different areas of the city?</string>
<string name="5800">What do you know about the leaders of Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="5801">Who run this place? You know about them?</string>
<string name="5802">I just need to ask a few questions.</string>
<string name="5803">Me just wants ask few questions.</string>
<string name="5804">Out of my way. I go where I want.</string>
<string name="5805">You shut up. Me goes where me want.</string>
<string name="5806">I will leave.</string>
<string name="5807">Me leave.</string>
<string name="5808">You look nice, but why are you in our home? Does Mommy know you?</string>
<string name="5809">Hello. Why are you here? Not many people come around now. Mommy says some people are sick.</string>
<string name="5810">I don&apos;t want to talk to you. You look scary, and Mommy said I shouldn&apos;t talk to scary people.</string>
<string name="5811">Hehe... you sound funny.</string>
<string name="5812">Mommy says guards are good, and I should do like they say.</string>
<string name="5813">That&apos;s what makes people sick, right? Some of my friends got that, and they don&apos;t come around any more. I miss them.</string>
<string name="5814">Bye. Don&apos;t get sick, okay?</string>
<string name="5815">It&apos;s big. I have to stay close to Mommy lots or I get lost.</string>
<string name="5816">There&apos;s my house... and school sometimes, but not for a while now. And the castle! It&apos;s big! I can&apos;t go by myself. That&apos;s all, I think.</string>
<string name="5817">You get spanked if you make someone eat a bug. And beans will grow if you put them in your nose.</string>
<string name="5818">Byebye. You go now.</string>
<string name="5819">Hmm... I don&apos;t think I can talk to you. Mommy says strangers might be bad.</string>
<string name="5820">You&apos;re mean! Why are you mean? Oh! I bet you&apos;re not supposed to be here! I bet Mommy didn&apos;t let you in!</string>
<string name="5821">Go away! I want all scary people to go away!</string>
<string name="5822">Hi again, &lt;Mister/Missus&gt; Guard. Why are you still here?</string>
<string name="5823">That&apos;s Mommy and Daddy, silly. Sometimes they listen to Mister Nasher, but he lives in the castle. Maybe he&apos;s nice, but I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="5824">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="5825">Me want some informations.</string>
<string name="5826">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5827">Me want to know about city areas.</string>
<string name="5828">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="5829">I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="5830">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="5831">You know anything about the bad plague?</string>
<string name="5832">Me wants information about places in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="5833">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="5834">What do you know about attempts at a cure?</string>
<string name="5835">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="5836">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; How has the plague affected the nobility?</string>
<string name="5837">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="5838">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="5839">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Are you suggesting a revolt of some sort?</string>
<string name="5840">What are the different areas of the city?</string>
<string name="5841">Tell me about the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="5842">Tell me about the Docks district.</string>
<string name="5843">Tell me about the Blacklake district.</string>
<string name="5844">Tell me about the Peninsula.</string>
<string name="5845">Where can I get equipment? </string>
<string name="5846">Where me get equipment?</string>
<string name="5847">Tell me about the City Core.</string>
<string name="5848">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Certainly you can tell me.</string>
<string name="5849">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You can tell me. Why worries about me?</string>
<string name="5850">Certainly you can tell me... we are &lt;race&gt; kin.</string>
<string name="5851">We both &lt;race&gt; kind. Why not tell me?</string>
<string name="5852">You tells about City Core.</string>
<string name="5853">You tells about Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="5854">You tells about Docks district.</string>
<string name="5855">You tells about Blacklake.</string>
<string name="5856">You tells about Peninsula.</string>
<string name="5857">Can you tell me about other city districts?</string>
<string name="5858">Maybe tell about other city places?</string>
<string name="5859">Greetings in these dark days. Is there aught than I can offer one as esteemed as yourself?</string>
<string name="5860">Yes? Is there something you require? These dark days have left my mind on other things so make it brief.</string>
<string name="5861">I&apos;ve no desire to speak with someone as rough-hewn as you, least of all in times such as these. Leave me be.</string>
<string name="5862">You are in need of more than that, by the sound of you. I will endeavor to speak slowly.</string>
<string name="5863">I can spare a few moments from my worrying. What is it that you wish to know?</string>
<string name="5864">It has cost me my business, for one. I was visiting friends in the City Core when the quarantine came down. My store is now empty and forgotten beyond those gates.</string>
<string name="5865">I have trusted associates that say a cure was being assembled, but something apparently disrupted the attempt. An attack, they say.</string>
<string name="5866">My business and I have ended up on separate sides of the quarantine, I&apos;m afraid. I cannot guess what has become of my dockhands now.</string>
<string name="5867">That is a tenuous link, and as much of one as I would want. Still, I suppose it is true enough. What harm can come of it?</string>
<string name="5868">This information has wisely been kept from the masses. Can you imagine the panic? Actually, I probably shouldn&apos;t have even told *you*.</string>
<string name="5869">It is ripe with the Wailing and I suspect that is where the plague first manifested. Hardly a surprise with all the filth that make their homes there.</string>
<string name="5870">It *kills* us! In the Wailing&apos;s eyes, we are no better than the lowliest of peasants. Where is the privilege of class now, I ask... </string>
<string name="5871">Hopefully we will do more than just let the Wailing take us. The actions of Lord Nasher and the Helmites have been underwhelming.</string>
<string name="5872">If you wish to know more of the matter, you should go to the district yourself. Trapped on this side of the quarantine, I am hardly current on such matters.</string>
<string name="5873">I understand there was trouble there recently. Someone has put an end to it, however, and nothing of interest about the place comes to mind.</string>
<string name="5874">A revolt? Why should the nobles revolt when they already hold the power! I merely suggested that provisions are being made for certain citizens of Blacklake to survive the plague.</string>
<string name="5875">Goodbye. Perhaps we&apos;ll both live to talk another time... </string>
<string name="5876">I am to be your simple guide? Hmph... Though if it would help toward a cure, I suppose I should endeavor to answer.</string>
<string name="5877">The different districts will each hold intrigues, I am sure. All but the Blacklake seem to do as they will when out from under the rule of law.</string>
<string name="5878">Very well, if this dreaded Wailing makes me serve as your signpost... Neverwinter is divided into five districts, each encompassing a particular industrious theme.</string>
<string name="5879">Which would you have questions about? The Beggar&apos;s Nest, the Docks, the Blacklake district, the Peninsula, or the City Core?</string>
<string name="5880">I don&apos;t sully myself by discussing mere conjecture. If you wish salacious details I suggest you look elsewhere.</string>
<string name="5881">The irony is not lost on me - I could have shown you to my own stock, once, and made a tidy profit from you, too... Instead, I point you to other establishments... </string>
<string name="5882">You look a bit of a scoundrel. You may want to visit the Moonstone Mask, near the Peninsula Gate in the City Core west.</string>
<string name="5883">You look the type to be concerned with the interests of nature. Perhaps you should visit the Druid Tree on the east side of the City Core&apos;s upper square.</string>
<string name="5884">Are you a pious individual? Perhaps you would benefit from visiting the Temple of Tyr in the City Core on the west side of the City Core&apos;s upper square.</string>
<string name="5885">Are you of an arcane bent? You might wish to make yourself known at the Cloaktower, just outside Castle Never.</string>
<string name="5886">You look handy with a weapon. You might wish to visit Shining Knight Arms and Armor in the southeast City Core.</string>
<string name="5887">... Not that someone of my stature would know anything of such a place - I merely mention it as a courtesy.</string>
<string name="5888">If you are looking for manpower, however, you may wish to visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest.</string>
<string name="5889">The City Core, my captain of redundancy, is where we now stand. Basic services are here, as well as specialized training.</string>
<string name="5890">Castle Never in the northeast is the city&apos;s heart. The &quot;upper square&quot; around it contains important spiritual and cultural institutions.</string>
<string name="5891">I know little of the Beggar&apos;s Nest, but that&apos;s hardly a failing. Only the poor and morally suspect willingly visit such a place.</string>
<string name="5892">I don&apos;t concern myself with the Docks. I have subordinates to handle the day-to-day workings of business and shipping... at least, I used to... </string>
<string name="5893">Ahh, only the best of us make our homes in the Blacklake district. It was the most privileged of the districts until it, too, fell within the Wailing&apos;s grasp.</string>
<string name="5894">Not even the status of residents could prevent the encroachement of the plague, though I hear some have... Ah, but I should speak no more of this.</string>
<string name="5895">Bah! What should I know of the Peninsula? It&apos;s a haven for those either caged in the prison or recently released from it.</string>
<string name="5896">The district edge, however, is possessed of more suspect establishments... for the most part, however, the militia&apos;s quarantine has kept us free of the Wailing.</string>
<string name="5897">That district is held to the thinnest thread of law by Captain Alaefin, the Head Gaoler. I have seen little of him since the cursed Wailing came.</string>
<string name="5898">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You know, you&apos;re right. A dullard such as yourself will forget what I say with the next shiny thing that captures your attention.</string>
<string name="5899">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I find your manner quite disarming. I suppose I could reveal one or two points. You may find them of interest.</string>
<string name="5900">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I rather think not. Blacklake district will handle its own affairs, thank you.</string>
<string name="5901">It&apos;s rather exciting, though dangerous as well. I hope the common people will understand that the ruling class knows best.</string>
<string name="5902">I really shouldn&apos;t give away any more. Suffice to say that certain nobles of Blacklake are making certain they survive this mess.</string>
<string name="5903">Could I trouble you with some questions?</string>
<string name="5904">Me wants to ask questions from you.</string>
<string name="5905">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5906">Me want to know about different city areas.</string>
<string name="5907">Can you tell me anything about the plague?</string>
<string name="5908">I require some information about locations in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="5909">Is there anything odd that you have heard?</string>
<string name="5910">You knows much about the plague?</string>
<string name="5911">Me wants to have information about Neverwinter places.</string>
<string name="5912">Maybe yous heard some rumors or something?</string>
<string name="5913">What do you know about cure attempts?</string>
<string name="5914">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="5915">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Has the plague disrupted the social order of the city?</string>
<string name="5916">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="5917">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="5918">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Are you suggesting a revolt of some sort?</string>
<string name="5919">What are the different areas of the city?</string>
<string name="5920">Tell me about the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="5921">Tell me about the Docks district.</string>
<string name="5922">Tell me about the Blacklake district.</string>
<string name="5923">Tell me about the Peninsula.</string>
<string name="5924">Where can I get equipment? </string>
<string name="5925">Where me get equipment?</string>
<string name="5926">Tell me about the City Core.</string>
<string name="5927">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Certainly you can tell me.</string>
<string name="5928">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You can tell me. Why worries about me?</string>
<string name="5929">Certainly you can tell me? We are &lt;race&gt; kin.</string>
<string name="5930">We both &lt;race&gt; kind. Why not tell me?</string>
<string name="5931">You tells about City Core.</string>
<string name="5932">You tells about Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="5933">You tells about the Docks district.</string>
<string name="5934">You tells about the Blacklake.</string>
<string name="5935">You tells about Peninsula.</string>
<string name="5936">I need to ask about other city districts.</string>
<string name="5937">Me ask about other areas?</string>
<string name="5938">Well hello there. You seem to be of noble blood, like me. We must stick together in these horrible times, don&apos;t you think, my fine-mannered friend?</string>
<string name="5939">Yes? Is there something you require? Please do be brief as your unwashed appearance leaves me to worry what infections you might be carrying... </string>
<string name="5940">Can you not see that I am in the midst of mourning? Show some respect for your betters, both living and dead!</string>
<string name="5941">I will comply, though it appears I will have to eschew my natural preference for proper grammar.</string>
<string name="5942">I suppose one still needs to breathe amidst one&apos;s mourning - Perhaps in helping you I am also helping my friends&apos; spirits find their rest.</string>
<string name="5943">I have lost my two closest friends to it already. The Helmites say they must be cremated rather than buried - but they did the Blacklake proud, at least... </string>
<string name="5944">The great unwashed have been kept ignorant of bungled efforts by city officials to contain the disease, and for good reason.</string>
<string name="5945">I even heard the area has fallen under the control of gangs of thugs and pirates, though whether this is true or simply an exaggeration I couldn&apos;t say.</string>
<string name="5946">I may share the race of your birth, but we are worlds apart. Still, these troubled times make strange allies of us all. </string>
<string name="5947">Components for a cure were lost to an attack. Can you imagine the panic if people knew that someone is actually fighting against the cure?</string>
<string name="5948">I hear it is now infested with zombies of the plague-dead - It serves the lower classes right for cursing us with such a dreadful pox!</string>
<string name="5949">Disrupted? The privileged do not take well to change - Why, captains of commerce are falling just as quick as their menial workers.</string>
<string name="5950">It won&apos;t be tolerated. The inaction of Lord Nasher and those under him will not hinder the nobilty from protecting their own.</string>
<string name="5951">If you have an opinion on the matter you should go to the district yourself and leave me to mourn the sacrifice.</string>
<string name="5952">I understand there was trouble there recently but someone has put an end to it. Even so, the guards will not allow me to attend my friends&apos; funerals.</string>
<string name="5953">My friends would have nothing to do with something so barbaric! It was simply a matter of the proper precautions being taken.</string>
<string name="5954">Fare thee well. I must return to my private mourning - It is the only way I have to grieve.</string>
<string name="5955">I don&apos;t usually have much regard for those that lose their way, but... well, the Wailing changes everything, doesn&apos;t it... </string>
<string name="5956">The different districts will each hold intrigues, I am sure. All but the Blacklake seem to do as they will once out from under the rule of law.</string>
<string name="5957">Neverwinter has always been divided into separate Districts but, with the militia maintaining the quarantine at every gate, it has become all the more apparent.</string>
<string name="5958">Which of the five is of interest to you? The Beggar&apos;s Nest, the Docks, the Blacklake district, the Peninsula, or the City Core?</string>
<string name="5959">The gossip of the nobility need not concern you, and likely wouldn&apos;t be the type of information you want anyway.</string>
<string name="5960">If you&apos;ll be using that equipment to avenge my friends or bring about a cure for us all, I&apos;ll gladly point you in the right direction.</string>
<string name="5961">I get the sense, however, that you seek something larcenous in nature. I&apos;d suggest visiting the Moonstone Mask, near the Peninsula exit in the City Core west.</string>
<string name="5962">You seem to move by Nature&apos;s hand? Perhaps the Druid Tree in the City Core upper square east would be a location of interest for you.</string>
<string name="5963">You appear quite strong in your faith. Perhaps you should pay a visit to the Temple of Tyr in the City Core upper square west.</string>
<string name="5964">Are scrolls and incantations your interest? You might wish to make yourself known at the Cloaktower, just outside Castle Never.</string>
<string name="5965">You look quick with a weapon. The Shining Knight Arms and Armor in the southeast City Core may have what you are looking for.</string>
<string name="5966">Not that I have ever been there, and any assumption that I have is merely the wildest of conjecture.</string>
<string name="5967">Ah, and If you wish to bolster yourself with a hireling, the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest is where the adventurers are gathering.</string>
<string name="5968">The City Core is where we are now and is one of the only districts where the plague has not made much headway.</string>
<string name="5969">Our more important institutions are located around Castle Never in the &quot;upper square,&quot; the center of Neverwinter&apos;s government.</string>
<string name="5970">The Beggar&apos;s Nest is where the Wailing first laid its claim upon the city and it remains the worst afflicted... Not that it had been pleasant before.</string>
<string name="5971">A friend of mine, a warehouser, says business is at a standstill there - The Wailing has left idle hands about, leading to mischief among the laborers. </string>
<string name="5972">The Blacklake district - My friends lived and now have died there... The militia won&apos;t let me attend the funeral, though they said they&apos;d pass on my regards.</string>
<string name="5973">But beyond my personal affection for my home, the Blacklake is where the best hope of beating the plague will arise... but that is not for your ears.</string>
<string name="5974">I have little interest in the Peninsula district&apos;s affairs. There is already too much to worry about without fretting over the inmates of its prison.</string>
<string name="5975">The edge of this district is full of rough-hewn establishments that, while they offer more variety, the quality of their goods and services is more often suspect.</string>
<string name="5976">Now there are even rumors of prisoners running free in the streets - You are better off leaving it alone.</string>
<string name="5977">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, I suppose I could say a little. It&apos;s not as though you will fully understand, anyway.</string>
<string name="5978">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I could mention a detail or two. It&apos;s not as though it hasn&apos;t been bandied about among my circle.</string>
<string name="5979">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I rather think not. Blacklake district will handle its own affairs, thank you.</string>
<string name="5980">You see, Blacklake will not fall to the plague quietly. There have been measures taken, stockpiling and... certain acquisitions... </string>
<string name="5981">I can&apos;t say much more, but my friends have not died in vain. They exposed themselves to the plague that other nobles in the Blacklake might survive.</string>
<string name="5982">Of course, I have heard nothing of suspects or leads. What are we coming to if the nobility cannot expect to be kept updated?</string>
<string name="5983">I need to ask a few questions.</string>
<string name="5984">You can answer questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="5985">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5986">Me want to know about different city areas.</string>
<string name="5987">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="5988">I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="5989">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="5990">You know anything about the bad plague?</string>
<string name="5991">Me wants information about places in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="5992">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="5993">What do you know about attempts at a cure?</string>
<string name="5994">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="5995">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You sound like you don&apos;t particularly like Aribeth.</string>
<string name="5996">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="5997">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="5998">We both &lt;race&gt; kind. What happening there?</string>
<string name="5999">Come on, we&apos;re both &lt;race&gt; kind. What&apos;s going on?</string>
<string name="6000">What are the different areas of the city?</string>
<string name="6001">Tell me about the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="6002">Tell me about the Docks district.</string>
<string name="6003">Tell me about the Blacklake district.</string>
<string name="6004">Tell me about the Peninsula district.</string>
<string name="6005">Where can I get equipment? </string>
<string name="6006">Where me get equipment?</string>
<string name="6007">Tell me about the City Core.</string>
<string name="6008">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, there must be more.</string>
<string name="6009">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You not saying everything.</string>
<string name="6010">You tells about City Core.</string>
<string name="6011">You tells about Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="6012">You tells about Docks district.</string>
<string name="6013">You tells about Blacklake.</string>
<string name="6014">You tells about Peninsula.</string>
<string name="6015">I need to ask about the other districts.</string>
<string name="6016">Me ask about other city places.</string>
<string name="6017">What were you told about the Waterdhavian creatues?</string>
<string name="6018">What you told about Water-doozian things?</string>
<string name="6019">Good morrow to you, citizen. Wait... are you a new recruit? Aye, they&apos;re replacing the ones we&apos;ve lost, are they?</string>
<string name="6020">Can I help you? I cannot be away from my duty for long. Wait... are you a new recruit? Aye, they&apos;re replacing the ones we&apos;ve lost... </string>
<string name="6021">You have my attention. Wait, you&apos;re one of the patchwork recruits, aren&apos;t you? Ahh, you&apos;re no substitute for experience.</string>
<string name="6022">Well I&apos;ll try to speak slowly for you. I&apos;ve seen smarter recruits, that&apos;s for sure - that said, the dumb aren&apos;t always the first to die... </string>
<string name="6023">Hmm, the more information you have, the less risk you&apos;ll pose to the rest of us on duty. I&apos;ll help if I can.</string>
<string name="6024">I know what I&apos;m told. Aribeth and her lot handle all the delicate stuff. We common guards keep the peace where we can and maintain the quarantine at all costs.</string>
<string name="6025">Not a thing. I was briefed on the Waterdhavian creatures, but nothing since. My life&apos;s on the line to keep the streets clear of rioters and looters.</string>
<string name="6026">The Wailing&apos;s brought out the worst in them. There&apos;s a panic for gold for some reason. Not sure why. The rich die too.</string>
<string name="6027">Anyway, not much happening in there now, though I&apos;m still losing men to the Wailing. We&apos;ll keep an eye on it though.</string>
<string name="6028">There&apos;s been word of a prison riot, though. Tyr only knows we&apos;ve never been able to instill fear in the inmates but maybe the Wailing finally has... </string>
<string name="6029">It&apos;s where the plague first appeared. The first few cases were ignored as a &quot;problem with the poor&quot; but now there&apos;s something else... </string>
<string name="6030">She handles city security on a big scale, reporting to Lord Nasher. She brings in people like you for special missions, leaving us for little things like, oh, restraining plague-maddened rioters.</string>
<string name="6031">Pardon me if I don&apos;t think she&apos;s more important than the dozens of us who have already been put to the torch thanks to the Wailing&apos;s touch!</string>
<string name="6032">We&apos;re scared, all right? You should be too! You want to throw yourself at whatever is in there, you go ahead. Good on you.</string>
<string name="6033">In fact, I think they were talking revolt for a while, but somebody put a stop to it. Was that you? My thanks go out to you if it was.</string>
<string name="6034">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Look, I&apos;m here to do my job and let you do yours. </string>
<string name="6035">Stay alive out there, recruit.</string>
<string name="6036">Well, you can&apos;t keep the peace without knowing where to keep it, can you? Sorry, it&apos;s an old guard joke my buddy used to tell before... nevermind.</string>
<string name="6037">With us gone, the different districts each hold their intrigues, I&apos;m sure. All I know is that we&apos;re fighting a losing battle, even here in the Core... </string>
<string name="6038">The city&apos;s always had Districts, but with the quarantine we&apos;ve been ordered to lock things down. As a result, each District has ended up handling things differently.</string>
<string name="6039">Which do you have questions about? There&apos;s the Beggar&apos;s Nest, the Docks, the Blacklake district, the Peninsula, and the City Core? You need to know them all.</string>
<string name="6040">All I hear is how bad things are getting, how many more men we&apos;ve lost. It&apos;s like a war, except you can&apos;t make the Wailing surrender.</string>
<string name="6041">There are several merchants in the City Core, but some are raising prices like there&apos;s no tomorrow. Of course, they might be right... </string>
<string name="6042">Make sure I don&apos;t catch you around the Moonstone Mask. It&apos;s in the west near the Peninsula exit. You kind of look the type... </string>
<string name="6043">You need nature-related supplies, don&apos;t you? You look the type. You should visit the Druid Tree in the City Core upper square east.</string>
<string name="6044">You look... I don&apos;t know, devout, I guess. You might want to check out the Temple of Tyr in the City Core upper square west.</string>
<string name="6045">You&apos;re a spell-tosser, aren&apos;t you? The Cloaktower is just outside Castle Never, and might have what you need.</string>
<string name="6046">You good with a weapon? Shining Knight Arms and Armor has the best gear - I shop there myself. They&apos;re in the southeast City Core.</string>
<string name="6047">They cater to the shady and the flamboyant. I suppose they do stock the odd thing that can&apos;t be had elsewhere... not legally, anyway.</string>
<string name="6048">And if you want someone to back you up, check the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest. Good people there.</string>
<string name="6049">The City Core is the business center, and is built around Castle Never. We&apos;ve been able to keep it largely free of the Wailing but not entirely... </string>
<string name="6050">It&apos;s also where we keep the tightest rule of law. This is true normally, but even more so now with the plague causing havoc.</string>
<string name="6051">The Beggar&apos;s Nest is hurting bad. There&apos;s a lot of poverty - I&apos;ve already lost three of my men to violence there and another eight to Wailing.</string>
<string name="6052">The Docks are a nightmare to patrol even at the best of times. There&apos;s dirty gold there. Not a lot of respect for the city guards.</string>
<string name="6053">Blacklake? Bunch of spoiled nobles. I don&apos;t think they&apos;ve had a good word for the guards in the history of the city. And there&apos;s those rumors... </string>
<string name="6054">People are saying the nobles stumbled on a cure and they won&apos;t share it with the rest of us. Probably not true, but it would be just like them.</string>
<string name="6055">The Peninsula holds the prison. There&apos;s a good number of staff that live in the area, as well as people on their way out. </string>
<string name="6056">Of course, with most of what remains of the militia here, the other Districts are suffering. Hopefully that&apos;s where you can help.</string>
<string name="6057">Captain Alaefin runs the place and I hope he&apos;s doing okay because he&apos;s one of the best the city has to offer... </string>
<string name="6058">Things went a little nuts for a while, but it&apos;s settling down. Maybe you had a hand in that. Good for you if you did.</string>
<string name="6059">You want to go poke your nose around... whatever&apos;s in the Beggar&apos;s Nest, you go right ahead. Make yourself a hero.</string>
<string name="6060">There&apos;s not much we can do. Muggers and bands of thugs have the run of the place now. I guess they won the war... </string>
<string name="6061">Nobody cared about the Beggar&apos;s Nest before and it&apos;s not vital we save it now. Just remember that I&apos;ve lost better men than you in there.</string>
<string name="6062">Look, this isn&apos;t what the guards signed on for. We keep the peace. We don&apos;t know anything about plague or... what come after.</string>
<string name="6063">Things are looking up, though. Somebody restored a semblance of order - Destroyed a whole infestation of undead. It sure makes our job a lot easier.</string>
<string name="6064">Maybe you had something to do with that? If so, thanks. It&apos;s been pretty quiet in there ever since.</string>
<string name="6065">People are barricading wherever they can, and there are even rumors of undead walking the streets. I&apos;m afraid there&apos;s not much the guards can do to help.</string>
<string name="6066">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Look, the guards are hired to keep the peace and maintain the quarantine. We&apos;re hunters of the living, not the dead.</string>
<string name="6067">I even heard something about them openly threatening some of my guards. If they don&apos;t fall in line, the whole place is going to hell.</string>
<string name="6068">I do know that those damned Helmites keep getting in our way, though. I swear, their blessings better do HALF of what they say.</string>
<string name="6069">I&apos;m not sure what all happened in there, but it seems to have calmed down now. Hell of a price to pay, though.</string>
<string name="6070">Captain Alaefin was a good man and my thanks go out to whoever put him out of his misery. The riots have finally calmed down, though.</string>
<string name="6071">That the caravan bringing them was attacked when it entered the city. Nobody knows what happened to them after that - scattered to the wind, I guess.</string>
<string name="6072">Well, nobody except you, maybe. I&apos;ve heard that you&apos;ve been making great strides finding them. Good on you. Better than most have done.</string>
<string name="6073">The cure attempt they were for is still up in the air, I guess. They don&apos;t tell me about details. They just said keep an eye out for them.</string>
<string name="6074">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="6075">Me want some informations.</string>
<string name="6076">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6077">Me want to know about different city areas.</string>
<string name="6078">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="6079">I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6080">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="6081">You know anything about the bad plague?</string>
<string name="6082">Me wants information about places in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6083">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="6084">What do you know about attempts at a cure?</string>
<string name="6085">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="6086">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you mean physically or spiritually?</string>
<string name="6087">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="6088">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="6089">What are the different areas of the city?</string>
<string name="6090">Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="6091">Docks district.</string>
<string name="6092">Blacklake district.</string>
<string name="6093">Peninsula.</string>
<string name="6094">Where can I get equipment? </string>
<string name="6095">Where me get equipment?</string>
<string name="6096">City Core.</string>
<string name="6097">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; What do you know about that?</string>
<string name="6098">You can tell me. We are &lt;race&gt; kin.</string>
<string name="6099">We both &lt;race&gt; kind. Why not tell me?</string>
<string name="6100">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You know anything abouts that?</string>
<string name="6101">I need to ask about the other districts.</string>
<string name="6102">Me ask about other city areas.</string>
<string name="6103">There&apos;s no replacement for family but you look like a friendly face... </string>
<string name="6104">What is it you need, then? I have worries of my own, you know... </string>
<string name="6105">Why my children, huh? Why couldn&apos;t the Wailing have taken someone like you, instead?</string>
<string name="6106">You want some informations? All right, dunce, all you have to do is ask.</string>
<string name="6107">I can spare a few moments. Perhaps the idle chatter will clear my thoughts.</string>
<string name="6108">I know I don&apos;t want to get it. The Wailing took my entire family, one after the other. I watched &apos;em die, every one - They shriveled up from the inside.</string>
<string name="6109">Bah, won&apos;t tell us &quot;simple people.&quot; They think we&apos;d panic if there was no hope or stampede if a cure was announced.</string>
<string name="6110">Last little while I&apos;ve heard the place is almost overrun with thieves, too. People seem to really need gold for something.</string>
<string name="6111">I suppose we are both &lt;race&gt;. Ah, all right. I don&apos;t know much anyway, so I&apos;m in the clear.</string>
<string name="6112">I ain&apos;t heard a single thing, and I probably won&apos;t. I&apos;m not sure whether it&apos;s a blessing or a curse but I&apos;m alive... </string>
<string name="6113">And don&apos;t think it&apos;s coincidence that the plague seemed to start in the Beggar&apos;s Nest, either! The rich needed an excuse to clear it out.</string>
<string name="6114">Would I know the difference? It&apos;s just that the eyes go dead long before a person stops moving... That&apos;s when the Wailing starts... </string>
<string name="6115">Maybe those Helmites are right. Maybe it&apos;s a wasting of the soul. Maybe the gods are mad at us... My question is how come I survived?</string>
<string name="6116">Maybe you heard about that, or maybe you had a part in it? I dunno, but the area seems much more calm... aside from the Wailing, of course.</string>
<string name="6117">I even heard they were trying to hoard food and part of a cure! Someone put a stop to it though.</string>
<string name="6118">I hear things are getting better though. There was some infighting or something, but now it&apos;s been settled. Less muggings too.</string>
<string name="6119">Thanks for the distraction from my troubles - I hope your kin don&apos;t fall prey the same as mine... </string>
<string name="6120">Neverwinter... This city was a good place once. Now it&apos;s nothing but burning bodies piled in the streets. I don&apos;t even have a family anymore.</string>
<string name="6121">You want to go poking around for stories, go right ahead. I&apos;m going to stay right here: in the street and out of trouble.</string>
<string name="6122">It&apos;s set out like an eye - the City Core, where we are now, is the pupil. Around it lie the other districts... Through it all runs the river, all fed by tears.</string>
<string name="6123">Do you want to hear about the Beggar&apos;s Nest? The Docks? The Blacklake? The Peninsula? The City Core? Take your pick - I have a lifetime, however short.</string>
<string name="6124">As if I care about anything else right now. I&apos;m scared to go home, to see the bodies. I&apos;m scared maybe I&apos;ll catch it too.</string>
<string name="6125">That would depend on what you are looking for. I suppose I could make my best guess at what you want.</string>
<string name="6126">You work a bit outside the law, maybe? Don&apos;t worry, my lips are sealed. I know somewhere that might interest you, though... </string>
<string name="6127">You one of them nature-talking forest-walkers, aren&apos;t you? I suppose you might visit the Druid Tree in the City Core upper square east.</string>
<string name="6128">You looking for a temple or something? You&apos;ll find what you want at the Temple of Tyr in the City Core upper square west.</string>
<string name="6129">You a spellcaster or something? There&apos;s lots of that sort of thing at the Cloaktower, just outside Castle Never.</string>
<string name="6130">You need a good blade or something? Shining Knight Arms and Armor in the southeast City Core has the best.</string>
<string name="6131">The Moonstone Mask near the Peninsula exit in the City Core west - They have all sorts of interesting things there.</string>
<string name="6132">And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest.</string>
<string name="6133">That&apos;s where we is now. Got all your basic services as such. Lots of different kinds of people make their home here... Less every day, mind you... </string>
<string name="6134">Castle Never is in the northeast - That&apos;s the upper square where all the &quot;informed elite&quot; do their business.</string>
<string name="6135">Beggar&apos;s Nest? Don&apos;t let anyone sour you on that place - Good honest poor people live and die there. Not like Blacklake or the Docks.</string>
<string name="6136">I used to do the occasional odd job in Docks district, but not any more. Didn&apos;t like working for pirates.</string>
<string name="6137">Bah! Bunch of stuck up nobles. The Wailing has them tied in knots - Kills them just the same as any commoner, and that fact drives &apos;em nuts.</string>
<string name="6138">Apparently they&apos;re even seizing resources meant for us poorer folk. My brother wouldn&apos;t have passed away so easy if he only had a little food in him.</string>
<string name="6139">You really don&apos;t know the city if you have to ask. Nobody wants to go to the Peninsula. That&apos;s where the prison is.</string>
<string name="6140">Myself, I usually find what I need around the outer edge. Of course, stock is down all over because of the Wailing.</string>
<string name="6141">The prison is usually run pretty strict, but I don&apos;t want to imagine what the plague has done to it.</string>
<string name="6142">Maybe that was you? Well, I&apos;m glad they got shook up. They deserved it and it quieted things down out there, too.</string>
<string name="6143">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m not actually a part of it, so I guess I&apos;m in the clear. Not that I know all that much.</string>
<string name="6144">Stay clear of the Docks. Losing your family is worry enough without losing your purse, too. The guards are no help neither.</string>
<string name="6145">See, the Blacklake nobles, and I don&apos;t know exactly who, are hoarding food. It&apos;s made them a lot of enemies. </string>
<string name="6146">Last I heard there was rioting because of them. Don&apos;t know how it turned out. Not my business. Being the last left of my family, I&apos;ve got other worries.</string>
<string name="6147">Things are a lot better, too. The Wailing&apos;s still rough, but someone cleared out some zombies or something that were causing trouble.</string>
<string name="6148">I hope none of them zombies were my family - Though if they were, I&apos;d like to thank whoever did the clearing for giving them their due rest... </string>
<string name="6149">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah, you won&apos;t understand anything anyway so I guess it&apos;s okay to tell you.</string>
<string name="6150">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s not for me to say. I&apos;m not involved and I don&apos;t know much, anyway. Being the last left of my family, I&apos;ve got other worries.</string>
<string name="6151">It&apos;s settled down a bit now. I guess there was some killings, and even the captain of the place died.</string>
<string name="6152">Not my business, but I&apos;m glad they sorted it out. You have something to do with that? Good on you if you did.</string>
<string name="6153">I even heard -but I ain&apos;t saying from who- that some prisoners and guards have been killed. Wonder what&apos;s going on in there... </string>
<string name="6154">Now there&apos;s even some zombies or something... I hope none of them are my family - I wouldn&apos;t want them to have to be like that.</string>
<string name="6155">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="6156">Me want some informations.</string>
<string name="6157">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6158">Me want to know about different city areas.</string>
<string name="6159">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="6160">I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6161">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="6162">You know anything about the bad plague?</string>
<string name="6163">Me wants information about places in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6164">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="6165">What do you know about attempts at a cure?</string>
<string name="6166">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="6167">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="6168">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="6169">What are the different areas of the city?</string>
<string name="6170">Talk about the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="6171">Talk about the Docks district.</string>
<string name="6172">Talk about the Blacklake district.</string>
<string name="6173">Talk about the Peninsula.</string>
<string name="6174">Where can I get equipment? </string>
<string name="6175">Where me get equipment?</string>
<string name="6176">Talk about the City Core.</string>
<string name="6177">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Shouldn&apos;t all help be welcome?</string>
<string name="6178">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Don&apos;t you want the other cure attempts to work?</string>
<string name="6179">Please. I&apos;m sure it will help.</string>
<string name="6180">Okay, maybe it help.</string>
<string name="6181">If you wish. I doubt it will do anything.</string>
<string name="6182">Whatever. It probably do nothing.</string>
<string name="6183">No, thank you.</string>
<string name="6184">Not for me, no.</string>
<string name="6185">I&apos;ll not have your useless blessing!</string>
<string name="6186">You keep your useless blessing thing!</string>
<string name="6187">I want to ask about the other city districts.</string>
<string name="6188">Me ask about other city places.</string>
<string name="6189">Is your temple accesible? I may need clerical services.</string>
<string name="6190">Your temple open for selling? Me sometimes need cleric stuff.</string>
<string name="6191">How long has the temple been closed?</string>
<string name="6192">You been closed for long time?</string>
<string name="6193">Can I ask you about Helm&apos;s Hold?</string>
<string name="6194">Me maybe ask about Helm&apos;s Hold?</string>
<string name="6195">Blessings upon you. Is there aught I can do for you?</string>
<string name="6196">Speak what ye will, friend. I will answer.</string>
<string name="6197">What would you make of my time? Speak quickly, for I have much to do.</string>
<string name="6198">I have nothing to improve the state of your mind, if that is what you require. I can, however, answer simple questions.</string>
<string name="6199">I will answer, though I am a newcomer too. Granting blessings in this time of plague has not left much time for exploration.</string>
<string name="6200">The Wailing pulls at the soul, spiritually tearing a victim apart from within. The blessings I give are small comfort, but comfort nonetheless.</string>
<string name="6201">Most are foolish sorcery, and none have proven effective. We Helmites under Desther are certain that only our blessings will deliver Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6202">There has also been much hoarding of gold. Muggings are rampant. I hope it does not harm the spirit of the people further.</string>
<string name="6203">Perhaps we could have prevented the events that befell the place. The loss of so many is a great tragedy.</string>
<string name="6204">People are reluctant at first, but the more the plague strikes at them, the more they abandon such things and seek what we offer.</string>
<string name="6205">It was thought the plague could be contained there, but even as we try to calm people, the Wailing follows soon after.</string>
<string name="6206">The blessings will accomplish this. Other actions can certainly follow, but care must be taken not to do more harm than good.</string>
<string name="6207">We Helmites will do what is necessary. Our blessings will deliver the city. You will see.</string>
<string name="6208">I have heard that the undead that were roaming the area are calmed now. Not that people should endanger themselves facing such things... </string>
<string name="6209">They hoarded resources away from the poorer of Neverwinter&apos;s citizens. Someone has, however, put a stop to it.</string>
<string name="6210">I hear, however, that the area is quite calm now. I hope no one was foolishly put at risk by rash action. </string>
<string name="6211">As you will. Would you like a blessing as you go?</string>
<string name="6212">Hmm... I have only just acquainted myself with the city, but I will assist you if I can.</string>
<string name="6213">Don&apos;t waste your time following conjecture. You should be more concerned about your spiritual well-being.</string>
<string name="6214">There are several districts dividing the city. The division has apparently slowed the plague, but it divides people as well.</string>
<string name="6215">I believe the different regions are the Beggar&apos;s Nest, the Docks, the Blacklake district, the Peninsula, and the City Core.</string>
<string name="6216">No, not really. Of course, I busy myself with concern for the plagued, and do not worry about petty scandal.</string>
<string name="6217">I know little of these things. I need only my blessings. Still, I believe there are a few establishments that have what you want.</string>
<string name="6218">I have seen a number of characters enter the Moonstone Mask in the central west. I gather they cater to the stealthy.</string>
<string name="6219">Are you a servant of nature? There is a Druid Tree in the City Core upper square east, though I am unfamiliar with them.</string>
<string name="6220">Our Helmite Temple is closed while we continue our blessings. The Temple of Tyr in the City Core upper square west will assist you.</string>
<string name="6221">If you know of arcane magic, the Cloak Tower may assist you. It is just outside Castle Never.</string>
<string name="6222">If you are a master of weapons, the Shining Knight Arms and Armor in the southeast City Core seem to be well-stocked.</string>
<string name="6223">Not that I truly know anything of the place. I merely mention it as a courtesy. Better you avoid it, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="6224">I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southwest, but I would avoid it.</string>
<string name="6225">Ah, the spiritual and governmental center. We Helmites have established a small temple here, with Desther as our guide.</string>
<string name="6226">We are not far from Castle Never, and serve as advisors in all the major institutions. Not all heed our words, but they will in time.</string>
<string name="6227">The Beggar&apos;s Nest? Our blessings are a comfort, but have been unable to lessen the impact of the Wailing in the district. </string>
<string name="6228">The Docks are a haven for lawlessness, even in this otherwise dark time. Thankfully my brethren have been mostly left to do their good work.</string>
<string name="6229">Blacklake is the home of the nobility, a group that I am sorry to say has not borne the weight of these times in a distinguished manner.</string>
<string name="6230">It is possible they are even hoarding resources meant for the poorer Districts. Hopefully no one inflames the situation.</string>
<string name="6231">The Peninsula is where the prison is located. Try as we might, we Helmites have not been allowed much access within.</string>
<string name="6232">There are many shops around the outer District edge as well, though I haven&apos;t seen what they hold. I haven&apos;t had the time.</string>
<string name="6233">Hopefully my brethren in the area have continued their blessings and the spirit of that has found a way within to some degree.</string>
<string name="6234">I&apos;m not sure I approve, as the potential for loss of life was high, but I suppose these things must be done.</string>
<string name="6235">Especially now, as I have heard that contact with the great fortress has been sporadic. The proper authorities will need time to sort things out.</string>
<string name="6236">I would avoid the Docks, friend. Let we Helmites administer our blessings and calm the situation in our gentle way.</string>
<string name="6237">Now I fear there is an unforseen threat of undead in the District. Leave it to the Helmites, my friend. Do not endanger yourself there.</string>
<string name="6238">I hope no further rash action is taken. The gentle blessings of we Helmites should be allowed to take precedence. Spirits must be healed.</string>
<string name="6239">Certainly, but in the proper perspective. The plague will fall not to brute force, but to the growth of hope within the people.</string>
<string name="6240">Everyone seeks the end of the plague. We under Desther merely believe that our methods will bring the swiftest resolution.</string>
<string name="6241">In the end, I think people will look back and realize the importance of the role we played, even if they cannot see it now.</string>
<string name="6242">As you will. Good luck to you.</string>
<string name="6243">The blessings of we Helmites upon you. May it deliver you beyond the plague.</string>
<string name="6244">Which in particular interests you?</string>
<string name="6245">Ah, normally we of the faithful would not object to showing you around, but I fear that our temple is currently closed to the public.</string>
<string name="6246">You see... ah... Although we treat the sick without hesitation, we can&apos;t risk contaminating our blessing pools. We must keep the temple secure.</string>
<string name="6247">Well, I accompanied Desther from Helm&apos;s Hold shortly after the plague began. He wisely decided to close it soon after we arrived.</string>
<string name="6248">It is a shame, but necessary. Most of the Helmites that were here previously fell to the plague. All that remain now are we that arrived with Desther.</string>
<string name="6249">Oh, I am not an authority on the place. I mean, I am a Helmite, of course, but my time in the Hold was limited.</string>
<string name="6250">Besides, it is days away and hardly worth considering. There is so much here that deserves our attention. Do you require anything else?</string>
<string name="6251">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="6252">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="6253">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6254">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="6255">Have you heard anything about strange animals in the area?</string>
<string name="6256">Can you tell me what&apos;s going on in this area?</string>
<string name="6257">What you know &apos;bout plague? Anything?</string>
<string name="6258">You hear &apos;bout weird animals around here?</string>
<string name="6259">What go on around here?</string>
<string name="6260">Do you know anything else about it?</string>
<string name="6261">You knows something else maybe?</string>
<string name="6262">Maybe you&apos;ve heard of something of interest?</string>
<string name="6263">I&apos;d be interested in work, if you know of anything.</string>
<string name="6264">Are there any places of interest in the core I should visit?</string>
<string name="6265">Maybe you hears something interesting?</string>
<string name="6266">Me want work.</string>
<string name="6267">You know good places to go here?</string>
<string name="6268">So you haven&apos;t heard about any animals in this area?</string>
<string name="6269">So you not hear about animals &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="6270">I&apos;m investigating the plague. Perhaps you could tell me more about it.</string>
<string name="6271">Me look into plague. Maybe you know more?</string>
<string name="6272">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="6273">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="6274">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="6275">Neverwinter big place. Me need directions.</string>
<string name="6276">Aren&apos;t you in danger of becoming infected yourself?</string>
<string name="6277">Where are all these dead people coming from?</string>
<string name="6278">This can&apos;t be a pleasant task for you.</string>
<string name="6279">You not in danger of catching plague here?</string>
<string name="6280">Where the dead come from?</string>
<string name="6281">This not a nice job, huh?</string>
<string name="6282">You believe you&apos;ll see your family again when you die?</string>
<string name="6283">You&apos;re a fool to take such a risk.</string>
<string name="6284">I hope you&apos;re right. That you&apos;ll see your family.</string>
<string name="6285">May the gods watch over you, brother. May they watch over us all.</string>
<string name="6286">You thinks you see family again when you dies?</string>
<string name="6287">You&apos;se a fool to think that.</string>
<string name="6288">Me hope you&apos;se right, that you sees family again.</string>
<string name="6289">May gods watch over you, brother. May gods watch us all.</string>
<string name="6290">Uh-huh. Let me ask you something else.</string>
<string name="6291">Uhhh... me ask you other question now.</string>
<string name="6292">Let me ask you something else, then.</string>
<string name="6293">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="6294">I urge you to keep away from these bodies, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. There is a risk of contagion, I understand.</string>
<string name="6295">May Helm watch over you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="6296">May Ilmater have mercy on us all.</string>
<string name="6297">Begone and leave me to my grim task.</string>
<string name="6298">Questions, is it? Helm grant me patience.</string>
<string name="6299">I suppose there&apos;s no harm in chatting a bit. Do mind the bodies, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Try not to breath the fumes directly... ugh... it&apos;s disgusting... </string>
<string name="6300">I&apos;ll answer what I can. Just keep back from the pile, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Try not to breath the fumes directly... ugh... it&apos;s disgusting... </string>
<string name="6301">Speak quickly, then. I&apos;m not in the mood to be interrogated. Try not to breath the fumes of the burning pile directly... ugh... it&apos;s disgusting... </string>
<string name="6302">Besides the obvious? The Wailing Death can&apos;t be cured by the gods, it seems. None of them clerics&apos; blessings do a thing.</string>
<string name="6303">Animals? That sounds familiar. I heard something about some animals arriving from Waterdeep, but nothing more beyond that.</string>
<string name="6304">The Wailing Death is going on, fool. Ahhh, don&apos;t mind me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. The core is no place for any sane man to be these days.</string>
<string name="6305">Do you have a speech impediment? Oh, nevermind.</string>
<string name="6306">There&apos;s no work that I know of, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Maybe you could check at the Trade of Blades or Castle Never... but I doubt anyone is hiring.</string>
<string name="6307">Interesting? I can&apos;t think of a single thing that holds any interest for me anymore. Nothing except maybe trying to save the souls that are left alive here.</string>
<string name="6308">Well I suppose that&apos;s about as direct as one can get.</string>
<string name="6309">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="6310">I really can&apos;t think of anything else to add to that, sorry.</string>
<string name="6311">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="6312">*Sigh* Look at what I do, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Very few people care to talk to me at length, if at all. Maybe you&apos;d have more luck asking these things at a local tavern.</string>
<string name="6313">Is there something else you wanted, then?</string>
<string name="6314">Stand back, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. All of these poor souls are victims of the plague.</string>
<string name="6315">Keep back, fool, or risk catching the Wailing Death yourself.</string>
<string name="6316">Everyone knows something about the plague. Half of it isn&apos;t true and the other half is rumor. I&apos;m not sure I can add much to it all.</string>
<string name="6317">I am not from this district. Nor would I be inclined to point your way, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, even if I were. Ask someone else for aid.</string>
<string name="6318">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="6319">I suppose it wouldn&apos;t occur to you to buy a map, now, would it?</string>
<string name="6320">I am. If I fall, I will be far from the first amongst the city guard to do so. All I can ask is that Helm watch over me and protect me from this evil.</string>
<string name="6321">These? These are all plague victims, of course. Many of the fools tried to gain access to the City Core and died at the quarantine gates.</string>
<string name="6322">Some of them are locals, however. The Wailing Death has come to the core, despite our efforts. I expect things will only get worse before they get better.</string>
<string name="6323">It seems a shame to burn these poor souls, to not even give them a decent burial. We have no choice, however. Ilmater help us, no choice at all.</string>
<string name="6324">Far from it. The Wailing Death has already taken my wife and my only son from me, however. &apos;Tis not as if it can get any worse, for me.</string>
<string name="6325">If I catch the plague here, it won&apos;t be so bad. At least I&apos;d see my family again. There are other guards that still have folks to live for.</string>
<string name="6326">I can only hope so. The Helmites say so... but, then, Helm isn&apos;t answering them anymore, is he? Maybe there is nothing better.</string>
<string name="6327">Maybe so, but it&apos;s my risk to take. Maybe I just don&apos;t care what happens to me anymore, if that&apos;s all right with you.</string>
<string name="6328">I hope so, too. The Helmites say that&apos;s the way of it, but Helm isn&apos;t answering their calls. Maybe the gods have abandoned us finally.</string>
<string name="6329">Bless you for your kindness. I have the feeling that no one&apos;s watching over us, anymore, though.</string>
<string name="6330">*Sigh* I&apos;m sorry. Was there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="6331">Makes you think maybe the gods have abandoned us, doesn&apos;t it? Makes you think worse is coming. Makes you think winter is coming, even.</string>
<string name="6332">No doubt it&apos;s something for the others in the city guard to worry about. In this post, they don&apos;t tell me much.</string>
<string name="6333">No. Nothing that would interest you, I&apos;m sure. Perhaps you should ask at the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="6334">The Mask is a bordello, to be sure, but it&apos;s where all the folk are crowding these days. Poor souls looking for a bit of joy in all this bleakness.</string>
<string name="6335">Me, I haven&apos;t the stomach for it. I&apos;ll die soon enough, to be sure.</string>
<string name="6336">What would you wish to know?</string>
<string name="6337">Stand back. These bodies carry the plague.</string>
<string name="6338">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="6339">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="6340">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6341">Do you know anything about what causes it?</string>
<string name="6342">Have you heard anything about strange animals in the area?</string>
<string name="6343">Is there anything going on in this area of the city?</string>
<string name="6344">You know how you gets it?</string>
<string name="6345">You hear &apos;bout weird animals around here?</string>
<string name="6346">What go on &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="6347">Anything else you can tell me?</string>
<string name="6348">You knows something else maybe?</string>
<string name="6349">Maybe you&apos;ve heard of something of interest?</string>
<string name="6350">I&apos;d be interested in work, if you know of anything.</string>
<string name="6351">Maybe you hears something interesting?</string>
<string name="6352">Me want work.</string>
<string name="6353">Could you tell me anything about the plague?</string>
<string name="6354">You know &apos;bout plague, maybe?</string>
<string name="6355">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="6356">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="6357">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="6358">Neverwinter big place. Me need directions.</string>
<string name="6359">Why are you out here on the street? You&apos;re sick, you should be inside somewhere.</string>
<string name="6360">How has the plague affected your trade?</string>
<string name="6361">Why you out here on street? You sick, should be inside.</string>
<string name="6362">Plague make your trade very bad, yeah?</string>
<string name="6363">Let me ask you something else, then.</string>
<string name="6364">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="6365">A gold or two? For you? You must be joking.</string>
<string name="6366">Golds? For you? You is joking, ha ha!</string>
<string name="6367">Err... about those sores... </string>
<string name="6368">You haves sores. You gots plague, no?</string>
<string name="6369">Why wouldn&apos;t you go to the Moonstone Mask?</string>
<string name="6370">Why not Moonstone Mask?</string>
<string name="6371">But you certainly don&apos;t need the coin if, ah... </string>
<string name="6372">You not need coin if you going to, umm... </string>
<string name="6373">You have the plague?! Get away from me!!</string>
<string name="6374">You has plague?! Get away!!</string>
<string name="6375">Waste coin on you? I think not.</string>
<string name="6376">I have nothing to give.</string>
<string name="6377">Here... take a gold piece.</string>
<string name="6378">Take this: 100 gp. Go and find someplace warm tonight, and rest.</string>
<string name="6379">Waste coin? Me thinks not.</string>
<string name="6380">Me has nothing to give.</string>
<string name="6381">Here... you take gold piece.</string>
<string name="6382">Take this: 100 gp. You go and finds someplace warm, and rest.</string>
<string name="6383">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Ignore her]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="6384">I could offer you mercy. A quick and painless death.</string>
<string name="6385">Me can give mercy. Quick death, no pain.</string>
<string name="6386">Aye, now... how about a lad like yourself takes a lass like me for an evening o&apos; pleasure? Only a gold or two, no more.</string>
<string name="6387">I... a workin&apos; girl does not normally beg t&apos; make her keep, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... but these ain&apos;t no normal times. Could you spare some kindness, mayhap?</string>
<string name="6388">Aye, begone, churl.</string>
<string name="6389">Questions, is it? Helm grant me patience.</string>
<string name="6390">Oh, certainly, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. That&apos;s how I get my gold, after all. Answering questions.</string>
<string name="6391">Oh, fine, fine. It&apos;s not like the gold is leaping into my lap today, after all.</string>
<string name="6392">Followed by a dagger to my belly, no doubt. Oh, go ahead, already.</string>
<string name="6393">Naw. We working girls deal with sickness plenty enough, but this ain&apos;t got nothing to do with that. The sickness is in the air, an&apos; there ain&apos;t no one who&apos;s immune.</string>
<string name="6394">Strange animals? You mean beasts? No, I&apos;ve heard nothin&apos; about any beasts in these parts.</string>
<string name="6395">There&apos;s always things going on in the core. Most of it is out o&apos; reach of my ears, however, except maybe the urgent whisperings of dyin&apos; men.</string>
<string name="6396">Do you have a speech impediment? Oh, nevermind.</string>
<string name="6397">Nobody&apos;s spending coin, so nobody&apos;s hiring. Except maybe at the Moonstone... but even there probably not.</string>
<string name="6398">Well I suppose that&apos;s about as direct as one can get.</string>
<string name="6399">Oh, I suppose there&apos;s work to be had. There&apos;s all kinds of things people need doin&apos;, especially with a city in chaos. Nothing that reaches my ears, however.</string>
<string name="6400">Nope. Wait around some, you&apos;ll learn all you wants to an&apos; more, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="6401">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="6402">Is there something else you wanted, then?</string>
<string name="6403">What do you need, girl? I have to work, yet, for a gold or so... lest I sleep in the street again an&apos; catch the plague myself.</string>
<string name="6404">I can tells you plenty about the plague. From personal experience, in fact. Anything specific you wanted to know, aye?</string>
<string name="6405">Go on, now, I don&apos;t have time to give directions when you could just find things yourself. Ask a guard, it&apos;ll keep them busy and away from me.</string>
<string name="6406">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="6407">I suppose it wouldn&apos;t occur to you to buy a map, now, would it?</string>
<string name="6408">Inside where? When you has the plague, nobody wants to take you in. You ain&apos;t got no family, even. And I ain&apos;t settin&apos; foot in the Moonstone Mask, no way.</string>
<string name="6409">Hah! You&apos;d think it would be bad, that us girls would find nary a customer in all of Neverwinter who&apos;d lie with us for a night, aye? Not at all, says I.</string>
<string name="6410">The souls in this city, they all thinks they&apos;re going to die. Convinced of it, they are. So they pile together in the Moonstone Mask, lookin&apos; for a last bit of joy.</string>
<string name="6411">An&apos; they look even for me. There&apos;s folks with the Wailing Death... they ain&apos;t deserved it none. They want a bit o&apos; joy, just the same... and I won&apos;t be turning them away none.</string>
<string name="6412">The girls at the Moonstone, they don&apos;t seem t&apos; get the plague none. Could be the matron mother just hides it real well. More like, &apos;n fact.</string>
<string name="6413">If you&apos;re tellin&apos; me that there&apos;s beasts roaming about the core... well, I don&apos;t want to hear none of it. There&apos;s enough death comin&apos; for you in the nights as it is.</string>
<string name="6414">Depends. You could go to Castle Never, t&apos;is interesting enough. Send them me love, if you would.</string>
<string name="6415">Walk around, if ye wish. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find all sorts to interest you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="6416">What would you wish to know?</string>
<string name="6417">Oh, aye, aye. I&apos;ve got the plague or something just as good, an&apos; you don&apos;t. You may wag your finger at me, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, but I ain&apos;t dead yet.</string>
<string name="6418">So is there something you actually wanted, then, or are ye just going to stare?</string>
<string name="6419">Hmph. I don&apos;t like the matron mother none, that Ophala Cheldarstorn. Something not right with her, I says.</string>
<string name="6420">That an&apos; the Moonstone has too many rules. No, no, the only place for me is out on th&apos; streets. That way, when I die, I ain&apos;t far from the pile over yonder.</string>
<string name="6421">If I&apos;m going to die, is that it? Yes, I&apos;m going to die. But I got me babes, an&apos; they ain&apos;t sick. They going to be orphans, soon.</string>
<string name="6422">That&apos;ll be bad enough, for them. I&apos;m going to give &apos;em what I can, before the Wailing Death takes me. Nothin&apos; else I can do.</string>
<string name="6423">Aye. I&apos;ll be going away soon enough, no need to rush. Move along with ye, rabbit.</string>
<string name="6424">Then begone, cruel &lt;lord/lady&gt;. May the plague take ye, too.</string>
<string name="6425">I... no. No, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I thank you, but &apos;tis not my time just yet.</string>
<string name="6426">Then leave me be and go on yer ways.</string>
<string name="6427">Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, you are most gracious and kind. My babes will eat tonight, thanks to you.</string>
<string name="6428">I... you are too kind, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! Bless you, bless your heart! My babes... my babes will live, once I&apos;m gone. Bless you!!</string>
<string name="6429">Back again, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? You should really not be hangin&apos; about me so much... I *am* ill with the Wailing Death, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="6430">Oh, certainly, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="6431">*Sigh* Nothing to live for. May as well spend my last gold on a few nights of fun.</string>
<string name="6432">Hey, now, don&apos;t butt your way in line. We all get our turn with the girls.</string>
<string name="6433">Stay away from me! You never know who has the plague!</string>
<string name="6434">Just came down from one of the rooms, did you?</string>
<string name="6435">Err... you&apos;re a bit eager to get the festivities started, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="6436">Poor soul lost everything, I see. Have a brother who ended up the same way.</string>
<string name="6437">You can&apos;t come in here wounded like that!</string>
<string name="6438">Ahhh! It&apos;s a plague victim, spouting blood everywhere!</string>
<string name="6439">Get away from me! Under all that blood you probably have the Wailing Death!</string>
<string name="6440">Do you work for Ophala? I hear she has some simpleton guards, she does.</string>
<string name="6441">Hmph. Funny how the lackwits never get the plague, but the good ones die off.</string>
<string name="6442">Don&apos;t come near me! You were probably stricken dumb by the plague!</string>
<string name="6443">You needn&apos;t brandish your weapon here, &lt;mister/missus&gt;.</string>
<string name="6444">Stop waving that about, will you, &lt;mister/missus&gt;? You&apos;re making me nervous.</string>
<string name="6445">Ophala will kick you out of here if you keep walking around with that unsheathed.</string>
<string name="6446">Get lost, holy &lt;man/woman&gt;! We don&apos;t need your kind here!</string>
<string name="6447">If you holy folk were any good, your gods would listen to you and heal us!</string>
<string name="6448">Hmph. Awfully strange place for a holy &lt;man/woman&gt; like yourself, no?</string>
<string name="6449">Miss Ophala doesn&apos;t appreciate spell-casting around here, so keep it to yourself.</string>
<string name="6450">Magic caused the plague. My cousin told me that for sure.</string>
<string name="6451">Why don&apos;t you just go back to wherever you came from, magic-user?</string>
<string name="6452">Oh! It&apos;s not often I encounter &lt;race&gt; kin in these parts. How do you do?</string>
<string name="6453">It&apos;s always a delight to see another &lt;race&gt; face around here.</string>
<string name="6454">Be wary of the humans in this town. If they don&apos;t think you started the plague, they&apos;ll claim &lt;race&gt; soup is the cure.</string>
<string name="6455">Hello, miss. Err... you&apos;re one of Ophala&apos;s girls, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="6456">I gots four gold. Care to make a deal, miss? Five? Six?</string>
<string name="6457">They say Miss Ophala keeps her girls plague-free... and I must admit, you sure do look healthy.</string>
<string name="6458">You&apos;ve come to a good place. Ophala keeps her girls free of the plague, I hear.</string>
<string name="6459">They brought in something from Waterdeep that was supposed to cure us, but it&apos;s been lost, I hear. Too bad.</string>
<string name="6460">Might as well have some fun before the Wailing Death takes us, you know what I mean?</string>
<string name="6461">The gods have abandoned us. The Helmites can&apos;t even cure the plague with their blessings, you know that?</string>
<string name="6462">You just get lost, now! Don&apos;t need no plague spread to the fine girls, here.</string>
<string name="6463">You&apos;re here to have some fun, too, &apos;fore the Wailing Death takes you, hey?</string>
<string name="6464">I didn&apos;t know they let barbarians into the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="6465">You mean they actually allow uncultured barbarians to walk around here?</string>
<string name="6466">Hmph. You barbarians probably brought this plague with you from the mountains.</string>
<string name="6467">Wonderful. Another of you &lt;race&gt; people in the city. Funny how you folk don&apos;t seem to catch the plague none... </string>
<string name="6468">Keep away from me! You &lt;race&gt; kind have the plague, everyone knows that!</string>
<string name="6469">Hmmm. Someone told me that &lt;race&gt; blood cured the plague. You heard o&apos; that?</string>
<string name="6470">You can have a turn when I&apos;m done here.</string>
<string name="6471">I&apos;m busy with the girls, here, can&apos;t you see that?</string>
<string name="6472">Get away from me! You have the look of the plague about you!</string>
<string name="6473">Get lost, ya naked imp!</string>
<string name="6474">Get back in yer room and put some clothes on, for Ilmater&apos;s sake!</string>
<string name="6475">One of the girls kick you out, did she?</string>
<string name="6476">You can&apos;t wave about a weapon up here, are you mad?!</string>
<string name="6477">Stop waving that about and go away!</string>
<string name="6478">You&apos;re going to frighten everyone, waving that about!</string>
<string name="6479">Excuse me, but I&apos;m trying to conduct some business.</string>
<string name="6480">You&apos;ll have to talk to Miss Ophala, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="6481">Go throw yourself on a midden heap, already.</string>
<string name="6482">I&apos;m busy conducting some business, so I&apos;ll thank you not to interrupt.</string>
<string name="6483">Go away! I&apos;m busy here, can&apos;t you see that?</string>
<string name="6484">Don&apos;t interrupt me!!</string>
<string name="6485">Get lost. We don&apos;t need no &lt;race&gt; kind up here.</string>
<string name="6486">Don&apos;t interrupt me, &lt;race&gt; one.</string>
<string name="6487">I&apos;m conducting some business, &lt;race&gt; jerk, can&apos;t you see that?</string>
<string name="6488">Please don&apos;t interrupt, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. We&apos;re trying to conduct some business.</string>
<string name="6489">Hello, I&apos;m rather busy right now. Sorry.</string>
<string name="6490">I don&apos;t have time for your like. You&apos;ll wait your turn.</string>
<string name="6491">(giggle!) A little eager to begin, are we?</string>
<string name="6492">You can&apos;t run around like *that*! Miss Ophala will have a fit!</string>
<string name="6493">Awww, poor baby lost &lt;his/her&gt; clothes in a game of chance, did &lt;he/she&gt;?</string>
<string name="6494">You can&apos;t wave your weapons about like that. Stop it.</string>
<string name="6495">Put your weapons away right now, or I&apos;ll call Miss Ophala!</string>
<string name="6496">(giggle!) Is that a weapon you&apos;re waving about or are you just happy to see me?</string>
<string name="6497">My my. Yet *another* holy &lt;man/woman&gt;. Must be my lucky day.</string>
<string name="6498">You know, you holy folk can&apos;t just butt into line like this.</string>
<string name="6499">Why, *hello* there, &lt;brother/sister&gt;... </string>
<string name="6500">Sorry, we don&apos;t service magic-users here.</string>
<string name="6501">Go away, wizard, or I&apos;ll call Miss Ophala.</string>
<string name="6502">We don&apos;t want any of your spells here. You&apos;d best leave.</string>
<string name="6503">I don&apos;t recognize you. You aren&apos;t one of my sisters here, are you?</string>
<string name="6504">Hey! Miss Ophala doesn&apos;t let no private girls in here, you know!</string>
<string name="6505">What are you doing up here, girl? Best go back downstairs.</string>
<string name="6506">My, my. Hello there, handsome.</string>
<string name="6507">Ignore this peasant man, sir. I&apos;ll give you a discount... </string>
<string name="6508">You haven&apos;t found another girl already, have you? I&apos;m your lass... </string>
<string name="6509">You&apos;re new to the Mask, aren&apos;t you? Well, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll like it... </string>
<string name="6510">*Sigh* Business has been a little *too* busy since the plague hit, you know what I mean... ?</string>
<string name="6511">You&apos;ll have to wait your turn.</string>
<string name="6512">I don&apos;t know how Ophala keeps us free of the sickness, but she does.</string>
<string name="6513">Oh, by the gods! Must all the dregs of society come in here?</string>
<string name="6514">Go away, you plague-ridden filth!</string>
<string name="6515">Hmmm. I charge &lt;race&gt; kind extra, you know.</string>
<string name="6516">Please stay away. I was told &lt;race&gt; kind carry the plague!</string>
<string name="6517">Miss Ophala let another of your &lt;race&gt; kind come up here?</string>
<string name="6518">Ye seems amiable enough... but we ain&apos;t hiring new hands until this whole business is over with.</string>
<string name="6519">We ain&apos;t hiring new hands. Be off with ye.</string>
<string name="6520">Get lost. I&apos;ve no wish to talk to the likes of ye.</string>
<string name="6521">Ha ha! Just come out of th&apos; Moonstone Mask, did ya? Lose something?</string>
<string name="6522">Lost yer shirt at the gambling table, I see. Ha ha!</string>
<string name="6523">Yer not some naked plague victim, are ya? Get away, already!</string>
<string name="6524">What are you doing, running in here getting blood all over the place?!</string>
<string name="6525">You&apos;re bloody injured! Or are you some plague victim? Out! Get out!!</string>
<string name="6526">Must have been some fight, by the look of ye.</string>
<string name="6527">I had a cousin slow like ye. He were a mercenary, too... but he drowned in a puddle.</string>
<string name="6528">I&apos;ve no time for simpletons. We&apos;re not hiring, anyway.</string>
<string name="6529">What? Has the bloody plague stricken ye dumb?</string>
<string name="6530">Don&apos;t walk around with yer weapon out unless ye means to use it.</string>
<string name="6531">You keep wavin&apos; that about, and you&apos;ll be in for a world of hurt, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="6532">Sheathe it, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, or ye&apos;ll just cause trouble.</string>
<string name="6533">Ye holy folk should stay in the church for all the bloody good ye&apos;re doing.</string>
<string name="6534">And why haven&apos;t yer gods done anything about this plague, eh?</string>
<string name="6535">Haven&apos;t seen a holy &lt;man/woman&gt; in these parts since the Helmites run off.</string>
<string name="6536">If yer smart, magic-user, ye&apos;ll keep yer spells well-hidden.</string>
<string name="6537">Don&apos;t suppose you wizardly folk can do anything about this plague? Hmph, thought not.</string>
<string name="6538">Sorry, we ain&apos;t hiring wizards. Off with ye.</string>
<string name="6539">Yer a mighty fine-lookin&apos; wench. Just wander over from the Moonstone Mask, did ya?</string>
<string name="6540">Let&apos;s find us a quiet corner and I&apos;ll make a woman out of ya, lass. Ha ha!</string>
<string name="6541">Yer pretty enough, but probably diseased like every other git in this city.</string>
<string name="6542">Best be careful the Wailing Death doesn&apos;t catch ya, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="6543">I&apos;d invite ye to join us, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, but there&apos;s hardly room.</string>
<string name="6544">Now this is a sorry state. Can&apos;t leave the city, an&apos; can&apos;t do anything while we&apos;re here. &apos;Cept wait for the Wailing Death to take us.</string>
<string name="6545">Don&apos;t stand so close. Ya never know who gots the Wailing Death, &apos;til it&apos;s too late.</string>
<string name="6546">We wouldn&apos;t hire yer like even if our pockets were full of gold... which they ain&apos;t.</string>
<string name="6547">Don&apos;t come near me! Don&apos;t know who might have the plague, an ye looks like a fine candidate.</string>
<string name="6548">You barbarians are all the same. Smell like ye just woke up in a bear&apos;s bowels.</string>
<string name="6549">We got no room for barbarians &apos;round here. Go back to yer mountains.</string>
<string name="6550">Ye looks like ye can handle your weapon, barbarian, but we ain&apos;t hiring.</string>
<string name="6551">We ain&apos;t never hired no &lt;race&gt; kind before, so get lost.</string>
<string name="6552">I got better things to do then be chatted up by some &lt;race&gt; fool.</string>
<string name="6553">You best be careful. There&apos;s some folks who think that your &lt;race&gt; kin caused the plague.</string>
<string name="6554">I needed to ask a few questions.</string>
<string name="6555">Can you maybe answer questions for me?</string>
<string name="6556">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6557">Can you tell me anything about Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="6558">What can you tell me about Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="6559">Can you tell me anything about my duties?</string>
<string name="6560">You tells me about Lady Aribeth? Who she?</string>
<string name="6561">You tells me stuff about Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="6562">You maybe know what me supposed to do?</string>
<string name="6563">What she do? Why she in charge?</string>
<string name="6564">Who is she to claim authority over me?</string>
<string name="6565">What is her position? Why is she in charge?</string>
<string name="6566">Why she think she boss of me?</string>
<string name="6567">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="6568">Could you at least say if it&apos;s pointless charity work?</string>
<string name="6569">You maybe say if it be stupid charity work?</string>
<string name="6570">I want to ask something different.</string>
<string name="6571">Well met. I assume you are a new recruit of the Neverwinter militia? You look like you will be a fine addition.</string>
<string name="6572">Greetings to you. I assume you are new addition to the Neverwinter Militia? You&apos;ll prove adequate, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="6573">Hello. You are a new recruit for the Neverwinter Militia, correct? I suppose we must make do with whatever help we can get.</string>
<string name="6574">I will try, but only so this remedial instruction is addressed before bothering Lady Aribeth with it. You are meant to deal with her exclusively.</string>
<string name="6575">I&apos;ll answer what I can, but Lady Aribeth is better informed about these matters.</string>
<string name="6576">Lady Aribeth will inform you of anything you need to know. I am merely to direct you to speak with her.</string>
<string name="6577">Another time, and be sure to present any questions you have to Lady Aribeth. She is in the next room.</string>
<string name="6578">I&apos;m sorry, I am merely supposed to direct you to Lady Aribeth. Anything else you will have to investigate on your own.</string>
<string name="6579">Aribeth will clarify what is required of you. I couldn&apos;t add anything to what she might say.</string>
<string name="6580">New recruits of the city militia should report to Lady Aribeth as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="6581">If you have already spoken with Lady Aribeth, I&apos;m not sure I have much of value to add. You should address your concerns with her. </string>
<string name="6582">I would advise that you speak with Lady Aribeth as soon as possible. She will brief you on what is required of you.</string>
<string name="6583">I assume from your tone that you will want the opportunity for profit? I understand. Not everyone joins out of the goodness of their heart.</string>
<string name="6584">I am sure you will find what you require. I don&apos;t approve, but there are ways to capitalize on desperate times.</string>
<string name="6585">I would suggest, however, that you refrain from telling Aribeth. She is trying to help those in need, and will not appreciate your financial goals.</string>
<string name="6586">She is Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, trusted member of the Neverwinter Nine, and favored servant of Lord Nasher Alagondar, ruler of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6587">She has complete authority over the efforts to fight the plague, and that means everyone involved answers directly to her.</string>
<string name="6588">Now, in all seriousness, you must speak with her. I am only to serve as a signpost to newcomers.</string>
<string name="6589">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="6590">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="6591">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6592">Thank you &lt;sir/madam&gt;, but I ain&apos;t interested in any charity you might be giving. I just don&apos;t have the interest in easin&apos; yer noble guilt today.</string>
<string name="6593">Yeah, just leave me here. I&apos;ve nowhere else to go.</string>
<string name="6594"></string>
<string name="6595">No, please, I don&apos;t want to think about this anymore than I have to.</string>
<string name="6596"></string>
<string name="6597"></string>
<string name="6598">What do you want? I&apos;m no guard, I can&apos;t help you. All I can do is wait for the plague to get me, and I can&apos;t even do that from my own bed.</string>
<string name="6599">Please don&apos;t hurt me. Haven&apos;t I suffered enough? I have nothing left. Not even a place of my own to lay down and die.</string>
<string name="6600">The zombies are all gone? I don&apos;t know what to say. I am so happy to be able to go home... I mean, it&apos;s just the Beggar&apos;s Nest... but it&apos;s all I&apos;ve got left.</string>
<string name="6601">I just want to go home to the Beggar&apos;s Nest. That&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="6602">I had almost given up hope. I can&apos;t believe it.</string>
<string name="6603"></string>
<string name="6604"></string>
<string name="6605"></string>

<string name="6613"></string>
<string name="6614"></string>
<string name="6615"></string>
<string name="6616"></string>
<string name="6617">Hello Oleff. I am &lt;FullName&gt;. Will you answer some questions?</string>
<string name="6618">My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have some questions for you.</string>
<string name="6619">I&apos;m &lt;FirstName&gt;. Enough chatter. I have questions for you.</string>
<string name="6620">Me &lt;FullName&gt;. Maybe me ask some questions?</string>
<string name="6621">Me &lt;FirstName&gt;. Stop yappin&apos; and answer questions, okay?</string>
<string name="6622">Farewell for now.</string>
<string name="6623">Bye bye then.</string>
<string name="6624">What is your position here?</string>
<string name="6625">What your job here?</string>
<string name="6626">What are the tenets of the Tyrran faith?</string>
<string name="6627">What stuff do Tyrrans believe?</string>
<string name="6628">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; That might sound harsh to some people.</string>
<string name="6629">Me needs temple stuff. What you gots?</string>
<string name="6630">I require temple services. What can you offer?</string>
<string name="6631">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe me can still help?</string>
<string name="6632">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I might still be able to help.</string>
<string name="6633">The plague undoubtedly complicated things.</string>
<string name="6634">Plague probably loused things up good.</string>
<string name="6635">Your efforts were likely wasted when the plague hit.</string>
<string name="6636">All you did probably useless when plague happen.</string>
<string name="6637">A waste of time, even before the plague hit.</string>
<string name="6638">Bah! Diggin&apos; is stupid, even before plague hit.</string>
<string name="6639">I will help you find these tombs.</string>
<string name="6640">Me help find tombs and dead guys.</string>
<string name="6641">I have no interest in helping.</string>
<string name="6642">Me no want to bother with this.</string>
<string name="6643">What do you know about Halueth Never?</string>
<string name="6644">Who this Halueth Never guy?</string>
<string name="6645">No! Me demands more!</string>
<string name="6646">Give me a copy of your letter.</string>
<string name="6647">Me needs copy of yous letter thing.</string>
<string name="6648">Me not care about this.</string>
<string name="6649">Farewell for now.</string>
<string name="6650">Bye bye</string>
<string name="6651">Go over what is needed again.</string>
<string name="6652">You repeat stuff about this job, okay?</string>
<string name="6653">Farewell for now.</string>
<string name="6654">Bye bye for now.</string>
<string name="6655">Yeah yeah, I&apos;ll look into it sometime.</string>
<string name="6656">Me get around to it maybe later.</string>
<string name="6657">Go over the task with me. Perhaps I will help too.</string>
<string name="6658">You tell me stuff too. Maybe me help.</string>
<string name="6659">This doesn&apos;t interest me. Farewell.</string>
<string name="6660">Me not care much. Bye.</string>
<string name="6661">Me gots stuff from one of the tomb-things.</string>
<string name="6662">I have an artifact from one of the tombs.</string>
<string name="6663">I have a copy of your letter and will look into it.</string>
<string name="6664">Me gots a letter from you. Me look into tomb stuff.</string>
<string name="6665">I have no interest in this.</string>
<string name="6666">&lt;StartAction&gt;Describe the recovery of the Ancient Chronicles of Never.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="6667">&lt;StartAction&gt;Describe the recovery of Halueth Never&apos;s rusted armor.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="6668">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="6669">&lt;StartAction&gt;Describe the recovery of the ancient Holy Symbol of Tyr.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="6670">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You must agree that I am worth more.</string>
<string name="6671">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You knows me worth more than that.</string>
<string name="6672">I demand more, lest you need a tomb of your own!</string>
<string name="6673">Me wants more, or me put you in tomb like Never!</string>
<string name="6674">Me come back if find more, okay.</string>
<string name="6675">That is sufficient. Thank you.</string>
<string name="6676">That really good. Thanks for the stuff.</string>
<string name="6677">I shall return if I find more.</string>
<string name="6678">That will not do! I demand more!</string>

<string name="6683">I have a letter from Ophala for you.</string>
<string name="6684">Me gots letter from Ophala for yous.</string>
<string name="6685">Why do you consort with a sinful operation?</string>
<string name="6686">Me thought you good. Why you work with dirty people?</string>
<string name="6687"></string>
<string name="6688"></string>
<string name="6689">Gold. I want gold to keep quiet about you.</string>
<string name="6690">Me wants gold to shut up. Heh.</string>
<string name="6691">Yes, you will pay me now.</string>
<string name="6692">Yeah! You pay me good!</string>
<string name="6693"></string>
<string name="6694"></string>
<string name="6695"></string>
<string name="6696"></string>
<string name="6697">&lt;StartAction&gt;Describe the recovery of Jacob&apos;s blessed quill from the evil Gilles.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="6698"></string>
<string name="6699"></string>
<string name="6700">Greetings of the Even-Handed to you. Welcome to the House of Tyr. I am Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar, in service of the Maimed God.</string>
<string name="6701">Tyr guide to you justice.</string>
<string name="6702">This Tyrran home welcomes your well-mannered address. Ask what you will, and I shall respond as I am able.</string>
<string name="6703">I am bound by Tyr to serve as long as the cause is just, but mind your tone. Disrespect is not tolerated in this place.</string>
<string name="6704">I will try, though I cannot guarantee you will fully understand my replies.</string>
<string name="6705">Temple services are available from Aribeth. She has stepped in to assist us because... well, we have suffered our own losses to the plague.</string>
<string name="6706"></string>
<string name="6707">We serve as judges, juries and, should the situation require it, executioners. Justice through benevolent force and armed vigilance.</string>
<string name="6708">There are many aspects to the worship of Tyr. He is the Blind Overlord, the Even-Handed. He is the guardian and governor of justice.</string>
<string name="6709">The tenets of the faith are for the ears of the faithful. I will not parade them out so you can mock them with your brutish manner.</string>
<string name="6710">The clergy are charged to reveal the truth, punish the guilty, right the wrong, and to always be true and just in their actions.</string>
<string name="6711">The law is unyielding, but true justice is also merciful when circumstances dictate. That can be hard to remember in times of crisis.</string>
<string name="6712">We administer to the plague sufferers. Previously we were working on artifact recovery, which may be even more important now.</string>
<string name="6713">You are a monk, are you not? I do not know your precise spiritual bent, but you may understand the importance of what I require.</string>
<string name="6714">It is really a matter that would only concern someone more spiritually minded, and I don&apos;t think you are the type. No offense meant.</string>
<string name="6715">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, while I appreciate your offer, this would best be left to someone more inclined to understand the needs of the church.</string>
<string name="6716">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps I was too quick to judge. You seem sincere enough. You may be able to understand why this is so important.</string>
<string name="6717">You might understand the significance of it, being a cleric yourself. Am I wrong? I can usually spot devout inclinations.</string>
<string name="6718">Certainly you will understand the importance of it. You walk with the gait of a paladin; we need that kind of dedication.</string>
<string name="6719">In the weeks before the plague, we uncovered the tomb of Miaslaznia Fairblade. She traveled widely with Halueth Never, founder of Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="6720">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I think it shall be left someone more appropriate, someone with adequate... eh... faculties.</string>
<string name="6721">This was a great discovery, and gave clues to the whereabouts of the founder&apos;s resting place. That would have been a great discovery indeed.</string>
<string name="6722">Greetings to you again, &lt;CUSTOM701&gt;. It is good to see you return to this house of Tyr.</string>
<string name="6723">Greetings. Are you with &lt;CUSTOM701&gt;? I am curious as to how the search for Halueth Never&apos;s tomb is going.</string>
<string name="6724">We have not seen the like of these in many many years. It brings new light to the wisdom of Halueth Never and his companions.</string>
<string name="6725">Contrary to your ignorant opinion, there are very valid reasons to pursue these tombs, especially now that the plague has ravaged the city.</string>
<string name="6726">Yes, it did. It is very unfortunate, because pursuing these tombs becomes all the more important with the city in crisis, as it is.</string>
<string name="6727">People are scared, and the lack of progress on a cure has diminished their hopes. A find like this would buoy their spirits.</string>
<string name="6728">There is also a chance that powerful artifacts could be found alongside Halueth Never&apos;s remains, though I would not rest my hopes upon it.</string>
<string name="6729">He was the founder of Neverwinter. Actually, not much is known about him, really. He&apos;s become a bit of a legendary figure.</string>
<string name="6730">That is unfortunate, and I understand how you might be reluctant. Please take this note, however, just in case you change your mind.</string>
<string name="6731">He reportedly fortified a fledgling Neverwinter against the Illusk barbarians, deflecting their wrath to Luskan and setting the tone for our uneasy relations with that city.</string>
<string name="6732">It signifies that you act with my sanction. Take it to Briley in the Peninsula district and he will aid you. He guards the one tomb already found.</string>
<string name="6733">It is in the basement of a house in the east side of the Peninsula district. Return to me if you find anything and I will reward you.</string>
<string name="6734">I welcome your aid in this matter. You couldn&apos;t have arrived at a more fortuitous time. Here, take this letter with my seal.</string>
<string name="6735">I hope there has been some progress with the search for Halueth Never&apos;s tomb. It would raise the spirits of the city.</string>
<string name="6736">Eh, you do not appear to have the letter that I gave you. Perhaps I forgot. I can give you another copy if you have misplaced it.</string>
<string name="6737">Very well. Briley in the Peninsula district will not help you without it. He is in the tomb we discovered in the basement of a house in the east side of the Peninsula district.</string>
<string name="6738">Well, please rememeber that you are free to change your mind. You have the letter I gave, do you not?</string>
<string name="6739">Another time, perhaps. Do please return.</string>
<string name="6740">Eh, if I am not mistaken, you have the letter I gave &lt;CUSTOM701&gt;. Has the weight of the task been transferred to you?</string>
<string name="6741">I would not be surprised if help had been enlisted. It is a big task, and even I am not sure of the dangers.</string>
<string name="6742">I hope that your attitude changes for the better. There really isn&apos;t anyone else suitable for this task right now.</string>
<string name="6743">Remember, take the letter to Briley in the Peninsula district in the center of the eastern edge. He will tell you what is known.</string>
<string name="6744">His very armor! And the location of his tomb! Who would have thought it was just beneath the surface, amidst so many others?</string>
<string name="6745">The plague snaps at the heart of Neverwinter, but we have a history. We shall fight with the newly detailed fury of Halueth Never.</string>
<string name="6746">You do? Wonderful. Please, tell me what it is that you have found.</string>
<string name="6747">Do not taunt us. The followers of Tyr do not brook such mischief at the best of times.</string>
<string name="6748">An excellent find! Neverwinter will benefit from learning about its auspicious origins. Perhaps we can find historical precedent for the plague as well.</string>
<string name="6749">As I said, you are to be rewarded. Here, take this 200 gold. It&apos;s not much, but there is more to come.</string>
<string name="6750">You have retrieved more than what we could have hoped for. A grand triad of artifacts, more than worthy of Never&apos;s legacy.</string>
<string name="6751">You have done much, and have even found the final resting place of Halueth Never, but what we have so far suggests there is more. </string>
<string name="6752">Your efforts are appreciated. A light has been cast on Halueth Never and his life, but there is still more to find.</string>
<string name="6753">We will guard well these items and the tombs they were found in. Take this amulet, and go with the blessing of Tyr.</string>
<string name="6754">There are further artifacts of his travels. Return to me if you find them. I shall reward you fairly, plus more when they are all recovered.</string>
<string name="6755">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps I could see fit to granting you another boon of Tyr, but I cannot make this allowance again.</string>
<string name="6756">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I do not wish to downplay your role, but the proper reward was given. Appreciate that, and take pride in your service.</string>
<string name="6757">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, no I think you are... confused. No, the proper reward was given. Be happy with that, and take pride in your service.</string>
<string name="6758">Thank you for your assistance, &lt;CUSTOM701&gt;. You were invaluable.</string>
<string name="6759">With heroes like &lt;CUSTOM701&gt;, and others, we will beat this.</string>
<string name="6760">The temple of Tyr, and indeed all of Neverwinter, thanks you for your sevice.</string>
<string name="6761">This adamantine is as much as I can manage. The temple is severely strained in this time..</string>
<string name="6762">It is ignorant and downright criminal to make such demands! I will ignore them just this once! Get out!</string>
<string name="6763">I will not tolerate this behavior in a house of Tyr, the god of justice! Leave me! You are no longer welcome here!</string>
<string name="6764">It speaks of his desire to be known as just another Neverwintan. Despite his greatness, he never forgot his home.</string>
<string name="6765">Knowing the details of his life could be very beneficial to the city. The people need to know they have a history of defeating adversity.</string>
<string name="6766">What?! He looted our fallen even as they gasped their last? I cannot imagine a more despicable act! Such disregard!</string>
<string name="6767">This item is not really an artifact, but I consider it valuable nonetheless. You are truly a friend of Tyr, risking yourself as you have. Take 500 gold as reward. It is the least we can do.</string>
<string name="6768">That beast looted our fallen even as they breathed their last? Despicable! You have done a great service by bringing him to task!</string>
<string name="6769">You are a great friend of Tyr, and will be remembered as such. Here, an additional 500 gold. It is the least we can do.</string>
<string name="6770">Unfortunately, it is very near the most we can do as well. Still, I hope it is sufficient. Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Thank you.</string>
<string name="6771">What? Let me see that. Oh, yes, of course. Please, just keep your voice down, and I&apos;ll get you what you need.</string>
<string name="6772">Let&apos;s see... hmmm... yes, I do believe you are plague free. Here is the document you need. Ophala should have no objection to your... patronage.</string>
<string name="6773">What? But... look, Ophala has friends in very high places. The Moonstone Mask would operate without my help. I just provide a service.</string>
<string name="6774">Is that all? Just gold? Listen, you! If I pay, I will never acknowledge this complaint again! Is that understood!?</string>
<string name="6775">I knew this would bite me in the ass one day. Very well. Here. 500 gold. Never speak of it again! I know I won&apos;t!</string>
<string name="6776">And no accusations. I&apos;ll do this, but I&apos;ve already dealt with someone&apos;s scorn and I&apos;m in no mood for chatter about it.</string>
<string name="6777"></string>
<string name="6778"></string>
<string name="6779"></string>
<string name="6780"></string>
<string name="6781"></string>
<string name="6782"></string>
<string name="6783"></string>
<string name="6784"></string>
<string name="6785"></string>
<string name="6786">I am thoroughly disgusted by the nature of people, and refuse to assist you. You may blame the actions of a small number for my mood.</string>
<string name="6787">I welcome the return of this item, but it is a shining spot in an otherwise bleak day. It does little to improve my true mood.</string>
<string name="6788">Here. Take some gold. It would seem that the treasure is all some people care about.</string>
<string name="6789"></string>
<string name="6790"></string>
<string name="6791"></string>
<string name="6792"></string>
<string name="6793">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="6794">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="6795">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6796">Please, good &lt;sir/madam&gt;, can you help? We have lost family to the plague, and escaped convicts in the Peninsula district prevent us from even mourning in our own homes.</string>
<string name="6797">Goodbye, I guess. Please, if you have a chance, can you please look into the trouble in the Peninsula? We have no one else to turn to.</string>
<string name="6798"></string>
<string name="6799">I... I don&apos;t know what someone like me could tell you. All I know is that none of us can go home. The guards do nothing... The Peninsula is unimportant with the plague taking a larger toll.</string>
<string name="6800"></string>
<string name="6801"></string>
<string name="6802"></string>
<string name="6803"></string>
<string name="6804">Glad that somebody was willing to take those thieves to the woodshed. I gotta thank you. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;m gonna get back to work in there.</string>
<string name="6805">I hate this. Someone should lay down the law.</string>
<string name="6806">That&apos;s the way things get done! Yes indeed!</string>
<string name="6807">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="6808">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="6809">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6810">Pardon my improper greeting, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, but I really can&apos;t muster the interest today. The plague picks us off one by one, and I can&apos;t even hide in my home.</string>
<string name="6811">Fare you well. I will be here. There&apos;s nowhere else for me to go. Definitely not home.</string>
<string name="6812"></string>
<string name="6813">I can&apos;t talk to anyone. I don&apos;t want to. I just want to be able to go home. Ah, why am I telling you this? You can&apos;t take on the whole Peninsula district.</string>
<string name="6814"></string>
<string name="6815"></string>
<string name="6816">What do you want? I thank you for your sympathy, if that&apos;s what you&apos;ve come to offer, but the guards have already given us plenty of good wishes. Unfortunately it doesn&apos;t help get our homes back. </string>
<string name="6817">What do you want? Please tell me you&apos;re not one of the thugs that forced us out. I&apos;ve nothing left to steal. I can&apos;t even huddle in my own home anymore.</string>
<string name="6818">I can&apos;t believe someone took the time to help us. Thank you for all you have done. It may not be much, but the Peninsula is where our homes are.</string>
<string name="6819">(sob) What are we to do?</string>
<string name="6820">I never thought I&apos;d be able to go home again.</string>
<string name="6821">I have a letter from Oleff. He sent me.</string>
<string name="6822">Me have Oleff letter. He sent me heres?</string>
<string name="6823">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6824">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Yous can tell me. It be okay.</string>
<string name="6825">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="6826">What can you tell me about these tombs?</string>
<string name="6827">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="6828">You know anything about the bad plague?</string>
<string name="6829">What you can tell me about tombs?</string>
<string name="6830">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="6831">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="6832">What do you know about attempts at a cure?</string>
<string name="6833">What is this place?</string>
<string name="6834">What this place?</string>
<string name="6835">Who is Oleff?</string>
<string name="6836">Who Oleff?</string>
<string name="6837">Farewell.</string>
<string name="6838">Bye bye.</string>
<string name="6839">What have you learned from this tomb?</string>
<string name="6840">What you learn from this tomb?</string>
<string name="6841">Where are the other tombs located?</string>
<string name="6842">Where other tombs located?</string>
<string name="6843">Did you find any artifacts in here?</string>
<string name="6844">You finds artifact stuffs in here?</string>
<string name="6845">I have other questions.</string>
<string name="6846">Me gots other questions and stuff.</string>
<string name="6847">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You can tell me. Come on.</string>
<string name="6848">We share the calling of cleric. You can tell me.</string>
<string name="6849">We&apos;s both kinda cleric. Yous can tell me.</string>
<string name="6850">What a good looker like yous got to hide, hmm?</string>
<string name="6851">A handsome man like you needs to keep secrets?</string>
<string name="6852">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Did this contribute to their deaths from the plague?</string>
<string name="6853">I&apos;m really sorry, but even nobility are prohibited from being here. I have to wait for word from Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar.</string>
<string name="6854">I-I&apos;m sorry, but you really shouldn&apos;t be in here. I&apos;m waiting for word from Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar.</string>
<string name="6855">P-please, Only those with the permission of Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar can be here. There&apos;s nothing for you to steal, anyway.</string>
<string name="6856">I had hoped he would send someone more... uh... thoughtfuly skilled. You seem a little... less than qualified for historical recovery.</string>
<string name="6857">Thank goodness you are here. The plague has not been kind to our number... but the work of Tyr must still be done.</string>
<string name="6858">The Wailing has taken many, including my brethren that were digging here. Pity... they didn&apos;t have time to... well, I shouldn&apos;t speak of that.</string>
<string name="6859">The tomb we are in belongs to Miaslaznia Fairblade. It has been her resting place for a good many years, though I don&apos;t know exactly how long.</string>
<string name="6860">I have been guarding this... hole for several days now. I hear nothing but the scuffling of feet above and the sceaming in my own head.</string>
<string name="6861">Another time. Remember to look at Jacob&apos;s journal in the chest. He may have included some valuable information before he... well.</string>
<string name="6862">Y-you really shouldn&apos;t be here. I&apos;m g-guarding this place, and I can&apos;t speak to you unless Oleff sent you to find the tombs of Never.</string>
<string name="6863">I suppose we are in no condition to protest. The plague has not been kind to our number, and the work must still be done.</string>
<string name="6864">She was a trusted friend of Halueth Never, so hopefully this place will hold clues as to where the founder himself is buried.</string>
<string name="6865">This one is very close to the surface, suggesting it may have been moved at least once in Neverwinter history, but no records tell of it.</string>
<string name="6866">Please, do not touch that. I&apos;ve been instructed to only allow access to someone sent by Oleff.</string>
<string name="6867">It is a holy place, but I cannot speak of it to you. Please, I guard this place for the church of Tyr. You should not be here. </string>
<string name="6868">Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar. He directs the actions of we who follow Tyr. I can&apos;t allow access to anyone except those he has sent.</string>
<string name="6869">T-thank you for leaving. This has been a difficult time for the Tyrran faith. I wish I was back in the Hall of Justice.</string>
<string name="6870">The plague killed every member of the team that was digging it out. What they knew, mostly died with them. There is a journal, though.</string>
<string name="6871">The scribe Jacob was supposed to detail what they found, but I have not read his account. It is in the chest. You may open it.</string>
<string name="6872">I don&apos;t know. Jacob&apos;s journal in the chest may say, but I was not instructed to read it, so you will have to examine it yourself.</string>
<string name="6873">I hope it proves useful. It would be a shame for him to have died without having shared his knowledge.</string>
<string name="6874">I don&apos;t think so. Of course, I only arrived after the team died of the plague. I hope no one had the gall to disturb their bodies.</string>
<string name="6875">The journal in the chest may have other information, but I was not instructed to read it.</string>
<string name="6876">I will answer what I can.</string>
<string name="6877">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I do not wish to speak ill of them, but I suppose the transgression was not that severe. Theirs was a small sin.</string>
<string name="6878">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t think that would be appropriate. It&apos;s not your affair, even if you were sent by Oleff and intend to help the church.</string>
<string name="6879">Perhaps you can understand. I guess it wouldn&apos;t hurt to tell you. Theirs was a small sin in the grand scheme of things.</string>
<string name="6880">You have the loveliest eyes... well, I suppose it wouldn&apos;t hurt too much if you are interested. Theirs was only a small sin.</string>
<string name="6881">You have a... a rough charm to you, but... well, I suppose it does no good to keep secrets. Theirs was a small sin... </string>
<string name="6882">They... well, they seemed to lose some of their belief in the power of Tyr. I suppose faith is tested in times like these.</string>
<string name="6883">They consorted somewhat with the Helmites and accepted blessings. There are many gods, I know, and Tyr favors Helm well enough, but it didn&apos;t seem appropriate.</string>
<string name="6884">Again, it&apos;s a small sin. They committed no evil and performed their duty to the last. It&apos;s just a shame they couldn&apos;t erase that blemish... </string>
<string name="6885">But... this does not really concern you. They have departed this mortal realm, and you have other duties to attend to.</string>
<string name="6886">I wouldn&apos;t dare to say. Tyr didn&apos;t abandon them. The power of Tyr hasn&apos;t protected anyone from the plague thus far, so great is the evil of it.</string>
<string name="6887">I haven&apos;t heard anything, and it frightens me greatly. The church has made no headway and the forces of Lord Nasher falter as well.</string>
<string name="6888">I know not what spawned this terrible Wailing disease, but it is the most insidious of evils. May the gods have mercy upon us.</string>
<string name="6889">I&apos;m sorry, I wish I knew of mysterious strangers or odd groups. It would put my mind at ease, and give reason to all of this.</string>
<string name="6890">For now, I just sit and hope that I&apos;m not struck down myself. I must trust in the wisdom of Tyr.</string>
<string name="6891">I have been in this hole for days now. What do you expect me to hear? What brilliant secrets do you think inhabit the dark?</string>
<string name="6892">Farewell. Just remember to pay attention to Jacob&apos;s journal. It was in the chest here. I&apos;m not sure who has it now.</string>
<string name="6893">His blessed quill will have been put to good use detailing what they found... strange... the quill is not here... </string>
<string name="6894">No one passes! Not past me!</string>
<string name="6895">Bound by Never! Never shall you pass!</string>
<string name="6896">Tombs of the Founder not to be found!</string>
<string name="6897">Guarded well for Never and ever!</string>
<string name="6898">What&apos;s downstairs? Is there something in your house?</string>
<string name="6899">What you mean? There something in your house?</string>
<string name="6900">You shouldn&apos;t be outside. It&apos;s dangerous.</string>
<string name="6901">You should be inside somewhere. Dangerous out here.</string>
<string name="6902">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6903">Bye byes.</string>
<string name="6904">Is there something in your house?</string>
<string name="6905">There something in your house?</string>
<string name="6906">Hi there. You nice? You look nice. Momma says lots people aren&apos;t nice. Maybe even downstairs.</string>
<string name="6907">Who you? Ha? You come for my house? Don&apos;t think so. I&apos;ll kick your tail! Like I keep the bad guys downstairs!</string>
<string name="6908">You ugly. Basement ugly.</string>
<string name="6909">Heh. You funny.</string>
<string name="6910">You maybe kinda slow? You talk like Jegs, and momma says he&apos;s not all there. Don&apos;t know where he&apos;s going, though.</string>
<string name="6911">Yeah, there&apos;s something behind the bookcase, but momma says not to talk about... uh... I can&apos;t say anymore.</string>
<string name="6912">Okay, goodbye and stuff.</string>
<string name="6913">I &apos;spose, but Momma doesn&apos;t mind. She says people get sick at home at work and at church, so what&apos;s wrong with me in the street?</string>
<string name="6914">&apos;Sides, she was mad because I went behind the bookcase again. Says it&apos;s not good to be there.</string>
<string name="6915">I guess there was, but some people chased stuff away. Nothing there now, I guess.</string>
<string name="6916">I don&apos;t want momma to know I know the secret word. You maybe go talk to her about it, okay?</string>
<string name="6917">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="6918">Me want some questions from yous</string>
<string name="6919">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6920">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="6921">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; If there is something odd here, you should tell me.</string>
<string name="6922">You know anything about the bad plague?</string>
<string name="6923">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; If something odd here, you tell me, okay?</string>
<string name="6924">What do you know about attempts at a cure?</string>
<string name="6925">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="6926">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="6927">Me ask something else.</string>
<string name="6928">Come now, fair lass, are you keeping secrets from me?</string>
<string name="6929">You pretty. You tell me if you hide stuff, nice lady.</string>
<string name="6930">Something&apos;s wrong here. What is it?! Tell me or die!</string>
<string name="6931">Something not right? You tell me! Tell me or die!</string>
<string name="6932">Are you telling me everything?!</string>
<string name="6933">That all you have to say? Well?!</string>
<string name="6934">What kind of sounds?</string>
<string name="6935">What sounds? What there?</string>
<string name="6936">I&apos;m going to go look, all right?</string>
<string name="6937">Me go look and you not stop me!</string>
<string name="6938">Me gots to check it out.</string>
<string name="6939">I&apos;m going to go look. Stay out of my way.</string>
<string name="6940">Do you know of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="6941">You hear anything odd ever? Maybe rumor stuff?</string>
<string name="6942">You seem agitated. Are you all right?</string>
<string name="6943">You okay? You get all shakey.</string>
<string name="6944">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You seem agitated. Is there something hidden here?</string>
<string name="6945">Go over this secret again for me.</string>
<string name="6946">You say about secret again for me, okay?</string>
<string name="6947">Tell me about what is going on here! Say or die!</string>
<string name="6948">You say what is happening here! Do it or die!</string>
<string name="6949">Beggin&apos; your pardon, but why are you in my home? Not that nobility or the like can&apos;t go wherever they want. Uh... </string>
<string name="6950">Greetings. Why are you in my home? Not that you shouldn&apos;t be here, or anything. I don&apos;t really have a reason for you not to be here.</string>
<string name="6951">What&apos;s a creature like you doing in my home! Get out! I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll... Just get out! I won&apos;t even waste breath talking to you!</string>
<string name="6952">You mean answers? You a few biscuits short? Sorry, I don&apos;t mean anything, and I don&apos;t mean to object. There&apos;s nothing here for you, though... </string>
<string name="6953">I suppose... Is there a reason you are here? Again, I don&apos;t really mean to object, but if there&apos;s nothing here for you... </string>
<string name="6954">It kills people no matter where they go or what they do. Maybe the nobles can do something, but I&apos;m just a servant.</string>
<string name="6955">Well, I was serving Lord Fontelbottom at his weekly Gelder&apos;s Club meeting, run by old Jim Gelder, you know, and he said something.</string>
<string name="6956">He said &quot;cure creatures were lost to an attack.&quot; Sounds like gibberish to me. He hasn&apos;t been the same since... well... he&apos;s never been &quot;all there.&quot;</string>
<string name="6957">Oh. All right then. Uh... please close the door behind you... ?</string>
<string name="6958">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;ll maybe do something about it? I won&apos;t have to worry about it no more? I guess I can talk.</string>
<string name="6959">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh no, I&apos;m staying right out of it. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on, and I don&apos;t want to.</string>
<string name="6960">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; What do you know? Maybe you just don&apos;t have the sense to be afraid. Well fine, maybe you&apos;ll fix it by accident.</string>
<string name="6961">You&apos;ve got some gall, flirting after inviting yourself into my house. Quite the charmer. I suppose I can tell you, if it&apos;ll get rid of you.</string>
<string name="6962">Ugh, no thank you. That might work on an ale-soaked wench in the City Core, but not with me. Not with your face, anyway.</string>
<string name="6963">Are you dim enough to think you can sweet-talk me after invading my home? That&apos;s... unique, I&apos;ll give it that. Fine, I&apos;ll tell you.</string>
<string name="6964">Why would you want to hurt me? I&apos;ll tell, of course... but why threaten?! It&apos;s just a word... just a strange little word. You say it and the bookcase opens. &quot;Halueth&quot; is the word.</string>
<string name="6965">I don&apos;t even know what it means. It&apos;s just... we used to hide things in the passage. We don&apos;t go too far, though. It&apos;s eerie... and smells... wrong. We used to hide things from the guards down there, but not anymore.</string>
<string name="6966">It&apos;s an old place... we dug out the basement and found it... now I wish we never had. There&apos;s something... behind the door.</string>
<string name="6967">I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t know! Please! Just get out! Just get out!</string>
<string name="6968">Leave me alone! Please! Just leave my home!</string>
<string name="6969">Don&apos;t know why you&apos;re in my home now. Whatever was in my basement is done and gone. Maybe things will get back to normal now.</string>
<string name="6970">See, we found a note in an old book, and when we said a certain word, the bookcase moved. We were going to dig out behind it to make a secret place that guards wouldn&apos;t look, but we found... well, there was a tunnel.</string>
<string name="6971">There&apos;s... something not right down there. There&apos;s a door we could never open and... *sounds* that come from behind it. Look at the bookcase and say the word &quot;Halueth.&quot; You&apos;ll see for yourself.</string>
<string name="6972">I don&apos;t know, and I won&apos;t try to find out! Maybe you want to, but I&apos;m not going to go looking for ways to be stupid.</string>
<string name="6973">Would you go poking around in the dark? Maybe, but maybe you could handle it if you found something. Me, I&apos;d just get killed.</string>
<string name="6974">That&apos;s your decision, I guess. The entrance is hidden behind the bookcase. Please, just try not to stir anything up. I have to live here.</string>
<string name="6975">All right, all right, the entrance is hidden behind the bookcase. Please, please don&apos;t stir up trouble. I have to live here.</string>
<string name="6976">And there&apos;s no reason you shouldn&apos;t go where you want. Really. I didn&apos;t mean to cause a fuss. My name is Telma... if you want to know.</string>
<string name="6977">No! I mean, of course not. Why would I know of anything odd? I mean, there&apos;s the plague, of course. What else needs to be happening besides that?</string>
<string name="6978">Oh, I&apos;m fine, of course. Nothing wrong with me. Nothing is out of sorts here. Nothing at all.</string>
<string name="6979">I... well I didn&apos;t mean to give the impression that... Oh, hell with it. It looks like you know already. There&apos;s something under my house.</string>
<string name="6980">See, we were digging a... uh... storage place behind the bookcase and down... well, to hide things from the city guards. It didn&apos;t pan out, though.</string>
<string name="6981">Please... I&apos;ve already told all I can... I just want people to leave my home. Just leave me... It&apos;s no secret anymore.</string>
<string name="6982">Farewell.</string>
<string name="6983">Has anyone left recently?</string>
<string name="6984">Bye bye.</string>
<string name="6985">I just have a few questions.</string>
<string name="6986">Me just gots some questions for yous.</string>
<string name="6987">Anyone get let out in last little while?</string>
<string name="6988">Me works for Aribeth and Nasher guy. You let me go.</string>
<string name="6989">I serve Aribeth and Lord Nasher. Let me pass.</string>
<string name="6990">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, has anyone been allowed in, then?</string>
<string name="6991">Hold! Passage from the city of Neverwinter is forbidden. We cannot risk the plague being spread to the surrounding countryside.</string>
<string name="6992">Well met, citizen.</string>
<string name="6993">No one has exited the city recently. I would not allow it. The danger to the outside lands is too great.</string>
<string name="6994">I don&apos;t care if you&apos;re the bloody avatar of Ilmater himself, you&apos;re not getting through this gate. Nobody passes this point until a cure is found.</string>
<string name="6995">What, did you not understand what I just said? Passage outside if forbidden. That means no one, and I mean NO ONE gets out.</string>
<string name="6996">I am trusted with the grave duty of keeping the whole of the North free of plague and you want to chat me up?</string>
<string name="6997">Please, just leave me to my duty. I can&apos;t lose focus. I can&apos;t let anyone gain my favor. Everyone is to be treated the same. Nobody gets out.</string>
<string name="6998">Er... I suppose I am not specifically restricted from letting people into the city. They are warned of the danger, but it is their risk to take.</string>
<string name="6999">That being said, nobody has entered the city recently. In fact, I believe only Desther and his Helmite brethren have dared risk it, and that was shortly after the plague began.</string>
<string name="7000">They have been tirelessly helping ever since. It&apos;s an astounding level of sacrifice for them to make, risking themselves like that.</string>
<string name="7001">Hello, I am &lt;FullName&gt;. Could I ask some questions?</string>
<string name="7002">I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;. I have some questions.</string>
<string name="7003">I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;. Just shut up and answer my questions.</string>
<string name="7004">Me &lt;FullName&gt;. Maybe me ask you some things?</string>
<string name="7005">Me &lt;FullName&gt;. You just shuts up and answer questions, okay?</string>
<string name="7006">Farewell, then.</string>
<string name="7007">Bye bye.</string>
<string name="7008">What is your position here?</string>
<string name="7009">What your job here?</string>
<string name="7010">Is there a place for nature in the heart of this city?</string>
<string name="7011">Nature in the city? Wha?</string>
<string name="7012">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Why are you so sure this plague is not natural?</string>
<string name="7013">Me needs stuff to buy. What you gots?</string>
<string name="7014">I require supplies. What can you offer?</string>
<string name="7015">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe me can still help?</string>
<string name="7016">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I might still be able to help.</string>
<string name="7017">It can&apos;t be new. Not during the plague.</string>
<string name="7018">Can&apos;t be new. Not during plague-sick.</string>
<string name="7019">This zoo seems small next to the plague.</string>
<string name="7020">So animals are in a zoo. So what?</string>
<string name="7021">I will help you free these animals.</string>
<string name="7022">This bad! Me free animals! </string>
<string name="7023">I have no interest in helping.</string>
<string name="7024">Me no want to bother with this.</string>
<string name="7025">What do you know of this hunter?</string>
<string name="7026">Who this hunter guy?</string>
<string name="7027">No! Me demands more!</string>
<string name="7028">Me not care about this.</string>
<string name="7029">Go over what is needed again.</string>
<string name="7030">You repeat stuff about this job, okay?</string>
<string name="7031">Go over the task with me. Perhaps I will help too.</string>
<string name="7032">You tell me stuff too. Maybe me help.</string>
<string name="7033">There some stuff done about animals! </string>
<string name="7034">There has been progress in freeing the animals.</string>
<string name="7035">I will help.</string>
<string name="7036">Me help!</string>
<string name="7037">I have no interest in this.</string>
<string name="7038">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You must agree that I am worth more.</string>
<string name="7039">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You knows me worth more than that.</string>
<string name="7040">I demand more! Deny me and you will suffer!</string>
<string name="7041">Me wants more, or me hurt you bad!</string>
<string name="7042">That is sufficient. Thank you.</string>
<string name="7043">That really good. Thanks for the stuff.</string>
<string name="7044">That will not do! I demand more!</string>
<string name="7045">Farewell</string>
<string name="7046">Bye bye</string>
<string name="7047">What is the purpose of the zoo?</string>
<string name="7048">Why they cage animals?</string>
<string name="7049">I need the key.</string>
<string name="7050">Me need key.</string>
<string name="7051">I need the scroll.</string>
<string name="7052">Me need scroll.</string>
<string name="7053">Nothing more. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7054">Perhaps more for a &lt;brother/sister&gt; druid?</string>
<string name="7055">What animals? Is there something you need help with?</string>
<string name="7056">What animals? Maybe you need help or something?</string>
<string name="7057">Greetings. Blessings of the Earthmother Chauntea and the Treefather Silvanus upon you. I am Nyatar, in the service of Nature.</string>
<string name="7058">Walk with balance and with nature.</string>
<string name="7059">I welcome your well-mannered address. Ask what you will, and I shall respond as I am able.</string>
<string name="7060">I will assist if I can, but mind your tone in the presence of nature. I favor balance in all things, including within those people I must associate with.</string>
<string name="7061">I will try to answer, though I cannot guarantee you will fully understand my replies. Your mind seems very... instinctual.</string>
<string name="7062">And I have no small stake in the fate of this city. The plague is not natural. I cannot be elsewhere when such an abomination goes unchecked.</string>
<string name="7063">The place of Nature is everywhere. It cannot be bound by walls or notions of property. Even in the heart of Neverwinter she must find purchase.</string>
<string name="7064">Nature&apos;s place is everywhere. It is the city that has encroached upon *her*. I work for balance, but I will not parade my methods for you to mock.</string>
<string name="7065">Especially in this time, when the population has been so weakened by the plague. Balance is the first casualty as people lose hope.</string>
<string name="7066">It kills the spirit. Victims rot from within as their very life is drained away... but where does it go? There is actually energy being lost here!</string>
<string name="7067">I see to it that the city does not tip too far from balance; that concerns for natural elements are kept a priority. *Sigh* It&apos;s not easy in these times.</string>
<string name="7068">You would not understand. Only a &lt;brother/sister&gt; in nature could fully appreciate what needs to be done. How vital my task is.</string>
<string name="7069">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, while I appreciate your offer, this would best be left to someone more inclined to understand balance.</string>
<string name="7070">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps I was too quick to judge. You seem sincere enough. You may be able to understand why this is so important.</string>
<string name="7071">You... you are a ranger, are you not? I cannot be wrong; I know a &lt;brother/sister&gt; of the wood when I see one. You will understand.</string>
<string name="7072">You are a &lt;brother/sister&gt; druid, are you not? I cannot be mistaken. We are kin in the eyes of the Earthmother. You will understand.</string>
<string name="7073">Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="7074">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, understanding nature requires someone that is better at... understanding things.</string>
<string name="7075">It is operated by a hunter and his &quot;noble&quot; entourage. It is not clean, it is not compassionate, and it is not right. The animals within are mistreated.</string>
<string name="7076">Greetings again, &lt;CUSTOM750&gt;. Nature welcomes you. I hope the day has held you in better health than those poor creatures in the Blacklake zoo.</string>
<string name="7077">Greetings. Are you with &lt;CUSTOM750&gt;? The fight against the zoo in the Blacklake could use whatever help is available. The animals suffer so.</string>
<string name="7078">Your attitude is the majority. I was working to have it closed, but the plague has delayed that indefinitely. The officials I spoke with are among the plague dead.</string>
<string name="7079">It is not new. I was working to have it closed, but the plague has delayed that indefinitely. The officials I spoke with are among the plague dead.</string>
<string name="7080">It has given the zoo a reprieve. They know the law was turning against them, but now they have time to cover their actions.</string>
<string name="7081">I fear the animals will simply be killed and made into trophies. All creatures deserve charity. This bear, panther, wolf and lion; all four should be rescued.</string>
<string name="7082">Montgomery &quot;Sureshot&quot; Weatherson. His family has been a great advocate of animal rights, but Montgomery abandoned that philosophy when his father died. </string>
<string name="7083">I understand your reluctance in this troublesome time, but these little things make a diffence too. Please, take this in case you change your mind.</string>
<string name="7084">He gauges his progress as a man by what he has mastered, his family and business, and nature, creature by creature. He is out of balance.</string>
<string name="7085">This key will grant access to the zoo. My animal companion &quot;found it,&quot; and I made copies. Guards may try to stop you, but doors will not.</string>
<string name="7086">This is a Transport Via Plants scroll. Use it on the large tree near the zoo and any of the animals you lead there will be teleported here.</string>
<string name="7087">I was hoping you would say that. Let me give you a few things to help in your task. I have thought long about what is required.</string>
<string name="7088">The plague still rages, but some small comfort has been given. Animals are no longer caged in that horrible zoo.</string>
<string name="7089">That is good to know. Truth be told, my animal spies have kept me informed. I have felt it necessary to carefully monitor the creatures involved.</string>
<string name="7090">Please, accept this reward with my blessing and that of the Earthmother and Treefather.</string>
<string name="7091">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps I could grant a bit more of nature&apos;s blessing upon you, but I cannot make this allowance again.</string>
<string name="7092">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I do not wish to downplay your role, but the proper reward was given. Appreciate that, and take pride in your service.</string>
<string name="7093">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, no I think you are... confused. No, the proper reward was given. Be happy with that, and take pride in your service.</string>
<string name="7094">Thank you for your assistance, &lt;CUSTOM750&gt;. You were invaluable.</string>
<string name="7095">&lt;CUSTOM750&gt;&apos;s assistance was invaluable. A little balance given to this horrible time.</string>
<string name="7096">You have served the Earthmother and Treefather as well as could be done.</string>
<string name="7097">This Ironwood is as much as I can manage. The temple is severely strained in this time.</string>
<string name="7098">It is ignorant and downright criminal to make such demands! You must realize how unbalanced your actions are!</string>
<string name="7099">I... I cannot fight you... If I was strong enough I wouldn&apos;t have needed you in the first place. Take it... take it all... </string>
<string name="7100">Several nobles live vicariously through him. Their influence protects him from what little pressure I have been able to apply thorugh the law.</string>
<string name="7101">In nature, everything that falls away is reborn elsewhere, but this Wailing steals away the very core of a person like a bandit. That is NOT natural.</string>
<string name="7102">They claim they want common people to see the beauty of nature but, in truth, only the families of certain nobles are allowed in.</string>
<string name="7103">There are humane ways to do such things, but I suspect this zoo is more intended to show their superiority over the creatures held there.</string>
<string name="7104">For all the care they give to the animals held within, they may as well have simply placed their heads on the walls.</string>
<string name="7105">Please, speak with these animals as I know you can. Lead them to freedom at the large tree before their lives are lost. There is no purpose to their captivity.</string>
<string name="7106">And take this Scented Fetish. It will let you speak to the animals with the skill of a druid or a ranger. Please, lead the animals to the large tree and freedom.</string>
<string name="7107">I am glad to hear it. I previously gave out a key for the zoo and a Transport Via Plants scroll. Do you need these?</string>
<string name="7108">Please keep it in mind. I previously gave out a key for the zoo and a Transport Via Plants scroll. If you don&apos;t have them, take them just in case.</string>
<string name="7109">Please, use the fetish I made to lead the animals to freedom. There is no point to their captivity. They don&apos;t need to suffer.</string>
<string name="7110">Take it. My animal companion &quot;found it&quot; and I made copies.</string>
<string name="7111">I created it specifically for the large tree near the zoo. Please, free the animals.</string>
<string name="7112">All the animals were indeed freed, but the deaths suffered among those creatures has given this task a horrible end.</string>
<string name="7113"></string>
<string name="7114"></string>
<string name="7115">All the animals are free and safe. A pity about the deaths among their captors. All life deserves a chance... but perhaps that was their chance.</string>
<string name="7116"></string>
<string name="7117">There has been some movement, but not all of the animals are safe. Please, if there is something you can do to help, this is the time.</string>
<string name="7118">They are all dead. You can&apos;t call this a success, can you? I can&apos;t. I was hoping for a bright spot amidst the plague... </string>
<string name="7119">Some animals escaped, at least. That is something. A little life in this horrible dying time. I&apos;m not completely happy, but it&apos;s something.</string>
<string name="7120">At least only one of the animals was killed. That can be called a victory of sorts. Amidst everything else, there is a victory for life here.</string>
<string name="7121">Please, leave me. I am in no mood to speak. This is a tragedy.</string>
<string name="7122">Everything is dying. people... the animals... There&apos;s not much a person can do... is there?</string>
<string name="7123">Please, leave me be. I have no desire to speak with anyone.</string>
<string name="7124">I previously gave out a key for the zoo and a scroll of Trasport Via Plants. Do you need either of these to continue? </string>
<string name="7125">I want to grant you a reward for what was done, but you&apos;ll understand that I can&apos;t be too generous. This matter was not handled as well as it could have.</string>
<string name="7126">I would call the encounter a success, and must reward you accordingly. I am sure you will be pleased.</string>
<string name="7127">Here, with my blessing. I&apos;m sure you will be pleased. Your service has been quite adequate.</string>
<string name="7128">Accept this reward and be thankful. Our association has been a trying one.</string>
<string name="7129">Take this, then, and leave. With nature&apos;s grace, we will have no further association.</string>
<string name="7130">Perhaps that can be arranged. I would not press the matter, however, as times are very lean. Take this, and go with balance.</string>
<string name="7131">This outpost will close over this... even nature&apos;s children must pay certain people to maintain our position in the city... even we... </string>
<string name="7132">I don&apos;t like it here. The animals seem sad. I can kind of tell. Maybe I&apos;ll help them when I&apos;m bigger.</string>
<string name="7133">Time to go... goood. Gotta get out before those guards come. They scare me.</string>
<string name="7134">I wish they&apos;d open the cages. Then we could cut the animals up for meat and stuff! Maybe even keep their heads!</string>
<string name="7135">Aw, I don&apos;t wanna go! I wanna see the guards kill somebody for being here too late!</string>
<string name="7136">I&apos;ll pay your one gold.</string>
<string name="7137">I&apos;m not going to pay right now.</string>
<string name="7138"></string>
<string name="7139"></string>
<string name="7140"></string>
<string name="7141">Montgomery &quot;Sureshot&quot; Weatherson bids you welcome to his animal hold. View these beasts for only one gold.</string>
<string name="7142"></string>
<string name="7143">You may enter. Remember that you are a guest and must abide by the rules of common courtesy. The guards do not listen to excuses.</string>
<string name="7144">Then you don&apos;t get in. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7145"></string>
<string name="7146">Keep your manners while here. Your gold buys you a look and that&apos;s it. You should feel privileged that we work to stay open around the clock in these dangerous times.</string>
<string name="7147">Nightfall is coming. I warn you, the night guards do not listen to excuses. Get yourself gone or get ready to fight and die.</string>
<string name="7148">You&apos;ve got some nerve! I&apos;ve never backed down from a challenge!</string>
<string name="7149">Montgomery Sureshot will not let some damned treehuggers take his hard won trophies!</string>
<string name="7150">Nasher couldn&apos;t shut me down, Nyatar couldn&apos;t shut me down! What makes you think you can?</string>
<string name="7151">Not a one! Not a one goes free!</string>
<string name="7152">Now that&apos;s a fine animal! You&apos;d have a fight running that one down. Get a good look, son!</string>
<string name="7153">I&apos;ll take you hunting one day, son. You&apos;ll love it! Face to face with the worst of nature&apos;s snarling beasts!</string>
<string name="7154">Can I kill it, dad?</string>
<string name="7155">Get lost. Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m spending a day with the family?! Stare right into its eyes, boys. Show no fear!</string>
<string name="7156">I don&apos;t wanna. It looks sick.</string>
<string name="7157">Dear, you&apos;re scaring the children.</string>
<string name="7158">That&apos;s the spirit, but save it for the hike next week. We&apos;ll find some real trophies.</string>
<string name="7159">Time to go. That Montgomery isn&apos;t shy about setting his guards on people. That&apos;s a man that knows how to protect his home!</string>
<string name="7160">See that! It thinks you&apos;re food! Go on! Give it your arm!</string>
<string name="7161">Shut up! Stop it! It&apos;s sad... I can tell... I think... </string>
<string name="7162">A fine collection. Reminds me of my days with the Adaron Aces. I tell you, we would wrangle the biggest meanest... eh... what was it we hunted?</string>
<string name="7163">Not like the old days... never dared to put things in cages back then. These beasts look cowed... frightened. Where&apos;s the honor in a fight with one of these?</string>
<string name="7164">Time to head out. The guards have orders to... &quot;deal&quot; with anyone if the back rooms are tampered with.</string>
<string name="7165">Boar! That was it! Nasty things! Ah, those were the days... these beasts here look a bit underfed, though... not much challenge here.</string>
<string name="7166">*Sigh* I wish we didn&apos;t have to come here so often, but since the plague, Billiam hasn&apos;t been able to take the boys hunting. Not that I mind... so much blood... </string>
<string name="7167">I don&apos;t think it&apos;s safe to be here. Let&apos;s get out before those guards start threatening. They are the real beasts.</string>
<string name="7168">Wait here until I use Nyatar&apos;s scroll on the tree outside.</string>
<string name="7169">Take revenge on the guards! Slaughter them!</string>
<string name="7170">Take revenge on everyone! Slaughter anyone here!</string>
<string name="7171">Run to the tree outside. It will send you to freedom!</string>
<string name="7172">You are free. Wait until I make sure the way is safe.</string>
<string name="7173">&lt;StartAction&gt;This animal looks up slowly, unsure of your intent. You sense fear.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7174">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal nods, hoping you will come back soon. You sense worry.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7175">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal remembers the pain it has suffered. You sense rage.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7176">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal is overcome by a blind fury. You sense no restraint to its rage.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7177">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal is instantly more lively. You sense great joy.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7178">I will listen. What is it you wish to say?</string>
<string name="7179">What do you want?</string>
<string name="7180">Speak, but waste my time and you&apos;ll regret it.</string>
<string name="7181">What you meaning? You please e&apos;splain.</string>
<string name="7182">What you blather about, idiot?</string>
<string name="7183">Farewell for now.</string>
<string name="7184">Bye bye for nows.</string>
<string name="7185">I do what needs to be done. What is your offer?</string>
<string name="7186">Me does whatever. What you want?</string>
<string name="7187">Me nots evil!</string>
<string name="7188">I do not commit evil acts!</string>
<string name="7189">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me bad inside where good can&apos;t see!</string>
<string name="7190">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; My evil is carefully veiled, making me more dangerous!</string>
<string name="7191">You wish me to bring them to you instead of Oleff?</string>
<string name="7192">You wants me to bring to you instead of Oleff?</string>
<string name="7193">Even in times of plague you scheme. How petty.</string>
<string name="7194">Even with plague around you act mean. Stupid.</string>
<string name="7195">I will bring the artifacts to you instead of Oleff.</string>
<string name="7196">Me bring stuff to yous instead of Oleff stuffed-shirt.</string>
<string name="7197">Why do you think I am working for Oleff?</string>
<string name="7198">Why you think me work for Oleff?</string>
<string name="7199">No! Me demands more!</string>
<string name="7200">The letter is unimportant. I don&apos;t need it.</string>
<string name="7201">Letter dumb. Me not need.</string>
<string name="7202">Me not care about this.</string>
<string name="7203">Go over what is needed again.</string>
<string name="7204">You repeat stuff about this job, okay?</string>
<string name="7205">Farewell for now.</string>
<string name="7206">Bye bye for now.</string>
<string name="7207">Yeah yeah, I&apos;ll look into it sometime.</string>
<string name="7208">Me get around to it maybe later.</string>
<string name="7209">Go over the task with me. Perhaps I will help too.</string>
<string name="7210">You tell me stuff too. Maybe me help.</string>
<string name="7211">This doesn&apos;t interest me. Farewell.</string>
<string name="7212">Me not care much. Bye.</string>
<string name="7213">Me gots stuff from one of the tomb-things.</string>
<string name="7214">I have an artifact from one of the tombs.</string>
<string name="7215">I have no interest in this.</string>
<string name="7216">&lt;StartAction&gt;Describe the recovery of the Ancient Chronicles of Never.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7217">&lt;StartAction&gt;Describe the recovery of Halueth Never&apos;s rusted armor.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7218">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="7219">&lt;StartAction&gt;Describe the recovery of the Ancient Holy Symbol of Tyr.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7220">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You must agree that I am worth more.</string>
<string name="7221">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You knows me worth more than that.</string>
<string name="7222">I demand more! Appease me or die!</string>
<string name="7223">Me get more or you die like dog!</string>
<string name="7224">Me come back if find more, okay.</string>
<string name="7225">That is sufficient. Thank you.</string>
<string name="7226">That really good. Thanks for the stuff.</string>
<string name="7227">I shall return if I find more.</string>
<string name="7228">That will not do! I demand more!</string>
<string name="7229">You were at the tomb and didn&apos;t help the dying?</string>
<string name="7230">You was there and didn&apos;t help the dying guys?</string>
<string name="7231">That&apos;s despicable! Give me Jacob&apos;s quill NOW!</string>
<string name="7232">You evil dumb-head! Give me Jacob&apos;s write-y thing NOW!</string>
<string name="7233">Give me the Quill now, you evil bastard!</string>
<string name="7234">You gives me Quill right now, jerk!</string>
<string name="7235">What are the tenets of your faith in Talona?</string>
<string name="7236">What Talona? What she stand for?</string>
<string name="7237">I sense the stink of Tyr upon you. I hear that Oleff has you running errands? Maybe it displeases you? Care to hear an offer?</string>
<string name="7238">Off you go. Puppet. Dog.</string>
<string name="7239">Oh so polite. Bah! I have no use for manners. Can you steal and can you kill? That&apos;s what I need.</string>
<string name="7240">Ahh, you answer rude and rough. Are you what I need? Can you steal and kill? Or are you an indignant lackey of Tyr? We shall see.</string>
<string name="7241">Bah! Why I waste time on an imbecile, I don&apos;t know. Still, you don&apos;t need to think. You just need to steal and kill.</string>
<string name="7242">I&apos;m sure your quaint morality lets you sleep deep and long. Come back when you tire of being an errand &lt;boy/girl&gt; for Tyr and Oleff.</string>
<string name="7243">The &quot;justice&quot; of Tyr has a sickening grip on this city. Talona would like to see... something happen. Something that will shake the Tyrran faith.</string>
<string name="7244">Wait... you... you reek of purity! You walk as a paladin! Bah! I waste my breath! There is nothing you can offer me!</string>
<string name="7245">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;d be a fool to believe you! Your very nature makes you my enemy! Get lost.</string>
<string name="7246">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ahh, I see. I can respect that, but you&apos;ll have the taint of evil on you after this, I promise.</string>
<string name="7247">My name is Gilles. I need someone to act without conscience and despoil what the Tyrrans are trying to achieve. You see where I&apos;m going?</string>
<string name="7248">You were given a letter by Oleff asking you to find certain tombs and the artifacts within. The fool wants to strengthen the will of the people.</string>
<string name="7249">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I think it shall be left someone more appropriate, someone with adequate... eh... faculties.</string>
<string name="7250">These relics of Halueth Never could benefit the church of Talona, perhaps be warped to her will. And if not, they should be destroyed.</string>
<string name="7251">Hello again, &lt;CUSTOM712&gt;. Is there something you require? I hope you are not attracting attention to me for no reason.</string>
<string name="7252">Who in the hells are you? That &lt;CUSTOM712&gt; better not have said to talk to me. Too much attention is deadly.</string>
<string name="7253">Well now, wouldn&apos;t Oleff like to get his hands on this, hmm? I shall see that it is... properly disposed of.</string>
<string name="7254">Talona is her most active while people languish beneath disease. That is her domain, no matter if she caused the plague or not.</string>
<string name="7255">Oleff and his brethren have no guarantees that these items will stop the plague. They just know they could prove powerful.</string>
<string name="7256">This is a resource that must be denied them. Bring the items to me instead of Oleff and I will pay you far more than what he would&apos;ve.</string>
<string name="7257">I have eyes around the city. They say you carry a letter from Oleff, compelling his fellow Tyrrans to let you pass.</string>
<string name="7258">What I don&apos;t know is whether you are helping for faith or just for the gold. If it&apos;s gold, I can offer more. It&apos;s that simple.</string>
<string name="7259">Of course you will. You understand how weak those fools are, and how they don&apos;t appreciate you. I will treat you right.</string>
<string name="7260">Have you found any of the Halueth Never artifacts? The followers of Talona long for them. Tyr will not have his trinkets.</string>
<string name="7261">Eh, you do not appear to have the letter that Oleff gave you. Have you rightfully abandoned his service?</string>
<string name="7262">Good, good. Just so long as you are still on the proper course. Talona has little patience for your mortal whims.</string>
<string name="7263">Ah HA! But I have planted the seed, and you will think about it each time you are underpaid by Oleff.</string>
<string name="7264">Ahh, but you have a copy of Oleff&apos;s letter too, don&apos;t you? Perhaps you have wisely decided to serve Talona?</string>
<string name="7265">What, are you supposed to be extra help or something? What weakling needs help against the plague-riddled Tyrrans?</string>
<string name="7266">You treat this task as though it is a mere errand! Show respect for the will of Talona! Get to your task!</string>
<string name="7267">Don&apos;t pester me unless you have news of benefit to the followers of Talona! Do not tempt her wrath!</string>
<string name="7268">The very shell that Halueth Never wore! The stink of him is thick inside it. My masters shall see that it is put to good use.</string>
<string name="7269">Well hand it over, fool! I&apos;m not paying for your oh so eloquent words!</string>
<string name="7270">The Lady of Poison will not suffer these distractions. Get to your task!</string>
<string name="7271">Self-indulgent tripe! These chronicles will make fine kindling at the next gathering of malagents at Daernuth. What a festival that shall be!</string>
<string name="7272">Here, your pay is 600 gold. That is far more than what Oleff would pay, and I may give even more!</string>
<string name="7273">A victory! Tyr shall never know these things! Whatever the future brings, Talona shall always have this sweet spiteful victory!</string>
<string name="7274"></string>
<string name="7275">A triumph! Forever a void in their knowledge of Halueth! Such a triumph for the Lady of Poison, but there is still more to find.</string>
<string name="7276">Take this additional 600, and know that Talona may spare you. That is all that can be asked!</string>
<string name="7277">There are further artifacts. Bring them to me and I shall reward your black soul with gold to bathe in! And more when they are all delivered!</string>
<string name="7278">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;re service was greatly appreciated, so I suppose more is warranted, but this boon shall NOT be repeated.</string>
<string name="7279">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You were paid what you were worth! Now you risk angering the Lady of Poison! No more shall be given!</string>
<string name="7280">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You are an imbecile to demand more of Talona! There will be no further reward! Get lost!</string>
<string name="7281">Talona recognizes your worth. Go with your life.</string>
<string name="7282">Take this weapon, and no more. Ask for any further and you will risk the Lady of Poison&apos;s fury!</string>
<string name="7283">Talona will not accept these demands! You get nothing, and risk death on top of it! Be grateful for your life and leave!</string>
<string name="7284">Then die for your insult! My brethren are everywhere!</string>
<string name="7285">Perhaps we&apos;ll forge it into a shovel and make a gift of it to the city stables. That would be fitting.</string>
<string name="7286">Besides, I visited the dig in the Peninsula district. They need to hire outsiders like you. Their own brethren are falling like flies.</string>
<string name="7287">Go on with you, I got no reason to talk and you&apos;ve got no reason to ask.</string>
<string name="7288">Not everyone is as stupid as you. I have spies and they say you have a letter from Oleff. You don&apos;t look like you deliver his mail.</string>
<string name="7289">Well, I helped myself to some of their belongings. Got a fine quill off one of them. Jacob was his name, I think.</string>
<string name="7290">He won&apos;t be needing it. I assume he&apos;s dead. He didn&apos;t react much when I rolled him over to go through his pockets.</string>
<string name="7291">Take this path and I&apos;m gone for good, fool! Walk in their shadow or walk with me! Either way, this is never mentioned again! Choose!</string>
<string name="7292">Hmph! Puppet! Peon! Shove your trinket, your morals, and your blind righteousness where the light of Tyr doesn&apos;t shine!</string>
<string name="7293">I will wait here. Think of your worth, and I will be waiting here.</string>
<string name="7294">Bring me their &quot;holy artifacts.&quot; They will be despoiled and twisted. Your evil intent is a welcome addition to our cause.</string>
<string name="7295">The Lady of Poison revels in disease and all that corrupts the body. She is at her greatest when all others are laid low.</string>
<string name="7296">That said... this plague is not her doing, though we are quite happy to accept tribute from people trying to appease her anyway.</string>
<string name="7297">Talona is life and death in balance, but death is the stronger. She is to be worshipped and feared, lest she strike you down when you are weakest.</string>
<string name="7298">Talona awaits.</string>
<string name="7299">You know a Moonstone Mask woman? Tamora?</string>
<string name="7300">You knows moonstone Mask woman. Tamora?</string>
<string name="7301">Nothing. Farewell.</string>
<string name="7302">Nothing. Nevermind. Byes.</string>
<string name="7303">See this brooch? Hers. And now you die! </string>
<string name="7304">Me gots her brooch. Me kill yous for her!</string>
<string name="7305">See her brooch? Good. Now I rough you up!</string>
<string name="7306">Me gots brooch from her! Now me kick yous butt!</string>
<string name="7307">No deal. You die!</string>
<string name="7308">No! You come near her again, you&apos;ll be sorry!!</string>
<string name="7309">No ways! You trouble her, you be sorry!!</string>
<string name="7310">I&apos;m listening. What&apos;s your offer?</string>
<string name="7311">Me maybe listen. What you gots?</string>
<string name="7312">You are just evil. I like that. I&apos;ll take it.</string>
<string name="7313">Hehe, that pretty slimy. Hehe. You got deal.</string>
<string name="7314">Get lost. I don&apos;t know you. We got no reason to talk.</string>
<string name="7315">What do you want? I ain&apos;t got nothing to say to no strangers. Probably muggers and crap.</string>
<string name="7316">Just leave me be! I ain&apos;t going near that woman again! it just ain&apos;t worth it!</string>
<string name="7317">Heh! Tamora will just be furious that I have her brooch. Furious! I love it. What a tart.</string>
<string name="7318">Idiot.</string>
<string name="7319">Maybe. She&apos;s a fine little bint. Likes it when you treat her like garbage. Oh, wait, no. *I* like it when I treat her like garbage. Ha!</string>
<string name="7320">What&apos;s it to you? She send you to do something about it? Hah! I don&apos;t believe it.</string>
<string name="7321">Hey hey HEY! Just hold on! Maybe we can make a deal? Or something? Here, look, maybe you want gold?</string>
<string name="7322">All right, all right! She isn&apos;t worth it! Yeesh!</string>
<string name="7323">I thought so. You wouldn&apos;t have met her in the first place if you were pure and all that.</string>
<string name="7324">Here, I&apos;ll pay you 200 gold for her brooch. I got the money to spare, and it will drive her nuts that I have it. Hehe.</string>
<string name="7325">Wow, in the books it&apos;s a lot harder to corrupt people. You got a deal, friend. She&apos;ll be livid. That little strumpet. She loves it.</string>
<string name="7326">I would speak with you... and perhaps more.</string>
<string name="7327">Me talk with yous? Maybe more?</string>
<string name="7328">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7329">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bemoan about how no one really respects you.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7330">Let&apos;s talk about you, and what you like.</string>
<string name="7331">You listen well? Does talking make your &quot;clients&quot; more relaxed?</string>
<string name="7332">Perhaps I could ask some serious questions?</string>
<string name="7333">We talk about you. You pretty.</string>
<string name="7334">You listen? Talking make customers feel more happy?</string>
<string name="7335">Maybe me ask serious stuffs, okay?</string>
<string name="7336">Where are you from? What is your story?</string>
<string name="7337">Where you from? What your story?</string>
<string name="7338">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;d find it degrading to disguise my true self like that.</string>
<string name="7339">I want to talk about something else.</string>
<string name="7340">Me talk about different things.</string>
<string name="7341">&lt;StartAction&gt;Lament the inherent loneliness of the adventurer lifestyle.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7342">Nothing bothers me. I am strong.</string>
<string name="7343">Me strong. Nothing hurt me.</string>
<string name="7344">Whatever, harlot. I&apos;m not here to talk.</string>
<string name="7345">Shaddap. Me not here for words, lap-lady.</string>
<string name="7346">There&apos;s more than talking, right?</string>
<string name="7347">We not just talk, right?</string>
<string name="7348">Here is a Pass Coin. My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="7349">Here my Pass Coin. Me called &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="7350">I don&apos;t have a Pass Coin.</string>
<string name="7351">Me not gots Pass Coin.</string>
<string name="7352">I should be going.</string>
<string name="7353">Me should go, maybe.</string>
<string name="7354">I&apos;ll stay a while, I think.</string>
<string name="7355">Me not so dumb. Me stay.</string>
<string name="7356">I must leave. Farewell.</string>
<string name="7357">Me gots to go. Bye.</string>
<string name="7358">Perhaps we could... retire to your bedchambers, my lady?</string>
<string name="7359">Maybe we go sleep now? Nicely, I mean.</string>
<string name="7360">Let&apos;s knock boots, honey!</string>
<string name="7361">Let&apos;s make two-butt beast!</string>
<string name="7362">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="7363">Know anything about plague?</string>
<string name="7364">Shouldn&apos;t you be ashamed of working here?</string>
<string name="7365">You feel dirty? Maybe ashamed?</string>
<string name="7366">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s very selfless, giving of yourself like that.</string>
<string name="7367">A prostitute with a heart of gold. Oh, that&apos;s new.</string>
<string name="7368">Lap-lady with the heart of gold. That really new.</string>
<string name="7369">Don&apos;t make me go upside your head!</string>
<string name="7370">&lt;StartAction&gt;Confide that you might have a big role in curing the plague.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7371">I enjoyed our time together. I hope you did as well.</string>
<string name="7372">Me like you. Hope you like me a little.</string>
<string name="7373">Another notch on my sword, woman. Nothing more.</string>
<string name="7374">You just one more for the road. Ha!</string>
<string name="7375">Welcome to the Moonstone Mask. My name is Luce. Is there aught I can do for you, gentle sir?</string>
<string name="7376">Good day, sir. My name is Luce. I trust you wish your visit to the Moonstone Mask to be a pleasant one.</string>
<string name="7377">Good day to you... fine sir. My name is Luce. Take heart. We of the Moonstone Mask are skilled at looking for worth beneath any distasteful surface.</string>
<string name="7378">Well, aren&apos;t you sweet, but remember that a Pass Coin only entitles you to my time. Anything beyond that is my discretion. I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll get along fine, though.</string>
<string name="7379">Me? Tonight I am whatever you wish. I am a confidant and a friend, if that is what you need me to be. </string>
<string name="7380">Well, a long time ago I was born to a loving family. And now I am here with you. Nothing is more important than that right now.</string>
<string name="7381">Well, then it is fortunate that I am not you. I give comfort where it is needed. What do you do, besides malign the choices of others?</string>
<string name="7382">Goodbye. Perhaps we&apos;ll talk another time. Just remember to provide a Pass Coin. They are available from the bartender.</string>
<string name="7383">Important people are not often able to confide with people that care. I am a surrogate and a friend, if need be. Tell me, what bothers you?</string>
<string name="7384">Of course you feel that way. Many people in power have a sense of yearning that just can&apos;t seem to be filled, despite their great responsibilities.</string>
<string name="7385">You can let it all go with me. I am not here to judge, or to laud your position. I am here with you, stripped of your trappings.</string>
<string name="7386"> How serious is &quot;serious?&quot; I try not to worry my companions unnecessarily, but I will endeavor to talk about whatever you like.</string>
<string name="7387">I am sure you are quite capable, but is your emotional armor so perfect? There is no shame in needing a kind word now and then.</string>
<string name="7388">For instance, you seem a roguish type. Irreverent. Perhaps someone that enjoys playing with people. Sometimes that can keep companions at a distance.</string>
<string name="7389">For instance, you look very in tune with nature. A good calling, but perhaps it keeps your companions at a distance?</string>
<string name="7390">For instance, you look very devout, and sure of your spiritual side. That can sometimes keep friends at a distance if they don&apos;t understand.</string>
<string name="7391">For instance, you seem very learned of arcane matters. Perhaps it sometimes keeps companions at a distance? Some people react with suspicion to such things.</string>
<string name="7392">For instance, you look like someone familiar in the use of weapons. That affinity for battle can keep companions at a distance sometimes. </string>
<string name="7393">I can close that distance, if you like. That&apos;s why I&apos;m here, and likely that&apos;s why you are here too.</string>
<string name="7394">I am sorry, m&apos;lady, but my company is open to males alone. You might wish to see if Tanith is free. </string>
<string name="7395">I think you should reconsider your tone. A Pass Coin purchases my time, not my will. If I am not pleased with your behavior, this encounter will end.</string>
<string name="7396">I will try to abide your gruff demeanor, but remember that a Pass Coin buys my time, not my will. If your words displease me, this encounter will end.</string>
<string name="7397">Very well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Now, tell me a little something about yourself. What&apos;s on your mind? We are very good listeners here at the Mask.</string>
<string name="7398">Well, I regret to inform you that I cannnot speak with you unless you have one. I&apos;m sorry. See the bartender if you wish to purchase one.</string>
<string name="7399">That is your option, but I must tell you that you will have to purchase another Pass Coin to speak with me again. Do you still wish to leave?</string>
<string name="7400">Another time, then. See the bartender for additional Pass Coins.</string>
<string name="7401">I thought you might. Shall we talk some more, perhaps?</string>
<string name="7402">I hardly think so. No, I have every right to refuse such a... distasteful advance. There is an art to this. You can&apos;t just charge like a bull.</string>
<string name="7403">Your simple charms suit you well. I like you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You please me. Perhaps your suggestion is one we should... pursue?</string>
<string name="7404">Such a gentleman. You know, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I think I quite like you. I think your suggestion is worth pursuing. </string>
<string name="7405">Not just yet. Patience is a virtue. Perhaps we should spend a little more time getting to know each other.</string>
<string name="7406">Follow me, my dear. Let&apos;s leave these bright lights off for awhile.</string>
<string name="7407">Nothing, and I couldn&apos;t say if I did. Call it superstitious, but Ophala was very explicit in requesting that we don&apos;t talk of it.</string>
<string name="7408">This really isn&apos;t the time or place for such things. Let&apos;s get back to you, and what you need.</string>
<string name="7409">Of course. Our time can be spent any way that you wish. Within reason, of course. Mood is so important.</string>
<string name="7410">You&apos;re true to yourself, and you follow the path that you&apos;ve chosen because it is right for you. That&apos;s the mark of a strong man.</string>
<string name="7411">Ehh... perhaps we should spend a little more time getting to know each other. A lot more. I don&apos;t judge, but you are working against your... rough exterior.</string>
<string name="7412">Look, if you want someone to kick you in the head there are special rooms for that in some of the dirtier dockside taverns.</string>
<string name="7413">My job is to listen and further a positive dialogue. If you don&apos;t want that, the door is behind you. Now... (ahem)... You were saying?</string>
<string name="7414">This talk is over. Get out before I call the guards.</string>
<string name="7415">No, I&apos;ve been mistreated enough for today. I&apos;m off. Go somewhere else.</string>
<string name="7416">Many people come here not knowing what it is they want. I try to make them comfortable. I try to ease what bothers them.</string>
<string name="7417">I&apos;m done with you. That was hurtful and inappropriate.</string>
<string name="7418">Some people just need a sympathetic ear. More than you would think, actually. I hope I make a difference in their lives.</string>
<string name="7419">Shouldn&apos;t you reserve your judgment for your own actions? I stand before you unashamed. Who are you to project your fears on me?</string>
<string name="7420">Now, shall we return to our pleasant chat, or will you exercise your right to use the door behind you?</string>
<string name="7421">Well, that certainly is a lot of pressure. So many people relying on you, even if they don&apos;t know it. That must weigh on your mind.</string>
<string name="7422">I can&apos;t help you in whatever task you percieve is yours, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I can try to ease your mind. I don&apos;t expect anything from you.</string>
<string name="7423">Sorry, I&apos;m a bit tired today. I&apos;ve been thinking of taking a little time off. Maybe doing some travelling or some such. </string>
<string name="7424">Ah, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I trust you are well? I hope I had some impact on you. Some people have trouble recognizing when they really need someone to talk to.</string>
<string name="7425">Perhaps one of the others can assist you? I&apos;m sure they will be more than welcoming.</string>
<string name="7426">Yes, silly, I like you fine. Don&apos;t let people get you down saying you are... uh... slow. You&apos;re a charmer, you are.</string>
<string name="7427">&lt;FirstName&gt;, you are ever the perfect gentleman. You needn&apos;t worry. No judgments, remember?</string>
<string name="7428">&lt;FirstName&gt;, you a fine companion. I must admit that you seemed... unpolished when I first spoke with you, but your manner is deceiving. You are a gentleman.</string>
<string name="7429">I want to ask questions about the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="7430">Me want some informations about Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="7431">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7432">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="7433">What kind of service is offered here?</string>
<string name="7434">What can you tell me about the owner of this place?</string>
<string name="7435">You know anything about the bad plague?</string>
<string name="7436">What they do here? What service you get?</string>
<string name="7437">Know anything about owner here?</string>
<string name="7438">What do you know about attempts at a cure?</string>
<string name="7439">You know about cure attempts maybe?</string>
<string name="7440">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="7441">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="7442">I don&apos;t work here. I&apos;ve questions about the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="7443">Me not work here. Me gots questions about Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="7444">I am not here for your amusement, dog!</string>
<string name="7445">Me not here for you, jerk.</string>
<string name="7446">Farewell.</string>
<string name="7447">Bye bye.</string>
<string name="7448">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; What did you almost say? You can tell me.</string>
<string name="7449">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; What you almost say? Tell me, &apos;s okay.</string>
<string name="7450">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, you can tell little old me. Can&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="7451">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe yous can tell me? Hmmm, pretty boy?</string>
<string name="7452">Tell me, or I twist your head off!</string>
<string name="7453">You tell me, or me break yous head!</string>
<string name="7454">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Doesn&apos;t the plague discourage... close contact?</string>
<string name="7455">A den of sin. It has no place in a moral city!</string>
<string name="7456">This a bad place! No good for good city!</string>
<string name="7457">Is there something you want? If not, please stand further away. Your looks may take interest away from me.</string>
<string name="7458">Yes? Is there something you want? I usually only have time to speak with the ladies when I visit here.</string>
<string name="7459">Greetings to you. Here, stand a bit closer. I look positively dashing next to you.</string>
<string name="7460">Very well. Let me know if I go too fast for you.</string>
<string name="7461">Very well. I have a few moments. What is it?</string>
<string name="7462">Don&apos;t speak of that! People come here to get away from such talk. They might shut this place down if people get too worried.</string>
<string name="7463">Goodbye. Perhaps we&apos;ll talk another time.</string>
<string name="7464">Companionship, in whatever form that means to you. The employees here are adept in discourse, games, and are especially good at listening.</string>
<string name="7465">Suffice to say that she runs a clean, much needed establishment. You won&apos;t find anyone to badmouth her.</string>
<string name="7466">Ophala is a saint of a woman. Anyone saying otherwise had best keep a close eye on... well, this isn&apos;t for me to talk about.</string>
<string name="7467">Well, greetings to you, my fair, fair lady. Would you care to share my company awhile?</string>
<string name="7468">Hello there. Let&apos;s have a look at you. Nothing spectacular, but fair enough. Would you care to share my company?</string>
<string name="7469">No, no, no, you&apos;re not what I had in mind at all. Get yourself back under whatever rock you crawled from.</string>
<string name="7470">Fair day to you, ma&apos;am.</string>
<string name="7471">Very well, though perhaps we&apos;ll discuss compensation later?</string>
<string name="7472">That&apos;s a relief. From your tone I was worried that Ophala might have lost her taste in companions. Leave me, then.</string>
<string name="7473">Ah, you&apos;re an intellectual charmer as well. Very well, I&apos;ll answer what I can.</string>
<string name="7474">Well, you certainly have a charming manner. Perhaps I can be a bit more... free with you. Very well.</string>
<string name="7475">Ehh, don&apos;t do that. You&apos;lll put me off my supper. Sorry, but you&apos;re just not my... ah... type.</string>
<string name="7476">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose it wouldn&apos;t hurt. It&apos;s not like people don&apos;t know. They just don&apos;t talk about it.</string>
<string name="7477">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I really don&apos;t want to be making an enemy of Ophala. She&apos;s a great source of... comfort in these times.</string>
<string name="7478">Ophala dabbles in... artful theft. She&apos;s arranged expensive losses for many of her detracters, though usually just as trophy victories.</string>
<string name="7479">It&apos;s a challenge to her, and I&apos;ve heard of nobles playfully offering their homes as targets, though maybe they only say that after.</string>
<string name="7480">Okay, okay! It&apos;s not like she makes things a big secret, so there&apos;s no need to get violent. Take it easy.</string>
<string name="7481">She doesn&apos;t do it herself, of course. She hires subtle sneaksmen, though I hear the plague has taken her favorites.</string>
<string name="7482">They know a lot about everyone, and that knowledge keeps the Moonstone Mask from being closed by the more prudish of the community.</string>
<string name="7483">Bite your tongue! That would be the greatest tragedy of them all. Imagine the decline in morale from that!</string>
<string name="7484">No, Ophala has taken special precautions to avoid any such worries. You&apos;ll realize that, should you decide to... partake.</string>
<string name="7485">And by what authority do you speak? Your god? There are other gods. Your laws? There are other laws.</string>
<string name="7486">No one is here against their will. There is a prestige to this place, and many a great name has come just to talk with an attentive listener.</string>
<string name="7487">You won&apos;t get far around here if you damn things just because they personally offend you. That&apos;s intolerance, not morality.</string>
<string name="7488">Nothing, but I know that I won&apos;t live in fear. I will mourn, and I may die, but I will do it at the bar with my friends and in talented company.</string>
<string name="7489">Well hello. I am &lt;FullName&gt;. Will you answer some questions?</string>
<string name="7490">I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;. I have a few questions.</string>
<string name="7491">I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;. Just answer my questions.</string>
<string name="7492">Me &lt;FullName&gt;. Maybe me ask some questions?</string>
<string name="7493">Me &lt;FullName&gt;. You just answer questions and stop yappin&apos;.</string>
<string name="7494">Farewell for now.</string>
<string name="7495">Bye bye, okay?</string>
<string name="7496">What kind of place do you run here?</string>
<string name="7497">What kind of stuff happens here?</string>
<string name="7498">Know any rumors? Seen anything strange?</string>
<string name="7499">Maybe you knows things? Seen weird stuffs?</string>
<string name="7500">You knows anything abouts the plague, maybe?</string>
<string name="7501">Have you heard anything about the plague?</string>
<string name="7502">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You can trust me. What&apos;ve you got to say?</string>
<string name="7503">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Trust me, okies? Yeah, &apos;s all good.</string>
<string name="7504">I will get them. Give me more details.</string>
<string name="7505">Me help get art stuff. Know where they is?</string>
<string name="7506">This does not interest me.</string>
<string name="7507">This is not my concern.</string>
<string name="7508">Tell me about these art objects.</string>
<string name="7509">So you want some pretty stuff? What is they?</string>
<string name="7510">No! Me demands more!</string>
<string name="7511">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You must agree that I am worth more.</string>
<string name="7512">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You knows me worth more than that.</string>
<string name="7513">I demand more! Pay or prepare to suffer!</string>
<string name="7514">Me wants more, or me hurt you good!</string>
<string name="7515">That is sufficient. Thank you.</string>
<string name="7516">That really good. Thanks for the stuff.</string>
<string name="7517">I don&apos;t care! I demand more!</string>
<string name="7518">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; And if they stopped, you might have to sell those secrets.</string>
<string name="7519">Come now, madam. Don&apos;t keep secrets between us.</string>
<string name="7520">You pretty. Tell me stuff. No secrets.</string>
<string name="7521">I&apos;m interested in the backroom.</string>
<string name="7522">Tell about backroom stuff for me. Yeah.</string>
<string name="7523">Don&apos;t play games. Tell me or shut the hell up.</string>
<string name="7524">Stupid word games! Just say or shut up! </string>
<string name="7525">I want permission to access the backrooms.</string>
<string name="7526">Me wants in backroom place. Sounds fun.</string>
<string name="7527">A common bawdy house! I am outraged!</string>
<string name="7528">Bunch o&apos; harlots and jigg-o-lers! You sick!</string>
<string name="7529"></string>
<string name="7530"></string>
<string name="7531"></string>
<string name="7532"></string>
<string name="7533"></string>
<string name="7534"></string>
<string name="7535">I already have a writ from him. Here.</string>
<string name="7536">Me gots it already. Uh, the paper, not plague.</string>
<string name="7537">Thank you. I&apos;ll return directly.</string>
<string name="7538">Okies, me come back soon.</string>
<string name="7539">I have an art object you might be interested in.</string>
<string name="7540">Me gots art crap you might like.</string>
<string name="7541">&lt;StartAction&gt;Describe securing the Statuette from Androd Golden.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7542">&lt;StartAction&gt;Describe securing the Portrait from Thoms Rumbottom.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7543">&lt;StartAction&gt;Describe securing the Urn from Hodge.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7544">Nothing. Nevermind.</string>
<string name="7545">I have a writ from Oleff declaring me plague free.</string>
<string name="7546">Me gots Oleff to say me not sick! Here paper!</string>
<string name="7547">This is nothing but a house of ill-repute!</string>
<string name="7548">This a dirty place! Filthy dirty!</string>
<string name="7549">What business do you need done?</string>
<string name="7550">You needs business or something done?</string>
<string name="7551">Well now, welcome to the Moonstone Mask. I am Ophala, your host and purveyor of fine spirits and entertainment.</string>
<string name="7552">Do come again. We&apos;re always open.</string>
<string name="7553">Well, you are quite the charmer, aren&apos;t you? Ask away.</string>
<string name="7554">My staff won&apos;t respond well to that attitude, you know. If you expect any quality of service you had better work on your tone.</string>
<string name="7555">I&apos;ll answer what I can. Just yell if I go too fast for you.</string>
<string name="7556">I won&apos;t have it spoken of within these walls. This is a place away from those... horrible concerns. Don&apos;t upset my customers, understand?</string>
<string name="7557">Look, you seem to be a likable person, so why don&apos;t you ask people yourself. It&apos;s not my business to tattle on my customers.</string>
<string name="7558">I have seen deals, secrets, and strange rendezvous, none of which are any business of yours. Please stay and enjoy, but stay out of people&apos;s... affairs.</string>
<string name="7559">There are... a few that are perhaps a bit unseemly, but everyone is welcome here. If I gave out secrets my customers would stop coming.</string>
<string name="7560">It&apos;s a place of comfort and understanding. That has different meanings to different people, so we have a wide variety of services.</string>
<string name="7561">I can&apos;t expect you to understand if this is your first visit. Most of what goes on here is quite innocent. Ah... most.</string>
<string name="7562">Perhaps you would be interested in partaking of our backroom areas? Or maybe you could be of use... no, I talk too freely.</string>
<string name="7563">Greetings to you again, &lt;CUSTOM710&gt;. Have you come to sample the delights of our company in the backroom, or is this about... business?</string>
<string name="7564">Greetings. Are you with &lt;CUSTOM710&gt;? They were the only other new person I&apos;ve spent much time with lately. Is this visit for pleasure or business?</string>
<string name="7565">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose there&apos;s no harm in me telling you what I need. Maybe you can help, if you&apos;re good enough.</string>
<string name="7566">You see, I&apos;m an avid... collector. My position here lets me hear about interesting things, and I occasionally hire people to get them for me.</string>
<string name="7567">Currently, I want a few pieces of art &quot;liberated.&quot; The owners of them have made disparaging remarks about me, and I would like to express my displeasure.</string>
<string name="7568">One is a statuette of someone&apos;s mother, or some such. Lord Androd Golden has it at his estate. He lobbied to ban city guards from visiting the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="7569">Listen anyway, so if you change your mind you will know where to go. The Rumbottom estate is in the Blacklake district. Androd&apos;s is in the Docks district.</string>
<string name="7570">Another is a portrait of Sir Reginald Rumbottom III. His nephew, Lord Thoms Rumbottom, has repeatedly lobbied to have us closed down. He&apos;s a bit... insecure, I think.</string>
<string name="7571">Last I heard, Hodge may have been in the Blacklake district. No doubt he&apos;s fortified himself in some noble&apos;s home, but I don&apos;t know which.</string>
<string name="7572">I&apos;m not asking you to kill. Just bring me the items. I&apos;ll reward you well.</string>
<string name="7573">Excellent. The Rumbottom estate is in the Blacklake district, while Androd maintains a home in the Docks district. Both are notoriously paranoid.</string>
<string name="7574">That is the last of them. These items were very personal to me, and I am more than willing to sweeten what I have already paid.</string>
<string name="7575">Here, take this 400 gold and a little something special. You deserve it.</string>
<string name="7576">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You drive a hard bargain, but I suppose it was worth it. This was a headache I am glad to have cured.</string>
<string name="7577">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I do not wish to downplay your role, but the proper reward was given. Appreciate that, and take pride in your service.</string>
<string name="7578">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I would not want to make light of your... mental condition, but you are wrong. I paid you what you deserved.</string>
<string name="7579">Please, feel free to spend some of your reward in the backroom. Provided you have met the conditions for entry, of course. Feel free to ask.</string>
<string name="7580">This diamond is all that I can afford. The plague has really cut into our clientele.</string>
<string name="7581">I&apos;m not a big fan of appeasement as a means to deter threats. I&apos;d ask that you look around and carefully consider your position.</string>
<string name="7582">Tsk. So be it. The people I meet. Yeesh.</string>
<string name="7583">The last is an urn stolen from me some years ago. The man that took it apparently got stuck here in the quarantine. Hodge is his name.</string>
<string name="7584">I am especially happy to see that women are visiting. As you can see, it seems that men are more inclined to seek comfort here in times of crisis.</string>
<string name="7585">You&apos;ll have stiff competition for attention tonight, I fear. Many more men than women are seeking comfort here tonight, it seems.</string>
<string name="7586">You could view it that way. It&apos;s in their best interests to behave while here, and it&apos;s in my best interests to keep close tabs when they don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="7587">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I need someone I can trust. I&apos;m happy to wait.</string>
<string name="7588">Well, aren&apos;t you just the cutest little buffoon. Very well, I&apos;ll tell you what I need and you can decide if you can help.</string>
<string name="7589">You&apos;ve certainly got a silver tongue. Almost good enough for my backroom. How about I tell you what I need, and you decide if you can help.</string>
<string name="7590">You&apos;d have to be an exceptional specimen for that to work on me. You&apos;re an amateur compared to my men in the back.</string>
<string name="7591">There&apos;s no need for that tone! I suppose... I suppose I do need a rougher kind of person. I don&apos;t have to like it, though.</string>
<string name="7592">If you agree, I&apos;ll tell you what I know about their whereabouts. Keep in mind that if I had exact information, I wouldn&apos;t need you.</string>
<string name="7593">Well, we have many pleasant employees that are willing to offer their comfort and sympathy to you in this troubled time.</string>
<string name="7594">They can cater to both men and women, and are quite skilled at conversation, artful pursuits, and many other forms of diversion.</string>
<string name="7595">The level of interaction must be agreed to by both parties, and there is the small matter of compensation for the time spent, as well.</string>
<string name="7596">Look, there is nothing going on here but the consensual exchange of gold for service. Besides, most people just want to talk.</string>
<string name="7597">I&apos;d suggest you control your outbursts if you wish to remain in my good graces. I&apos;ve no patience for false purity.</string>
<string name="7598"></string>
<string name="7599"></string>
<string name="7600"></string>
<string name="7601"></string>
<string name="7602"></string>
<string name="7603"></string>
<string name="7604"></string>
<string name="7605">I&apos;m sure you do. Very well. First, you will need a writ from Oleff in the Temple of Tyr, certifying you are plague free. Just a precaution, you understand.</string>
<string name="7606">Return to me when you have it and I will grant you a key... as well as take your 200 gold donation. Pretty standard fare.</string>
<string name="7607">Eh, from the state of you, I&apos;d have him look for Footman&apos;s Trouser Gout as well. Can&apos;t be too careful in this day and age.</string>
<string name="7608">Here is the paper. Oleff will recognize it. I&apos;ll make sure there is room in the back for you. Hurry back.</string>
<string name="7609">Well, when you phrase it like that, how can I not be intrigured. I was looking for a number of things. What have you got?</string>
<string name="7610">You do? I have been looking for a few things. Tell me what it is that you have?</string>
<string name="7611">Please don&apos;t tease me so. I have ever so many empolyees that do it better than you.</string>
<string name="7612">Very good. I never did like his work, but I certainly couldn&apos;t allow him to retain this piece. Especially not since things soured between us.</string>
<string name="7613">I appreciate that you brought it, but the murder of Androd was wholly unnecessary! I heard about what a bloody matter it was!</string>
<string name="7614">Thank you. I never cared for his uncle, but Thoms had this painted on some rather sensitive parchment. I couldn&apos;t leave it in his care.</string>
<string name="7615">The portrait is painted on a rather sensitive document, but that was no excuse for killing Thoms. He was no fighter.</string>
<string name="7616">There&apos;s no real value to the urn, but I love messing with Hodge. If you happened to spoil some scheme he was working on, all the better.</string>
<string name="7617">Here, I&apos;ll pay you now for this piece. Excellent work. 400 gold should satisfy your pockets.</string>
<string name="7618">I&apos;m paying less for this bungled affair. You should have restrained yourself. 200 gold is what you get.</string>
<string name="7619">There is more for you to retrieve. Return when you have it and I&apos;ll reward you. I&apos;ll give more when all three objects are in my possession, as well.</string>
<string name="7620">Besides, this might get him off my back. He doesn&apos;t care much for the Moonstone Mask. I think he&apos;s... got a condition.</string>
<string name="7621">He probably didn&apos;t even know there was anything wrong with the painting, and he didn&apos;t deserve to die for simply opposing the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="7622">Well that seems to be just fine. Yes, yes I think you&apos;ll be all right. I&apos;ll gladly give you a key to the backroom.</string>
<string name="7623">There is just the small matter of a Pass Coin. Purchase one and you can spend as long as you like with one of our friendly staff.</string>
<string name="7624">You can get the coins from the bartender for 200 gold. Remember to be on your best behavior. The coins buy you time, not consent. Only gentle persuasion grants that.</string>
<string name="7625">Begging your pardon, but don&apos;t you already have a key to the back room? All you need now is to purchase Pass Coins from the bartender.</string>
<string name="7626">Well, my concerns are my own, but perhaps you could be useful... I don&apos;t know though.</string>
<string name="7627">Just take the paper you have. Oleff will recognize it. I&apos;ll make sure there is room in the back for you. Hurry back.</string>
<string name="7628"></string>
<string name="7629">I would speak with you... and perhaps more.</string>
<string name="7630">Me talk with yous? Maybe more?</string>
<string name="7631">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7632">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bemoan about how no one really respects you.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7633">Let&apos;s talk about you, and what you like.</string>
<string name="7634">You listen well? Does talking make your &quot;clients&quot; more relaxed?</string>
<string name="7635">Perhaps I could ask some serious questions?</string>
<string name="7636">We talk about you. You pretty.</string>
<string name="7637">You listen? Talking make customers feel more happy?</string>
<string name="7638">Maybe me ask serious stuffs, okay?</string>
<string name="7639">Where are you from? What is your story?</string>
<string name="7640">Where you from? What your story?</string>
<string name="7641">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;d find it degrading to disguise my true self like that.</string>
<string name="7642">I want to talk about something else.</string>
<string name="7643">Me talk about different things.</string>
<string name="7644">&lt;StartAction&gt;Lament the inherent loneliness of the adventurer lifestyle.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7645">Nothing bothers me. I am strong.</string>
<string name="7646">Me strong. Nothing hurt me.</string>
<string name="7647">Whatever, harlot. I&apos;m not here to talk.</string>
<string name="7648">Shaddap. Me not here for words, lap-lady.</string>
<string name="7649">There&apos;s more than talking, right?</string>
<string name="7650">We not just talk, right?</string>
<string name="7651">Here is a Pass Coin. My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="7652">Here my Pass Coin. Me called &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="7653">I don&apos;t have a Pass Coin.</string>
<string name="7654">Me not gots Pass Coin.</string>
<string name="7655">I should be going.</string>
<string name="7656">Me should go, maybe.</string>
<string name="7657">I&apos;ll stay a while, I think.</string>
<string name="7658">Me not so dumb. Me stay.</string>
<string name="7659">I must leave. Farewell.</string>
<string name="7660">Me gots to go. Bye.</string>
<string name="7661">Perhaps we could... retire to your bedchambers, my lady?</string>
<string name="7662">Maybe we go sleep now? Nicely, I mean.</string>
<string name="7663">Let&apos;s knock boots, honey!</string>
<string name="7664">Let&apos;s make two-butt beast!</string>
<string name="7665">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="7666">Know anything about plague?</string>
<string name="7667">Shouldn&apos;t you be ashamed of working here?</string>
<string name="7668">You feel dirty? Maybe ashamed?</string>
<string name="7669">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s very selfless, giving of yourself like that.</string>
<string name="7670">Harsh. Aren&apos;t you supposed to have a heart of gold?</string>
<string name="7671">Harsh. Where&apos;s your heart of gold and stuff?</string>
<string name="7672">&lt;StartAction&gt;Confide that you might have a big role in curing the plague.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7673">What&apos;s that about your other clients?</string>
<string name="7674">You gots problems with someone?</string>
<string name="7675">You&apos;re having problems? Perhaps it *should* be my business.</string>
<string name="7676">You gots trouble? Maybe it good me help, maybe?</string>
<string name="7677">Don&apos;t tease! Tell me about your client or shut the hell up!</string>
<string name="7678">Stupid! Say about client or be more quiets!</string>
<string name="7679">What&apos;s in it for me?</string>
<string name="7680">What me get?</string>
<string name="7681">Perhaps I can look into it. I&apos;ll see.</string>
<string name="7682">Maybe me try find this jerk.</string>
<string name="7683">I&apos;ll maybe take a look. Now, about that chat?</string>
<string name="7684">Me maybe look, but first we talk.</string>
<string name="7685">I&apos;ll just go look into this. </string>
<string name="7686">Me go check it out.</string>
<string name="7687">I&apos;m here as a Moonstone Mask customer.</string>
<string name="7688">Me here for pretty ladies. Heeh.</string>
<string name="7689">What business do you mean? Are you having trouble?</string>
<string name="7690">I&apos;m here about the business with Hoff.</string>
<string name="7691">Me here about Hoff.</string>
<string name="7692">What business you mean? Me don&apos;t get it.</string>
<string name="7693">I hope you enjoyed our time together. </string>
<string name="7694">Hope you happy. Me happy if you happy.</string>
<string name="7695">Like I care? You&apos;re another notch on my sword.</string>
<string name="7696">Heh... me not care. Got what me wanted.</string>
<string name="7697">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7698">Here&apos;s your brooch. Hoff doesn&apos;t have it.</string>
<string name="7699">Here brooch. Hoff gots nothing.</string>
<string name="7700">Hoff is dead. Here is your brooch.</string>
<string name="7701">Hoff whack dead! Here your brooch.</string>
<string name="7702">Sorry to hear that.</string>
<string name="7703">That too bad.</string>
<string name="7704">He&apos;s dead. Here&apos;s your brooch.</string>
<string name="7705">He dead. Here your pin-thing.</string>
<string name="7706">Nothing.</string>
<string name="7707">He&apos;s scared now. Here&apos;s your brooch.</string>
<string name="7708">He scaredy-baby now. Here your brooch.</string>
<string name="7709">Well good. Now, how about some chatting?</string>
<string name="7710">Good then. Now maybe we &quot;talk.&quot;</string>
<string name="7711">Well, welcome to the Moonstone Mask, handsome stranger! I&apos;m Tamora, and I&apos;ll be your dream for the evening. Won&apos;t you be mine?</string>
<string name="7712">Greetings and such. I&apos;m Tamora. What can the friendly staff of the Moonstone Mask do for you today?</string>
<string name="7713">Whoop. No sir, Tamora ain&apos;t doing charity cases today. The Moonstone Mask is judgment free, but I got eyes. You ugly.</string>
<string name="7714">Wow, ever the gent. Not like some other jerks. Well, pony up a Pass Coin and you have my time. More than that... we&apos;ll see.</string>
<string name="7715">Me? This really isn&apos;t about me. I&apos;m what you want, and nothing more. Besides, can you believe anything I say when you&apos;re paying for it?</string>
<string name="7716">Doesn&apos;t really matter, does it? I&apos;m from here. I&apos;ll be here long enough for you. Let&apos;s be happy with that. I am.</string>
<string name="7717">Too bad for you, I guess. People hide from each other all the time. I just tell you about it upfront.</string>
<string name="7718">Bye then. If you come back, make sure you bring a Pass Coin. I can&apos;t say all that much, otherwise.</string>
<string name="7719">I guess. It&apos;s more to see whether I like them or not. They confide and I show them support. Do you need that sort of thing? What bothers you?</string>
<string name="7720">Well, you might have reason to feel that way. Maybe you deserve it. I don&apos;t know. I never really understood how some people can have so much and still be empty.</string>
<string name="7721">I&apos;m not here to judge or anything. I mean, everyone needs sympathy, no matter how much they enjoy their life.</string>
<string name="7722">Not likely. I don&apos;t let things get to me. Not usually, anyway. People really have to try to get under my skin. </string>
<string name="7723">Tough talk, but I know a lot of guys that act like that, but turn out to be big kittens. What about you?</string>
<string name="7724">Maybe you feel lonely or not as well-liked as you should be? It&apos;s not like you don&apos;t need companions. You came here, didn&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="7725">Of course, you could just be here because you don&apos;t need the pain of trying to work through real relationships. No shame in that.</string>
<string name="7726">Sorry little lady, I&apos;m not your type. You&apos;ll have to go talk to Tanith. He&apos;s a big sweety.</string>
<string name="7727">Oh, a tough guy. I have enough clients like that, but that ain&apos;t your business. You want my time? Get a Pass Coin and an attitude adjustment.</string>
<string name="7728">Maybe, if you are less of a jerk. I&apos;ve had enough from... well, enough of that. Pony up a Pass Coin and we&apos;ll start with a little chat.</string>
<string name="7729">Very well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Now, tell me a little something about yourself. What&apos;s on your mind? I listen well enough, if that&apos;s what you want.</string>
<string name="7730">What, I&apos;m supposed to talk for free? I don&apos;t think so. Pay the bartender for the Coins. He&apos;s got plenty.</string>
<string name="7731">If you want, but you can&apos;t just start back where we leave off. If you come back, you&apos;ll have to pay again. So, you going?</string>
<string name="7732">Another time, then. See the bartender for additional Pass Coins.</string>
<string name="7733">Well good. Let&apos;s chat a little more. You&apos;ve got some interesting things to say. Really. I mean that. Yeah.</string>
<string name="7734">Slow down! This ain&apos;t a calf roping. You charge ahead and the only thing you&apos;ll get is my foot in your butt. Trust me, you wouldn&apos;t like it.</string>
<string name="7735">You are a lovable little simpleton, ain&apos;t you. I like you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I like you just fine. Let&apos;s have a little fun, you and me.</string>
<string name="7736">Such a gentleman. You know, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I think I quite like you. I think your suggestion is worth pursuing. </string>
<string name="7737">Let&apos;s talk a bit more. You aren&apos;t the type to move too fast, are you? Nah, you want to last awhile. Let&apos;s talk some more.</string>
<string name="7738">Follow me. We&apos;ll put the lights out for a while.</string>
<string name="7739">Whoa, none of that. Ophala doesn&apos;t want it spoken of in here. Figures that would be like inviting it in.</string>
<string name="7740">Of course. We can talk all night, if you want. Your coin is in the bank and there&apos;s no one beating down the door.</string>
<string name="7741">Ehh... perhaps we should spend a little more time getting to know each other. A lot more. I don&apos;t judge, but you are working against your... rough exterior.</string>
<string name="7742">Hah! Whatever. I&apos;m here because the money is good. It&apos;s really good. Nice people, too... mostly. The ones that aren&apos;t will get dealt with.</string>
<string name="7743">I get people talking, loosen them up a bit, and maybe we spend some time in the dark. It&apos;s like life, but less of a burden. Beats farming.</string>
<string name="7744">I suppose. I don&apos;t think about it. I just like putting on the masks. Not everyone wants a deep chat about life, either.</string>
<string name="7745">And some people just want to talk and don&apos;t care if the person really listens.</string>
<string name="7746">If I&apos;m supposed to feel ashamed, what are you supposed to feel like? You&apos;re the one supporting the profession. No one forced you in here.</string>
<string name="7747">Now, shall we return to our pleasant chat, or will you exercise your right to use the door behind you?</string>
<string name="7748">What are you doing here, then? Yeesh. I mean, I&apos;m sure it&apos;s a lot of pressure, but shouldn&apos;t you get to it?</string>
<string name="7749">If you&apos;re looking for some fun, I&apos;m off the market for the moment. It&apos;s been a trying bunch of days, let me tell you.</string>
<string name="7750">Wow, you&apos;re a moron. Better than being a jerk like... well, enough of that. Pony up a Pass Coin and we&apos;ll have a little chat.</string>
<string name="7751">Ain&apos;t none of your business, as I said. Now, did you want some engaging discourse or are you just wasting my time?</string>
<string name="7752">You &quot;not gots&quot; a lot more than that, friend. The bartender can help you get some coins, but the rest... I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="7753">You&apos;ll help me? Right! Tell you what, I&apos;ll fill you in and we&apos;ll see just how much help you provide.</string>
<string name="7754">Not that being ugly is the worst thing. I&apos;m just stressed enough dealing with one of the worst clients... But that ain&apos;t your business.</string>
<string name="7755">Well maybe I should just have you kicked out or... or maybe you&apos;re just the kind of jerk I need to deal with another jerk.</string>
<string name="7756">See, I&apos;ve got this guy who&apos;s decided he really likes tormenting me. He follows me around and some of my good clients get threatened... that sort of thing.</string>
<string name="7757">Guy&apos;s name is Hoff. Hangs out at the Docks. Big controller. How about you give him a message? Preferably on the end of your boot.</string>
<string name="7758">I don&apos;t know. Applause? Look, if you want to do a good deed, go do it. I don&apos;t need to be in debt to another jerk.</string>
<string name="7759">Don&apos;t get to it soon or anything. Here, take this brooch so Hoff knows I sent you. Be careful with it! I want it back when you&apos;re done!</string>
<string name="7760">Now, I suppose we can spend a little time chatting first if you want, but I need this taken care of eventually.</string>
<string name="7761">You&apos;d better take a look. I already gave you my brooch so Hoff knows I sent you. I&apos;d better get it back when this is all done, too!</string>
<string name="7762">You&apos;ll need to track &lt;CUSTOM621&gt; down. He said he&apos;d help too, and I gave the jerk my brooch so that Hoff would know I sent him!</string>
<string name="7763">Gee, thanks for that stirring pledge. Here, take my brooch so Hoff will know I sent you. Be careful! I want it back when all this is done!</string>
<string name="7764">You&apos;d better! I already gave you my brooch so Hoff would recognize you! I want it back when all this is done, you know!</string>
<string name="7765">Thanks, but you&apos;ll have to track down &lt;CUSTOM621&gt; to do it. I already gave the jerk my brooch so Hoff would know I sent him. </string>
<string name="7766">I wouldn&apos;t have given it up if this wasn&apos;t important. That Hoff... I don&apos;t know about him. Remember, he&apos;s in the Docks somewhere.</string>
<string name="7767">I wouldn&apos;t have given it if this wasn&apos;t important. That Hoff... I don&apos;t know about him at all. Careful in the Docks when you are looking.</string>
<string name="7768">Thanks. Remember, he won&apos;t believe I did this if you don&apos;t have the brooch. Those Dock boys are thick skulled.</string>
<string name="7769">Nope, you is still ugly. I mean, I need your help, but that price is just too high. Maybe later if you help me just this once? Please?</string>
<string name="7770">Here, take this brooch so Hoff knows I sent you. Be careful with it! I want it back when this is done!</string>
<string name="7771">I mean, I already gave you my brooch so that Hoff knows I sent you. I&apos;ll want it back when all this is done, too.</string>
<string name="7772">You&apos;ll have to track down &lt;CUSTOM621&gt;. I gave the jerk my brooch so Hoff would know I sent him. I&apos;ll want it back when all this is done, too.</string>
<string name="7773">Hello there. You here for business or pleasure? Before you say &quot;pleasure is your business,&quot; let me remind you that I&apos;ll kick you square if you do.</string>
<string name="7774">Whoa, I don&apos;t think so. I mean, it looks like they used your face to take the harsh edges off an ugly stick.</string>
<string name="7775">And your name was... ? Just kidding! Really, &lt;FirstName&gt;, it&apos;s nice of you to come back and say that. It is. You were fun.</string>
<string name="7776">And, I might add, you&apos;re a bit of good stuff. Your... determination and flexibilty are mightily impressive. Trust me.</string>
<string name="7777">Not the most creative of nights, but determination sure made up for any lack of... flexibility. Really.</string>
<string name="7778">And I wouldn&apos;t be concerned. Your impressive... flexible nature more than make up for any... ah... shortcomings. Really.</string>
<string name="7779">Nothing spectacular, maybe, but nice. Don&apos;t worry. No judging in the Moonstone Mask about any kind of... ah... shortcomings. Mostly.</string>
<string name="7780">Yeah, yeah, the first time always brings out the pathetic joker in some people. You don&apos;t impress me.</string>
<string name="7781">Oh, and what do you have to tell me?</string>
<string name="7782">Yes yes. Just leave me to my business.</string>
<string name="7783">Son of a bitch! Hoff got my brooch! That&apos;s the last time I trust anyone!</string>
<string name="7784">Whatever. I&apos;m not talking to anyone anymore. I can&apos;t believe this!</string>
<string name="7785">Oh... soooo... someone sold it to him and then stole it back? I suppose that will teach him a lesson or something... I guess.</string>
<string name="7786">This is just confusing me. It&apos;s like people are going out of their way to make things difficult. I&apos;m taking some time off. I don&apos;t know... </string>
<string name="7787">Don&apos;t tease me with this garbage.</string>
<string name="7788">More than I wanted... but I&apos;m not going to shed a tear over him. He was a real jerk. Thanks.</string>
<string name="7789">Don&apos;t be expecting a great reward or anything. I don&apos;t have much beyond gratitude and a good thought.</string>
<string name="7790">That should keep him away then. Hopefully he doesn&apos;t start bugging anyone else. He might end up dead. That would be a shame.</string>
<string name="7791">Okay... sooo.... someone sold it to him and then killed him to get it back? I guess that&apos;s what I wanted.</string>
<string name="7792">Tsk. Nooooo, I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;m just not feeling the love right now. Let&apos;s talk a bit more, and maybe you&apos;ll get a little friendlier?</string>
<string name="7793">Remember, no kissing.</string>
<string name="7794">I would speak with you... and perhaps more.</string>
<string name="7795">Me talk with yous? Maybe more?</string>
<string name="7796">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7797">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bemoan about how no one really respects you.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7798">Let&apos;s talk about you, and what you like.</string>
<string name="7799">You listen well? Does talking make your &quot;clients&quot; more relaxed?</string>
<string name="7800">Perhaps I could ask some serious questions?</string>
<string name="7801">We talk about you, handsome kinda guy.</string>
<string name="7802">You listen? Talking make customers feel more happy?</string>
<string name="7803">Maybe me ask serious stuffs, okay?</string>
<string name="7804">Where are you from? What is your story?</string>
<string name="7805">Where you from? What your story?</string>
<string name="7806">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;d find it degrading to disguise my true self like that.</string>
<string name="7807">I want to talk about something else.</string>
<string name="7808">Me talk about different things.</string>
<string name="7809">&lt;StartAction&gt;Lament the inherent loneliness of the adventurer lifestyle.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7810">Nothing bothers me. I am strong.</string>
<string name="7811">Me strong. Nothing hurt me.</string>
<string name="7812">Whatever, plaything. I&apos;m not here to talk.</string>
<string name="7813">Shaddap. Me not here for words, lap-lad.</string>
<string name="7814">There&apos;s more than talking, right?</string>
<string name="7815">We not just talk, right?</string>
<string name="7816">Here is a Pass Coin. My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="7817">Here my Pass Coin. Me called &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="7818">I don&apos;t have a Pass Coin.</string>
<string name="7819">Me not gots Pass Coin.</string>
<string name="7820">I should be going.</string>
<string name="7821">Me should go, maybe.</string>
<string name="7822">I&apos;ll stay a while, I think.</string>
<string name="7823">Me not so dumb. Me stay.</string>
<string name="7824">I must leave. Farewell.</string>
<string name="7825">Me gots to go. Bye.</string>
<string name="7826">Perhaps we could... retire to your bedchambers?</string>
<string name="7827">Maybe we go sleep now? Nicely, I mean.</string>
<string name="7828">Forget the talk. Let&apos;s wrassle!</string>
<string name="7829">Let&apos;s make two-butt beast!</string>
<string name="7830">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="7831">Know anything about plague?</string>
<string name="7832">Shouldn&apos;t you be ashamed, working here?</string>
<string name="7833">You maybe ashamed of working here?</string>
<string name="7834">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s very selfless, giving of yourself like that.</string>
<string name="7835">What *I* need? Right. You do this to help others. Ha!</string>
<string name="7836">Me not that stupid! You not here to help!</string>
<string name="7837">Don&apos;t make me go upside your head! I&apos;ve always wanted to say that.</string>
<string name="7838">&lt;StartAction&gt;Confide that you might have a big role in curing the plague.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7839">I enjoyed our time together. I hope you did as well.</string>
<string name="7840">Me like you. Hope you like me a little.</string>
<string name="7841">Just another victim, boy.</string>
<string name="7842">You one of many. Hehe. Me done with you.</string>
<string name="7843">Just lay with me. That is enough.</string>
<string name="7844">Maybe we just lay still. That good.</string>
<string name="7845">Gentle comforts are welcome. I&apos;m not that tired.</string>
<string name="7846">Gentle night, maybe. Me not that tired.</string>
<string name="7847">I&apos;m looking for an animal. Think you can manage?</string>
<string name="7848">Make me tired. Real tired. Animal man.</string>
<string name="7849">Welcome to the Moonstone Mask. I am Tanith. What would the lady like for this evening? What is your pleasure?</string>
<string name="7850">Good day, ma&apos;am. I am Tanith. I shall endeavor to make your visit to the Moonstone Mask a pleasant one.</string>
<string name="7851">Well... good day... fine lady. My name is Tanith. I shall endeavor to be what you need in a companion... with no judgment... mostly.</string>
<string name="7852">I am certain, my lady, that we shall have a fine time. Have you a Pass Coin? A formality, as I am sure our talk will be... enjoyable.</string>
<string name="7853">Me? Tonight I am whatever you wish. I am a confidant and a friend, if that is what you need me to be. </string>
<string name="7854">I was raised in a home with five sisters. When I left, I didn&apos;t really fit in with the dock workers or loggers. I don&apos;t count that as a loss.</string>
<string name="7855">I understand. As a woman you may have been forced to hide your true feelings on occasion. I don&apos;t appreciate the tone of your comment, but I understand. </string>
<string name="7856">Goodbye. Perhaps we&apos;ll talk another time. Just remember to provide a Pass Coin. They are available from the bartender.</string>
<string name="7857">Important people are not often able to confide with people that care. I am a surrogate and a friend, if need be. Tell me, what bothers you?</string>
<string name="7858">Of course you feel that way. Many people in power have a sense of yearning that just can&apos;t seem to be filled, despite their great responsibilities.</string>
<string name="7859">You can let it all go with me. I am not here to judge, or to laud your position. I am here with you, stripped of your trappings.</string>
<string name="7860">If that is what you wish. I don&apos;t recommend it, but I will accomodate you as best I can. </string>
<string name="7861">I am sure you are quite capable, but is your armor so perfect? Women in power are sometimes convinced that need equals weakness.</string>
<string name="7862">For instance, you seem a roguish type. Irreverent. Perhaps someone that enjoys playing with people. Sometimes that can keep companions at a distance.</string>
<string name="7863">For instance, you look very in tune with nature. A good calling, but perhaps it keeps your companions at a distance?</string>
<string name="7864">For instance, you look very devout, and sure of your spiritual side. That can sometimes keep friends at a distance if they don&apos;t understand.</string>
<string name="7865">For instance, you seem very learned of arcane matters. Perhaps it sometimes keeps companions at a distance? Some people react with suspicion to such things.</string>
<string name="7866">For instance, you look like someone familiar in the use of weapons. That affinity for battle can be threatening, and keep people at a distance.</string>
<string name="7867">I can close that distance, if you like. That&apos;s why I&apos;m here, and likely that&apos;s why you are here too.</string>
<string name="7868">I am sorry, m&apos;lord, but my company is open to the ladies alone. You might wish to see if Tamora or Luce are available.</string>
<string name="7869">That tone will not do you much good here. A Pass Coin may purchase my time, but a line such as that is more at home on the tavern floor.</string>
<string name="7870">There&apos;s no need to be quite so.. gruff. Merely supply your Pass Coin and we will continue. I assume you will adopt a more pleasant voice?</string>
<string name="7871">Very well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Now, tell me a little something about yourself. What&apos;s on your mind? We are very good listeners here at the Mask.</string>
<string name="7872">Well, I regret to inform you that I cannnot speak with you unless you have one. I&apos;m sorry. See the bartender if you wish to purchase one.</string>
<string name="7873">That is your option, but I must tell you that you will have to purchase another Pass Coin to speak with me again. Do you still wish to leave?</string>
<string name="7874">Another time, then. See the bartender for additional Pass Coins.</string>
<string name="7875">I thought you might. Shall we talk some more, perhaps?</string>
<string name="7876">My dear, dear woman, I will be more than happy to accomodate you... eventually. Let&apos;s just... go a little slower. Gutter-talk can be had anywhere.</string>
<string name="7877">Your simple charms suit you well. I like you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but let me first ask what it is you expect. I&apos;ll need to know my boundaries.</string>
<string name="7878">Such a lady. I would be open to that, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but let me first ask you what it is you expect. What my boundaries are.</string>
<string name="7879">Not just yet. i want a sense of who you are. I can&apos;t be properly attentive if I don&apos;t know you well enough.</string>
<string name="7880">What do you wish from me? How far should I go? Did you wish my simple arms for the night, or are you wanting more... masculine charms?</string>
<string name="7881">Sorry, but Ophala want&apos;s no talk of that. Call a devil&apos;s name and you invite him in. We want the Moonstone Mask to be an escape.</string>
<string name="7882">Of course. Our time can be spent any way that you wish. Within reason, of course. Mood is so important.</string>
<string name="7883">You&apos;re true to yourself, and you follow the path that you&apos;ve chosen because it is right for you. That&apos;s the mark of a woman that understands what she needs.</string>
<string name="7884">Do not take this the wrong way but... my lady, I will need just a bit longer to bask in your... inner beauty first.</string>
<string name="7885">Look, if you want someone to fight with, you can look for an adversary outside. I will not be baited into a war of words.</string>
<string name="7886">My job is to listen. If you can&apos;t believe that I might be honest when I do so, the door is behind you. Now... You were saying?</string>
<string name="7887">This talk is over. Get out.</string>
<string name="7888">I really don&apos;t have the heart for this today. I don&apos;t need the criticism.</string>
<string name="7889">Many people come here not knowing what it is they want. I try to make them comfortable. I try to ease what bothers them.</string>
<string name="7890">In fact, I think I&apos;ve just about had it with you. Take your problems with you when you go.</string>
<string name="7891">Some people just need a sympathetic ear. I try to show the kind or restraint and understanding they may not have had from the men in their lives.</string>
<string name="7892">People think the women of this profession are immoral, but that I am some kind of licentious devil. That&apos;s their burden, not mine.</string>
<string name="7893">If you see me as dishonest, I won&apos;t be able to change your mind. The door is behind you. Feel free to use it. Or stay.</string>
<string name="7894">Well, that certainly is a lot of pressure. So many people relying on you, even if they don&apos;t know it. That must weigh on your mind.</string>
<string name="7895">I can&apos;t help you in whatever task you perceive is yours, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I can try to ease your mind. You can be vulnerable here.</string>
<string name="7896">I apologize, but I am no longer working and my time is my own. I hope this doesn&apos;t inconvenience you.</string>
<string name="7897">Ah, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are looking well. I trust our encounter has left you with fond memories?</string>
<string name="7898">Perhaps one of the others can assist you? I&apos;m sure they will be more than welcoming.</string>
<string name="7899">Your manner will never be a question with me, dear woman. Don&apos;t let your lovely simple heart be polluted. Ever.</string>
<string name="7900">&lt;FirstName&gt;, you are ever the perfect lady.</string>
<string name="7901">I was concerned at first, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You were a little... unpolished when we first spoke, but your manner warmed considerably. Ever the perfect lady.</string>
<string name="7902">Well... I am quite sure that can be arranged. Follow me. Hold tight. Hang on.</string>
<string name="7903">I&apos;m certain that I can accomodate you, my lady. Follow me, and I shall douse these harsh lights. </string>
<string name="7904">I understand. Rest ye well, my lady. I will watch over you.</string>
<string name="7905">An unnecessary comment. I am sorry I could not draw a more genuine response from you.</string>
<string name="7906">I&apos;ve got a pass for the Gauntlet.</string>
<string name="7907">Me gots Gauntlet pass.</string>
<string name="7908">Anything interesting in this tavern?</string>
<string name="7909">Anything neat in this place?</string>
<string name="7910">Let&apos;s see what you have for sale.</string>
<string name="7911">What&apos;s you got for sale?</string>
<string name="7912">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7913">Give me the earnings for the week.</string>
<string name="7914">You give money made this week, maybe?</string>
<string name="7915">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come on, what harm is there in telling me?</string>
<string name="7916">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Why you not tell? Nobody care if me know.</string>
<string name="7917">I don&apos;t want to resort to force, but I will if you don&apos;t tell me.</string>
<string name="7918">Me not want to fight, but me will if you not tell.</string>
<string name="7919">The Trade of Blades? What&apos;s that?</string>
<string name="7920">Trade of Blades? What that?</string>
<string name="7921">What is the Gauntlet, specifically?</string>
<string name="7922">What the Gauntlet be?</string>
<string name="7923">Why is this a big secret?</string>
<string name="7924">Why this all so secret-like?</string>
<string name="7925">What do I have to do now that I own the bar?</string>
<string name="7926">What me gots to do with this place now that me own it?</string>
<string name="7927">Greetings. Got a particular need this fine day?</string>
<string name="7928">Another time, friend.</string>
<string name="7929">Nothing that needs to be said out in the open. Nope, nothing at all.</string>
<string name="7930">Well met, Boss. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="7931">Shh. Don&apos;t say it so loud. Here&apos;s a key. Go on down when you want. It&apos;s the door in the center of the south wall. There are stairs leading down to the basement.</string>
<string name="7932">You&apos;ve already got a key. Go on down to the Gauntlet, if you want. It&apos;s the door in the center of the south wall. There are stairs down to the basement.</string>
<string name="7933">There haven&apos;t been many customers since the Gauntlet shut down, but the plague is the real cause of how slow it&apos;s been here. Business is literally dying off.</string>
<string name="7934">Sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but it hasn&apos;t been long enough to work the books out. Gotta wait a week between payments.</string>
<string name="7935">Here&apos;s what was made. 50 gold. Like I said... not a lot.</string>
<string name="7936">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Look, if you really want in on what happens here, you&apos;ll have to get a pass from a mercenary in the Trade of Blades. Then we&apos;ll talk.</string>
<string name="7937">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I don&apos;t think so. It&apos;s nothing that concerns you.</string>
<string name="7938">Hmm, maybe you&apos;d fit right in, but it doesn&apos;t matter. Not unless you get a pass from a mercenary in the Trade of Blades. Then we&apos;ll talk.</string>
<string name="7939">If you don&apos;t know, I doubt you&apos;ll be back. It&apos;s the mercenary guild in the northwest of the City Core. That&apos;s all I&apos;m saying.</string>
<string name="7940">Hey there. Not much happening here now that we&apos;ve got a new owner. Still a good bar, though.</string>
<string name="7941">It&apos;s a contest open to people who believe there is nothing more basic than defending yourself against someone meaning to do you harm.</string>
<string name="7942">Look, it ain&apos;t exactly safe for people to get in a pit and slug it out. We&apos;ve had accidents... a couple people lost limbs... </string>
<string name="7943">You win, you get a rank and a few cheers. You lose, you get dusted off and try again. It&apos;s about knowing your worth in a fight.</string>
<string name="7944">The city guards think it&apos;s a bloodsport, but it&apos;s not. It&apos;s about honor in battle, but they don&apos;t understand. The guards just see what they want to.</string>
<string name="7945">Look, if you want to try, that&apos;s up to you. just don&apos;t blab about it, and don&apos;t complain if you lose. People don&apos;t like that.</string>
<string name="7946">Well, the last owner, Claudus, he set things up so he didn&apos;t have to do a thing. He was always busy with this or that.</string>
<string name="7947">Anyway, all you need to do is come in every week or so and I&apos;ll give you the profits that we&apos;ve made. You won&apos;t get rich, but it&apos;s better than nothing.</string>
<string name="7948">Besides, I can tell you&apos;d rather be out adventuring and such. You look like the type. It sounds dangerous to me, but I bet there&apos;s good coin in it.</string>
<string name="7949">Damn you! Damn you all! Fine! You won! So what! Proves nothing! I was Champion for months! Everyone knows that! Everyone knows... </string>
<string name="7950">That&apos;s it for you! You got past Agar, but it stops here. No one beats Claudus. Just ask! No one beats me! This place is mine!</string>
<string name="7951">You... beat Fashi, hmm? I suppose you think you are tough?! Well, don&apos;t get cocky. Agar will put you in your place.</string>
<string name="7952">You beat Hrusk, eh? Not surprising. He&apos;s been here weeks and hasn&apos;t got out of round one. He&apos;s ruled it, but he hasn&apos;t gotten past it.</string>
<string name="7953">New blood? Good! Remember, you fight one round at a time and get a medal for each victory. It&apos;s for glory alone. There&apos;s no prize.</string>
<string name="7954">Take the place. Go on, you are the owner now, but I&apos;ve told my friends to leave. The Gauntlet goes with me! BAH!</string>
<string name="7955">Beaten? Proves nothing! Where are they?! I want to talk to the piece of garbage that beat me!</string>
<string name="7956">Oh course, if you beat all three rounds, you get to fight me. Then maybe you win the whole damn bar! Trust me, that will never happen.</string>
<string name="7957">He&apos;d never beat me, but then, no one can. That&apos;s why I put the bar up as a reward. People stopped trying.</string>
<string name="7958">And if he doesn&apos;t, I will. Nobody beats me. If you think you&apos;ll walk out of here with MY bar, you are mistaken!</string>
<string name="7959">Claudus got beat! It&apos;s worth closing the Gauntlet to see him get taken down.</string>
<string name="7960">You got a Third Round Medal! I bet you might even be able to take Claudus! Maybe... &lt;StartAction&gt;(hushed)&lt;/Start&gt; if he didn&apos;t have an &quot;in&quot; with the healer... </string>
<string name="7961">You know, you are pretty tough if you got past Fashi for that Second Round Medal. Maybe you&apos;ll actually take Agar. Maybe.</string>
<string name="7962">Okay, so maybe you could get past me, but there&apos;s no way you&apos;ll beat Fashi. Can&apos;t be done. No sir.</string>
<string name="7963">Bah! I got no time for newcomers. You want respect, you step up to the Pit.</string>
<string name="7964">I never thought I&apos;d see it happen. I&apos;m gonna miss this place.</string>
<string name="7965">Impressive medal. Claudus might even have to submit to you. That would be good. &lt;StartAction&gt;(hushed)&lt;/Start&gt; I suspect he fights with an unfair advantage.</string>
<string name="7966">The medal in your possession proves you can best me, but I would prepare for a wholly different battle with Agar.</string>
<string name="7967">You have surpassed the level that Hrusk was fighting at. Very good. We shall have to see if you can best me.</string>
<string name="7968">Welcome to the Gauntlet. I look forward to seeing you present yourself in the Pit.</string>
<string name="7969">Me knew it could be done, but me not smart enough to do it. BAH! Me go back to real battles!</string>
<string name="7970">You past Third Round me! You fight good! Bet you try Claudus now! Careful, he not fight fair. Don&apos;t know how, but he not fair.</string>
<string name="7971">Hah! So you passed that Fashi smallkin? Bah! Me step on him too, one time. You prove you tough to ME next!</string>
<string name="7972">Heh, Hrusk too weak. You prove nothing beating him. Maybe Fashi test you, but he small too! Ha! Like watching children!</string>
<string name="7973">More meat for Pit? Good! Me tired of what here!</string>
<string name="7974">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7975">At least tell me about the fighters.</string>
<string name="7976">Maybe tell about fighters?</string>
<string name="7977">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7978">Bye bye.</string>
<string name="7979">What about the others?</string>
<string name="7980">What about other fighter guys?</string>
<string name="7981">What do you know about Claudus?</string>
<string name="7982">What Claudus fight like?</string>
<string name="7983">Go away, kid, you bother me.</string>
<string name="7984">Beats it, you bother me.</string>
<string name="7985">Thank you. Farewell.</string>
<string name="7986">Thanks, byes.</string>
<string name="7987">What do you know about the fighters?</string>
<string name="7988">What yous know about Fighters?</string>
<string name="7989">You watch a lot of the fights. Are they fair?</string>
<string name="7990">Is fights fair? You seem to know stuff.</string>
<string name="7991">What about the Third Round?</string>
<string name="7992">And Third Round? Whats about that?</string>
<string name="7993">What about Claudus?</string>
<string name="7994">It&apos;s you! It&apos;s &lt;FullName&gt;! I love you! I mean, I love your fighting! You took Fashi! Hell, you took Agar! </string>
<string name="7995">Hey there! You are doing pretty good! You got a good medal on you!</string>
<string name="7996">What? Why would I talk to you? You&apos;ve got no medals. Feh!</string>
<string name="7997">Sure. See you. Good luck! You&apos;re great!</string>
<string name="7998">That&apos;s right, goodbye. As if I&apos;ve got time for no-medals like you. Beat it.</string>
<string name="7999">A newcomer wants to know about the fighters? HA! Like it matters! You&apos;d have to beat the mighty Hrusk and his pet before you&apos;re even ranked!</string>
<string name="8000">Hrusk has that flaming axe, you know? Burn the hair right off you, it would. Even the short stuff!</string>
<string name="8001">Go away. I&apos;m done talking to your worthless butt.</string>
<string name="8002">I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m talking to you. I mean, sure, maybe you used to be a no-medals, but look at you now! WOW!</string>
<string name="8003">Thanks! &lt;He/She&gt; said thanks! To me! Everyone see that?! Damn right!</string>
<string name="8004">I can&apos;t believe it! &lt;CUSTOM710&gt; is just the best! The BEST! That was great!</string>
<string name="8005">Hmph... wins a few medals and gets all tight... but WOW, that &lt;FullName&gt; can fight! Did you see &lt;him/her&gt; brush me off? ME!</string>
<string name="8006">Claudus? He&apos;s just great! It&apos;s like... I don&apos;t know! It&apos;s like he&apos;s almost invulnerable! Some people complain that he&apos;s so good, but they just can&apos;t compete.</string>
<string name="8007">I mean, everything is fair, right? And he doesn&apos;t use any magic weapons or anything. Just anmial companions like everyone else. He just seems like a super fighter!</string>
<string name="8008">Agar is the Third Round Medal fight. He&apos;s real tough. He&apos;s got a pet, like everyone else, and he&apos;s got something nasty too.</string>
<string name="8009">Fashi is the Second Round Medal fight. He looks small but boy, he can sure take it. It&apos;s amazing, it is.</string>
<string name="8010">Oh, sure. I mean, each guy has a specialty and a pet, but that&apos;s all known before a fight begins, if you ask around.</string>
<string name="8011">Except for Claudus. He&apos;s got no special thing, and his pets are normal like everyone elses, but he seems super-tough anyway. He&apos;s just that good.</string>
<string name="8012">His weapon poisons. People complained at first, but they got used to it. He&apos;s just tough anyway, so he&apos;s proved his worth.</string>
<string name="8013">You just can&apos;t cut him or poke him. He&apos;s so focussed. He bruises though. I noticed that. He&apos;s not invulnerable.</string>
<string name="8014">Don&apos;t worry about that. You won&apos;t get to him. The others are plenty tough, but Claudus is just plain scary.</string>
<string name="8015">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="8016">At least tell me about the fighters.</string>
<string name="8017">Maybe tell about fighters?</string>
<string name="8018">Goodbye.</string>

<string name="8051">Oh, sure. I mean, each guy has a specialty, but that&apos;s all known before a fight begins, if you ask around.</string>

<string name="8055">Don&apos;t worry about that. You won&apos;t get to him. The others are plenty tough, but Claudus is just plain scary.</string>
<string name="8056">Made a showing for yourself downstairs, eh? Never make Champion. Not a chance. No way.</string>
<string name="8057">I knew it! I knew you could do it! Gots yourself a Champion Medal! Ask around and they&apos;ll tell you I knew you could do it!</string>
<string name="8058">Get on with you. I got no reason to talk with you.</string>
<string name="8059">First Rule of the Gauntlet: Don&apos;t shoot the food.</string>
<string name="8060">Good on you, boss, showing these rabble they could be beat. Not great for business, but worth it to see them get fed their boots.</string>
<string name="8061">You&apos;ll want to take that there pass to the bartender. He&apos;ll set you up. That&apos;s all I&apos;m saying.</string>
<string name="8062">The bartender will take your order. I&apos;m busy.</string>
<string name="8063">Goodbye for now.</string>
<string name="8064">What is your job? Do you fight?</string>
<string name="8065">I will fight for my first medal.</string>
<string name="8066">I&apos;m ready to try for the next medal round.</string>
<string name="8067">Me fight for first medal!</string>
<string name="8068">What you do? You fight?</string>
<string name="8069">Me leave for now, okay?</string>
<string name="8070">What are the rules?</string>
<string name="8071">What rules is for fight?</string>
<string name="8072">Me ready to try for next medal up thing!</string>
<string name="8073">Why is he unbeatable?</string>
<string name="8074">Why he so tough?</string>
<string name="8075">You will keep the battle fair, won&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="8076">You keeps it fair though, right?</string>
<string name="8077">Bring him on!</string>
<string name="8078">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; It should be fair. You know that.</string>
<string name="8079">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You should make it fair. That only right.</string>
<string name="8080">Do we let him give humans a bad name?</string>
<string name="8081">We not let hims give humans shame.</string>
<string name="8082">I can pay you. 400 gold will get you away.</string>
<string name="8083">Me pay you 400 gold so you free to leave.</string>
<string name="8084">You&apos;ve already been paid to keep it fair.</string>
<string name="8085">You already paid to make fair fight.</string>
<string name="8086">He is still giving humans a bad name.</string>
<string name="8087">He still shame humans.</string>
<string name="8088">No, no, I am the healer and a referee, of sorts. I make sure no one actually dies - well, animals or henchmen companions will - and I make sure the fights are fair.</string>
<string name="8089">Very well. You will be fighting Hrusk. There is a lever in the pit you can use to exit when you have won, or if you want to give up. Good luck.</string>
<string name="8090">I am sorry, someone is already fighting Hrusk for the First Round Medal. Come back in a little while.</string>
<string name="8091">Welcome to the Gauntlet. I am the healer and will tend to your wounds if you need me to do so. You know the rules of the pit, I believe?</string>
<string name="8092">Prepare. Fashi has readied himself and awaits you.</string>
<string name="8093">Ready yourself. Agar awaits in the Pit.</string>
<string name="8094">So, you are going to fight Claudus. I wish you the best of luck. He has all the odds on his side.</string>
<string name="8095">I am sorry, Fashi has already been challenged. You will have to wait to attempt this round.</string>
<string name="8096">I am sorry, Agar is already in battle. You will have to wait if you want to challenge him.</string>
<string name="8097">I am sorry, but Claudus is already in battle. You will have to wait to challenge him, unless he is defeated.</string>
<string name="8098">So, Claudus finally falls. Good. I was sick of listening to him. Didn&apos;t pay me enough to cover his lies forever.</string>
<string name="8099">As you will. The fighters will wait for another challenger.</string>
<string name="8100">The rules are simple. It is you and your resources against the gladiator and his resources. You are allowed a henchman and perhaps an animal companion, and your opponent will have assistance as well.</string>
<string name="8101">You fight until you defeat all your opponents. Anything goes in the pit, but no advance spells or potions can be in effect. All combatants have Dispel Magic cast on them at entry.</string>
<string name="8102">There are no prizes, but Claudus has put the Board Laid Bare up as a reward for anyone that can beat him in battle. No one has managed yet.</string>
<string name="8103">I try to, anyway. A friendly word of advice? Ask around about the fighters before you fight. That&apos;s all I&apos;ll say.</string>
<string name="8104">That is a discussion we can have when you fight him. Until then, you just leave it alone.</string>
<string name="8105">I have the power to do so, but I am... restricted, a little in this instance. Claudus pays for all of this, you understand. You... understand?</string>
<string name="8106">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s a risk for me... but I suppose... I suppose I should do my job for a change. You&apos;re right... </string>
<string name="8107">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You do not understand the place I am in. I wish I could help, but I can&apos;t. You will just have to try.</string>
<string name="8108">Very well. Prepare to face him. I will make sure a Dispel Magic is cast on you both. Do not waste this chance.</string>
<string name="8109">I&apos;m sorry. I took the gold once, but he&apos;ll suspect something if I keep doing this... I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="8110">No... no we shouldn&apos;t. I know... Okay, I will try and keep it fair. I just hope he doesn&apos;t notice.</string>
<string name="8111">I know but... he&apos;s going to notice. I just know it. I&apos;m sorry, I can&apos;t keep doing this.</string>
<string name="8112">Perhaps... but this doesn&apos;t make me feel any more honest. But the money could help me... </string>
<string name="8113">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="8114">Me want some informations.</string>
<string name="8115">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="8116">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="8117">Where can I go to get some action?</string>
<string name="8118">Aribeth tolerates mercenaries when Neverwinter has a standing militia?</string>
<string name="8119">You know anything about the bad plague?</string>
<string name="8120">Me wants fighting action somewheres.</string>
<string name="8121">Me thought Neverwinter had militia army. Why Aribeth allow mercenaries?</string>
<string name="8122">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You can tell me. I&apos;m up for it.</string>
<string name="8123">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me good for it! Come on!</string>
<string name="8124">Come now, there shouldn&apos;t be secrets among &lt;race&gt; kind.</string>
<string name="8125">You keep secret from &lt;race&gt; buddy? Come on!</string>
<string name="8126">Tell me or I will get violent!</string>
<string name="8127">You say or me get angry!</string>
<string name="8128">Here&apos;s my 50 gold.</string>
<string name="8129">Me take it. Here 50 gold things.</string>
<string name="8130">No thanks.</string>
<string name="8131">Not for me, okay?</string>
<string name="8132">Here there, friend. I suppose I got time to chat. Trade o&apos; Blades ain&apos;t very busy today, and I&apos;m gettin&apos; nowhere with this waitress.</string>
<string name="8133">What does you want, ha? Come on, you don&apos;t interrupt a Trade of Blades merc without good reason.</string>
<string name="8134">This better be good. I&apos;ve got a fine drink going and that waitress is makin&apos; eyes much prettier than yers.</string>
<string name="8135">By the hells, you&apos;re dumb as a post! No worries, I suppose. Brains can hold you back in this business.</string>
<string name="8136">I suppose. Make it quick, though. I have ever so many places to be. Yeah, right.</string>
<string name="8137">I know a sword can&apos;t stop it, and that makes me worthless right now. No one is hiring, except the odd noble trying to prevent looting.</string>
<string name="8138">Get on, then. I&apos;ve drinking to get to.</string>
<string name="8139">Heh, now you&apos;re talking my language. There&apos;s one place... hmm... </string>
<string name="8140">Just because we work for the highest bidder, doesn&apos;t mean we wouldn&apos;t put it on the line for this city.</string>
<string name="8141">Watch your mouth, friend. It hasn&apos;t gone unnoticed that when a few of the city guards died, she hired outsiders like you instead of coming here.</string>
<string name="8142">Yeah, you look good with a weapon. Just don&apos;t let anyone hear about it. It&apos;s not supposed to get around.</string>
<string name="8143">I don&apos;t know. This place is pretty much just for weapon fighting. No fancy stuff, just straight out brawling.</string>
<string name="8144">It&apos;s a club for fighting. We call it the Gauntlet. If you want action, that&apos;s where you go. I can sell you a pass, if you want. 50 gold.</string>
<string name="8145">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah, fine. Ain&apos;t no big thing. If you&apos;re not good enough, you get beat down anyway. Just don&apos;t blab about it.</string>
<string name="8146">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, it&apos;s better if I don&apos;t say anything. There&apos;s a rule about the Gauntlet. I forget what it is, though, because nobody talks about it.</string>
<string name="8147">There was the Gauntlet, but that was won just recently by someone. Ain&apos;t nothing there now.</string>
<string name="8148">I was gonna say the Gauntlet, but you got the fourth round medal on you right now! That&apos;s it for you, friend. You&apos;re at the top.</string>
<string name="8149">I suppose it&apos;s all right. Just don&apos;t let on it was me that said. It&apos;s not supposed to get around all that much.</string>
<string name="8150">Would I be a mercenary if I scared that easy? Right. Just back away, friend. You don&apos;t want trouble here.</string>
<string name="8151">Suit yourself. No skin off my butt.</string>
<string name="8152">But you know all this. I see you&apos;ve got a pass for the Gauntlet in the Board Laid Bare tavern already. It&apos;s in the Blacklake district.</string>
<string name="8153">You can get in with that just fine. Give it to the bartender. Just don&apos;t make trouble. It ain&apos;t exactly legal.</string>
<string name="8154">And here&apos;s your pass. Don&apos;t say where you got it, although I doubt they&apos;ll ask. Nobody talks about the Gauntlet, but people show up anyway.</string>
<string name="8155">The Board Laid Bare tavern is in the Blacklake district. Give the pass to the bartender. Good luck. You&apos;ll need it.</string>
<string name="8156">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="8157">Me want some informations.</string>
<string name="8158">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="8159">What do you know of the plague?</string>
<string name="8160">I&apos;m looking for premium equipment.</string>
<string name="8161">Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?</string>
<string name="8162">You know anything about the bad plague?</string>
<string name="8163">Me wants real good stuff. Real shiny.</string>
<string name="8164">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="8165">Let&apos;s see what you have for sale.</string>
<string name="8166">Show what yous got.</string>
<string name="8167">Hello there, then. What can the Shining Knight Arms do for someone so obviously well taken care of?</string>
<string name="8168">Yes? Is there something you need? The Shining Knight has what you need.</string>
<string name="8169">Yeah? What? Come on, come on, the Shining Knight is a business, not a charity. Let&apos;s see your gold.</string>
<string name="8170">Well, get the cobwebs out of your head and spill it.</string>
<string name="8171">I&apos;m just a merchant. What it is you want me to say?</string>
<string name="8172">It&apos;s cut into my sales, that&apos;s what I know, and my supplies are running out. My blacksmith Marrok has had to offer his services at barely above the cost of materials.</string>
<string name="8173">Always open if you&apos;ve got the gold.</string>
<string name="8174">Hmm... Not sure what you&apos;re after, really. My stock is the best you&apos;ll find for honest coin.</string>
<string name="8175">I don&apos;t have time for rumors. I guard the shop from looters and plague-sick. That&apos;s all that matters.</string>
<string name="8176">You look like you really know your way around a weapon. Maybe... yeah, what the hell. I got something special for you.</string>
<string name="8177">Of course, it&apos;s not like you&apos;d really know. I mean, I might have a special store of things for a true fighting &lt;man/woman&gt;, but you ain&apos;t one.</string>
<string name="8178">I mean, you&apos;ve already got a ward for the back room. That&apos;s where Marrok makes the good stuff. He&apos;ll set you up.</string>
<string name="8179">Take this ward stone. It will get you into the back room. There&apos;s where Marrok makes the good stuff. He&apos;ll take care of you.</string>
<string name="8180">I mean, you&apos;re not really the type that would know decent weapons and armor... wait a minute... is that a fourth round club medal... ?</string>
<string name="8181">I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to insult you. If you have that, you deserve the best. Take this ward for the backroom. Marrok will get you the good stuff.</string>
<string name="8182">I mean, I see you have a fourth round club medal there, but I already gave a ward to someone that had one.</string>
<string name="8183">There can&apos;t be two of you, you know. No, I don&apos;t think there can. I can&apos;t help you.</string>
<string name="8184">Nothing that would be worth telling to you. I mean, what are you, smart as a cow? I like you fine, but you is stupid, &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="8185">What exactly is it you do here?</string>
<string name="8186">I want you to make an item for me.</string>
<string name="8187">Here is your &lt;CUSTOM777&gt; gold. </string>
<string name="8188">I cannot afford this item.</string>
<string name="8189">I&apos;m interested in axes and armor.</string>
<string name="8190">I&apos;m interested in blunt and crushing weapons.</string>
<string name="8191">I&apos;m interested in magical swords.</string>
<string name="8192">I&apos;m interested in some of the less common weapons.</string>
<string name="8193">Nevermind, I don&apos;t want you to make the item.</string>
<string name="8194">Me get it. Here be &lt;CUSTOM777&gt; gold. You work now.</string>
<string name="8195">Me not got enough gold.</string>
<string name="8196">Me not want item now.</string>
<string name="8197">What kinds of things would &apos;component&apos; items be?</string>
<string name="8198">Me want axes and armor.</string>

<string name="8200">Me want magic sword.</string>

<string name="8205">Can I ask you some questions, Marrok?</string>
<string name="8206">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>

<string name="8243">Do you have examples? Give me some idea of what you need.</string>
<string name="8244">You got examples, maybe? Give a clue what you need.</string>
<string name="8245">Where can I get some of these components?</string>
<string name="8246">Where me get component stuff like that?</string>
<string name="8247">Is the item guaranteed to be powerful?</string>
<string name="8248">You always get better item back?</string>
<string name="8249">Okay, back to my questions about what you can make.</string>
<string name="8250">Back to questions about stuff you make, okay?</string>
<string name="8251"></string>
<string name="8252"></string>
<string name="8253"></string>
<string name="8254"></string>
<string name="8255"></string>
<string name="8256"></string>
<string name="8257"></string>
<string name="8258"></string>
<string name="8259"></string>
<string name="8260"></string>
<string name="8261"></string>
<string name="8262"></string>
<string name="8263">Back to my questions about components</string>
<string name="8264">Back to stuff about components, okay?</string>
<string name="8265">Well now, you might know your way around a fine weapon or two, eh? What can Marrok do for you?</string>
<string name="8266">Okay, I see there&apos;s some stuff on my anvil. Let me take a look and see what I can construct for you.</string>
<string name="8267">Nope, this won&apos;t do. Listen closely - there can only be two items on the forge: one component item and a specific magical weapon or suit of magic armor that goes with it. </string>
<string name="8268">Let&apos;s see... you have a diamond and a suit of magical armor. I could build you a Chromatic Breastplate - a fine suit of armor if I do say so myself. </string>
<string name="8269">But this job isn&apos;t cheap. It will cost &lt;CUSTOM777&gt; gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.</string>
<string name="8270">Always a pleasure doing business with a fine &lt;man/woman&gt; such as yourself. Stand back - you don&apos;t want to catch a hammer in the head.</string>
<string name="8271">What is that? Some special holy water? Powerful stuff. I could combine it with your suit of magical armor and make you a Scales of Truth suit. </string>
<string name="8272">If you want I can look through your inventory and backpack to see if you have anything I can combine into a powerful weapon or suit of armor. Is there anything in particular you want me to look for?</string>
<string name="8273">So, axes and armor is it? Let me just take a look at what you&apos;ve got in that pack of yours and I&apos;ll give you a list of what I can make from your inventory.</string>
<string name="8274">Of course. Not everybody&apos;s into axes, swords and maces now, are they? Let me give you a list of the exotic weapons I can make with the items in your pack.</string>
<string name="8275">Hmmm... I could combine that gargoyle skull and your suit of magical armor into a top of the line suit of Whitebone Armor. </string>
<string name="8276">That adamantite could be worked into that magic battleaxe to make a Sentinel. Fine weapon. Mighty fine weapon.</string>
<string name="8277">Ironwood. You know, I could combine the ironwood with that magic club of yours and make you a Gladiator&apos;s club.</string>
<string name="8278">Clubs, maces and hammers for you, eh? I&apos;ll just take a look at your stuff and see what we&apos;ve got to work with, then I&apos;ll give you a list of the items I can make for you.</string>
<string name="8279">There you go, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Quick as you please and the job is done. You can pick the item up from my forge.</string>
<string name="8280">Fair enough - but this isn&apos;t a charity I&apos;m running. If you don&apos;t have the gold, you don&apos;t get the item. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="8281">Fair enough - a customer always has the right to change &lt;his/her&gt; mind. Anythinge else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="8282">Okay, I know you aren&apos;t too bright so I&apos;ll speak nice and slow. It will cost &lt;CUSTOM777&gt; gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course. Do you understand?</string>
<string name="8283">Just place one component item and one magical weapon or one suit of magic armor on the forge and I&apos;ll help you out. But if the forge isn&apos;t full - like now - I can&apos;t really do my thing, can I?</string>
<string name="8284">Interesting. Ironwood would graft quite nicely to that magical mace to make a solid Ironwood Mace.</string>
<string name="8285">Hmmm... I could bond the adamantite to that magic double axe and make you a Double Axe of the Tall Kin.</string>
<string name="8286">This will work. I can combine your adamantite with your magic great axe to make a Stonefire Great Axe.</string>
<string name="8287">Ah... there&apos;s real potential here. Your adamantite and your magic greatsword will make a Harbinger Kin Greatsword.</string>
<string name="8288">Huh. Dragon blood. Not going to ask where you got that, but I can use it to turn that magic halberd into a Ravager Halberd.</string>
<string name="8289">Dragon blood is powerful stuff. If I remember right I could combine it with that magic hand axe and make an Ice Reaver Hand Axe.</string>
<string name="8290">That dragon blood will go nicely with your magic heavy flail to make a Reaver Heavy Flail.</string>
<string name="8291">Okay, here&apos;s something. I can use your adamantite and your magic katana to make a Sword Saint Katana.</string>
<string name="8292">This is interesting. By adding your diamond to your magic longsword I can make an Astral Blade Longsword.</string>
<string name="8293">You know, that diamond could be added to your magic light hammer to make a Storm Light Hammer.</string>
<string name="8294">I could work that ironwood into your magic light flail to make a Foundation Light Flail.</string>
<string name="8295">Aha - jackpot! I can use your special holy water and your magic mace to create a Mace of Disruption!</string>
<string name="8296">Look at that - fairy dust! I could combine it with your magic morning star to construct a Drone Morning Star.</string>
<string name="8297">I could use that dragon blood and your magic rapier to make a Namarra Rapier.</string>
<string name="8298">I could forge that adamantite with that magic scimitar and make you a Desert Wind Scimitar.</string>
<string name="8299">If I remember right, the adamantite can be added to your magic scythe to make a Sea Reaver Scythe.</string>
<string name="8300">You know, I could use that fairy dust and your magic short sword to make you a Feyduster short sword.</string>
<string name="8301">Hmmm... that fairy dust will work into your magic spear. I could make a Fey Spear, if you want.</string>
<string name="8302">Hey, look at this! I can use this special holy water and your magic sickle to make a Golden Sickle.</string>
<string name="8303">I bet if I take that ironwood and that two-bladed sword I can create one of those Uthgardt Ceremonial Two-Bladed Swords.</string>
<string name="8304">Okay - I can take your adamantite and your magic war hammer make you a Rune Hammer.</string>
<string name="8305">I&apos;m a weapon and armor smith, of sorts. I take component items and combine them with magic items to make even more powerful magic items. Not a bad little gig, if you can get it.</string>
<string name="8306">Nothing beats a good old sword, does it? Tried and true. Okay, let me peek inside your backpack and I&apos;ll give you a list of the wondrous blades I can make from the stuff in your inventory.</string>
<string name="8307">Well, I need stuff like Adamantine and Ironwood and Diamonds and Dragon Blood and Fairy Dust (SPIT!!) and Holy Water and Gargoyle Skulls and... and... Adamantine... </string>
<string name="8308">Hey, I&apos;m not trying to pressure you. I&apos;ve got enough business as it is. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="8309">Goodbye. Perhaps we&apos;ll talk another time.</string>
<string name="8310">Bah! Ask your questions but make it quick. I don&apos;t have time waste on pleasantries. I have important work to do.</string>
<string name="8311">You&apos;ll have to remove the items from my forge and put the proper component item and an appropriate magic item in place if you want me to make anything for you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="8312">If an item isn&apos;t on the list, you don&apos;t have the stuff I need to make it. Just pick something you&apos;re interested in having me make.</string>
<string name="8313">Hmmm... you don&apos;t seem to have the stuff I need to make a special axe or special armor. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="8314">Excellent choice. When you&apos;re ready, just place the component and appropriate magic item on the forge then come speak to me again.</string>
<string name="8315">Just say you want me to create an item for you, and if everything is in the forge as it should be we can do business.</string>
<string name="8316">If an item isn&apos;t on the list, you don&apos;t have the stuff I need to make it. Just pick something you&apos;re interested in having me make.</string>
<string name="8317">Hmmm... you don&apos;t seem to have the stuff I need to make a special blunt or crushing weapon. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="8318">Hmmm... you don&apos;t seem to have the items I need to make a special sword of any type. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="8319">If an item isn&apos;t on the list, you don&apos;t have the stuff I need to make it. Just pick something you&apos;re interested in having me make.</string>
<string name="8320">Hmmm... you don&apos;t seem to have the items I need to make a special rare or exotic weapon. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="8321">If an item isn&apos;t on the list, you don&apos;t have the stuff I need to make it. Just pick something you&apos;re interested in having me make.</string>
<string name="8322">Yes? What? Marrok is busy busy here.</string>
<string name="8323">By the hells, Durga be letting the worst rabble in here! What you want from Marrok, what, what!?</string>
<string name="8324">No, no, no, you sneak in here! You are no fighter type, I can see that plain! Get you gone from here! MY WORK IS NOT FOR AMATEURS!</string>
<string name="8325">Then I take a magic version of the item you want made, and combine the things to make something different.</string>
<string name="8326">Eh, no. See, If your weapon or armor is really powerful already, you should keep it. Just give me your low-level magic items. I can&apos;t guarantee that your fancy item won&apos;t get worse.</string>
<string name="8327">That ain&apos;t my concern. If you&apos;re the adventuring sort, you can go try and take them from monsters. I think you can get some from merchants, though.</string>
<string name="8328">Eh, I suppose. I don&apos;t like tipping my hand all that much, but I can&apos;t sell it if you don&apos;t know about it. Here, take a copy of this book. It&apos;s got all you need to know.</string>
<string name="8329"></string>

<string name="8332"></string>
<string name="8333"></string>

<string name="8335">Citizen, you should speak to me before going through this gate.</string>

<string name="8346">Relax, I&apos;m not here to hurt you.</string>
<string name="8347">Me not hurt you.</string>
<string name="8348">Who said I was here because of Ophala? Who is that?</string>
<string name="8349">Did me say Ophala? Didn&apos;t think so. Who she?</string>
<string name="8350">Your valuables!! Where are they !!! NOW!!!</string>
<string name="8351">Where your valuable stuffs! WHERE?!!</string>
<string name="8352">I&apos;m going now.</string>
<string name="8353">Me go now.</string>
<string name="8354">Yes, I&apos;m here because of Ophala, just like you said.</string>
<string name="8355">Yeah, me here because of Ophala, just like you say.</string>
<string name="8356">Where is this statue she wants? Why is it important?</string>
<string name="8357">Where this statue she want? Why it needed?</string>
<string name="8358">I swear she didn&apos;t send me here.</string>
<string name="8359">Me swear she not send me.</string>
<string name="8360">What? Who... ? Ruffian! Please, get away! </string>
<string name="8361">No! Please! Whatever you&apos;re here for, just take it and go! Tell Mistress Ophala that I&apos;m sorry I caused her distress! I&apos;m sorry!</string>
<string name="8362">You&apos;ve opened my doors, sullied my home, and you&apos;re probably rife with plague! You&apos;ve already hurt me! All for that blasted statue!</string>
<string name="8363">Everywhere! It&apos;s my home! There&apos;s a key around here somewhere! It opens everything! JUST DON&apos;T TOUCH ME!!!</string>
<string name="8364">Don&apos;t lie to me! I know! She&apos;s wanted that statue for years, and now you show up here, a thug in my home! Of course she sent you!</string>
<string name="8365">Take what you want. Just don&apos;t hurt me. I don&apos;t want anyone here, and I sure don&apos;t want Ophala breathing down my neck anymore!</string>
<string name="8366">Of course you are! I wouldn&apos;t believe you if you said you weren&apos;t. She&apos;s wanted that statue for years, and now you show up here, a thug in my home! </string>
<string name="8367">So don&apos;t play dumb or cute, I know what this is about. Tell her I&apos;m sorry, and that I won&apos;t bother her again! Take the damned statue and just get out!</string>
<string name="8368">It doesn&apos;t matter. You&apos;re either here for the statue or you&apos;re a thief and you&apos;ll take it anyway. Either way, I don&apos;t have to deal with it anymore.</string>
<string name="8369">If she didn&apos;t send you, I&apos;ll pay dearly for saying anything. If she did send you, she&apos;d have told you if you were supposed to know.</string>
<string name="8370">Suffice it to say that if you take the matron of the Moonstone Mask to a ball, make sure you don&apos;t leave with her sister.</string>
<string name="8371">No amount of tributary artwork will save your hide from her wrath. Just take it. The statue is in my dresser, along with a master key for most of my locks.</string>
<string name="8372">There&apos;s a key around here somewhere that will unlock everything... or just smash it all, I don&apos;t care. Just don&apos;t touch me!</string>
<string name="8373"></string>
<string name="8374"></string>
<string name="8375">Grovelling won&apos;t save your worthless hide! Die, scum!</string>
<string name="8376">If you want to live, you&apos;d better answer my questions!</string>
<string name="8377">You beg but me still kill you! You die now!</string>
<string name="8378">You answer me question, me let you live... maybe.</string>
<string name="8379"></string>
<string name="8380"></string>
<string name="8381">Go on, get out of here before I slit your throat!</string>
<string name="8382">You run away now or me change mind and kill you!</string>
<string name="8383">I think I&apos;ve decided to kill you after all.</string>
<string name="8384">Me kill you after all, yuh?</string>
<string name="8385"></string>
<string name="8386"></string>
<string name="8387">I don&apos;t want this to turn ugly... but you&apos;re not leaving me much choice.</string>

<string name="8389"></string>
<string name="8390"></string>
<string name="8391">Your life is in my hands - you&apos;d better not keep secrets.</string>
<string name="8392">You life in me hands - you no keep secret.</string>
<string name="8393">Either you start talking or I start removing your fingers!</string>
<string name="8394">You talk or me hack off you fingers!</string>
<string name="8395">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is it the cause or your pay that you don&apos;t want to risk?</string>
<string name="8396"></string>
<string name="8397"></string>
<string name="8398"></string>
<string name="8399"></string>

<string name="8404"></string>
<string name="8405">Please... my death will serve no purpose. Allow me to live...</string>
<string name="8406">You will get nothing from me. Come kill me, then! I will die for a greater cause than you can know!</string>
<string name="8407">There is nothing I can tell you. I am sworn to my cause. I would plead for my life, but I will only come back if released.</string>
<string name="8408">I can fight no more... I am beaten...</string>
<string name="8409">Your mercy is admirable... but it will not endear me to you. I am sworn to the inevitable. Neverwinter will fall to plague, and what comes after... you cannot know.</string>
<string name="8410">I can make no good argument for why you should spare me. I can&apos;t tell you what you want to know. I will not risk endangering what must come!</string>
<string name="8411">Your hands? The lives of all the plague-dead trickle though your hands second by second. Do not think you control anything by threatening my little life. I am nothing compared to what comes!</string>
<string name="8412"></string>
<string name="8413"></string>
<string name="8414">That is not for you to know. I cannot tell you - you would not understand what must be done.</string>
<string name="8415">You know nothing! My cause is beyond you! My payment is to stand strong while the rest of you fall to plague!</string>
<string name="8416">Kill the enemy!</string>
<string name="8417">We cannot fail in our task!</string>
<string name="8418">I don&apos;t bargain with the devil&apos;s own. To arms!</string>
<string name="8419">I&apos;ve got plenty of questions. You&apos;d better damn well have answers... </string>
<string name="8420">You beg but me still kill you! You die now!</string>
<string name="8421">You answer me questions, me let you live... maybe.</string>
<string name="8422">Where can I find him, then?</string>
<string name="8423">Where me find him, den?</string>
<string name="8424">Go tell your precious Master that he&apos;s messing with the wrong &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="8425">You tell Master guy he pick on wrong &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="8426">I grow weary of you. Prepare to die... </string>
<string name="8427">Me bored wit&apos; you. You die now... </string>
<string name="8428">With the Waterdhavian creatures we will soon have a cure. The plague will be beaten.</string>
<string name="8429">Me collects Water-whosis creatures. We gonna gets cure soon so yous gonna fail.</string>
<string name="8430">Either you start talking or I start removing your fingers... </string>
<string name="8431">You talk or me hack off fingers... </string>
<string name="8432">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Are your people immune to the plague... or do you simply know how it is spread? </string>
<string name="8433">Who is this Master of yours?</string>
<string name="8434">Is your life so worthless you will not bargain for it?</string>
<string name="8435">Who dis Master guy be?</string>
<string name="8436">You not want to bargain for yous life? You that worthless?</string>
<string name="8437"></string>
<string name="8438">You are stronger than I expected... a pity you will not survive. I&apos;m certain the master would&apos;ve preferred that you serve him.</string>
<string name="8439">Kill me if you must, but you cannot stop what comes! The People of the Eye serve the inevitable! You will wish you had never existed!</string>
<string name="8440">My life has already been given to another. Even if I die, I have already served a greater destiny than you can even comprehend.</string>
<string name="8441">Stay your wrath... this battle is lost to me... I yield.</string>
<string name="8442">As you wish, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... but I&apos;m sure the Wailing shall have its way with you long before my Master ever needs to intervene.</string>
<string name="8443">Ah, but you already have. The only reason you cannot see him is that he does not try to hide.</string>
<string name="8444">You are a fool. The plague points to a great and glorious future, and we have ensured that it did what it must! Your actions only ensure a more painful death for yourself!</string>
<string name="8445"></string>
<string name="8446">My life is far from meaningless. I serve a cause that is far greater than anything you can fathom. I walk strong among the plague-ridden knowing you can do nothing to stop it.</string>
<string name="8447">His name is not for me to reveal. Perhaps once the Wailing has run its course, he shall spell it out in corpses down the avenues.</string>
<string name="8448">There is little I can do to stay your wrath, but it doesn&apos;t matter. My death will mean nothing to you, and less to the inevitable will of my masters.</string>
<string name="8449">We walk ahead of the plague. It is the tool of far greater masters than you can comprehend. It will take you. You will rot and fall away, and in the end your death will be a blessing.</string>
<string name="8450">You will be stopped. You will take no more steps toward a cure. My master has declared that there shall be no salvation for this wretched city. It will wither and die...</string>
<string name="8451">You are an annoyance to the master, but he knows all that you do... all the steps you make. You will be shrugged aside in the end.</string>
<string name="8452">I did not say I was sent by Ophala.</string>
<string name="8453">Me say nothing about Ophala.</string>
<string name="8454">Sit your pathetic self down or I will hurt you!</string>
<string name="8455">Shut up or me kill you dead!</string>
<string name="8456">Rest easy. I am leaving.</string>
<string name="8457">Me leave. You no worry.</string>
<string name="8458">You&apos;d better hope you remember! Face me!</string>
<string name="8459">You better get better! Fights me now! </string>
<string name="8460">That&apos;s right. Stay there and no one gets hurt.</string>
<string name="8461">You stay put like rock and me not hurt!</string>
<string name="8462">Who are you, you little blighter?! Speak! Or I will call the guards to remove you!</string>
<string name="8463">By what right do you enter my home! Did Ophala put you up to this?! I demand to know! </string>
<string name="8464">Worry? Why should I worry! You are obviously a scoundrel with no true backbone! Guards! Dispatch this worm!</string>
<string name="8465">Eh... n-now then, there&apos;s no c-call for that kind of talk. I didn&apos;t mean to threaten you... Just thought I&apos;d try the old school discipline... eh? Yes... </string>
<string name="8466">Oh, but who else would put you up to this, hmm? Well if she wants that portrait, she should send real fighting men to get it!</string>
<string name="8467">Obviously Ophala means business... she s-sent capable muscle... Take what you want... I&apos;m not the fighter I once was... </string>
<string name="8468">*Sigh* Not like the old days... J-just don&apos;t hurt me... </string>
<string name="8469">What? Only a dog doesn&apos;t respect surrender! Guards! Help!</string>
<string name="8470">Take what you will... This old man can&apos;t stop you... Damn that Ophala... </string>
<string name="8471">I am no concern of yours. Walk away.</string>
<string name="8472">You turn around and leave!</string>
<string name="8473">Shut your mouth and be quiet or I kill you!</string>
<string name="8474">Shut up or me kill!</string>
<string name="8475">Relax, I won&apos;t hurt you.</string>
<string name="8476">Me not hurt you.</string>
<string name="8477">Callers for the master don&apos;t arrive like this! Your finery is betrayed! Are you bandit?!</string>
<string name="8478">I&apos;m waiting for an answer. What are you doing in my kitchen! Probably a bandit!</string>
<string name="8479">Vermin in my kitchen. What mangey dog choked you up? Hmm? Bandit! Thief!</string>
<string name="8480">What are you doing in my kitchen?! Speak up, or I call the guards!</string>
<string name="8481">Save your words. You&apos;ll get nothing from me. If you are looking for Master Hodge, he&apos;s already gone. You&apos;d think the bugger knew someone was coming.</string>
<string name="8482">He&apos;s taken his master keys with him. I couldn&apos;t help you if I wanted, which I don&apos;t. I don&apos;t get involved in the affairs of Master Hodge. I don&apos;t need the grief.</string>
<string name="8483">If you share a relationship with him, I don&apos;t know which of you is worse off. Now get! My muffins are burning!</string>
<string name="8484">Oh no, you aren&apos;t going to try those excuses on me. I gave a warning once, and now I&apos;m through! GUARDS!</string>
<string name="8485">I have recovered one of the reagents for the cure.</string>
<string name="8486">&lt;StartAction&gt;Explain about the Cockatrice in the Docks district.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="8487">&lt;StartAction&gt;Explain about the Dryad in the Blacklake district.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="8490">I need to talk to you.</string>
<string name="8491">I came as quickly as I could, Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="8492">Me got one of them Waterdeep monster things for cure!</string>
<string name="8493">Me need talk at you.</string>
<string name="8494">I have the last of the reagents from the Waterdhavian creatures.</string>

<string name="8499">&lt;StartAction&gt;Explain about the Cockatrice in the Docks district.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="8500">I was delayed by Fenthick.</string>
<string name="8501">You were waiting for me? Why?</string>
<string name="8502">I&apos;m here now. Say what you have to say.</string>
<string name="8503">Me come as quick as me can.</string>
<string name="8504">Fenthick want talk at me first.</string>
<string name="8505">Why you wait for me?</string>
<string name="8506">Me here now. You speak.</string>
<string name="8507">It will be an honor to serve you, Lady Aribeth!</string>
<string name="8508">I serve no master but myself!</string>
<string name="8509">I&apos;ll help you... for a price.</string>
<string name="8510">Me be honored for serve you, Aribeth!</string>
<string name="8511">Me serve no one but me!</string>
<string name="8512">Me help you... if you give gold!</string>
<string name="8513">I have heard such rumors before.</string>
<string name="8514">What became of these creatures?</string>
<string name="8515">Time&apos;s wasting. Get to the point, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="8516">Me heard that before.</string>
<string name="8517">What happen to magic monsters?</string>
<string name="8518">You boring. Hurry up.</string>
<string name="8519">And then the Academy was attacked.</string>
<string name="8520">So you think someone within the Academy betrayed you.</string>
<string name="8521">But Academy got attacked.</string>
<string name="8522">Me not understand - you say Academy betray you?</string>
<string name="8523">How may I serve you in this, Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="8524">Let me guess, you want me to get those creatures back.</string>
<string name="8525">What you want me do now, Aribeth?</string>
<string name="8526">You want me go get monster back for you?</string>
<string name="8527">Why did you choose me for this?</string>
<string name="8528">Shouldn&apos;t the city watch be helping in this?</string>
<string name="8529">I will do as you command, Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="8530">I&apos;ll do it, but the rewards better be worthwhile!</string>
<string name="8531">Why you pick me?</string>
<string name="8532">Why city guards no do this?</string>
<string name="8533">Me do as you command, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="8534">Me do it, but it better be worth me time!</string>
<string name="8535"></string>
<string name="8536">How do we even know the creatures are still alive?</string>
<string name="8537"></string>
<string name="8538">How you even know monsters still alive?</string>
<string name="8539">I will begin my search for the Waterdhavian creatures at once!</string>
<string name="8540">I need to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="8541">Me go find monsters right now!</string>
<string name="8542">Me got questions me want ask you.</string>
<string name="8543">What do you think of Desther?</string>
<string name="8544">Tell me about Fenthick.</string>
<string name="8545">It would be nice to know a little more about the Lady I&apos;m working for.</string>
<string name="8546">Now that me is working for you, me want know more &apos;bout you.</string>
<string name="8547">You tell me &apos;bout Fenthick now, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="8548">What you think &apos;bout Desther.</string>
<string name="8549">What can you tell me about the attack on the Academy?</string>
<string name="8550">I want to know more about the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="8551">I want more information on the Waterdhavian creatures and this cure.</string>
<string name="8552">Where can I get some supplies?</string>
<string name="8553">What you know &apos;bout attack on Academy?</string>
<string name="8554">Me want know more of plague.</string>
<string name="8555">What you know &apos;bout monsters and cure for sickness?</string>
<string name="8556">Me need buy stuff.</string>
<string name="8557">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="8558">Maybe he has a point.</string>
<string name="8559">Maybe him got point.</string>
<string name="8560">Why do you put up with him?</string>
<string name="8561">Why you keep him here?</string>
<string name="8562">I want to ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="8563">Me want ask &apos;bout other stuff.</string>
<string name="8564">Do have any information as to where the creatures might be?</string>
<string name="8565">You got hints for me &apos;bout where to look for monsters?</string>
<string name="8566">The room next door is full of plague victims. Aren&apos;t you scared of being infected?</string>
<string name="8567">Did the quarantine do anything to help?</string>
<string name="8568">You got sickies in temple here. You not scared?</string>
<string name="8569">You block city off, right? No one go in or out?</string>
<string name="8570">Tell me about the cockatrice.</string>
<string name="8571">Tell me about the yuan-ti.</string>
<string name="8572">Tell me about the intellect devourer.</string>
<string name="8573">Tell me about the dryad.</string>
<string name="8574">What right do you have to use kill these creatures to save yourselves?</string>
<string name="8575">You tell &apos;bout cockatrice.</string>
<string name="8576">You tell &apos;bout yuan-ti.</string>
<string name="8577">You tell &apos;bout intellect devourer.</string>
<string name="8578">You tell &apos;bout dryad.</string>
<string name="8579">You gonna kill monsters for make cure?</string>
<string name="8580">That&apos;s all I need to know about the Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="8581">Me not need nothing else &apos;bout Waterdeep monsters.</string>
<string name="8582">I found a note you might be interested in.</string>
<string name="8583">Me got note you need look at.</string>
<string name="8584">Yes - let&apos;s go at once!</string>
<string name="8585">No - I need to take care of a couple things.</string>
<string name="8586">Yes - me ready right now!</string>
<string name="8587">No - me need do some stuff first.</string>
<string name="8588">Thank you, Aribeth. You are most generous.</string>
<string name="8589">I have no need of gold. Your thanks is reward enough.</string>
<string name="8590">500 gold pieces? This is an outrage!</string>
<string name="8591">Me thanks you. This be lots gold.</string>
<string name="8592">Me not need gold. You keep for help other people.</string>
<string name="8593">500 gold! This not fair! Me want more!</string>
<string name="8594">I require temple services.</string>
<string name="8595">Me need to buy temple stuff.</string>
<string name="8596">We are but one reagent away from our salvation, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Thanks to &lt;CUSTOM100&gt; we only need to find the fourth and final reagent from the missing Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="8597">You are a welcome sight, as always, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Is this visit in regards to the fourth Waterdhavian creature? </string>
<string name="8598">I have glad tidings to report, &lt;FirstName&gt;. &lt;CUSTOM100&gt; found the second of the Waterdhavian creatures. We now have two of the four components - we are halfway to a cure!</string>
<string name="8599">One of the bards here in Castle Never is composing a song to honor your adventures during the recovery of the second reagent, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8600">Have you heard, &lt;FirstName&gt;? &lt;CUSTOM100&gt; has recovered the first of the missing Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="8601">Welcome back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You have done a great thing in recovering the first of the reagents for us.</string>
<string name="8602">Welcome, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Do you have news of the missing Waterdhavian creatures? Or is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="8603">Well done, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I knew you wouldn&apos;t let me down!</string>
<string name="8604">That old scoundrel? I suppose I cannot expect such men to give up their ways, even in times like this.</string>
<string name="8605">It is shameful the way such a gentle creature is mishandled. The plague does enough harm without us adding to it.</string>
<string name="8606">That was the reason we lost contact with those in the prison? As if the plague was not enough.</string>
<string name="8607">I heard of the trouble in the Beggar&apos;s Nest. This malevolent thing was behind it? As if the plague was not enough.</string>
<string name="8608">Welcome, &lt;FullName&gt;. I regret I did not get a chance to introduce myself properly to you while you were training at the Academy. </string>
<string name="8609">I am Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, paladin in the service of Tyr and the right hand of Nasher Alagondar, Lord of Neverwinter. I have been waiting for you.</string>
<string name="8610">You truly are remarkable, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If nothing else you prove that wit is no match for courage and skill!</string>
<string name="8611">Truly the heart of a hero beats within your chest, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Of all who have sought the creatures you have proven yourself above everyone else!</string>
<string name="8612">I heard of the trouble in the Beggar&apos;s Nest. This malevolent thing was behind it? As if the plague wasn&apos;t enough.</string>
<string name="8613">That was the reason we lost contact with those in the prison? As if the plague was not enough.</string>
<string name="8614">It is shameful the way such a gentle creature is mishandled. The plague does enough harm without us adding to it.</string>
<string name="8615">That old scoundrel? I suppose I cannot expect such men to give up their ways, even in times like this.</string>
<string name="8616">You have earned a place of honor among those who sought to aid Neverwinter in these dark times. You will stand with us as the ritual to create the cure is performed.</string>
<string name="8617">&lt;FirstName&gt;, where others have found only failure you have discovered shining success. Neverwinter is in your debt.</string>
<string name="8618">We are all eagerly awaiting its recovery. As soon as we have the fourth component we can begin the ritual to create the cure.</string>
<string name="8619">Ah, dear Fenthick, the love of my life. He has been my rock during these troubled times. But even he cannot help me with this, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8620">I have been following your progress since your early training at the Academy. Neverwinter has need of a &lt;man/woman&gt; like you if we are to survive the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="8621"></string>
<string name="8622">The attack on the Academy doused the one faint spark of hope this city had. I need you to help recover that which we have lost, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8623">You will answer only to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I will give you free reign in your tasks.</string>
<string name="8624">I promise your reward for this task will be well worth your efforts. There are many rumors about the plague, but if you are to aid me in this, it is important you know the truth about the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="8625">I knew I could count on you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There are many rumors about the plague, but if you are to aid me in this, it is important you know the truth about the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="8626"></string>
<string name="8627">Our divine healers can do nothing to help those afflicted by the Wailing Death, and even our most powerful magic cannot raise those who succumb to the illness.</string>
<string name="8628">But a short time ago we had word that Khelben &quot;Blackstaff&quot; Arunsun, the famous archmage of Waterdeep, had discovered a potential cure, one that might be concocted from the essence of four rare and magical creatures.</string>
<string name="8629">Under great secrecy the four creatures were gathered in Waterdeep then sent here to Neverwinter, as strange a menagerie as any has ever set eyes on: a cockatrice, an intellect devourer, a yuan-ti and a dryad.</string>
<string name="8630">I ordered them sent to the Academy, Neverwinter&apos;s renowned training institution for adventurers of every ilk. I once studied there myself and I thought the instructors and students were loyal to Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="8631">The Academy may have been betrayed from within. Or perhaps I simply put too much faith in the instructors, students and staff to keep this news secret, as Desther claims.</string>
<string name="8632">You were there, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You saw the slaughter. The attack caught us unprepared. You are one of only a handful of survivors from the carnage of the Academy.</string>
<string name="8633">Fenthick and Desther arrived with reinforcements, but during the confusion of battle the Waterdhavian creatures disappeared into the streets of Neverwinter - and our hopes of a cure vanished with them.</string>
<string name="8634"></string>
<string name="8635"></string>
<string name="8636"></string>
<string name="8637">You proved yourself during the attack on the Academy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your bravery and skill are obvious, and I know you are not in league with those who seek to destroy Neverwinter. </string>
<string name="8638">The city watch can do little to help in this search; their numbers are barely enough to keep order in the streets of Neverwinter. Others, like Fenthick or myself, have duties that require we stay here.</string>
<string name="8639">The city watch can do little to help in this search; their numbers are barely enough to keep order in the streets of Neverwinter. Others, like Fenthick or myself, have duties that require we stay here.</string>
<string name="8640">Your task in this is twofold, &lt;FirstName&gt;. First, find the Waterdhavian creatures and bring them back to me at any cost. We need to harvest components from these creatures if we are to concoct a cure for the Wailing Death. This is your most important duty.</string>
<string name="8641"></string>
<string name="8642">Second, we must discover who was behind the attack on the Academy. Any evidence you uncover in this matter should be brought to Fenthick. He is the one assigned the task of unmasking our hidden enemy.</string>
<string name="8643">You proved yourself during the attack on the Academy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your bravery and skill are obvious, and I know you are not in league with those who seek to destroy Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="8644">Whatever rewards you seek - fame, fortune, glory - you shall have in abundance. Provided you are successful in this task.</string>
<string name="8645">I ask for your discretion in this matter, &lt;FirstName&gt;. News of the attack and strange creatures roaming the city will only add to the panic and chaos already in the streets.</string>
<string name="8646"></string>
<string name="8647"></string>
<string name="8648">You might want to seek someone to accompany you in your mission. There are a number of mercenaries for hire at the Trade of Blades, located in the City Core.</string>
<string name="8649">A good place to begin your search for the missing creatures might be the Peninsula District. There have been several eyewitness accounts of strange beasts in the area.</string>
<string name="8650">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. May Tyr guide your steps.</string>
<string name="8651">I will do my best to answer what questions I may, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8652">It is no secret that Fenthick and I are lovers. Our feelings for each other are only matched by our devotion to Tyr and our loyalty to Neverwinter. </string>
<string name="8653">Although Lord Nasher has placed me in charge of finding a cure for the plague, I could not do this without Fenthick&apos;s help. His faith and conviction are a comfort to me in times of darkness.</string>
<string name="8654">Is there anything else, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="8655">I think the Helmite is arrogant, sanctimonious, self-righteous and holier-than-thou! Forgive me for being so blunt, but Desther and I do not see eye to eye. </string>
<string name="8656">Desther challenges my every decision on general principle, or so it would seem. He is constantly accusing me of abandoning my faith and not trusting enough in the power of the divine.</string>
<string name="8657">My faith in the power of Tyr is strong, yet I understand sometimes the Gods rely on mortal means to accomplish their ends. Mere blessings and prayers are not enough to end this plague, despite what the Helmites believe.</string>
<string name="8658">Sometimes I think Desther and his Helmites do more to hinder my efforts than help them. But Fenthick assures me they bring hope to the city, and hope is something the people desperately need.</string>
<string name="8659">I am not one to boast of my accomplishments, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Suffice to say that I am a Paladin of Tyr and I am honored Lord Nasher has placed me in charge of finding a cure for the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="8660">It was a slaughter, as you well know. Only a handful of the hundreds training and teaching at the Academy survived.</string>
<string name="8661">As yet we have not discovered the identity of those behind the attack, but the enemy knew the Waterdhavian creatures were there. How they came by that knowledge is a troubling prospect. </string>
<string name="8662">Take any information concerning who may be behind the attack straight to Fenthick. He is the one I have placed in charge of unmasking our hidden enemy.</string>
<string name="8663">Is there something else I can help you with, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="8664">I will do my best to answer your questions, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8665">The first victims were reported several months ago, and within days it had spread to all corners of the city. It was not the first plague Neverwinter has suffered, but it is by far the worst.</string>
<string name="8666">Unlike other sicknesses, the Wailing Death seems to resist all efforts to cure it, including the divine magic of the priests. Perhaps that is what makes it so terrible.</string>
<string name="8667">The plague does not seem to spread through contact with the infected. Healers tend to the sick without becoming ill, and some who lock themselves alone indoors contract the illness.</string>
<string name="8668">We have quarantined the city, but that is mostly to help the watch maintain order. It has done little to halt the spread, though some districts remain unaffected.</string>
<string name="8669">Perhaps that is what is so terrible about this affliction. There is no rhyme or reason to it, seemingly no way to guard against it and, until we have all the Waterdhavian creatures, no way to cure it.</string>
<string name="8670">We have quarantined the city, but that is mostly to help maintain order. It has done little to halt the spread of the disease - though some districts remain largely unaffected.</string>
<string name="8671">The plague does not seem to spread through contact with the infected. Healers tend to the sick without becoming ill, and some who lock themselves alone indoors still become infected.</string>
<string name="8672">I have no equipment to spare - all we have was given to the city watch to help them maintain order. Perhaps I could sell you some things from the temple armory...</string>
<string name="8673">Yes, I will arrange to sell you whatever I can. When you next come back, ask me for temple services. If I don&apos;t have something, the city core has all manner of shops to supply you with whatever you might need.</string>
<string name="8674">It was Khelben &quot;Blackstaff&quot; Arunsun, the archmage of Waterdeep, who discovered the potential cure. However, we have not even had a chance to test it. The creatures were taken from us too quickly.</string>
<string name="8675">If Blackstaff is right, the cure requires feathers from a cockatrice, the brain of an intellect devourer, blood from a yuan-ti and a lock of hair freshly plucked from a dryad&apos;s head.</string>
<string name="8676">Is there more you would know? Any information about the creatures I can provide to help you locate them will be freely given, of course.</string>
<string name="8677">A single drop of blood, a single scale, a lock of hair - all these can be collected with no harm to the creatures. Only the monstrously evil intellect devourer needs be slain to collect the reagent.</string>
<string name="8678">A cockatrice resembles a hybrid of chicken, lizard, and bat. They are repulsive animals that can petrify opponents. You must be extremely cautious when dealing with this beast.</string>
<string name="8679">The yuan-ti are a race of beings whose bloodlines are a mixture of human and snake. They can be any combination of snake and human characteristics.</string>
<string name="8680">They are highly intelligent and many of the creatures practice magic. It is rumored that some even have the ability to alter their shape.</string>
<string name="8681">The intellect devourer is a truly horrible entity, resembling a large fleshy brain with legs. It can dominate the minds of its victims so that it may devour their very thoughts.</string>
<string name="8682">She is like most of her kind: a beautiful, elusive forest sprite whose charms transcend mere physical appearance. Out of charity, she came willingly to help us when she learned of our need.</string>
<string name="8683">However, the city is strange to her and unsettling. When the attack came I suspect she fled in panicked terror, and now is lost among the unfamiliar streets and buildings of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="8684">If you find her, treat her with the respect and kindness she deserves. She is very brave to leave her wood to come to our aid.</string>
<string name="8685">There are many rumors and I would not like to give you any false leads, &lt;FirstName&gt;. However, there is something that seems reliable.</string>
<string name="8686">There have been some promising reports from the Peninsula District. Several eyewitness accounts indicate a strange creature is wandering the area - or was a short time ago.</string>
<string name="8687">There are unsettling reports coming from the Beggar&apos;s Nest. Some say the corpses of plague victims are coming back as the undead. That might be worth investigating.</string>
<string name="8688">The city watch reports a near rebellion in the Blacklake District. The commoners claim the nobles have found a secret cure. Perhaps it is related to the creatures.</string>
<string name="8689">All secrets are known in the Docks District, but the city guard has lost control of the area. The area is run by criminal gangs now - it might be too dangerous even for you.</string>
<string name="8690">But there is no guarantee the reports are accurate. The creatures could be in any one of the city districts. I shall leave it up to you where you want to take your search.</string>
<string name="8691">However, before my men were driven out there were whispers of attempts to escape the city with a valuable prize. Perhaps someone means to smuggle one of the creatures out.</string>
<string name="8692">Of course, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will do my best to help with whatever you need to know.</string>
<string name="8693">Let me see... hmmm... You were right to bring this note to our attention.</string>
<string name="8694">Take it to Fenthick - he is the one in charge of unmasking the enemy behind all this. He will find your note most interesting, I am sure.</string>
<string name="8695">Is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="8696">It is but one small step toward our ultimate goal, but it gives me hope. And I know with your help Neverwinter shall yet be saved!</string>
<string name="8697">I believe I heard Lord Nasher himself humming the tune in the halls. People are beginning to take notice of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8698">Are you ready to go to the ritual chamber? We must leave as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="8699">Then we shall waste no more time - Neverwinter has suffered long enough!</string>
<string name="8700">You have earned the right to stand with those who sought to aid Neverwinter in this dark time. I will spare a few minutes for you to get ready.</string>
<string name="8701">But you must hurry, &lt;FirstName&gt; - Neverwinter has suffered long enough. Return and speak to me when you are ready to go on.</string>
<string name="8702">We have all four reagents now. Quickly, &lt;FirstName&gt;, time grows short.</string>
<string name="8703">You have earned a place of honor among those who sought to aid Neverwinter in these dark times. You will stand with us as the ritual to create the cure is performed.</string>
<string name="8704">Battling the plague has drained the coffers of Neverwinter. I regret I cannot offer you more than 500 gold pieces for all you have accomplished.</string>
<string name="8705">Is there something else you need, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="8706">Your charity and selflessness are an example to us all, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I only wish more were as noble as you. </string>
<string name="8707">Were it up to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you would have a king&apos;s ransom for all you have done. However, the coffers are all but bare. The quarantine has been costly for all within the city.</string>
<string name="8708">The cure will now be ours, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Neverwinter owes you a debt it can never repay. All I can offer is this small sum of 500 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="8709">I must speak with you.</string>

<string name="8756">It will all be over soon.</string>
<string name="8757">Shhhh... rest now</string>
<string name="8758">I will try to ease your suffering.</string>
<string name="8759">There are too many... too many sick and too many dead.</string>
<string name="8760">Leave me be for the moment. I am listening to Fenthick.</string>
<string name="8761">I can spare no time for your idle chatter, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I must coordinate the search of my Helmites as they try to recover the missing Waterdhavian creatures... thanks to Aribeth!</string>
<string name="8762">This is in addition to all our other duties: tending to the dead, comforting the sick, spreading our blessings and giving hope to the people of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="8763">You should spend your time more productively, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Instead of speaking with me you should be out looking for the missing Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="8764">I suspect my Helmite brethren will prove far more useful in this task than a mere &lt;class&gt;, but who am I to defy the desires of Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="8765">Lord Nasher made a mistake when he appointed Aribeth to be in charge of finding a cure for the plague.</string>
<string name="8766">My Helmites are better equipped to deal with this crisis of faith. People should put their faith in the Gods - not in Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="8767">Aribeth trusted the Academy to protect the Waterdhavian creatures rather than relying on my Helmites, or even her own god, Tyr. </string>
<string name="8768">Had Aribeth delivered the Waterdhavian creatures to my Helmites, news of their arrival would not have spread so quickly through the city.</string>
<string name="8769">We could have kept their location secret and prevented the tragedy that befell the Academy.</string>
<string name="8770">The results of her actions are plain for all to see, yet even now she would rather trust a &lt;class&gt; such as you than rely on my Helmites!</string>
<string name="8771">I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t talk right now. I&apos;m listeming to Desther.</string>
<string name="8772">I understand, Fenthick. These are troubled times.</string>
<string name="8773">I am honored to serve Neverwinter, Fenthick.</string>
<string name="8774">I&apos;ll only serve if I am well paid, Fenthick.</string>
<string name="8775">It be honor for me serve Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="8776">Me only serve if me get gold.</string>
<string name="8777">He has no right to speak about me like that!</string>
<string name="8778">Desther had better watch his mouth or he might lose some teeth!</string>
<string name="8779">That okay. Me understand. This be tough times.</string>
<string name="8780">Him should not speak at me like that!</string>
<string name="8781">Desther better watch him mouth or me smash him face!</string>
<string name="8782">Rumors?</string>
<string name="8783">I wish to ask you some questions, Fenthick.</string>
<string name="8784">Where can I find Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="8785">I thought you might be interested in this note.</string>
<string name="8786"></string>
<string name="8787"></string>
<string name="8788">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="8789">I will go to Aribeth at once!</string>
<string name="8790">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="8791">I guess I better go talk to Aribeth if I want any kind of reward from all this.</string>
<string name="8792">Me go Aribeth right now!</string>
<string name="8793">Me got questions me want ask.</string>
<string name="8794">Me better go talk at Aribeth if me want get gold for all this.</string>
<string name="8795">Me want ask you some stuff.</string>
<string name="8796">Where me find Aribeth?</string>
<string name="8797">Me think you want look at this note.</string>
<string name="8798"></string>
<string name="8799"></string>
<string name="8800">Me go now.</string>
<string name="8801">What do you know about the attack on the Academy?</string>
<string name="8802">Tell me about the plague.</string>
<string name="8803">What do you know about a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="8804">Tell me about Aribeth.</string>
<string name="8805">What do you know about Desther?</string>
<string name="8806">What you know &apos;bout attack at Academy?</string>
<string name="8807">You tell &apos;bout plague.</string>
<string name="8808">You know stuff &apos;bout plague cure?</string>
<string name="8809">You tell &apos;bout Aribeth?</string>
<string name="8810">What is your role in all this, Fenthick?</string>
<string name="8811">What you do here, Fenthick?</string>
<string name="8812">What you know &apos;bout Desther?</string>
<string name="8813">This is no trick!</string>
<string name="8814">Why would I do such a thing?</string>
<string name="8815">This not be trick!</string>
<string name="8816">Why me want trick you?</string>
<string name="8817">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Fenthick should follow every lead if he wants to find out who&apos;s behind this.</string>
<string name="8818">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; What&apos;s the matter, Desther? Do you have something to hide?</string>
<string name="8819">It is an honor to serve Neverwinter, Fenthick.</string>
<string name="8820">Is there some type of reward for bringing this to your attention?</string>
<string name="8821">Me just happy to help.</string>
<string name="8822">You gonna give me gold for note now?</string>
<string name="8823">Thank you, Fenthick. You are very generous.</string>
<string name="8824">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This note was not easy to obtain, Fenthick. Not easy at all.</string>
<string name="8825">You better dig a little deeper or you won&apos;t live long enough to die from the plague!</string>
<string name="8826">Thanks. You nice man.</string>
<string name="8827">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me work hard for note. Real hard.</string>
<string name="8828">You give more gold or me kill you faster than plague!</string>
<string name="8829">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Say, Desther - you Helmites are kind of like a cult, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="8830">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; A cult could have both the organization and the determination to be behind this.</string>
<string name="8831">The note is real, Desther!</string>
<string name="8832">Why would I make a fake note about a cult in Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="8833">Note be real!</string>
<string name="8834">Why me want make fake note &apos;bout cult?</string>
<string name="8835">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You knew the creatures were at the Academy, didn&apos;t you Desther? </string>
<string name="8836">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; The attackers knew enough to go straight to where the creatures were being held.</string>
<string name="8837">This information is still worth investigating.</string>
<string name="8838">Me think we still got look into this.</string>
<string name="8839">Aren&apos;t you afraid of catching the plague yourself?</string>
<string name="8840">You not be afraid of get sick, too?</string>
<string name="8841">&lt;FirstName&gt;, you were quick to answer the summons. Allow me to be the first to welcome you to the Halls of Justice.</string>
<string name="8842">This is a mistake, Fenthick. We know nothing about this &lt;class&gt;! How can you so blindly trust &lt;him/her&gt;?</string>
<string name="8843">Desther, please. &lt;FirstName&gt; showed great promise throughout &lt;his/her&gt; training at the Academy, and has done even more in the week since the attack. Rarely has a recruit shown such potential after so short a training period.</string>
<string name="8844">If we are to have any hope of finding a cure for the Wailing Death we need people like &lt;FirstName&gt; in the service of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="8845">And I still say we should put our faith in my Helmite brethren, rather than an unproven &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="8846">Aribeth holds &lt;FirstName&gt; in the highest regard, Desther. And Lord Nasher placed her in charge, not you.</string>
<string name="8847">Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you must forgive Desther. The plague takes a heavy toll on us all, a toll made even greater in the past weeks by the attack on the Academy and the loss of the cure.</string>
<string name="8848">Such callous disregard for the suffering of others! Is this the kind of mercenary we want working for us, Fenthick?</string>
<string name="8849">There is nothing wrong with wanting to earn one&apos;s fortune in the world, Desther. Rest assured, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you will be well rewarded for your efforts. </string>
<string name="8850">If we are to survive the Wailing Death, Neverwinter has need of men and women like you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8851">You speak more truth than you know, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Within the Academy walls the true horror of the Wailing Death had yet to be felt.</string>
<string name="8852">The quarantine of Neverwinter has done little to halt the spread of the Wailing Death. Bonfires burn night and day as the city watch dispose of the dead, yet the corpses are piled ever higher.</string>
<string name="8853">It is all we can do to contain the chaos and maintain order within the various city districts. Rumors run rampant and the citizens are on the verge of panic.</string>
<string name="8854">You do not understand, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The true horror of the Wailing Death had yet to be felt within the Academy&apos;s walls.</string>
<string name="8855">Because the plague cannot be cured by the priests or clerics of the city, some claim it is an unnatural thing sent by an unknown enemy bent on destroying Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="8856">The attack on the Academy in these past weeks will only make things worse, Fenthick - once people learn how Aribeth lost the cure through her lack of faith!</string>
<string name="8857">Desther! I will not have you question the faith of my true love! Aribeth believed the Academy to be a safe haven. Anyway, it is not our place to even discuss such things.</string>
<string name="8858">My Lady Aribeth is in charge, appointed by Lord Nasher himself to stop the Wailing Death. You must talk to her, &lt;FirstName&gt;, as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="8859">Hello again, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and well met as always. Is there something I may do for you?</string>
<string name="8860">I will answer them as best I may, though there are many things only Aribeth has the authority to discuss.</string>
<string name="8861">My Lady Aribeth is in the chamber beyond the north doors. There she works tirelessly to put an end to the plague that ravages Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="8862">Is there anything else you need, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="8863">Go with the blessing of Tyr upon you.</string>
<string name="8864">My Lady Aribeth awaits you in the chamber beyond the north doors. There, she works tirelessly to put an end to the plague that ravages Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="8865">It is important that you speak with Aribeth soon, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I will not refuse your request. Ask your questions.</string>
<string name="8866">Your mind may be simple, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I sense your heart is true.</string>
<string name="8867">What do we have here? Hmmm... it seems the plague was unleashed on us as part of some greater plot! We may have worse trials ahead of us than the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="8868">Let me see, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Hmmm... &apos;The People of the Eye&apos;. A cult in Neverwinter is dark news indeed - especially one bent on preventing us from recovering the Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="8869">Let me see... hmmm... a traitor in Neverwinter? One who betrayed us at the Academy? This would explain much, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8870">You may be slow of wit, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but you desire knowledge. Many who are wise cannot say the same. Ask your questions.</string>
<string name="8871">Listen to the lack-wit speak, Fenthick! Are we turning to simpletons now? Have we become so desperate?</string>
<string name="8872">The Gods bestow many gifts besides intelligence, Desther: courage, heart, loyalty, strength. Do not be so quick to judge.</string>
<string name="8873">Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I must congratulate you on capturing the first Waterdhavian creature.</string>
<string name="8874">Have you heard, &lt;FirstName&gt;? The first of the Waterdhavian creatures has been recovered by &lt;CUSTOM100&gt;.</string>
<string name="8875">&lt;FirstName&gt;! Thanks to you we have now recovered two of the Waterdhavian creatures, and are halfway to a cure for the Wailing Death!</string>
<string name="8876">I have good news to report, &lt;FirstName&gt;! The second Waterdhavian creature has been recovered by &lt;CUSTOM100&gt;. We are halfway to a cure!</string>
<string name="8877">Well done, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I heard you found the third of the creatures from Waterdeep. A cure is all but within our grasp now!</string>
<string name="8878">Well met, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Have you heard? The third Waterdhavian creature has been found. A cure is all but in our hand!</string>
<string name="8879">What good is one creature to us, Fenthick? It is like a sword with no blade. Would you go into battle armed only with the hilt of a sword?</string>
<string name="8880">A sword cannot be forged without the hilt, Desther. The recovery of the first creature is an important step in finding a cure for the Wailing Death. With &lt;FirstName&gt;&apos;s help we are sure to recover the other creatures soon.</string>
<string name="8881">Perhaps... but I will put my faith in Helm and my brethren rather than this &lt;class&gt; of Aribeth&apos;s.</string>
<string name="8882">Enough, Desther. We must all do our part to end this plague. Now, what may I do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="8883">Two creatures out of four, Fenthick. Half a cure is as worthless as half a horse!</string>
<string name="8884">We have already recoverd two creatures, Desther. Does this not give you hope we may succeed?</string>
<string name="8885">Hope? My Helmites spread hope and blessings throughout the city, Fenthick. We also search for the lost creatures. Only we do not seek glory like this &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="8886">We are still missing the final creature, Fenthick. By now it may be forever beyond our grasp. Without all four creatures there will be no cure.</string>
<string name="8887">We are so close, Desther. &lt;FirstName&gt; will not let us down! The final creature will be ours if we just remain true to the cause!</string>
<string name="8888">I and my Helmite brethren prefer to remain true in our faith, Fenthick - unlike some. We seek answers from the divine Helm, not a mortal like this &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="8889">We learned very little in the week after the attack occurred. You are one of the few who survived, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The instructors were slaughtered, and only a handful of the students are left.</string>
<string name="8890">You must uphold the legacy of the Academy, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I know you will be equal to the task. Rarely has a recruit shown as much promise as you.</string>
<string name="8891">There is little else I can tell you about the attack, I fear. We have yet to uncover the identity of the mysterious assailants. Perhaps Aribeth can tell you more.</string>
<string name="8892">Despite the city-wide quarantine, the Wailing Death spreads quickly. Even here in the Hall of Justice we have felt the plague&apos;s touch, as you can see by the afflicted all around us.</string>
<string name="8893">Desther and I do what we can to comfort these poor souls, but we can do little else. Not even Neverwinter&apos;s most powerful priests can heal or raise those who contract the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="8894">People are scared. They&apos;re on the verge of panic and even open rebellion, and the city watch struggles to keep order. </string>
<string name="8895">The panic will get worse when people learn of the attack on the Academy and how Aribeth lost the cure.</string>
<string name="8896">I will not have you speak ill of the woman I love, Desther! We should not even be discussing this. Aribeth must decide who is given such information; she is the one in charge.</string>
<string name="8897">I am afraid I cannot discuss this with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I must obey the chain of command, and my Lady Aribeth is in charge of finding a cure for the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="8898">Tell &lt;FirstName&gt; the truth, Fenthick! Aribeth had the cure and she lost it because she trusted those at the Academy over my Helmite brethren!</string>
<string name="8899">I do whatever my Lady Aribeth commands, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Lord Nasher himself appointed her to oversee our efforts to find a cure. He could not have made a better choice. </string>
<string name="8900">Aribeth has placed me in charge of discovering who was behind the attack on the Academy. If you ever come across such information you may report it directly to me.</string>
<string name="8901">And of course I do what I can to ease the suffering of those within Castle Never who have been infected with the Wailing Death, although they are beyond my power to save.</string>
<string name="8902">Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande is a paladin who serves Tyr, as do I. She is young, but her faith, courage and intelligence are beyond question... as is her beauty.</string>
<string name="8903">You let your feelings for her cloud your judgment, Fenthick. Your lover is not without her flaws.</string>
<string name="8904">Aribeth and I are of one heart and soul, it is true. But that does not make her any less a paragon of virtue. None who serve Neverwinter are more capable than my Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="8905">&lt;He/She&gt; speaks as if I am not even in the room! No matter, I am too busy to waste my time chatting with you, anyway.</string>
<string name="8906">You must forgive Desther. The strain of the Wailing Death weighs heavily upon us all. But the Helmites are our allies in this dark time.</string>
<string name="8907">Desther and his followers arrived to offer their aid just before the city was quarantined. They came to help us when no one else dared.</string>
<string name="8908">What could be worse than the Wailing Death, Fenthick? I fear &lt;FirstName&gt; is playing a trick on you with this so called &apos;evidence&apos; of some grand conspiracy!</string>
<string name="8909">Perhaps your simple mind considers this an amusing joke, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Or maybe you thought you could get a reward for this flimsy slip of paper!</string>
<string name="8910">Perhaps this is some kind of sick joke on your part, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Or maybe you thought to get some kind of reward for this flimsy piece of paper?</string>
<string name="8911">So you say. But anyone can write up a note, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Perhaps you thought you could use this slip of paper to pry a reward from Fenthick!</string>
<string name="8912">Please, Desther - I hardly think &lt;FirstName&gt; is the kind of &lt;man/woman&gt; to do such a thing. I think this bears further investigation, at the very least.</string>
<string name="8913">The plague is a trial sent by the Gods to test our faith, not part of some secret plot to overthrow Neverwinter. Chasing these conspiracy theories is a waste of time!</string>
<string name="8914">Rest assured that I intend to follow every lead in my efforts to find out who is behind the suffering of Neverwinter. You have done well to bring this to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8915">Well spoken, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. &lt;FirstName&gt; only has Neverwinter&apos;s best interests at heart, Desther. We are all on the same side. </string>
<string name="8916">How dare you accuse me - after all I have done for this city! You see what kind of people your Lady Aribeth prefers to work with, Fenthick?</string>
<string name="8917">Please, we are all on the same side here. I know you and Desther do not get along, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but that is no excuse for tossing out baseless accusations.</string>
<string name="8918">Desther and his Helmites have done as much for the city as anyone - accusing him because you dislike his attitude is beneath you and does nothing to help the situation. </string>
<string name="8919">Lord Nasher has given me the authority to grant compensation to those who serve our cause. For bringing me this note I can give you 250 gold.</string>
<string name="8920">We are lucky to have a &lt;man/woman&gt; like you to help us in this matter, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Please accept these 300 gold pieces as a reward for your actions.</string>
<string name="8921">You have proven your worth through your deeds, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Here are 200 gold pieces for your service. </string>
<string name="8922">You see what kind of animal Aribeth rests her hopes on? You should throw &lt;him/her&gt; in the dungeons for threatening you!</string>
<string name="8923">Relax, Desther. &lt;FirstName&gt; was only joking, I&apos;m sure. Nobody would threaten us here where a single word could bring twenty guards rushing to our aid.</string>
<string name="8924">Although given the circumstances the jest was in poor taste, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Tensions are high - the Wailing Death is a great strain on us all.</string>
<string name="8925">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I imagine you went to great trouble to acquire this evidence, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I suppose for one who is as dedicated to our cause as you I could spare another 50 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="8926">Careful, Fenthick, lest your generosity empty the city&apos;s coffers!</string>
<string name="8927">An extra 50 gold pieces will not break us, Desther. And &lt;FirstName&gt; has earned each and every coin.</string>
<string name="8928">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I would give you more if I could, but I must exercise restraint lest I drain Neverwinter&apos;s coffers completely.</string>
<string name="8929">Before you launch a time consuming investigation into some mysterious cult, Fenthick, you might want more evidence. For all we know this note is a fake.</string>
<string name="8930">Your words are wise, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The possibility of the cult is one we must give careful consideration to.</string>
<string name="8931">So you claim. But we have only your word on that, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8932">Perhaps you are not as stupid as you seem. Maybe you plan to sell trinkets to ward off the evil magic of this imaginary cult. You would not be the first to exploit the panic for personal gain.</string>
<string name="8933">Maybe you plan to sell trinkets to ward off the evil magic of this imaginary cult. You would not be the first to exploit the panic for personal gain.</string>
<string name="8934">Enough, Desther! You have no right to make such accusations! &lt;FirstName&gt; has done nothing but help us in these troubled times.</string>
<string name="8935">Please accept my apologies for Desther&apos;s behavior, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We are all under a great deal of stress.</string>
<string name="8936">How dare you! I will not be slandered by these baseless accusations! Show me your proof or I will demand you be held for inciting false rumors!</string>
<string name="8937">Desther, settle down. We cannot begin to threaten each other over every perceived insult. &lt;FirstName&gt; was only making a joke.</string>
<string name="8938">And you, &lt;FirstName&gt; - you should not make such accusations, even in jest. The penalty for any who are involved in prolonging the plague is death.</string>
<string name="8939">*Everybody* knew the Academy was being used to house the Waterdhavian creatures, Fenthick - even the students themselves had heard the rumors!</string>
<string name="8940">The attack was the result of gossip and loose lips from those Aribeth chose to trust instead of my faithful Helmites. We will be wasting our time looking for this phantom spy!</string>
<string name="8941">You make a good point, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The attack on the Academy would not have been so efficient had they been relying solely on rumors.</string>
<string name="8942">So did Fenthick! So did Aribeth! So did every single student within the Academy walls! I do not like what you are suggesting, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8943">Desther is right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There were many who knew the Waterdhavian creatures were at the Academy. You cannot just make wild accusations.</string>
<string name="8944">The crime for betraying Neverwinter is death, and I will not let this turn into a witch hunt! Besides, Desther and his Helmites have proved their loyalty many times over since the plague began.</string>
<string name="8945">Our faith protects us! Only the faithless need fear the Wailing Death, as I and my Helmites have proclaimed many times.</string>
<string name="8946">Desther, please. No one yet knows how the plague spreads, though contact with the infected does not seem to be a catalyst. Even so, people are burning the bodies and locking themselves indoors just to be safe.</string>
<string name="8947">I must speak with you.</string>
<string name="8948">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="8949">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="8950">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="8951">Have you heard anything about a cure for the Wailing Death?</string>
<string name="8952">Did you hear anything about the attack on the Academy?</string>
<string name="8953">How did you end up tending the afflicted here?</string>
<string name="8954">Have you heard any rumors lately?</string>
<string name="8955">You know stuff &apos;bout cure for sick?</string>
<string name="8956">What you know &apos;bout fight at Academy?</string>
<string name="8957">You be nurse. How you get your job here?</string>
<string name="8958">You hear gossip or rumors or stuff?</string>
<string name="8959">That&apos;s it? You haven&apos;t heard the rumors about a cure from Waterdeep?</string>
<string name="8960">You not hear stuff &apos;bout cure from Waterdeep?</string>
<string name="8961">Tell me what you&apos;ve heard about Desther.</string>
<string name="8962">Tell me what you&apos;ve heard about Aribeth.</string>
<string name="8963">Tell me what you&apos;ve heard about Fenthick.</string>
<string name="8964">Tell what you hear &apos;bout Desther.</string>
<string name="8965">Tell what you hear &apos;bout Aribeth.</string>
<string name="8966">Tell what you hear &apos;bout Fenthick.</string>
<string name="8967">What were they saying?</string>
<string name="8968">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You don&apos;t like Desther much, do you?</string>
<string name="8969">What them say?</string>
<string name="8970">Aren&apos;t you afraid of contracting the plague yourself?</string>
<string name="8971">You not scared you get sick, too?</string>
<string name="8972">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="8973">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="8974">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="8975">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="8976">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="8977">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="8978">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="8979">Neverwinter big place. Me need directions.</string>
<string name="8980">Greetings, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. How may I be of service? </string>
<string name="8981">May whatever Gods you pray to keep you safe from the plague.</string>
<string name="8982">On your way, then. I&apos;ve got too many sick and suffering to waste my time on long goodbyes.</string>
<string name="8983">Off with you, then. I&apos;ve no time for the likes of you.</string>
<string name="8984">Your mind is feeble, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Never fear, I am used to dealing with patients whose minds have become enfeebled. I&apos;ll speak slow so you understand..</string>
<string name="8985">I really should be tending the sick, but for you my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; I can spare a few moments.</string>
<string name="8986">I really should be tending the sick, but I can spare a few moments, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="8987">Make it quick - my time is better spent easing the suffering of my patients.</string>
<string name="8988">There&apos;s no cure for the plague, everybody knows that! All I can do is try to ease their suffering and make their last days less painful.</string>
<string name="8989">I heard Fenthick and Desther whispering about it once, but they clammed up as soon as they saw me. That Desther gave me a foul look.</string>
<string name="8990">I was a midwife, before the plague. But there ain&apos;t many babies being born now - not live ones, anyhow. I heard Castle Never needed nurses to tend their sick and dying, so I came.</string>
<string name="8991">I&apos;ve heard my share. Desther and Aribeth are always arguing and Fenthick&apos;s always trying to keep the peace.</string>
<string name="8992">Some people won&apos;t have nothing to do with the sick. They board themselves up in their homes and don&apos;t come out for no reason. And they still get the Wailing Death. </string>
<string name="8993">Is there something else you wanted to know? Or can I get back to my duties?</string>
<string name="8994">Aribeth doesn&apos;t like him, I know that much. He&apos;s got a sharp tongue and a sour face, but I think it&apos;s more than that. But it&apos;s not really my place to speak of such things.</string>
<string name="8995">Lady Aribeth&apos;s always telling Fenthick not to put so much faith in Desther and his Helmites. You know they&apos;re lovers? Fenthick and Aribeth, I mean. Of course you know. Everybody knows. </string>
<string name="8996">Poor Fenthick. He&apos;s caught in the middle between Desther and Aribeth, always ends up having to pick one side or the other when they argue about how to save the city.</string>
<string name="8997">Well I suppose that&apos;s about as direct as one can get.</string>
<string name="8998">You interested in more of my gossip, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="8999">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Desther and his Helmites showed up soon after the plague started, just in time to get locked inside the city when the quarantine hit. </string>
<string name="9000">Desther says they came because they heard about Neverwinter&apos;s suffering, but it seems like odd timing to Lady Aribeth. Or so she told Fenthick once.</string>
<string name="9001">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but I better not say any more. If someone overheard me, I would be in a lot of trouble.</string>
<string name="9002">A cure from Waterdeep? How are they going to get it here with Neverwinter under quarantine! Throw it up over the walls? You&apos;re talking crazy.</string>
<string name="9003">Is there something else you need? If not, I really should get back to the sick.</string>
<string name="9004">Desther was saying the attack was all Aribeth&apos;s fault, and Fenthick was trying to defend her. That&apos;s all I heard.</string>
<string name="9005">Do you have more questions? If not, I really should get back to my duties.</string>
<string name="9006">He&apos;s sour, that one. A bitter man with a sharp tongue. But he&apos;s a man of the cloth, and his Helmites do good work around the city, helping the sick. </string>
<string name="9007">Desther&apos;s not a real friendly sort, but I guess that ain&apos;t no crime. I just try to stay out of his way.</string>
<string name="9008">Is there something I can do for you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="9009">What do you want? And be quick about it - can&apos;t you see how busy I am here?</string>
<string name="9010">As much as most, less than some, I suppose. I&apos;ve seen my share of the dead and dying since I started to work here tending the sick.</string>
<string name="9011">I&apos;m here to tend the sick and the dying, not play tour guide. </string>
<string name="9012">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="9013">Yes, I suppose it would seem large to someone like you, wouldn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="9014">The Helmites don&apos;t catch it from helping the sick, so why should I? The plague takes who it wants, when it wants. Nothing anyone can do about that.</string>
<string name="9015">None of them pay any attention to a quiet little nurse going about her duties, so I&apos;ve heard all sorts of stuff about each and every one of them.</string>
<string name="9016">Besides, all you have to do is go outside the front door of the Hall of Justice. The City Core district has every kind of shop, store or inn you&apos;ll ever need, I suspect.</string>
<string name="9017">You think he&apos;d always side with Aribeth, since they are lovers. But Fenthick&apos;s an honest man, and when Aribeth is wrong, he&apos;s not afraid to tell her so.</string>
<string name="9018">Make peace with your gods! Like the Phalorm before us, we are doomed!</string>
<string name="9019">The Wailing heralds the end of days!</string>
<string name="9020">Woe to the unrepentant, for they shall be struck down!</string>
<string name="9021">The end is nigh! Like the arrogant of Netheril, we shall fall to dust!</string>
<string name="9022">Death is the price we pay for our arrogance!</string>
<string name="9023">Lord Nasher hasn&apos;t made an appearance for weeks. Who can blame him? It stinks of burning bodies out here.</string>
<string name="9024">So you&apos;re Nasher&apos;s lackeys, are you? You&apos;ll smell like the rest of us after a day near the corpse burning pits.</string>
<string name="9025">You know what? I may not like you but I like the folks in charge even less, right now... </string>
<string name="9026">Has the Wailing driven you mad!? At least put some clothing on!</string>
<string name="9027">Aye, I&apos;d run around naked too, if it weren&apos;t for the boils... </string>
<string name="9028">You&apos;d better get some clothes on you before you get lynched as a plague-spreader!</string>
<string name="9029">Those wounds look terrible! You&apos;re - You&apos;re not a Wailer are you?</string>
<string name="9030">Aye, the Tyrists are so busy with the plague-struck, they&apos;ve no time for the honest wounded!</string>
<string name="9031">Look at those wounds - Guards catch you trying to break quarantine? </string>
<string name="9032">You think you&apos;re a dim wit? You&apos;d make a finer ruler than that fool Nasher!</string>
<string name="9033">Dumb as a post yet they made you militia even so, hmm? </string>
<string name="9034">So Lord Nasher gambled our fate on the likes of you, did he? Why, if I was Lord... !</string>
<string name="9035">You militia folk must enjoy waving your weapons around like that! You can&apos;t cut or bash through the stink of the burning corpses, though.</string>
<string name="9036">Good thing I don&apos;t have that weapon - I&apos;d chop the head off every fool guard in the city!</string>
<string name="9037">Don&apos;t think you can scare me with that weapon, soldier - I follow my own law now... </string>
<string name="9038">You with the Tyrists? My brother died because none of them would come to see him... </string>
<string name="9039">What good have you clerics done us! Well, the city STINKS to the heavens. That&apos;s a start, I guess.</string>
<string name="9040">If you&apos;re so high and holy, why don&apos;t you cure the Wailing, huh?</string>
<string name="9041">Hmph. A lot of good all you wizards of the Cloaktower have done us... </string>
<string name="9042">All of you wizards working away in your tower - I bet you brought this on us in the first place!</string>
<string name="9043">Can&apos;t you use magic to get rid of the smell of the corpse burn? Or maybe you spellthrowing types used to it?</string>
<string name="9044">Psst! &lt;Race&gt; friend! I heard something about a plot to overthrow Lord Nasher - spread the word!</string>
<string name="9045">This city needs the rule of a good &lt;race&gt; lord, don&apos;t you think?</string>
<string name="9046">This here Wailing - it&apos;s just a plot of Lord Nasher&apos;s to get rid of good &lt;race&gt;-folk like us!</string>
<string name="9047">I bet a pretty lass like you would make a fine spy... </string>
<string name="9048">And here I thought that that ogre, Lord Nasher, had scared all the pretty girls away... </string>
<string name="9049">Think you&apos;re pretty, do you? Well you won&apos;t be for long if you keep doing that fool Nasher&apos;s bidding... </string>
<string name="9050">I&apos;d rather live under the rule of a dashing fellow like you than an old fart like Nasher... </string>
<string name="9051">You&apos;re a good-looking chap. Are you with the resistance?</string>
<string name="9052">You may think you&apos;re a pretty boy but you&apos;re still doing the militia&apos;s dirty work!</string>
<string name="9053">Be careful around the Core - people are getting upset about how long it&apos;s taking to get a cure.</string>
<string name="9054">Just between you and I, I wouldn&apos;t trust anyone around these parts, least of all those in charge.</string>
<string name="9055">The church, the government, the militia, they&apos;ve all turned on us. All we&apos;ve got is ourselves... </string>
<string name="9056">The Tyrists keep on whining about their precious cure - You know what? There&apos;s no cure for being dead... </string>
<string name="9057">This is what we&apos;ve become, is it? Guttersnipes and harpies, all of us... </string>
<string name="9058">I&apos;d call the guard but it looks like they&apos;ve sold out to the likes of you these days... </string>
<string name="9059">It&apos;s because of outlanders like you that we all caught this bloody Wailing... </string>
<string name="9060">Hmph! The heads of state are no better than a barbaric animal like you!</string>
<string name="9061">You smell as bad as the politics around here... Not as bad as the burn-pits, though... </string>
<string name="9062">Well, wonderful. Another &lt;race&gt; fool wandering about. Nasher&apos;s brought ruin to this place... </string>
<string name="9063">Hmph, more &lt;race&gt; rabble. If I were in Lord Nasher&apos;s shoes, I&apos;d be rid of the whole lot of you... </string>
<string name="9064">Go back to where you came from, &lt;race&gt;-kin - You&apos;re not wanted here!</string>

<string name="9160">Can you tell me anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?</string>
<string name="9161">What do you know about the Wailing Death?</string>

<string name="9165">What you know &apos;bout da Wailin&apos;?</string>
<string name="9166">You know Missus Aribeth, yuh?</string>
<string name="9167">Me ask stuff &apos;bout Black-lake Dis-Trick, yuh?</string>

<string name="9170">You know any ting else &apos;bout dat night?</string>
<string name="9171">I&apos;m interested in the plague. Can you tell me anything else about it.</string>
<string name="9172">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there anyone else who might know more about the Wailing Death?</string>
<string name="9173">Me int&apos;rested in plague. You know any udder stuff &apos;bout it?</string>
<string name="9174">Something about her fascinates me. Can you tell me anything more?</string>
<string name="9175">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there anyone else who might be able to tell me more about her?</string>
<string name="9176">Hmm. She int&apos;resting. You know more &apos;bout her?</string>
<string name="9177">Would you mind answering some more general questions for me?</string>
<string name="9178">Me have udder questions. Don&apos;t worry, dey simple.</string>
<string name="9179">Lady Aribeth has assigned me to temporary militia duty.</string>
<string name="9180">Missus Aribeth made me militia for li&apos;l while.</string>
<string name="9181">What kind of clearance do I need?</string>
<string name="9182">Uh... What you mean by &apos;clear-rinse&apos;?</string>
<string name="9183">Why do I need clearance?</string>
<string name="9184">Why me need &apos;clear-rinse&apos;?</string>
<string name="9185">Sorry, no.</string>
<string name="9186">Hail, good &lt;sir/madam&gt;! The Wailing Death has created a lot of conflict beyond these gates. Lady Aribeth&apos;s ordered us to restrict access to the Blacklake district.</string>
<string name="9187">Be careful. There&apos;s plenty of danger afoot.</string>
<string name="9188">Yes, yes. On your way, then.</string>
<string name="9189">I&apos;ll be keeping my eye on you... </string>
<string name="9190">I see. A little on the slow side, are we?</string>
<string name="9191">I&apos;d be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="9192">I suppose I can answer a question for you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Go ahead.</string>
<string name="9193">I&apos;ll answer one of your questions... if it doesn&apos;t take long.</string>
<string name="9194">Well, best bet would be to talk to a guard in the area. Past my gate is a bit of the slums, but if you keep going you&apos;ll reach the Blacklake Gate.</string>
<string name="9195">Well, the Blacklake&apos;s split into two parts - the Nobles&apos; Quarter, and the rest of it. The nobles are plague-free right now and sealed off tight. There&apos;s rumors the nobles have a cure that they aren&apos;t willing to share with the rest of us.</string>
<string name="9196">The Nobles&apos; Quarter itself is all barricaded in, but being a guard gives you access. Once inside you can check out the zoo in the north and a rough-house tavern called the Board Laid Bare in the centre of the district, if you want.</string>
<string name="9197">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="9198">Don&apos;t get me wrong, I can understand the nobles&apos; desire to quarantine themselves... but some of the biggest crooks I&apos;ve known were of noble birth. </string>
<string name="9199">Maybe there is something to the rumors about the nobles having a cure and not wanting to share it. It doesn&apos;t sound likely, but the fact remains they&apos;re plague free while the rest of the town gets sick. </string>
<string name="9200">The Wailing&apos;s caused its fair share of conflict beyond these gates, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, making it a dangerous place. Lady Aribeth has ordered us to restrict access.</string>
<string name="9201">Harrumph... The Blacklake nobles won&apos;t make much of a ragamuffin like you. The Wailing&apos;s caused its fair share of conflict beyond these gates.</string>
<string name="9202">A little on the slow side, are we?</string>
<string name="9203">I&apos;d be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="9204">I suppose I can answer a question for you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Go ahead.</string>
<string name="9205">I&apos;ll answer one of your questions... if it doesn&apos;t take long.</string>
<string name="9206">Aye, my friend Haggard was with the night watch in the Academy when the caravan bringing the creatures came in. We found him with his throat slit after the attack, amidst the empty cages.</string>
<string name="9207">He had the symbol of Helm, god of all us guard-folk, gripped tightly in his frozen palm. We buried him with it that way... to honor him.</string>
<string name="9208">The rest, as they say, is history. Freed from their cages, the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night and are out there still, hiding from us all.</string>
<string name="9209">Is there anything else you need?</string>
<string name="9210">The person who knows the most about it is probably Lady Aribeth, herself. She&apos;s a good soul and deadly smart, too. I&apos;m glad she&apos;s in charge of the search.</string>
<string name="9211">Too little to cure it, too much to live without fear. Our only hope is to find those Waterdhavian creatures. Without them, every last one of us is dead.</string>
<string name="9212">Only that I&apos;ve lost half my family to it by now. I stand guard in their memory.</string>
<string name="9213">You might want to check with the Helmite, Desther. He&apos;s new here but has been putting his own health at risk to offer Helm&apos;s blessings to the plague-struck.</string>
<string name="9214">Do you have a speech impediment? Oh, nevermind.</string>
<string name="9215">Can&apos;t say I know her as well as Abbot Fenthick, har har! But, aye, she has been a pillar of this community since she was knighted.</string>
<string name="9216">I&apos;m afraid not. We must respect a person&apos;s privacy, especially in sad times such as this.</string>
<string name="9217">If you want the dirt on Lady Aribeth, you&apos;d best talk to good sir Fenthick. They&apos;re due to be married in the summer, you know... </string>
<string name="9218">Aye, there was word she&apos;d be hiring on adventurers to help fill the ranks. What can I do for you then?</string>
<string name="9219">Well, I suppose we could do a lot worse. You sound a little... slow to me, but you must have passed muster to get in at all.</string>
<string name="9220">We&apos;re under pretty tight lockdown right now. Unless you have the express permission of either Lady Aribeth or Lord Nasher, you&apos;ll have to remain in the Core.</string>
<string name="9221">Look, the Wailing Death isn&apos;t a joke. The latest estimates put the death toll in the several thousands! I even heard Lord Nasher has already come down with it.</string>
<string name="9222">We have no cure, not yet, so we&apos;re doing the only thing we know how to do. Limit movement, limit exposure. In other words... you&apos;d better have clearance.</string>
<string name="9223">Then don&apos;t waste my time.</string>
<string name="9224">I assume you have proper quarantine clearance to enter the District?</string>
<string name="9225">In other words, if you want access to the Blacklake district, you&apos;re going to need quarantine clearance, understood?</string>
<string name="9226">Even if you&apos;ve got quarantine clearance to get past me, there&apos;s nothing that will get you into the Nobles&apos; Quarter... </string>
<string name="9227">I doubt it&apos;s true, but food attracts flies - victims of the Wailing have been flocking to the Blacklake barricades. There&apos;ve been a few clashes already, so tread carefully. </string>
<string name="9228">Other side of that is where a Blacklake gate guard will be stationed. Maybe he&apos;ll have a better idea of how you&apos;d fit in or help out.</string>
<string name="9229">Could you answer some questions about the Docks district?</string>
<string name="9230">Yuh. Me got questions &apos;bout Dock District, okay?</string>
<string name="9231">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9232">Is there any way I can help out in there?</string>
<string name="9233">How bad is it in there?</string>
<string name="9234">Are there any places I should look out for in the Docks district?</string>
<string name="9235">Me here to help. How me do dat?</string>
<string name="9236">How bad it be in dere?</string>
<string name="9237">You know places to watch out for in Dock district?</string>
<string name="9238">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Look, I&apos;m here to help, remember?</string>
<string name="9239">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Me here to help, yuh?</string>
<string name="9240">I&apos;ve got some general questions that need answers... </string>
<string name="9241">Me have questions &apos;bout gen&apos;ral stuff, yuh?</string>
<string name="9242">Can you tell me anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?</string>
<string name="9243">What do you know about the Wailing Death?</string>
<string name="9244">Are you familiar with Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="9245">I have some questions about the Docks district.</string>
<string name="9246">Me want know more &apos;bout dose plague-cure creatures.</string>
<string name="9247">What you know &apos;bout da Wailin&apos;?</string>
<string name="9248">You know Missus Aribeth, yuh?</string>
<string name="9249">Me ask stuff &apos;bout Dock Dis-Trick, yuh?</string>
<string name="9250">Do you know anything else about what happened that night?</string>
<string name="9251">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there anyone else who might know more about the Waterdhavian creatures?</string>
<string name="9252">You know any ting else &apos;bout dat night?</string>
<string name="9253">I&apos;m interested in the plague. Can you tell me anything else about it.</string>
<string name="9254">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there anyone else who might know more about the Wailing Death?</string>
<string name="9255">Me int&apos;rested in plague. You know any udder stuff &apos;bout it?</string>
<string name="9256">Something about her fascinates me. Can you tell me anything more?</string>
<string name="9257">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there anyone else who might be able to tell me more about her?</string>
<string name="9258">Hmm. She int&apos;resting. You know more &apos;bout her?</string>
<string name="9259">Would you mind answering some more general questions for me?</string>
<string name="9260">Me have udder questions. Don&apos;t worry, dey simple.</string>
<string name="9261">Lady Aribeth has assigned me to temporary militia duty.</string>
<string name="9262">Missus Aribeth made me militia for li&apos;l while.</string>
<string name="9263">What kind of clearance do I need?</string>
<string name="9264">Uh... What you mean by &apos;clear-rinse&apos;?</string>
<string name="9265">Why do I need clearance?</string>
<string name="9266">Why me need &apos;clear-rinse&apos;?</string>
<string name="9267">Sorry, no.</string>
<string name="9268">Hail, good &lt;sir/madam&gt;! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates. The Docks have always been dangerous but now we&apos;re restricting access on Lady Aribeth&apos;s orders.</string>
<string name="9269">Be careful. There&apos;s plenty of danger afoot.</string>
<string name="9270">Yes, yes. On your way, then.</string>
<string name="9271">I&apos;ll be keeping my eye on you... </string>
<string name="9272">I see. A little on the slow side, are we?</string>
<string name="9273">I&apos;d be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="9274">I suppose I can answer a question for you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Go ahead.</string>
<string name="9275">I&apos;ll answer one of your questions... if it doesn&apos;t take long.</string>
<string name="9276">Well, you can report in to the Gate Guard on the other side. Maybe he&apos;ll know something about the... uh, I probably shouldn&apos;t be talking about that.</string>
<string name="9277">It&apos;s pretty bad - I certainly wouldn&apos;t go in unequipped. I&apos;d hide any valuables if I were you, too. In fact, it&apos;s safe to say the criminals have all but taken over the entire district. We guards do our best, but we just don&apos;t have the numbers.</string>
<string name="9278">Well, the biggest landmark is the Seedy Tavern up against the north wall, run by old Jim Seedy. The Golden Apple Inn is a little southwest of it.</string>
<string name="9279">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="9280">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you&apos;re right... Apparently there&apos;s been increasing activity from the Bloodsailors, a local pirate&apos;s guild. What they&apos;re up to is anybody&apos;s guess but it&apos;s something big... </string>
<string name="9281">If you want to know more about it, I suggest you talk to the Dockside Gate Guard. He&apos;ll have the latest information, whatever it may be.</string>
<string name="9282">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but you&apos;ll have to go through official channels and that means talking to the Dockside Gate Guard. Maybe you can convince him but my lips are sealed.</string>
<string name="9283">The Wailing&apos;s taken its toll beyond these gates, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, making it an even more dangerous place than it always was. Lady Aribeth has ordered us to restrict access.</string>
<string name="9284">Harrumph... I thought we were keeping ragamuffins like you on the other side of this gate. The Wailing&apos;s taken its toll out there, making it a dangerous place.</string>
<string name="9285">Well... I suppose telling &lt;race&gt; kin can&apos;t hurt. Apparently there&apos;s been increasing activity from the Bloodsailors, a local pirate&apos;s guild. They&apos;re up to something, I swear it.</string>
<string name="9286">A little on the slow side, are we?</string>
<string name="9287">I&apos;d be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="9288">I suppose I can answer a question for you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Go ahead.</string>

<string name="9302">Aye, there was word she&apos;d be hiring on adventurers to help fill the ranks. What can I do for you then?</string>
<string name="9303">*sigh* Thank goodness it wasn&apos;t a permanent appointment.</string>
<string name="9304">We&apos;re under pretty tight lockdown right now. Unless you have the express permission of either Lady Aribeth or Lord Nasher, you&apos;ll have to remain in the Core.</string>

<string name="9307">Then don&apos;t waste my time.</string>
<string name="9308">I assume you have proper quarantine clearance to enter the District? I don&apos;t wish to delay you amidst the stink of the corpse-fires any longer than I have to.</string>
<string name="9309">In other words, I know you want to get away from the stink of the corpse-fires, but if you want access to the Docks district, you&apos;re going to need quarantine clearance, understood?</string>
<string name="9310">Well, you&apos;d better show me quarantine clearance if you think you&apos;re going back... Lady Aribeth&apos;s orders. I don&apos;t care how much it stinks here by the fires - you need proper clearance.</string>
<string name="9311">If it&apos;s a store you&apos;re looking for, mind you, Twenty-in-a-Quiver is the best the district&apos;s got and it&apos;s just a little southeast of ol&apos; Seedy.</string>
<string name="9312">Could you answer some questions about the Peninsula district?</string>
<string name="9313">Yuh. Me got questions &apos;bout Peninsula District, okay?</string>

<string name="9360">It&apos;s pretty bad - I certainly wouldn&apos;t go in unequipped. Gate Captain Kipp can brief you once you&apos;re on the other side.</string>
<string name="9361">There&apos;s not much there, to be honest. With the prison at the top of the rise and all, most reputable folk and businesses steer clear. You should probably talk to Gate Captain Kipp on the other side - he can fill you in.</string>
<string name="9362">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="9363">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you&apos;re right... Apparently there&apos;s been a bit of a prison break. She got sent in to mop up. </string>

<string name="9365">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but you&apos;ll have to go through official channels and that means talking to Commander Sebile directly. Apparently she&apos;s set up a headquarters somewhere in the District.</string>

<string name="9395">You&apos;ll be easy pickings.</string>
<string name="9396">Alaefin will reward us handsomely for your head!</string>
<string name="9397">This is our turf now.</string>
<string name="9398">You came to the wrong part of town.</string>
<string name="9399">From all around you comes the scraping of metal bars slipping back into their stone sheaths. The cell doors have opened.</string>
<string name="9400">Deal with these nuisances, Kurdan, or your body will be the *next* I possess.</string>
<string name="9401">Don&apos;t bother bein&apos; pleasant. Just gimme the secret handshake and you&apos;re in, all right?</string>
<string name="9402">Guess you&apos;re one of them Bloodsailors, all right. Go on in and find Seldana. She&apos;ll give you the dirt on the Gaoler&apos;s plans.</string>

<string name="9422">Da Pits? Ooo, what dey be?</string>
<string name="9423">Da doors - dey locked or unlocked?</string>
<string name="9424">Da prisoners - where dey hidin&apos;?</string>
<string name="9425">Hmph. Der storerooms &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="9426">Yeah, I am... Get back to your cell or face the consequences.</string>
<string name="9427">No, I had to fight my way through them to get here.</string>
<string name="9428">... Why do you ask?</string>
<string name="9429">Yeah, me prisoner. You get back to cell before you get hurts!</string>
<string name="9430">Me? No, me club dem on way here.</string>
<string name="9431">Uh... Is dis a trick question?</string>
<string name="9432">Who are you, anyways?</string>
<string name="9433">How come you&apos;re not in your cell?</string>
<string name="9434">Think you could answer some questions for me?</string>
<string name="9435">All right, get out of here then.</string>
<string name="9436">Who you be, huh?</string>
<string name="9437">You not in cell. How come?</string>
<string name="9438">Uh, me have questions. You got time?</string>
<string name="9439">Okay den, get out of here.</string>
<string name="9440">That&apos;s all I need to know about the prison.</string>
<string name="9441">That all me need to know &apos;bout prison.</string>
<string name="9442">The Head Gaoler&apos;s right hand man is a half-orc named Kurdan Fenkt, one of the meanest prisoners in the Pit.</string>
<string name="9443">Four in total. The top two are the prison proper. The bottom two are the Pits.</string>
<string name="9444">He kept talking about cutting us, getting inside our heads. Some of our guys came out of there looking like zombies. The rest of us were... discarded.</string>
<string name="9445">Psst! Into the lockdown, quick, before the patrols see us!</string>
<string name="9446">Pull that lever. It locks the door so we&apos;ll be safe.</string>
<string name="9447">Thank goodness you&apos;ve come, then. They&apos;ve been going from cell to cell, killing us guards... I think I&apos;m the last one left.</string>
<string name="9448">The Head Gaoler? He was torturing some of us former guards on the bottom level until we managed to escape.</string>
<string name="9449">Agreed. The Head Gaoler&apos;s a monster - We have to put a stop to him.</string>
<string name="9450">It&apos;s the Security Layer - Supposed to be a buffer zone between the regular prisoners and the troublemakers we throw down in the Pits... </string>
<string name="9451">That&apos;s where you&apos;re headed. There aren&apos;t many cells down there except those the prisoners built themselves. What they did in the Pits was their business... </string>
<string name="9452">The cell doors are locked but the others should all be open. If you can get inside a lockdown and seal it up, you should be safe inside.</string>
<string name="9453">They&apos;ve barricaded themselves in the central guard room. They&apos;re sending out patrols but it&apos;s pretty haphazard - I&apos;ve killed off a couple without them noticing... </string>
<string name="9454">Yeah, you&apos;ll find them to the north and south.</string>
<string name="9455">At your command.</string>
<string name="9456">Sure thing. I&apos;ll secure the area.</string>
<string name="9457">Think we&apos;ll survive the day?</string>
<string name="9458">You&apos;re not with the prisoners, are you?</string>
<string name="9459">Yeah? Well, now that I&apos;ve got you cornered, I&apos;m going to take you down like I did the last one - point blank.</string>
<string name="9460">You&apos;re mistrusting - not the sign of a hunter. I guess that means you&apos;re being hunted, just like me. I&apos;m the last guard left, I think.</string>
<string name="9461">Just a guard. The name&apos;s Emernik.</string>
<string name="9462">I squeezed through the bars and snapped the neck of the prisoner they&apos;d sent to butcher me. Too little too late - The others are all dead.</string>
<string name="9463">I don&apos;t see why not. We&apos;re safe in here.</string>
<string name="9464">The people in those cells were my friends. Abandon their memory if you want, stranger, but I&apos;m here for some vengeance.</string>
<string name="9465"></string>
<string name="9466">Just be careful. This is place is a deathtrap right now.</string>
<string name="9467">Looks like things are cooling down. I&apos;m going to stay around here and try to get things back in order. Thanks for the help.</string>
<string name="9468">What are you, prisoner or guard?</string>
<string name="9469">Stand back! How do I know I can trust you?</string>
<string name="9470">Relax - I set you free, didn&apos;t I?</string>
<string name="9471">What you be, huh? Pris&apos;ner or guard guy?</string>
<string name="9472">You stay back! How me trust you, huh?</string>
<string name="9473">Huh? Me no cap-tor - me set you free!</string>
<string name="9474">Then I could use some information.</string>
<string name="9475">How did you end up in that cell in the first place?</string>
<string name="9476">What&apos;s the layout of this floor?</string>
<string name="9477">What do you know about the prisoners?</string>
<string name="9478">How you get &apos;prisoned anyway?</string>
<string name="9479">Think you can make your way out of here alone?</string>
<string name="9480">Any suggestions as to what we do now?</string>
<string name="9481">Okay, enough questions.</string>
<string name="9482">How dis place laid out?</string>
<string name="9483">What you know &apos;bout pris&apos;ners?</string>
<string name="9484">What we do now?</string>
<string name="9485">Okay, questions all done.</string>
<string name="9486">Hmm. Me have questions.</string>
<string name="9487">You okay runnin&apos; for door alone?</string>
<string name="9488">And the Head Gaoler?</string>
<string name="9489">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; The Pits? What&apos;s that?</string>
<string name="9490">And da Head Guy?</string>
<string name="9491">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Did the Head Gaoler keep a logbook at all?</string>
<string name="9492">Okay, get out of here, then. I&apos;ve cleared the way for you.</string>
<string name="9493">Okay, you go now den. Me already clear path for you.</string>
<string name="9494">I could use some information before you go.</string>
<string name="9495">Please, you have to get me out of here.</string>
<string name="9496">These cell doors are operated by levers in the two guard rooms near the main entrance.</string>
<string name="9497">I&apos;ve got a wife and family. Please help me.</string>
<string name="9498">Beware of the patrols. I think this corridor&apos;s the only one that&apos;s safe.</string>
<string name="9499">Thanks, I&apos;ve been in there too long... </string>
<string name="9500">I think it&apos;s fair to assume you&apos;re not one of my captors, are you?</string>
<string name="9501">You&apos;re not one of my captors, are you? No, I&apos;d recognize your face if you were.</string>
<string name="9502">You&apos;re with them, aren&apos;t you - the former prisoners... Please don&apos;t hurt me.</string>
<string name="9503">Well I *used* to be a guard... until the Head Gaoler turned everything upside down, at any rate. Look, I&apos;m with the good guys, all right?</string>
<string name="9504">Look at me, I&apos;m unarmed. If I knew anything about magic, I would have been out of here long ago... Look, the name&apos;s Commander Ralston, all right?</string>
<string name="9505">I thought maybe you&apos;re one of them come to take me downstairs... I&apos;m Commander Ralston, by the way. I used to be in charge of this floor.</string>
<string name="9506">All right but the sooner I get home to my family, the happier I&apos;ll be.</string>
<string name="9507">I don&apos;t know but I&apos;m going to try. I figure if I make a run for it, I can make it out the main door.</string>
<string name="9508">Good. If they see me out of my cell, I&apos;m a dead man.</string>
<string name="9509">Hard to say. One afternoon, the Head Gaoler just went down and unlocked the door to the Pits.</string>
<string name="9510">He walked right in there and all the prisoners walked right out. The fighting lasted a couple of days but all us guards have been captured now... or worse.</string>
<string name="9511">Apparently he&apos;s still down there. The prisoners have damn well crowned him king. If you ask me, the Wailing&apos;s got him and driven him mad... </string>
<string name="9512">That&apos;s where we throw the prisoners we can&apos;t handle. It&apos;s every man for himself down there.</string>
<string name="9513">Stairs down are on the west side. There are two cell wings, North and South, with a corridor that runs between them.</string>
<string name="9514">Each wing has a guard room with a lever to open the cell block. The south wall also has the Head Gaoler&apos;s old office.</string>
<string name="9515">The former prisoners, you mean? They&apos;re cruel, vengeful. When they came, we weren&apos;t ready for them. I saw a dozen friends cut down around me.</string>
<string name="9516">It was horrible, &lt;sir/madam&gt;! They threw a bunch of us guards into the Pits, too. For the Head Gaoler, they said... like he&apos;s going to eat them or something!</string>
<string name="9517">I don&apos;t know about you but I&apos;m heading home to my wife and kids. Set the whole place on fire as far as I&apos;m concerned. </string>
<string name="9518">Yes &lt;sir/madam&gt;! Wish me luck.</string>
<string name="9519">I&apos;m sure he did - the man was meticulous. He&apos;s probably got a million of them hidden away in his desk somewhere.</string>
<string name="9520">I figure the militia must have this place surrounded by now.</string>
<string name="9521">Well, seems like all the prisoners have had the fight scared out of them. Whatever you did, I&apos;m grateful. You saved what few of us guards are left.</string>
<string name="9522">Nothing keeping me here now. I&apos;m getting home to my family. If you hadn&apos;t cleaned this place out, I&apos;d have said burn it behind me.</string>
<string name="9523">Good luck to you. I got nothing else to say.</string>
<string name="9524"></string>
<string name="9525">Just a man like any other, maybe driven mad by the plague.</string>
<string name="9526">I&apos;m hoping it&apos;s one of the Waterdhavian creatures, actually.</string>
<string name="9527">Who are you and why are you helping the Head Gaoler?</string>
<string name="9528">You&apos;re not even worth my time. Die, grunt!</string>
<string name="9529">Jus&apos; some guy. Maybe he go plague-mad, yuh?</string>
<string name="9530">Hmm. Me hope he creature for plague-cure.</string>
<string name="9531">Who you be? Why you help dat man?</string>
<string name="9532">Grrr! Don&apos;t waste time. Me kill you now!</string>
<string name="9533">What proof do you have of this?</string>
<string name="9534">What&apos;s inside him, then? Have you seen it?</string>
<string name="9535">Yuh? Me no believe you. Prove it.</string>
<string name="9536">What inside him, den? You see it?</string>
<string name="9537">Guards into zombies? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="9538">You say zombie-guards?</string>
<string name="9539">All right, you stay here. I&apos;m going after the Head Gaoler.</string>
<string name="9540">Okay, you stay. Me go after Head Guy.</string>
<string name="9541">How horrible. Is there any way to rescue them?</string>
<string name="9542">Hmm. Is dere some way me can rescue dem?</string>
<string name="9543">Sounds like the Waterdhavian Intellect Devourer Aribeth needs.</string>
<string name="9544">Sound like Intellectal devo... deveroreror... uh... brain eater Aribeth wants.</string>
<string name="9545">You let the Head Gaoler walk all over you? How come?</string>
<string name="9546">You were king of nothing - there&apos;s nothing here.</string>
<string name="9547">The Head Gaoler&apos;s just sick with the Wailing, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="9548">Why you let Head Guy take over?</string>
<string name="9549">King of da Pits? Why dat make you proud?</string>
<string name="9550">Head Guy jus&apos; sick wit&apos; Wailing, dat&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="9551">Yes, master. We lay wait for dem here.</string>
<string name="9552">Hrrr... You show prowess in battle. I surrender to you.</string>
<string name="9553">So you hunt da Head Gaoler, yuh? You know what you face?</string>
<string name="9554">The Wailing? No. Head Gaoler, he no man anymore, just a shell of a man. On the inside, something eat his brain. It sees through his eyes, and makes him... different.</string>
<string name="9555">Why he set prisoners free? Why he make guards into zombies? Why he trust me to watch that back of his? Why? Because he ain&apos;t Alaefin anymore.</string>
<string name="9556">You meet them soon enough. They down in his lair, protectin&apos; him. Feedin&apos; him. He say he make me like them if I not serve him... </string>
<string name="9557">Ha! Maybe you can talk sense into them. Talk to them all and maybe there be no place for brain creature to jump to. It gets into new people real fast.</string>
<string name="9558">Yeah, I seen it. It&apos;s small like a dog and smells like dead moss. No head, just a big brain all open. That must be why it likes eating them so much.</string>
<string name="9559">I not know about that stuff. I just know that Head Gaoler was tough, and if brain creature can get him, then it&apos;s stronger than him, so it&apos;s really dangerous... </string>
<string name="9560">Hrrr, I not stay here. If Head Gaoler kill you, he know I surrender to you, and he eat my brain for that. I not want that.</string>
<string name="9561">Hrrr, I not know much &apos;bout that. All I know is that he not a man, just a shell of a man.</string>
<string name="9562">On the inside, something ate his brain, and sees through his eyes, making him different.</string>
<string name="9563">I Kurdan Fenkt. I was king of the Pits, &apos;till Head Gaoler come down here. Now he king of the Pits and I is just his lackey. Hrrr... </string>
<string name="9564">He have power to turn folk into zombies. He do it to guards, even. He threaten to do it to me, too.</string>
<string name="9565">Da Pits is what you make of it. Better to be king of Pits den not be any king at all... How many kings you know, anyway?</string>
<string name="9566">Hrrr. Then you ain&apos;t worth my surrender. If I die, I die as king of da Pits, then. Come on!</string>
<string name="9567">Yeah, maybe that it. Talk to the people so they go away. Otherwise, you&apos;d best kill the thing inside the Head Gaoler and kill it fast.</string>
<string name="9568">You go fight him. Maybe talk to his guards too, so they leave and brain thing not jump in them. Yeah, you do that. I get out of here.</string>
<string name="9569">The clang of metal bars echoes through the north wing of the prison.</string>
<string name="9570">Who are you?</string>
<string name="9571">I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="9572">I need directions.</string>
<string name="9573">Who you?</string>
<string name="9574">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="9575">Me need directions. Is big place.</string>
<string name="9576">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9577">I&apos;m called &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9578">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. I&apos;m an adventurer.</string>
<string name="9579">I don&apos;t generally give out my name.</string>
<string name="9580">Go soak your head. I&apos;m not telling you who I am.</string>
<string name="9581">Me is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9582">Me called &lt;FullName&gt;. Me be big adventurer.</string>
<string name="9583">Me not usually say.</string>
<string name="9584">You get lost, me not telling.</string>
<string name="9585">What kind of job?</string>
<string name="9586">What job you speak of?</string>
<string name="9587">How do you intend to get me into the prison?</string>
<string name="9588">That doesn&apos;t seem like much pay for a lot of work.</string>
<string name="9589">Perhaps you&apos;d be willing to give an advance... ?</string>
<string name="9590">What dangers are you aware of?</string>
<string name="9591">All right, I guess I&apos;m your &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="9592">No, I&apos;m not interested in this.</string>
<string name="9593">How you get me into dis prison, anyway?</string>
<string name="9594">Not much pay for lots work.</string>
<string name="9595">Maybe you give some gold now... ?</string>
<string name="9596">What dangers dere be?</string>
<string name="9597">Okay, me do it.</string>
<string name="9598">No, me no do dis stuff.</string>
<string name="9599">What was it you needed doing again?</string>
<string name="9600">Something was controlling Head Gaoler Alaefin. I&apos;ve got a piece of it.</string>
<string name="9601">Yes, I&apos;ve changed my mind. I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="9602">No, I&apos;m still not interested.</string>
<string name="9603">What you want again?</string>
<string name="9604">Head Guy Alaefin was controlled by thingy. Me kill it, and got piece.</string>
<string name="9605">Yes, me want to do it now.</string>
<string name="9606">No, me still not interested.</string>
<string name="9607">Yes, that will do nicely.</string>
<string name="9608">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I went through considerable trouble to get this... wouldn&apos;t a higher reward be suitable?</string>
<string name="9609">Better offer some more money, woman. I&apos;d hate for you to... come to harm. </string>
<string name="9610">Yuh, dat amount be okay.</string>
<string name="9611">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me have hard time taking dis. Bigger reward be better, yuh?</string>
<string name="9612">You give more gold or me get angry, start killin&apos; more den just pris&apos;ners!</string>
<string name="9613">I need no reward. The Prison&apos;s troubles have been resolved and that is all that matters.</string>
<string name="9614">Me no need gold. Prison stuff fixed now, dat&apos;s all wut&apos;s important.</string>
<string name="9615">Head Gaoler Alaefin was controlled by something.</string>
<string name="9616">I&apos;ll get back to it. Farewell.</string>
<string name="9617">I&apos;m not interested anymore.</string>
<string name="9618">Gaoler guy Alaefin controlled by nasty creature.</string>
<string name="9619">Me get back to it. Bye.</string>
<string name="9620">Me not care no more.</string>
<string name="9621">Sorry, not interested. I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="9622">Me not interested. Me go now.</string>
<string name="9623">Lady Aribeth has temporarily assigned me to militia service.</string>
<string name="9624">Aribeth make me into militia for li&apos;l while.</string>
<string name="9625">Alaefin? What can you tell me about him?</string>
<string name="9626">Alley-fin? What you know &apos;bout him?</string>
<string name="9627">How do I get into the prison, again?</string>
<string name="9628">How me get in prison?</string>
<string name="9629">Tell me again what the reward will be.</string>
<string name="9630">What reward again?</string>
<string name="9631">Sure is good to see a friendly face. What brings you here in the midst of all this chaos? You wouldn&apos;t be a new recruit, would you?</string>
<string name="9632">What brings you here? The guards weren&apos;t supposed to let anyone else into the Peninsula District... say, you aren&apos;t a new recruit, are you?</string>
<string name="9633">Who are you and why did the guards let you in here? There&apos;s enough trouble in this district without thugs like you... wait, you aren&apos;t a new recruit, are you?</string>
<string name="9634">Sedos Sebile, of the Neverwinter Militia. I&apos;m in charge of the operation here... And you?</string>
<string name="9635">Look, there&apos;s a crisis out there and I have little time for friendly banter. What I need are warm bodies to throw at a problem outside of regular militia duties.</string>
<string name="9636">Remain safe, friend.</string>
<string name="9637">Take care.</string>
<string name="9638">Yes, on your way, then.</string>
<string name="9639">Very well. &lt;FirstName&gt; it is. Truth be told, we&apos;ve got our hands full here in the Peninsula and could use your help... it&apos;s a bit outside standard militia duties though.</string>
<string name="9640">An adventurer, hmm? Very well, &lt;FullName&gt;, I could use your help here in the Peninsula... it&apos;s a bit outside standard militia duties though.</string>
<string name="9641">As you wish. All the same, we&apos;ve got our hands full here in the Peninsula and could use your help... it&apos;s a bit outside standard militia duties though.</string>
<string name="9642">With all the prisoners in the streets, we&apos;re stretched to the limit just trying to keep the civilians safe... As if the Wailing wasn&apos;t enough... </string>
<string name="9643">What I need is someone to get inside that prison and figure out what the hell is going on down there.</string>
<string name="9644">They&apos;re running the prison like a fortress, sending out raiding parties and then retreating back inside. It&apos;s been hard to get a hold of them.</string>
<string name="9645">Perhaps, but the prisoners will likely have stripped the place of any valuables, and you&apos;re welcome to keep anything you confiscate from them.</string>
<string name="9646">Certainly not. If I gave an advance to every militia member, the city coffers would be empty and the prisoners would still be rioting.</string>
<string name="9647">Besides the prisoners, you may need to watch out for the Head Gaoler, Alaefin. Recent reports suggest he&apos;s the one who set them loose in the first place... </string>
<string name="9648">Good luck then, and don&apos;t forget to report back to me if you manage to resolve whatever the trouble is down there.</string>
<string name="9649">Well, I can lead the horse to water but I can&apos;t make &lt;him/her&gt; drink. If you&apos;ll excuse me, then, there&apos;s lots to do in these troubled times.</string>
<string name="9650">You again, is it? Have you changed your mind about entering the prison for me?</string>
<string name="9651">Then we have little to talk about and you are wasting valuable time. Excuse me, I have a job to do.</string>
<string name="9652">Let&apos;s have a look at that... It&apos;s the brain of an intellect devourer, isn&apos;t it? So that&apos;s why Captain Alaefin was acting so strangely! Of course!</string>
<string name="9653">The intellect devourer was one of the Waterdhavian creatures that Lady Aribeth has been searching for to help cure the plague! You&apos;d better return this to her.</string>
<string name="9654">I thank you for all the trouble you have taken in completing this task, then. I will speak well of you when I make my report.</string>
<string name="9655">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; True, you appear to have performed admirably under such pressure. Here, take 375 gold, then, and I will make note of it in my report.</string>
<string name="9656">Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I must prepare that report to present to Lord Nasher. He is not well, but news of your success should lift his spirits some.</string>
<string name="9657">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; This is militia business, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, and we play it by the book. I&apos;ll make note of your concern in my report.</string>
<string name="9658">You had a job to do and you did it. Here&apos;s your pay, 300 gold. I&apos;ll make note of your attempt to threaten me in my report.</string>
<string name="9659">Indeed, good &lt;sir/madam&gt;. You have performed admirable service and declined all reward. I will speak most highly of you when I make my report.</string>
<string name="9660">Hello there. I&apos;m glad to see people alive. I&apos;m not sure what happened in the prison, but whatever it was, it&apos;s had a big effect on everyone out here.</string>
<string name="9661">As you wish, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, but I have my orders and shall remain here until the job is done.</string>
<string name="9662">Excellent. I shall await your return, then.</string>
<string name="9663">Do you have evidence to support that you have ended the threat? I cannot report this until we know for sure.</string>
<string name="9664">I really must file my report with Lord Nasher. Excuse me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="9665">Bring me proof that you have dealt with whatever you claim was controlling him. Then we shall see about your reward.</string>
<string name="9666">I think they probably carry keys to get back into the fortress once they&apos;ve finished looting or whatever. Nobody we&apos;ve caught has had one, though.</string>
<string name="9667">Since you can&apos;t bust down the front door, you&apos;ll have to find the person with that key. I&apos;d start near the sewers in the southwest of the district. We&apos;ve seen a number of groups around there.</string>
<string name="9668">That said, this is proof enough that you&apos;ve done the job I required of you. I imagine 300 gold in danger pay will be sufficient.</string>
<string name="9669">Has she now? Well, that&apos;s the first bit of welcome news I&apos;ve heard all day.</string>
<string name="9670">Lady Aribeth&apos;s authorized a 300 gold piece bonus to any militia member who can bring me proof that the situation&apos;s been resolved. Consider it danger pay.</string>
<string name="9671">He used to be one of the militia&apos;s best and, until now, I&apos;d never heard a bad word said of him. Lord Nasher himself appointed him to the prison&apos;s command.</string>
<string name="9672">Something just doesn&apos;t seem right with this picture. I guess the Wailing can change one&apos;s perspective on things... </string>
<string name="9673">The escaped prisoners seem to be a little less vicious. Certainly they are still dangerous, but whatever was driving the riot seems to be gone. I have no explanation.</string>
<string name="9674">Hello again. I hope your search for the cause of the riots goes well. We need all the help we can get here. Have you found anything in the prison?</string>
<string name="9675">Aribeth has authorized a 300 gold piece reward. If you wish more, we will discuss it when you produce results.</string>
<string name="9676">The escaped prisoners keep sending raiding parties out of the prison. One of them must have a key to get back in.</string>
<string name="9677">You&apos;ll have to find who has that key. I don&apos;t know any more than that.</string>
<string name="9678">The clang of metal bars echoes through the south wing of the prison.</string>
<string name="9679">There is a large hole in the side of Lady Tanglebrook&apos;s skull, the contents having been violently removed. Whatever caused this, it wasn&apos;t the Wailing Death.</string>

<string name="9748"></string>
<string name="9749">Hello, you must be one of the new city guard. I wish you luck.</string>
<string name="9750">The Wailing Death has claimed so many lives. Why do people like Meldanen have to make things worse?</string>
<string name="9751">Stay away from me! You look like the sort that might carry the plague. </string>
<string name="9752">Degenerate! Show some modesty and dress yourself! This isn&apos;t Calimshan!</string>
<string name="9753">Why are you naked? The plague must be affecting your mind! Get your filth out of the Blacklake!</string>
<string name="9754">A naked plague victim! How did you get past our barricades? Don&apos;t touch me.</string>
<string name="9755">Such wounds! Did plague victims attack you? I had thought our barricades would keep them at bay.</string>
<string name="9756">You&apos;re bleeding! I bet that Meldanen had something to do with your trouble.</string>
<string name="9757">You look absolutely wretched! Did you clash with Meldanen&apos;s guards?</string>
<string name="9758">Don&apos;t brandish your weapon at me. There&apos;s enough to fear in this place with the plague and Meldanen.</string>
<string name="9759">Keep your weapon down, lest Meldanen and his guards think you a threat.</string>
<string name="9760">A proper member of society does not wander about with their weapon drawn.</string>
<string name="9761">You&apos;re a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;! Can you explain why the gods allow the privileged of Blacklake to be enslaved by fear of the plague? I thought not.</string>
<string name="9762">I regret that the Blacklake must shut out the plagues and weak, but what choice do we have? Your gods do nothing.</string>
<string name="9763">The gods have left the Blacklake to fend for itself. Why else would someone like Meldanen be allowed to threaten people so?</string>
<string name="9764">Best keep your magics to yourself around here, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Everyone is on edge because of Meldanen.</string>
<string name="9765">I think the plague is a result of the poor classes we allowed into the district. The barricades were long overdue.</string>
<string name="9766">You magical folk can&apos;t do anything about the plague either, can you?</string>
<string name="9767">Well, nice to see another of &lt;race&gt; descent in these parts. Keep low. The locals are quick to accuse outsiders of contributing to the plague.</string>
<string name="9768">It&apos;s nice to see not everyone &lt;race&gt; has been taken by the plague. Careful around Meldanen&apos;s place. He&apos;s was nasty enough before, but now... </string>
<string name="9769">Be wary of the humans in this district, my friend. They are quick to judge. Be extra wary of that Meldanen fellow.</string>
<string name="9770">Hello, miss. Forgive my forward manner, but you are the very model of feminine beauty.</string>
<string name="9771">Always a pleasure to bump into a pretty lass like yourself.</string>
<string name="9772">You certainly bring a different flavor to the district, my lady. A treat for the eyes in this dark time.</string>
<string name="9773">My, my. Hello there, handsome.</string>
<string name="9774">You&apos;ve the right good manners of a gentleman. Not like that Meldanen cad.</string>
<string name="9775">You&apos;re a handsome one. Just don&apos;t catch the plague, or your looks won&apos;t last long. </string>
<string name="9776">A word of advice. If you get the Wailing Death, you won&apos;t last long in this district. We&apos;ll put you behind the barricades.</string>
<string name="9777">How do you do, my &lt;lord/lady&gt; guard? I trust everything is well at the barricades, and that no plagued sods will make it through?</string>
<string name="9778">You&apos;ll have to pardon me. The plague has taken my desire for conversation.</string>
<string name="9779">I hope a plague cure is found soon. The barricades can&apos;t keep everyone out.</string>
<string name="9780">Don&apos;t touch me! You&apos;re ugly enough to be one of the plague-stricken. Why didn&apos;t the barricades keep you out?</string>
<string name="9781">Stand away from me. You could be one of Meldanen&apos;s thugs, or even a plague victim! </string>
<string name="9782">Hmph! Barbarians like you probably brought some strange mountain disease down upon us. Why were you allowed past our barricades?</string>
<string name="9783">A barbarian! I thought the barricades would have kept your kind out of our district. This is probably Meldanen&apos;s doing.</string>
<string name="9784">You don&apos;t belong among the nobles of Blacklake. What are you, another of Meldanen&apos;s thugs?</string>
<string name="9785">Well, wonderful. More &lt;race&gt; rabble. Plague carriers, I bet. We should hire more men for the barricades, or hire some away from Meldanen. What does he need so many for?</string>
<string name="9786">I have better things to do than chat with any old &lt;race&gt; n&apos;er-do-well that wanders by. You&apos;re probably up to dirty business with that Meldanen.</string>
<string name="9787">For all we know, it was &lt;race&gt; trickery that started this whole plague business. We should put you behind the barricades as well.</string>
<string name="9788">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="9789">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="9790">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9791">What have you heard of the Waterdhavian creatures on the loose?</string>
<string name="9792">Any strange events lately that you can think of?</string>
<string name="9793">Anything interesting going on in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="9794">You hear &apos;bout Waterdhavian creatures, maybe?</string>
<string name="9795">Any strange stuff happen?</string>
<string name="9796">What going on here?</string>
<string name="9797">Any idea where they could be if they came here?</string>
<string name="9798">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Has there been anything odd since the creatures escaped, that you remember?</string>
<string name="9799">You think where they go if they came, maybe?</string>
<string name="9800">Anything you consider odd?</string>
<string name="9801">Anyone in need of assistance that you know of?</string>
<string name="9802">Places of interest, perhaps?</string>
<string name="9803">Odd stuff?</string>
<string name="9804">Someone need help, maybe?</string>
<string name="9805">Neat places to go?</string>
<string name="9806">There&apos;s been no cases of the plague here at all?</string>
<string name="9807">No plague here at all?</string>
<string name="9808">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="9809">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="9810">What do you know about the plague?</string>
<string name="9811">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="9812">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="9813">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="9814">I need directions.</string>
<string name="9815">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="9816">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="9817">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="9818">I&apos;m looking for a good tavern.</string>
<string name="9819">Me look for temple.</string>
<string name="9820">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="9821">Good place to drink?</string>
<string name="9822">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="9823">No, me have other question.</string>
<string name="9824">I made it past the gate, didn&apos;t I?</string>
<string name="9825">Watch your tone. I&apos;ve had enough of being challenged.</string>
<string name="9826">I am a member of the guard, working for Aribeth.</string>
<string name="9827">Me get past gate, no?</string>
<string name="9828">Watch tone! Me no like always being yelled at!</string>
<string name="9829">Me is a guard, work for Aribeth.</string>
<string name="9830">Yes, and to the Abyss with your orders, I&apos;ll go where I like.</string>
<string name="9831">Yeah, and me no care about orders. Me go where me wants.</string>
<string name="9832">Anything else?</string>
<string name="9833">Any more?</string>
<string name="9834">Who might you be, &lt;sir/madam&gt;? I don&apos;t recognize you. You are aware the district is off-limits to all but residents and the city guard?</string>
<string name="9835">Fare you well, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="9836">As you wish, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="9837">Yes, yes, off you go.</string>
<string name="9838">(sigh) Why do I always get stuck with this type?</string>
<string name="9839">I&apos;d be happy to answer a question or two, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="9840">I suppose I can answer a question for you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="9841">If it doesn&apos;t take too long. Go ahead.</string>
<string name="9842">I heard something about some beasts loose in the city... but I haven&apos;t seen anything like that here in Blacklake, that&apos;s for certain.</string>
<string name="9843">Nothing to do with the plague, no. We haven&apos;t been getting much news here since we closed the district off.</string>
<string name="9844">Could be, I suppose. What kinds of things you find interesting?</string>
<string name="9845">There&apos;s been a couple of incidents... but we&apos;ve quarantined them right away. But no... no outbreaks, thankfully. No idea how long that&apos;ll last, though.</string>
<string name="9846">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="9847">Well... there is the business with Meldanen&apos;s visitor. But I&apos;m not supposed to talk about that... </string>
<string name="9848">Hmph. That Formosa keeps on going on in the southeast square about how she wants help. Someone should shut her up, you ask me.</string>
<string name="9849">I don&apos;t know. Maybe the zoo? That&apos;s in the northeast. Me, I like the Board Laid Bare... you should check out the basement. Heh.</string>
<string name="9850">Well, that&apos;s pretty rich. I don&apos;t think you are quite what people here are looking for. Someone looking for you? Ha!</string>
<string name="9851">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="9852">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you&apos;re right. Meldanen&apos;s had this strange woman visiting him the past few days. He&apos;s been real secretive about her.</string>
<string name="9853">Some of the fellows think he&apos;s holding her there... he&apos;s just the type. At any rate, his estate is up in the northwest if you want to go there. I wouldn&apos;t.</string>
<string name="9854">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but I don&apos;t want to be on the wizard&apos;s bad side. If you want to know about it, go see him at his estate in the northwest.</string>
<string name="9855">You could try the zoo up in the northeast. Maybe something&apos;s hiding there, I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="9856">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="9857">Hmm. You know, that&apos;s when Meldanen got his new visitor. Some strange woman that he&apos;s been real insistent on us guards not talking about. Even paid us some gold.</string>
<string name="9858">I can tell you, though. The lass is strange, and it does fit the time... but what do I know? Meldanen lives on an estate in the northwest, at any rate.</string>
<string name="9859">Identify yourself, &lt;sir/madam&gt;! Blacklake is off-limits to all but district residents and the city guard!</string>
<string name="9860">You there! Identify yourself! How did you find your way into the district, tell me!</string>
<string name="9861">Well... I suppose telling a fellow &lt;race&gt; can&apos;t hurt. Meldanen&apos;s had this strange woman visiting him the past few days. He&apos;s been real secretive about her. </string>
<string name="9862">Not much more than anyone else, thankfully. Patrolling here in Blacklake has its advantages, after all.</string>
<string name="9863">Where do you need to go?</string>
<string name="9864">(sigh) Make it quick.</string>
<string name="9865">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="9866">Yes, I suppose it would seem large to someone like you, wouldn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="9867">There ain&apos;t no temple in Blacklake. If there were, the clerics would likely be kicked out, anyway.</string>
<string name="9868">Not really. You can buy stuff at the Board Laid Bare, though. It&apos;s a tavern by the south gate.</string>
<string name="9869">Board Laid Bare. Near the south gate. Interesting stuff going on in the cellar.</string>
<string name="9870">Err... yes, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I think I recognize you now. You&apos;re one of them working for Aribeth de Tylmarande, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="9871">I&apos;m not interested in what you&apos;ve had enough of, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. There is a plague in the city... wait, I recognize you now. You&apos;re one of Lady Aribeth&apos;s whelp recruits.</string>
<string name="9872">Well, yes... I suppose you did, at that. Come to think of it, you&apos;re working for Lady Aribeth, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="9873">Who says you passed the gate? Not I. Now, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, I have strict orders regarding intruders in the district.</string>
<string name="9874">Right, I remember now.</string>
<string name="9875">My apologies, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Can&apos;t be too careful with folks getting desperate and all. I&apos;ll tell the other patrolmen about you, to be sure.</string>
<string name="9876">I suppose you have that right, working for the city as you do. I&apos;d be more polite around the established guards, though; you&apos;ll need what friends you can get.</string>
<string name="9877">Greetings, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Is there something you need?</string>
<string name="9878">You mean... oh, in the Blacklake district. I see what you mean.</string>
<string name="9879">Well... maybe you want to talk to Captain Thurin. One of the older guards has been missing for a while. Probably fell into the gutter.</string>
<string name="9880">You&apos;ll find Thurin at the tavern, most like. Wouldn&apos;t bother, though, were I you.</string>
<string name="9881">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="9882">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="9883">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9884">What do you know about the plague?</string>
<string name="9885">Have you heard anything about strange creatures in the area?</string>
<string name="9886">Do you know anything of interest about Blacklake?</string>
<string name="9887">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="9888">You hears of strange creatures maybe?</string>
<string name="9889">You know things &apos;bout Blacklake?</string>
<string name="9890">I&apos;m investigating the plague. Maybe you could help me?</string>
<string name="9891">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe you&apos;ve heard some rumors here in Blacklake about the plague? Odd things, perhaps?</string>
<string name="9892">Me look into plague. Maybe you help?</string>
<string name="9893">What kind of odd things do you hear?</string>
<string name="9894">I&apos;d be interested in work, if you know of anything.</string>
<string name="9895">Are there any places of interest in Blacklake I should visit?</string>
<string name="9896">Odd stuff? What odd stuff you speak of?</string>
<string name="9897">Me want work.</string>
<string name="9898">You know good places to go here?</string>
<string name="9899">Anything you can tell me about the zoo?</string>
<string name="9900">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; What about creatures other than at the zoo? Maybe you&apos;ve heard of something recent?</string>
<string name="9901">What you know &apos;bout zoo, then?</string>
<string name="9902">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="9903">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="9904">Maybe you could tell me about some recent events.</string>
<string name="9905">Me have questions about stuff going on.</string>
<string name="9906">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="9907">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="9908">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="9909">Blacklake big place. Me need directions.</string>
<string name="9910">Where is the nearest inn?</string>
<string name="9911">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="9912">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="9913">Me look for place to sleep.</string>
<string name="9914">Me look for temple.</string>
<string name="9915">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="9916">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="9917">No, me have other question.</string>
<string name="9918">Who are you?</string>
<string name="9919">Who you?</string>
<string name="9920"></string>
<string name="9921">So... what, exactly, do you clean?</string>
<string name="9922">I thought only nobles lived in Blacklake.</string>
<string name="9923"></string>
<string name="9924">What you clean?</string>
<string name="9925"></string>
<string name="9926">So you&apos;ve been in every house in the area?</string>
<string name="9927">So you go in all these houses?</string>
<string name="9928">Are there certain estates you don&apos;t go into?</string>
<string name="9929">Any noble houses you not like going to?</string>
<string name="9930">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, go on. What were you about to say?</string>
<string name="9931">Tell me about the wizard, woman, before you try cleaning without hands.</string>
<string name="9932">Could I ask you some other questions?</string>
<string name="9933">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; No, you say. You can tells me.</string>
<string name="9934">You speak &apos;bout wizard or you cleans without hands!</string>
<string name="9935">Me have other questions.</string>
<string name="9936">You might know some secrets about Meldanen, then?</string>
<string name="9937">If he snuck you into the estate, perhaps that entrance still exists?</string>
<string name="9938">You knows wizard&apos;s secrets?</string>
<string name="9939">I am grateful. Take these ten gold pieces as a gift from me.</string>
<string name="9940"></string>
<string name="9941"></string>
<string name="9942"></string>
<string name="9943"></string>
<string name="9944"></string>
<string name="9945"></string>
<string name="9946">Oh, hullo there, &lt;mister/missus&gt;. Something I can do for ye?</string>
<string name="9947">Off already? Another day, then, &lt;mister/missus&gt;.</string>
<string name="9948">Aye, farewell to ye.</string>
<string name="9949">Run off, then, an&apos; leave an old woman to &apos;er work.</string>
<string name="9950">I see. A little on the slow side, are we?</string>
<string name="9951">Seems to me like ye already have, &lt;boy/girl&gt;, heh.</string>
<string name="9952">Go on, then. I could stand to gab for a moment or two, aye.</string>
<string name="9953">Ask, then, but I&apos;ll be watching yer hands. Ye&apos;ve the look of a pickpocket, &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="9954">I&apos;ve got family beyond them walls, &lt;boy/girl&gt;, one&apos;s that ain&apos;t caught the Wailing Death yet. I hears plenty about it. Why?</string>
<string name="9955">Oh, aye, there&apos;s plenty of odd beasts and more besides at the zoo, of course.</string>
<string name="9956">I gets around the district a bit, an&apos; hears odd things as an old lady does. What did ye have in mind?</string>
<string name="9957">Other than yerself? Heh heh, nevermind silly me, &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="9958">Well... there is that whole business with Formosa. But it&apos;s not polite to talk about such things.</string>
<string name="9959">Hee hee... I needs a hand with the laundry scrubbin&apos;. I can spare a copper for ye, &lt;boy/girl&gt;. Heh heeee... ah, don&apos;t mind me none.</string>
<string name="9960">Not sure what a young &lt;lad/lass&gt; like you would like. Maybe go to the Board Laid Bare by the gate... &apos;tis got a strange reputation, they says. Never been there, meself.</string>
<string name="9961">I&apos;ve grunted that meself over the years, I have.</string>
<string name="9962">What else did ye need?</string>
<string name="9963">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I s&apos;pose not, at that. Formosa&apos;s been stirrin&apos; up trouble at the square, they says, trying to turn everyone against the wizard.</string>
<string name="9964">Bah, best ye hears such things for yerself, I can&apos;t make no sense of it. The square&apos;s in the southwest part o&apos; the district... and Formosa&apos;s there, no doubt.</string>
<string name="9965">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. If ye&apos;re really interested, head down to the square on the southeast corner. Ye won&apos;t be disappointed.</string>
<string name="9966">I don&apos;t know anything other than all the babble... but ye could hears that anywhere, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="9967">Something else, then, &lt;boy/girl&gt;?</string>
<string name="9968">Well... there&apos;s some folks who think the keepers at the zoo should be killin&apos; all their animals. Somethin&apos; about them coming from Waterdeep or somesuch.</string>
<string name="9969">Don&apos;t know why that would be. The zookeep&apos;s talked plenty to the city guard not so long ago... you&apos;d think they&apos;d know their business.</string>
<string name="9970">Why don&apos;t ye give it a visit and see for yerself? Them noble types always likes to show off their pretty critters, they does. It be on the north end o&apos; the district.</string>
<string name="9971">Does ye have more questions?</string>
<string name="9972">Eh... they says that Meldanen the wizard keeps himself a collection o&apos; beasties, but I don&apos;t know anything about how recent he got them.</string>
<string name="9973">You wants to talk to &apos;im, he has a mansion on the northwest end o&apos; the district. He don&apos;t like visitors, though.</string>
<string name="9974">What is it, &lt;boy/girl&gt;? Make it snappy. Haven&apos;t got all day.</string>
<string name="9975">You just stay right where ye are, &lt;boy/girl&gt;, so I can keep an eye on ye.</string>
<string name="9976">I might. What events are you referring to?</string>
<string name="9977">Sure enough. Where does ye need t&apos; be?</string>
<string name="9978">(sigh) Aye, go on.</string>
<string name="9979">Go on.</string>
<string name="9980">I&apos;ve needed a few meself as me gets older, heh. Where was I? Oh, yes.</string>
<string name="9981">Only the Board Laid Bare in these parts. Ye&apos;ll find it in the south o&apos; the district, near the gate. Mind yerself there.</string>
<string name="9982">Hmph. The nobles be all godless in these parts. No temples in Blacklake just yet, &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="9983">Nay. Could be that ye could buy some things at the Board Laid Bare, mayhaps. T&apos;is on the south end of the district, by the gate.</string>
<string name="9984">Something else?</string>
<string name="9985">Heh, most o&apos; the rich folk round these parts jus&apos; call me the Cleaning Lady. Weren&apos;t always so, of course. Once I had me a pretty name to match me face.</string>
<string name="9986">The city pays me a bit o&apos; coin to go around the district and keep it tidy, sure enough. I also takes in laundry from me neighbours.</string>
<string name="9987"></string>
<string name="9988">I keeps the streets an&apos; such swept around here. An&apos; to get a few extra coppers I takes in laundry from the neighbours, aye.</string>
<string name="9989">Oh, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s some that&apos;d like everyone to think that, but it weren&apos;t true. There&apos;s servants an&apos; poor folk alike here in the Blacklake.</string>
<string name="9990">Don&apos;t think we aren&apos;t thankful for the ones that live here, none. If it weren&apos;t for them, we poor folk&apos;d be the first to feel the touch of the plague, we would.</string>
<string name="9991">Not every house, silly &lt;boy/girl&gt;, but close enough as it makes no difference.</string>
<string name="9992">Oh, my! Ye certainly wouldn&apos;t catch me going to Meldanen&apos;s estate to take &apos;is laundry, of all things, no no no. Mind you, there was a time... </string>
<string name="9993">Ahhhh, but I should not talk about such things. I be an old lady, &lt;boy/girl&gt;... best you leave me to me work, now.</string>
<string name="9994">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, t&apos;was a long time ago, &lt;boy/girl&gt;, when I were a pretty lass. Meldanen were a young nobleman, then, an&apos; handsome besides.</string>
<string name="9995">His father, rest &apos;is soul, didn&apos;t approve of me none, so young Meldanen used t&apos; sneak me into the estate, he did. Hee hee!</string>
<string name="9996">But that were long before Meldanen became a wizard an&apos; such. He&apos;s no use for a poor old woman no more, an&apos; it&apos;s best left in the past.</string>
<string name="9997">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Nay, nay. They say it&apos;s best not to talk about the wizard, an&apos; I agree. T&apos;is of no importance, besides.</string>
<string name="9998"></string>
<string name="9999">Pfeh, threaten an old woman, would ye? T&apos;is nothing but an old story, &lt;boy/girl&gt;. I were a pretty lass an&apos; Meldanen a handsome nobleman.</string>
