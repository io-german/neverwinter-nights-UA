<resources><string name="0">What?! How dare you! Get out of my tavern this instant! Get out!!</string>
<string name="1">A reward? I&apos;ll need every coin I have just to repair the damage these creatures have done! Will you help us or not?</string>
<string name="2">Oh, I&apos;ve noticed, all right. The thought that you&apos;re the kind of student that mage is taking in makes me ill. Have you no sense of decency?</string>
<string name="3">Yes, but it isn&apos;t helping. They want us to let them leave, but they want to take Mara with them as a hostage. We can&apos;t allow that, they&apos;ll kill her!</string>
<string name="4">Of course losing Mara is a bad thing! What a terrible thing to say!</string>
<string name="5">Who knows how long it will be before they can help? And besides, they&apos;ll be in the same situation we are. If you can&apos;t help us, &lt;FirstName&gt;, who can?</string>
<string name="6">I... I suppose that&apos;s true, it&apos;s not. But I don&apos;t know what to do! They&apos;re holding my cook hostage in there... if we try to get past the barricade, they&apos;ll kill her!</string>
<string name="7">Please... can&apos;t you help us at all, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I&apos;d hate to see Mara hurt.</string>
<string name="8">Have you tried negotiating with them at all?</string>
<string name="9">And this is a bad thing, yes?</string>
<string name="10">Then I suppose the stories I&apos;ve heard about you aren&apos;t true. I thought Drogan&apos;s apprentices were decent folk.</string>
<string name="11">I don&apos;t see why you don&apos;t just go in there and kill them. You outnumber them, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="12">People have all kinds of stupid ideas. Why should we be faulted for them?</string>
<string name="13">Is there nothing you can do to help us? They&apos;re holding my cook hostage in there. If we try to break through the barricade, they&apos;ll kill her for certain!</string>
<string name="14">It&apos;s not that simple. They&apos;ve taken my cook hostage. If we try to get past the barricade they&apos;ll kill Mara for certain!</string>
<string name="15">We can&apos;t get in there. They&apos;re holding my cook hostage... if we try to push past the barricade, they&apos;ll kill her for sure! Can you help us, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="16">Well... the kobolds are all dead. At least it&apos;s over now.</string>
<string name="17">Thank the gods all this kobold business is finally over with. Serves them right for attacking the Bubbling Cauldron!</string>
<string name="18">I can&apos;t believe you actually let those kobolds go... but I suppose I can respect your reasons for doing so, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="19">It&apos;s too bad Mara had to die. I really wish things had turned out differently. It&apos;ll be strange to open the tavern again without her.</string>
<string name="20">I wonder if we&apos;ll ever find out what happened to Mara? I... really don&apos;t agree with your decision, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I suppose someone had to make it. Best not to dwell on it.</string>
<string name="21">Of course. Good luck to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="22">That... that&apos;s a cruel thing to say. You let them go, and... but I... I suppose you had your reasons. Just... go on and leave me be.</string>
<string name="23">I... I see. Thank you for telling me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. At least we know, now.</string>
<string name="24">At any rate, Mara is alive and that&apos;s what&apos;s important. Now all I have to do is clean this mess up and try to get things back to normal.</string>
<string name="25">It was a good thing you came by, at any rate, or Mara would have been killed for sure. Here... it&apos;s not much, I know, but I hope 50 gold will do as a reward.</string>
<string name="26">I... well, I... the tavern needs to be rebuilt! It... no, no, you&apos;re right. Here... 100 gold. It&apos;s all I have. You do deserve it.</string>
<string name="27">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I... I can&apos;t, &lt;FirstName&gt;, as much as I think you deserve it. I need to rebuild this place. Here... take the coin and my thanks. That&apos;s all I can do.</string>
<string name="28">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well... even though I&apos;ve got to scrape together enough to rebuild this place, you&apos;re right. Here... take 100 gold and my thanks.</string>
<string name="29">Then take the coin with my thanks. You&apos;re a credit to this town, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="30">Hmm. Mara uses those, I think... perhaps you should ask her if she has any. I&apos;m certain she&apos;d be more than happy to give them to you.</string>
<string name="31">But berries are no reward... here, take the coin with my thanks. You&apos;re a credit to this town, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="32">Truly? You&apos;re a kind &lt;man/woman&gt;, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Drogan would be proud of you, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="33">Well, at least all this kobold business is finally over with. That was a good trick you pulled, &lt;FirstName&gt;, luring them out like that. Risky, though.</string>
<string name="34">I can&apos;t believe you simply let the kobolds run off with Mara like that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That was your answer? Bah!</string>
<string name="35">Sorry. The Bubbling Cauldron won&apos;t be open again until all this mess is finally cleaned up. Come back another time.</string>
<string name="36">Hah! Good job, getting these vermin out of the kitchen! Now, shall we get rid of them once and for all?</string>
<string name="37">Yip! We kobolds surrender! We leave, you say! You no harm, you say!</string>
<string name="38">Don&apos;t be stupid, you little evil beast! If we let you go, you&apos;ll just do the same somewhere else! You deserve to die, right, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="39">Let&apos;s get this over with! Kill them all!!</string>
<string name="40">Ahhhh, fine. Have it your way, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I tell you that they&apos;ll just be back to torment us again!</string>
<string name="41">Go on then, you little beasts. Get out of my tavern! Go!!</string>
<string name="42">What are you talking about, &lt;FirstName&gt;? These are evil creatures! There&apos;s no reasoning with them!</string>
<string name="43">For how long? Forever? These are not people who will regret their ways and can be good citizens again! These are monsters, &lt;FirstName&gt;!</string>
<string name="44">Well, yes... but that&apos;s because they had no choice! They&apos;re monsters! As soon as we let them go, they&apos;ll be off to kill again!</string>
<string name="45">So we should just let them go? Let them suffer nothing for what they&apos;ve done? Because that&apos;s the only option, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="46">Then we kill them. There&apos;s no other way. Let&apos;s get this over with! Kill them all!!</string>
<string name="47">Do you need some help?</string>
<string name="48">Forget it. You&apos;re on your own.</string>
<string name="49">I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="50">Tell me why I should bother helping you.</string>
<string name="51">Fine, fine, I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="52">That doesn&apos;t sound like a reason. I guess I&apos;ll be leaving.</string>
<string name="53">Come to think of it, maybe I should help the kobolds...</string>
<string name="54">Some kind of reward would be an incentive, you know.</string>
<string name="55">If you haven&apos;t noticed, Drogan&apos;s not here.</string>
<string name="56">Have you tried talking with them?</string>
<string name="57">And losing your cook is a bad thing?</string>
<string name="58">Shouldn&apos;t the town guard handle this?</string>
<string name="59">So? I don&apos;t see this as my problem.</string>
<string name="60">Why don&apos;t you finish them off, then?</string>
<string name="61">Hmmm. I need an herb that might be in your kitchen.</string>
<string name="62">I should go.</string>
<string name="63">Get over it. Mara&apos;s dead. I found the body.</string>
<string name="64">I found Mara&apos;s body just outside of town. They killed her... I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="65">50 gold?! Do better than that, or kobolds will be the least of your problems!</string>
<string name="66">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sure you can do better than that, Lodar.</string>
<string name="67">50 gold would be fine, thanks.</string>
<string name="68">Actually, all I really need is some Helmthorn berries.</string>
<string name="69">No reward is necessary. I was happy to help.</string>
<string name="70">Sounds good to me!</string>
<string name="71">No, I won&apos;t break my word to them. Let them go.</string>
<string name="72">That&apos;s a little bloodthirsty of you, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="73">So then we&apos;re no better than they are?</string>
<string name="74">I suppose you&apos;re correct. Do what you wish, then.</string>
<string name="75">They&apos;re helpless, now. I won&apos;t permit a slaughter just to ease your anger.</string>
<string name="76">They have broken the law. We should imprison them.</string>
<string name="77">I convinced them to surrender, didn&apos;t I? And they let Mara live?</string>
<string name="78">That&apos;s my point. There should be a difference between us and monsters.</string>
<string name="79">Do what must be done, then. I&apos;ll not take part.</string>
<string name="80">No, I suppose they should pay for what they&apos;ve done...</string>
<string name="81">Then yes, we let them go.</string>
<string name="82">We&apos;ll teach you to attack us!</string>
<string name="83">You won&apos;t get far!</string>
<string name="84">Damn you little monsters! Come out and fight!</string>
<string name="85">Hiding behind a hostage? You little cowards!</string>
<string name="86">Are you going to help us free Mara? If so, you should probably talk to Lodar.</string>
<string name="87">I don&apos;t understand why these kobolds attacked Hilltop to begin with. What could they hope to gain?</string>
<string name="88">You just let them walk out of here with Mara? What will happen to her?</string>
<string name="89">Well done, &lt;FirstName&gt;! You saved Mara!</string>
<string name="90">Mara died, after all that. Well... I suppose you did your best, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="91">Leave me be. Finally got some peace here, now. I just hope they open the tavern soon... I need a drink.</string>
<string name="92">Best be careful, there, youngster. As ye can see, the tavern&apos;s had a bit of a problem with kobolds.</string>
<string name="93">Yup. Off ye go there, youngster.</string>
<string name="94">What? I hope ye&apos;re joking.</string>
<string name="95">No it ain&apos;t, now git. Bloody kids these days could give an old man a heart condition.</string>
<string name="96">Hmph. Here, then. Take it, for what it&apos;s worth. I&apos;m going back out there... it&apos;d be less ironic to be robbed by kobolds.</string>
<string name="97">Ye got that right. Now run along and bother someone younger, ye little vagrant.</string>
<string name="98">Kobolds started a fight they couldn&apos;t finish. Barricaded themselves in the kitchen, I think, an&apos; got themselves a hostage.</string>
<string name="99">Ye got that right. Can&apos;t remember the last time them little kobolds got so brave. They like to steal, usually, but not fight.</string>
<string name="100">Nasty, sneaky buggers. Probably from up in the Nether Mountains, I&apos;d wager. You go out to Blumberg, you&apos;ll find good paths that lead up there.</string>
<string name="101">Ye&apos;re asking me? Huh. Maybe they got driven out of their caves by somethin&apos; bigger, or maybe they got told to attack. I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="102">Huh. Maybe so. You &lt;race&gt; folk looks young, an&apos; that&apos;s all I have to say about that.</string>
<string name="103">Thanks for the information.</string>
<string name="104">I suppose with everyone so distracted, robbing you will be easy.</string>
<string name="105">Yes, I am. Ha ha! Funny, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="106">Not at all. I could use a few extra coins.</string>
<string name="107">Oh, forget it. You probably don&apos;t have anything worth taking.</string>
<string name="108">What&apos;s going on here, anyhow?</string>
<string name="109">The whole town&apos;s been attacked, it seems.</string>
<string name="110">Do you know anything else about kobolds?</string>
<string name="111">Why do you think the kobolds attacked?</string>
<string name="112">Youngster? I&apos;m probably older than you are.</string>
<string name="113">Go and speak to the boss, Nathan. I got chores to do.</string>
<string name="114">Ah, one of Drogan&apos;s students! Always nice to see your young face in here. Now, which one are you again?</string>
<string name="115">I am kidding, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Do not get such a sour face; I have not forgotten you. I am not so old as all that. Now, are you here to buy something, or just for a visit?</string>
<string name="116">Do be careful out there. I have seen dark times before, and I think they are back again.</string>
<string name="117">I am always willing to visit with a friendly customer. What would you like to know?</string>
<string name="118">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt;A bloody tax already? Why that... wait a minute. There has been no time for any decisions about that. You just made that up!</string>
<string name="119">Ha, ha, ha! Oh my, that was a good one, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You really had me going there for a minute. What a funny &lt;boy/girl&gt; you are. Now was there anything else?</string>
<string name="120">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; A bloody tax already? Why I ought to go over to the hall and wring Shuttlescombe&apos;s neck! No good mayor, always trying to find new taxes!</string>
<string name="121">Well, he is not getting any from me. I paid my defense tax when I paid my regular tax, and you can tell Shuttlescombe that I said so! Ah, that makes me so mad!</string>
<string name="122">Well, it is not your fault, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will not blame you, but next time I see the mayor, he&apos;ll be hearing my voice alright. What else can I do for you?</string>
<string name="123">Ha! One ran in here, and got its brains dashed out by my hammer and then I threw the corpse outside. That was the last I saw of any kobolds.</string>
<string name="124">I must have missed the main body of kobolds as I worked the forge. I hunted around, but they were gone. I guess the one that came in must have been a straggler.</string>
<string name="125">Is there anything else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="126">Would you like to buy something now?</string>
<string name="127">Yes.</string>
<string name="128">Oh, right now? Ha, ha, sorry. Bad joke. Some people think I have an odd sense of humor. What do you think, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Am I so very strange?</string>
<string name="129">Well, I am not so very good at serious, my friend. Humor is a wonderful shield that is more difficult to penetrate than the thickest armor.</string>
<string name="130">Ha! I love your sense of humor, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I could stand here all day and swap jokes with you.</string>
<string name="131">I find that highly insulting! You are never to speak to me again.</string>
<string name="132">Ha! I see you are not so easily fooled. That is good, though it does ruin the amusement.</string>
<string name="133">I am joking again! You are too easy to fool, &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="134">Ah, you are too sweet. I could pick you up and give you a big kiss. But I suppose that would not be appropriate.</string>
<string name="135">So you want to know about me? One of the things you should know by now, &lt;FirstName&gt;, is that the people who come to these small frontier towns usually do so for good reason.</string>
<string name="136">Most of us do not wish to talk about the past, and we spend most of our lives trying to pretend it never happened.</string>
<string name="137">That is what I would prefer. Thank you. Now, is there anything else?</string>
<string name="138">Let us just say that I grew up at Zhentil Keep and have only the most unpleasant memories of it. I do not wish to speak of it further.</string>
<string name="139">Now, was there anything else?</string>
<string name="140">Yes, that is true. He came in one day, looking so thin and hungry, I took pity on him and bought his useless old weapon for far more than it was worth.</string>
<string name="141">It would have been an embarrassment to sell it, so I still have it around here somewhere.</string>
<string name="142">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Why that lying old... wait a minute! You are pulling my leg, yes? Of course you are! I always loved your sense of humor, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="143">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, that lying old cretin! As if I would have any need for this lousy thing.</string>
<string name="144">I suppose it was charity that drove me to buy the poor old sword in the first place. I see no reason to recoup my losses. You may have it.</string>
<string name="145">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="146">I have never seen such beautiful antlers before. Surely these are a great prize. I can feel the magical energies pulsing through them.</string>
<string name="147">I could make a powerful magical helm from these, but the cost would be high. Are you interested in selling them to me, or in having them made into a magical helm?</string>
<string name="148">I will pay you 100 gold for these rarities.</string>
<string name="149">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I am sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I do not have so much extra gold that I can afford to be throwing it away.</string>
<string name="150">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you are such a charmer. I swear, you could talk Ilmater into beating a cripple! Ha!</string>
<string name="151">I will offer you 150 gold, but that is the most I can pay you. Is that acceptable?</string>
<string name="152">It was good doing business with you. Ah, these are beautiful.</string>
<string name="153">It was good doing business with you. Ah, these are beautiful.</string>
<string name="154">I told you I would pay you 150 gold, and I shall, but that is all.</string>
<string name="155">It will cost you 1000 gold, but I think it will be worth your while. Have you the gold for such an enterprise?</string>
<string name="156">What would you have me do? Bear the price myself?</string>
<string name="157">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I would like to do this for much less. I would even like to do this for 500 gold.</string>
<string name="158">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Good for you, young &lt;FirstName&gt;! I am glad to see you are starting to stiffen your spine and stand up for yourself. Now give me the 1000 gold, or quit wasting my time.</string>
<string name="159">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ha! You are such a prankster, young &lt;FirstName&gt;! Fine, since you tell such good jokes, I will do this for 500 gold. But do not be spreading this around.</string>
<string name="160">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Do I look like such a fool to you? Take your wishful thinking elsewhere; I will not be moved.</string>
<string name="161">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ha! You are such a prankster, young &lt;FirstName&gt;! Fine, since you tell such good jokes, I will do this for 500 gold. But do not be spreading this around.</string>
<string name="162">Excellent, Don&apos;t worry about the gold right now...Pay me when the work is completed.  I shall get right to work on this. Return in a while and I shall have it done for you.</string>
<string name="163">I have offered you a discount you cannot refuse. 500 gold and I shall make this helm for you.</string>
<string name="164">I do hope you mean my inventory and not my massive bosom, ha, ha! Sorry, old jokes are the best.</string>
<string name="165">You have returned, &lt;FirstName&gt;. What can I do for you now?</string>
<string name="166">Do come back now. </string>
<string name="167">I do not know him. Well... I guess I do know him, but there is a part of me that wishes I did not. So, how is the mindless fool?</string>
<string name="168">Dead? What do you mean? How is he dying?</string>
<string name="169">You know he is a prisoner and yet you did nothing to free him? That shows a better sense of judgment than I would have given you credit for, ha, ha.</string>
<string name="170">How was he captured by gnolls? I did not think he led an active enough lifestyle to be captured by anything more than a flask of cheap wine.</string>
<string name="171">Well, if you are looking to me to go and rescue him, think again. I have had little to do with him and he with me. I guess if you want to rescue him, I would be alright with that.</string>
<string name="172">As you will. It does not hurt my feelings any. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="173">I do not think you understand the situation, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I really do not care for my brother. Asking me for gold to save him is foolishness.</string>
<string name="174">Ah, now you have made me feel bad. Fine, I will help you out, but do not go telling others that I am getting soft. Here is 200 gold. You have disappointed me though.</string>
<string name="175">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Ha! Good one, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Give you gold to rescue that lout.</string>
<string name="176">That is like saying, &quot;Your competition&apos;s store is on fire. Give me gold and I will put the fire out.&quot; Ha! What a sense of humor you have.</string>
<string name="177">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, he is not worth much, but I guess I can pay you 200 gold. I would have thought a man of adventure would already have rescued him.</string>
<string name="178">I guess your value as a person is only worth as much as your purse. Now go rescue the fool and stop wasting my time.</string>
<string name="179">Well, good luck with that. I hope everything goes well. I do not wish him dead, but lightly wounded I am fine with.</string>
<string name="180">Ah, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I should have treated him better. His father, Tyrosh, was an orc who worked for the Zhents. </string>
<string name="181">My mother was a slave that got pregnant when she was given as a reward to Tyrosh. He was killed shortly after impregnating her, and then Glendir was born.</string>
<string name="182">I was born a few years later, from a human father, but I never knew him any better than Glendir knew Tyrosh. I do not know why I resented Glendir so much, but we never did get along very well.</string>
<string name="183">Ah well, just another poor choice to haunt my dreams. Was there anything else you needed?</string>
<string name="184">Well, since you failed to be any kind of success at all, I guess you will be giving my gold back now, right?</string>
<string name="185">Bah, you can take your justifications to a higher court. I once thought we were friends.</string>
<string name="186">Bah, of course you did! I do not even know why I bothered to ask you. I once thought we were friends. </string>
<string name="187">Well, you can buy and sell your equipment someplace else. I will have nothing more to do with you!</string>
<string name="188">Hades take you, &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="189">You do not stand a chance against me, &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="190">Ha, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you never fail to amuse me! Keep the gold, you will have more use of it than I would. Just do not go telling anyone about this. I should have done more to help.</string>
<string name="191">Of course, for you, anything.</string>
<string name="192">Have you rescued that no-excuse, lout of a brother of mine yet?</string>
<string name="193">Then you had better get working on it. I paid you good gold, and I have no patience for laziness.</string>
<string name="194">Get out of my shop, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are no longer welcome here.</string>
<string name="195">So my half-brother is back. I am not sure whether I should thank you or slap you upside the head.</string>
<string name="196">With his house burned down, he&apos;ll be staying with me, until he gets back on his feet. Do you have any idea how much he can eat? And he gets drunk and spills wine on my rug!</string>
<string name="197">Ah, I guess I cannot blame you. I just hope he finds a job soon. Did you want anything today?</string>
<string name="198">What are you talking about? Let me see that. What... who... argh, that stupid brother of mine! You should have just left him for dead, rather than pay so much.</string>
<string name="199">I do not have that kind of gold, nor am I likely to see that much gold anytime soon. I fear you have been taken in, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You will have to hunt for recompense elsewhere.</string>
<string name="200">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="201">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ha! I have mentioned how much I love your sense of humor, have I not? </string>
<string name="202">Ah, I guess I should not leave all of the onus on you. It&apos;s not your fault my brother is a good-for-nothing wastrel.</string>
<string name="203">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah, I understand why you would be feeling that way, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but you took a risk and I am afraid you cannot fault me for your losses.</string>
<string name="204">Just chalk it up to experience and use your mind a little more next time. A half-orc just is not worth 2000 gold.</string>
<string name="205">Actually, I would have to agree with Fiona here, I would never pay so much for Xanos. I might pay that much to see him locked in a cell... hmm.</string>
<string name="206">I take exception to that! I am worth far more than a mere 2000 gold!</string>
<string name="207">Ah, well, of course I did not mean you Xanos, but you are an extraordinary half-orc; a cut above all the rest.</string>
<string name="208">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah, I guess I should not leave all of the onus on you. It&apos;s not your fault my brother is a good-for-nothing wastrel.</string>
<string name="209">Take these boots. They have magical properties that should help you out. That is all I can give you though. I have to get back to work now. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="210">Good for you! I want you to tip the velvet, but something tells me I am out of luck.</string>
<string name="211">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="212">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Blushes]&lt;/Start&gt; Uh... never mind. All I am saying is that my brother&apos;s rescue is already costing me a lot. Why should I reward you?</string>
<string name="213">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I would be willing to take a donation from you towards supporting him, but a reward? Get out of here. You are starting to annoy me.</string>
<string name="214">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah, I suppose his life ought to be worth something. Here is 100 gold, but do not be telling others about this. I do not need a soft reputation around here.</string>
<string name="215">Now, was there anything else you needed?</string>
<string name="216">Ah, that is a bit of a painful story. His father, Tyrosh, was an orc who worked for the Zhents. My mother was a slave that got pregnant when she was given as a reward to Tyrosh. </string>
<string name="217">He was killed shortly after impregnating her, and then Glendir was born. I was born a few years later, from a human father, but I never knew him any better than Glendir knew Tyrosh.</string>
<string name="218"> I do not know why I resented Glendir so much, but we never did get along very well. But enough painful memories. Anything else you would like?</string>
<string name="219">My half-orc brother, Glendir, was captured by gnolls. I guess you didn&apos;t recognize him, but you set him free.</string>
<string name="220">Please, if you&apos;re waiting for the helm, you&apos;ll have to come back later, after I have finished crafting it.  Now is there something else?</string>
<string name="221">Ahhh, &lt;FirstName&gt;.  I see you are back for your helm, but you don&apos;t seem to have enough to pay for it right now.  No matter, I&apos;ll hold it for you until you are able to pay.  Is there something else I can do for you in the meantime?</string>
<string name="222">Ahhh, here is your helm, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It took all of my powers of craftsmanship and hours of skill, but the effort was worth it, at least, I hope you will think so.</string>
<string name="223">Neither, thanks. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="224">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="225">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Have you heard about the new kobold defense tax?</string>
<string name="226">Did you have problems with the kobolds?</string>
<string name="227">That is all my questions.</string>
<string name="228">No, thanks. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="229">Would you tell me about yourself?</string>
<string name="230">Please stop fooling around. I was trying to be serious.</string>
<string name="231">Yes, you are about the most annoying person I have ever met.</string>
<string name="232">No. I think you are pretty normal.</string>
<string name="233">What I meant to say, is you are fat, ugly and completely out of your mind. </string>
<string name="234">Fine, then I&apos;ll just see your inventory and then I&apos;ll go. </string>
<string name="235">Is this another joke?</string>
<string name="236">I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="237">Yes, but I like you all the same.</string>
<string name="238">Fine, I didn&apos;t really want to hear it anyways. </string>
<string name="239">I will respect your privacy.</string>
<string name="240">Why? </string>
<string name="241">What was so bad for you?</string>
<string name="242">Piper said he sold you his sword.</string>
<string name="243">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; That is not the story he tells. He says you stole it from him!</string>
<string name="244">I want to buy it. </string>
<string name="245">Could I have it?</string>
<string name="246">I found these magical antlers. Do you know anything about them?</string>
<string name="247">Neither, goodbye. </string>
<string name="248">I will sell them to you.</string>
<string name="249">Maybe I would like the helm, after all. </string>
<string name="250">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; For such powerful items, you could certainly spare more than that.</string>
<string name="251">Never mind. </string>
<string name="252">No, I want the helm. </string>
<string name="253">I will take it.</string>
<string name="254">I will take it.</string>
<string name="255">I want the helm.</string>
<string name="256">I changed my mind. How much will you buy them for? </string>
<string name="257">That is too much.</string>
<string name="258">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Charm]&lt;/Start&gt; You would like to do this for much less.</string>
<string name="259">Never mind, goodbye. </string>
<string name="260">Here is the gold.</string>
<string name="261">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; I think allowing you to live should give me a nice discount.</string>
<string name="262">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Couldn&apos;t you help an old friend out? I have always felt so close to you.</string>
<string name="263">I will pay.</string>
<string name="264">I would like to see your goods.</string>
<string name="265">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="266">I met a half-orc named Glendir, who claims to be your brother.</string>
<string name="267">He&apos;s doing well; if you count being a prisoner of hungry gnolls as a good thing. </string>
<string name="268">I imagine he will be dead soon.</string>
<string name="269">He is being held by a group of gnolls. </string>
<string name="270">I imagine the gnolls will devour him soon. </string>
<string name="271">He is a prisoner of a group of gnolls.</string>
<string name="272">I am not going to save him.</string>
<string name="273">I will only rescue him if I am getting paid.</string>
<string name="274">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Your brother&apos;s life must be worth something to you?</string>
<string name="275">I am working on it.</string>
<string name="276">I have news for you. Your brother, Glendir, is dead.</string>
<string name="277">Not a chance! You gambled and you lost.</string>
<string name="278">No, I already spent it.</string>
<string name="279">Fine, goodbye.</string>
<string name="280">Then you are of no more use to me. I think I will enjoy killing you.</string>
<string name="281">Of course. I am sorry, Fiona.</string>
<string name="282">I would like to see your goods.</string>
<string name="283">Not yet.</string>
<string name="284">I have this promissory note.</string>
<string name="285">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="286">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ll be getting something from you, if you know what is good for you!</string>
<string name="287">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You could give me some equipment instead of the gold.</string>
<string name="288">I want a reward.</string>
<string name="289">Fine. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="290">What does that mean?</string>
<string name="291">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I deserve something for my efforts.</string>
<string name="292">How is Glendir, a half-orc, your brother?</string>
<string name="293">What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="294">Greetings once again, my friend. Is there something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="295">I greet you, friend. Come and warm yourself by my fire. It is a cold &lt;day/night&gt; and the road, as you can see, is more dangerous than usual.</string>
<string name="296">Then I bid you farewell, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, and wish you the best of luck.</string>
<string name="297">I would gladly break bread with you, but I am short on supplies at the moment. Still, I&apos;m gladder for the company.</string>
<string name="298">It has been a long and tedious winter&apos;s &lt;day/night&gt; for me.</string>
<string name="299">Now... what brings a &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt; such as yourself to these parts? You are from the village of Hilltop, I take it?</string>
<string name="300">Of course. It was not my intention to pry. What would you like to ask?</string>
<string name="301">Very well. It was good to meet you, friend... another time, perhaps.</string>
<string name="302">I am hunting, if you must know. My quarry here is the elusive Shadow Hart.</string>
<string name="303">My name is Ferran Valiantheart, ranger and arcane archer of the High Forest wood elves, at your service.</string>
<string name="304">Indeed. I am one of a select few who have dedicated ourselves to the mastery of the bow... combining magic and archery into one discipline.</string>
<string name="305">It is a path that is closed to your kind, I am afraid, though I mean no disrespect to the bowmanship skills of your race.</string>
<string name="306">You are of elven blood... while this might not be your path, currently, perhaps it is something you might consider in the future.</string>
<string name="307">You are of elven blood yourself. I have the sense that perhaps this might be a path you might follow one day, as well.</string>
<string name="308">I was nearby and happened to see a group of kobolds fleeing from the direction of Hilltop. As you can see, they met with an ambush.</string>
<string name="309">A group of gnolls leapt out from the forest, taking the kobolds by surprise. They exchanged words, but I could not hear clearly... I believe the gnolls were demanding something.</string>
<string name="310">Regardless, it was obvious that the kobolds were not about to comply. They fought, but the gnolls had the obvious advantage.</string>
<string name="311">Some of the kobolds ran towards the elven crypt, I believe, while a larger group fled north towards the mountains.</string>
<string name="312">Of course. What do you wish to ask?</string>
<string name="313">It... is the burial place for the elven warriors of Ascalhorn from long ago. It is a shameful tale of our people, and therefore the crypt lies forgotten.</string>
<string name="314">If the kobolds did, indeed, enter within, they will not last long. Better that they had remained without and died at the hands of the gnolls.</string>
<string name="315">I am surprised that the haunting voices that echo through the crypt did not drive them out immediately.</string>
<string name="316">Hmm. As a matter of fact, I believe I saw a single kobold come out of the elven crypt not long ago. He seemed skittish and frightened... perhaps a messenger or lone survivor.</string>
<string name="317">He headed east, strangely. I would have thought he would go north towards the mountains... east lies the human village of Blumberg. Why would he go there?</string>
<string name="318">Perhaps he was confused, I cannot say. If the kobold showed his face in the human village, however, I doubt that he still lives.</string>
<string name="319">They looted what corpses remained, of course, and took a group of surviving kobolds prisoner and headed east.</string>
<string name="320">I am unsure. Perhaps they turned south and entered the High Forest. I am told that there are several gnoll caves there.</string>
<string name="321">Why would I? Kobolds and gnolls are both evil creatures... let them slaughter each other, if that is their desire. It is too bad they did not wipe each other out.</string>
<string name="322">At any rate, hunting these creatures is not why I am here. I just happened to witness the event, that is all.</string>
<string name="323">There is not much to tell. These are the foothills of the Nether Mountains, and the road you are on leads eastward to the human village of Blumberg.</string>
<string name="324">To the south of here lies the edge of the High Forest. A dangerous place to travel, if you are unfamiliar with it.</string>
<string name="325">There are trails that lead higher into the mountains up north. The Nether Mountains are home to kobolds and orcs... best beware.</string>
<string name="326">Truly? Then you are more than you seem. Those tracks belong to the elusive Shadow Hart... my quarry and the reason I am hunting in these foothills.</string>
<string name="327">Indeed. It is a rare and wonderful beast, white as the snow all around us and possessing the unique ability to vanish into the winds.</string>
<string name="328">I am loathe to kill such a magnificent beast, but I simply must have its horns. They are part of the only cure for an illness my wife has contracted, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="329">I thank you. I rather think it will be a long hunt, yet.</string>
<string name="330">I need no help, thank you, but on the off-chance you might find and take down the beast on your own I would gladly reward you for the horns.</string>
<string name="331">The Hart is a unique and lovely creature, it is true... but so is my wife, friend. Killing the Hart is a tragedy, but my wife is worth more to me than my own life. </string>
<string name="332">I do not expect you to understand. This is something I must do. I must get the horns of the Shadow Hart or perish in the attempt.</string>
<string name="333">He does not vanish entirely. Indeed, if you have ever seen a blink dog, the Shadow Hart moves very similarly... it teleports short distances away in order to flee.</string>
<string name="334">This does not make it impossible to hunt, but it does make it very difficult. Still... I have no choice. I must have those horns or perish in the attempt.</string>
<string name="335">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I... no, I am sorry, but I cannot. It is a shameful tale. Perhaps another time, friend.</string>
<string name="336">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... suppose it would be of no harm to tell you a little of the tale, even though you are not of elven blood yourself.</string>
<string name="337">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Very well... I will tell you a little of the tale, though only because you are of elven blood yourself.</string>
<string name="338">That crypt belongs to the warriors of Ascalhorn, the capital and crown jewel of the ancient elven nation of Earlan.</string>
<string name="339">No doubt you have never heard of such a place. It fell into ruin long ago, you see, when its rulers became jealous of the power of man.</string>
<string name="340">They sought out dark arts to give them power... and in so doing destroyed themselves. This crypt... this is the last that remains of their honored dead.</string>
<string name="341">Not for those who do not enter to violate its buried or steal its treasures. Few of us enter to pay respects any more... it is a past we would rather forget.</string>
<string name="342">This crypt was built by my own people, you see, to honor those warriors of Ascalhorn who turned to fight against the evil of its rulers.</string>
<string name="343">They were traitors to their own land, but did what needed to be done. It is the last of Ascalhorn that stands. A bitter tale, to be true.</string>
<string name="344">Ah, but I would speak no more of it. Enter the crypt for yourself, if you wish to pay your respects. But be wary.</string>
<string name="345">We hated what Ascalhorn&apos;s pride had turned it into. It is a past we would rather forget.</string>
<string name="346">No, not this place. The lords of Ascalhorn did not build this crypt, you see.</string>
<string name="347">Perhaps. It is a past that we would rather forget, however, if not the lesson it taught us.</string>
<string name="348">Those... those are the horns, indeed! However did you... no, I daren&apos;t ask. This is a most fortunate day! My wife shall be cured! May I have them, friend?</string>
<string name="349">But... but I must have them! I have been hunting this creature for over a year! The life of my beloved hangs in the balance... please do not deny me this!</string>
<string name="350">Then... then you have forced my hand. I... I am sorry.</string>
<string name="351">Oh thank you, thank you! I will never forget you for this!</string>
<string name="352">I must be off. I pray I am not too late to save her... thank you for this!!</string>
<string name="353">I... I am not sure I have anything of value to offer you... other than my bow. It is a magical bow, handed down in my bloodline... will you take it in exchange?</string>
<string name="354">I... I have nothing else! Please! The life of my beloved is at stake, here! Have you no heart?!</string>
<string name="355">Such... such greed! You will never give it to me, will you?! Then you have forced my hand!!</string>
<string name="356">Then take it. The life of my beloved is worth more than any heirloom.</string>
<string name="357">Ah. I was not attempting to pry, of course. Is there something I can help you with, friend?</string>
<string name="358">Ah, I see. In that case you have both good and bad luck. The kobolds passed by on this very road. As you can see, however, they met an ambush.</string>
<string name="359">I was nearby and watched the entire event as it occurred. I can tell you what I saw, if you wish.</string>
<string name="360">What?! You would rob a fellow traveler on the road?! I&apos;ve no valuables to interest your greed, rogue, so begone!</string>
<string name="361">Sometimes I wonder why I leave the High Forest at all, if this is the manner of &quot;civilized&quot; behavior I encounter. I hope you meet justice, cretin, and soon!</string>
<string name="362">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; I will not cower before the face of such vileness! Corellon guide my fury!!</string>
<string name="363">We shall see, vile cretin!</string>
<string name="364">How disappointing. A &lt;brother/sister&gt; of my own blood, lowered to the level of a common thief! I&apos;ve no valuables to interest your greed, so begone!</string>
<string name="365">I greet you, &lt;brother/sister&gt; of the woods. It lightens my heart to see another of our blood outside of the High Forest.</string>
<string name="366">Come and warm yourself by my fire, if you wish. It is a cold &lt;day/night&gt; and the road, as you can well see, is more dangerous than usual.</string>
<string name="367">Greetings, friend! I invite you to come up and share my campfire, if you&apos;ve the time. If not, then I suggest you be cautious... creatures abound in this region today, I fear.</string>
<string name="368">You can hand over your belongings -- now!</string>
<string name="369">Never mind. I have more pressing business.</string>
<string name="370">I&apos;m not interested in your fire, but I have questions.</string>
<string name="371">Thank you. I appreciate the hospitality.</string>
<string name="372">I prefer to ask the questions here.</string>
<string name="373">I should go.</string>
<string name="374">Why are you here in the foothills?</string>
<string name="375">Who are you?</string>
<string name="376">Arcane archer?</string>
<string name="377">Tell me what happened here.</string>
<string name="378">I have some other questions.</string>
<string name="379">Tell me about this elven crypt.</string>
<string name="380">Did you see anything else?</string>
<string name="381">Did you see where that one went?</string>
<string name="382">What did the gnolls do after the battle?</string>
<string name="383">Where do you think they were going?</string>
<string name="384">You didn&apos;t intervene or chase after them?</string>
<string name="385">What can you tell me about this area?</string>
<string name="386">I noticed some unusual deer tracks nearby.  Do you know anything of them?</string>
<string name="387">Shadow Hart?</string>
<string name="388">Well, good luck on that.</string>
<string name="389">Perhaps I could help you find this creature.</string>
<string name="390">Doesn&apos;t it seem wrong to kill one thing to save another?</string>
<string name="391">How does one hunt a beast who disappears?</string>
<string name="392">Are these the horns you&apos;re looking for?</string>
<string name="393">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Would you tell me the story behind the elven crypt?</string>
<string name="394">Is it very dangerous to enter?</string>
<string name="395">So the rest of the elves hated Ascalhorn?</string>
<string name="396">So it&apos;s a place of dark magic?</string>
<string name="397">Honored dead? Shouldn&apos;t the crypt be in better shape, then?</string>
<string name="398">I have the horns of the Shadow Hart.</string>
<string name="399">These were damn difficult to acquire. Forget it!</string>
<string name="400">I said no! I&apos;m keeping them.</string>
<string name="401">And what kind of reward are you offering?</string>
<string name="402">Alright, here. Take them and go.</string>
<string name="403">Certainly. Take them and return to your wife.</string>
<string name="404">That depends on the reward, really.</string>
<string name="405">I can&apos;t take that from you. Here... take the horns.</string>
<string name="406">What do I need your bow for? Offer something else.</string>
<string name="407">A bow&apos;s a good start. What else do you have?</string>
<string name="408">Ahhh, I can&apos;t stand this anymore. Take the horns, and keep your stupid bow.</string>
<string name="409">Fine, fine. The bow will have to do.</string>
<string name="410">Nothing else, hey? I&apos;ll just hold onto this, then.</string>
<string name="411">I have the Hart&apos;s horns... and that&apos;s what counts.</string>
<string name="412">A magical bow? That will do.</string>
<string name="413">I am from Hilltop, yes, but my business is my own.</string>
<string name="414">I&apos;m looking for a group of kobolds that attacked Hilltop, actually.</string>
<string name="415">Yes, tell me what happened.</string>
<string name="416">More dangerous than you think. Hand over your belongings, now!</string>
<string name="417">Fine. Forget it, then.</string>
<string name="418">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; But elves make fine bows and arrows. Hand them over now!</string>
<string name="419">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; I could always search your corpse and see for myself...</string>
<string name="420">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, you&apos;ll pay dearly for that mouth of yours!</string>
<string name="421">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Growl...]&lt;/Start&gt; </string>
<string name="422">The bear eyes you with an unfriendly disposition. It seems to have great discomfort as it shuffles forward.</string>
<string name="423">The bear&apos;s eyes open wide and it lets out a little whine, before you silence it forever.</string>
<string name="424">After a quick inspection you notice that the bear seems to have an arrow embedded in its chest.</string>
<string name="425">The bear gives a morose growl of pain as you walk away.</string>
<string name="426">Just as you finish cleansing the wound, the bear licks your face with its long, rough tongue. It then shambles off into the trees contentedly.</string>
<string name="427">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Send your mind out to touch the bear&apos;s mind.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="428">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Coup-de-grace]&lt;/Start&gt; I will put you out of your misery, bear.  It&apos;s for the best.</string>
<string name="429">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Examine the bear]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="430">Do nothing.</string>
<string name="431">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Remove the arrow and cleanse the wound.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="432">&lt;StartAction&gt;[growl...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="433">The bear wishes it could have a safe place to live, good friends, and a nice, soft halfling to snack on.</string>
<string name="434">The bear wonders if you would make a tasty snack, then decides you are not worth the trouble.</string>
<string name="435">The bear remembers another humanoid creature carrying a smaller creature on its shoulder, into a cave.</string>
<string name="436">The bear seems to wish it could go back to sleep for the rest of winter, unsure why it woke up in the first place.</string>
<string name="437">The bear scratches at a burr in its fur, radiates a welcome to you, then relieves itself on a nearby log.</string>
<string name="438">The bear sniffs at you, wondering if you have any berries or honey, then loses interest in you.</string>
<string name="439">This bear radiates positive thoughts to you, as if it recognizes you as a friend.</string>
<string name="440">The bear sniffs the air, then wanders off into the forest.</string>
<string name="441">The bear sends thoughts of some type of battle that the bear avoided. Large hairy creatures and small lizard like creatures fought on a nearby hill. The bear left before the battle ended.</string>
<string name="442">You see an image of yourself helping another bear with an arrow in its chest. The healed bear then sends thoughts to its kin, telling them to be kind to this friend of nature.</string>
<string name="443">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Send your mind out to touch the bear&apos;s mind.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="444">Goodbye bear.</string>
<string name="445">Have you seen any kobolds?</string>
<string name="446">Do I know you?</string>
<string name="447">links</string>
<string name="448">What - me think she be pretty enough for Rumgut right now!</string>
<string name="449">Ok - you iz on.</string>
<string name="450">Haha - me not called Rumgut for nothing, ya know...</string>
<string name="451">Oh - me no feel so good..</string>

<string name="463">Me all grown up and me be lonely and not like me own cookin&apos; so much. Me wife be real good cook. Me know someday she grow up too and then we be good couple.</string>
<string name="464">We will bash each other on heads and yell and make little ones, just like me mother and father done. Just thinkin&apos; of it make me so happy.</string>
<string name="465">Oh, she will grow up and be me size someday. There not be anyone else me size round here. She will grow, me sure.</string>
<string name="466">Oh, ha, ha, ha, me call meself that, cause me like drinkin&apos; rum so very much, it make me gut get big. When me go out huntin&apos; little goblins and stuff for food, me like to yell chants.</string>

<string name="474">Me squash you now like... little squashing thing.</string>
<string name="475">Maybe me make you into supper later. You get in cage.</string>

<string name="477">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Ha, ha, now you join me wife in cage. Maybe me make you into supper later.</string>
<string name="478">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; That be pretty good. Now we do another round.</string>
<string name="479">Lift rum high, to the sky, now drink it down, until we drown! &lt;StartAction&gt;[Drinks another bottle of rum.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="481">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt;Me impressed. Me also a little dizzy. One more time, me bet you no can do it!</string>
<string name="482">One, two... no, me do that one already. Drink you rum, worthy chum. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Drinks another bottle of rum.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="484">Why you want speak to me wife? She not very good talker. She mostly just cry and yell lots, just like Rumgut&apos;s mom.</string>
<string name="485">Me guess it be alright for you speak to her. Just treat her nice or Rumgut give you sharp slap to head!</string>
<string name="486">What? Something be wrong with me wife? What we be saving her from? See, she be all nice and safe in me cage.</string>
<string name="487">Wait! You be trying to trick me. You want take me wife away! You no should do that. It make me very angry!</string>
<string name="488">You dare threaten me? Me will crush you into ground like... like big crushing-into-ground thing!</string>
<string name="489">Oh yes, when she be my size I will hug her, and kiss her, and hold her, and I will never let her go. Now, you leavin&apos; soon or what?</string>
<string name="490">You watch who you call stupid. Me no like insults from little people like you. Only me wife call me stupid and get away with it!</string>
<string name="491">No, she just be small person, but she will grow. Someday she be like me mom, and be big too.</string>
<string name="492">That it! Me no have to take this from puny, &lt;race&gt; &lt;boy/girl&gt;! Me will crush you into ground like... like big crushing-into-ground thing!</string>
<string name="493">No, me was that small one time too. When me be young, but then me grow up.</string>
<string name="494">No, me be just big person, she be this big too, someday. You maybe not be this big someday, cause you likely die before you grow. You got big mouth and be kind of ugly.</string>
<string name="495">Uh... thanks, me think. Me gots a great big belly too. You like it?</string>
<string name="496">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Snort]&lt;/Start&gt; Ha, ha! Me likes you. You want anything?</string>
<string name="497">Prove it. Me no believe you.</string>
<string name="498">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No! You no can make me not love me wife. She be great cook. Now you get gone or me throw you in cage with me wife!</string>
<string name="499">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, me guess you be right. Me give you key, but then you leave with her fast, or maybe me change mind and decide to eat you and her.</string>
<string name="500">Me not even remember what we talkin&apos; about now. What you want?</string>
<string name="501">You be quiet in there. Me no want to hear you speak. Me just thinking &apos;bout what sauce go good with &lt;race&gt; meat.</string>
<string name="502">No! You stole me wife! Now Rumgut will bash you into squishy, much-bashed thing!</string>
<string name="503">Me gonna miss wife. Now me all alone again.</string>
<string name="504">Ummm..ok. Listen, I really think her dad wants her back - to make her all pretty for her wedding night, you know.  Kind of a family tradition.  How about you let her out and I&apos;ll take her back home, get her fixed up and bring her right back.</string>
<string name="505">Well - let me go have a look at her and I&apos;ll tell you if she&apos;s pretty enough for a man..I mean a giant, like yourself.</string>
<string name="506">I tell you what - If I beat you in a drinking contest - then you let me take her.</string>
<string name="507">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Glug Glug.</string>
<string name="508">I will leave now.</string>
<string name="509">You have a wife?</string>
<string name="510">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You have a really beautiful voice. I was drawn here by it.</string>
<string name="511">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="512">That&apos;s all my questions.</string>
<string name="513">Have you had troubles with kobolds?</string>
<string name="514">Why do you want a wife?</string>
<string name="515">Why don&apos;t you find someone more your size?</string>
<string name="516">Why are you called Rumgut?</string>
<string name="517">I like to drink too. Why, I bet I can drink more than you!</string>
<string name="518">I changed my mind. I do not think I can out drink you.</string>
<string name="519">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Pretend to drink, but spill most on ground.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="520">Time to die, Rumgut!</string>
<string name="521">I guess you can lock me up.</string>
<string name="522">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Drink the flask of rum.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="523">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Pretend to drink, but spill most on ground.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="524">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Drink the flask of rum.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="525">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Pretend to drink, but spill most on ground.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="526">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Drink the flask of rum.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="527">Could I speak to your wife?</string>
<string name="528">I am here to save Becka.</string>
<string name="529">Let her go, or I will have to kill you.</string>
<string name="530">Sounds like you will be a great couple.</string>
<string name="531">Listen stupid. She is a dwarf, which means she will never get bigger. </string>
<string name="532">But she is a dwarf. </string>
<string name="533">You are a giant, idiot! </string>
<string name="534">You are an idiot, giant!</string>
<string name="535">No, that is as big as she gets.</string>
<string name="536">But you are a giant, she&apos;s not!</string>
<string name="537">For someone so big, you sure have a small brain.</string>
<string name="538">It would look better if I sliced it open. </string>
<string name="539">No, it makes you look as stupid as you really are. </string>
<string name="540">Uh... sure. </string>
<string name="541">It is very impressive.</string>
<string name="542">I am fully grown.</string>
<string name="543">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You have to trust me. She will never be a proper wife.</string>
<string name="544">Oh, forget it!</string>
<string name="545">&lt;StartAction&gt;[The wolf looks at you with a lopsided grin.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="546">The wolf wonders if the giant in the cave will throw out some more kobold parts to chew on.</string>
<string name="547">The wolf scratches at a flea bite, wondering if swimming in the river would be worth the effort to get rid of the pest. </string>
<string name="548">The wolf appears bored and wonders when you are going to go hunting together.</string>
<string name="549">The wolf looks you over to decide if you would make a good mate, arriving at the decision that you would not produce good offspring together.</string>
<string name="550">The wolf complains about a stag he was hunting that kept disappearing into thin air.</string>
<string name="551">The wolf wonders how you can stand to move about on two legs, since you are obviously much slower.</string>
<string name="552">Hello, wolf.</string>
<string name="553">Me want god to save me. Me will worship him.</string>
<string name="554">I do not know what to believe. He was right about some things.</string>
<string name="555">The prophet sees all. The prophet knows all.</string>
<string name="556">All praise to the prophet of the new god!</string>
<string name="557">Praise be to the prophet of the new god. All bow before his wisdom!</string>
<string name="558">I cannot believe these people are falling for such obvious lies.</string>
<string name="559">Ah, my back hurts from all the bending and healing I have done this day. Not that I would complain. Servants of Ilmater never complain. It is part of the canon. </string>
<string name="560">Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;. How may this servant of Ilmater assist you?</string>
<string name="561">Yes, may Ilmater look favorably upon you.</string>
<string name="562">&lt;FirstName&gt;, I am tired. I am so exhausted I can hardly keep my eyes open. I have drained most of my spells and most of my energy in a few short hours.</string>
<string name="563">I can try to answer some questions for you, but make them quick, please.</string>
<string name="564">Right. So anything else?</string>
<string name="565">The god of endurance, suffering and perseverance, Ilmater cares for those whom nobody else will. We follow the path of poverty, collecting alms for those in need and keeping little for ourselves.</string>
<string name="566">To help the poor and ill, we charge adventurers a fee for healing. Some do not appreciate the need, but ours is not a rich church. Our temples are modest and often in poor repair.</string>
<string name="567">I do not even have a temple, but instead have this small shrine here in the community hall. Perhaps someday Hilltop will be large enough to support a small temple.</string>
<string name="568">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You always were a greedy soul, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I work in the same hall as the mayor. Believe me, if he decided to tax the only healer in town, he would lose his job the same day.</string>
<string name="569">You should probably go see if there are any lost kobolds you can terrorize into giving you gold. At least then you might be serving a purpose.</string>
<string name="570">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; That foolish old goat! He starts drinking again and this is what happens! </string>
<string name="571">Fine I will pay ten gold to this tax, but next election, you had better believe there will be a new Mayor!</string>
<string name="572">Would you really? That would certainly be a wonderful thing to do. How much would you like to donate?</string>
<string name="573">Oh, well... I suppose I should have expected as much. Anything else?</string>
<string name="574">Another donation, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I cannot believe this! Surely you are a rare &lt;man/woman&gt;. With this the community will be improved in so many ways. Thank you. Can I help you with anything else?</string>
<string name="575">&lt;FirstName&gt;! I cannot believe this! Surely you are a rare &lt;man/woman&gt;. With this the community will be improved in so many ways. Thank you. Can I help you with anything else?</string>
<string name="576">Another donation? That is wonderful, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am glad you feel the desire to do good for others. It seems to be a rare desire these days. Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="577">That is wonderful, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am glad you feel the desire to do good for others. It seems to be a rare desire these days. Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="578">Oh, um... thanks. I guess I can buy a meal for a poor family. Maybe even two, if they only eat half rations. Anything else?</string>
<string name="579">I do not mean to. I am not even supposed to, but it is very hard somedays. There is never enough gold to do all the work I am supposed to do.</string>
<string name="580">Maybe I need to escape this life, but I doubt it would be any easier elsewhere. Ah, well, I am getting old and maybe someday soon I will retire.</string>
<string name="581">Look, occasionally in a small village like this, you will have a small disaster. But, most of the time, it is just small things.</string>
<string name="582">So when a major catastrophe like this happens, and I have to use a large number of spells in a short time period, I find myself tiring easily.</string>
<string name="583">That&apos;s all there is to it. I imagine I&apos;ll be feeling better in a week or two, if I ever get any rest.</string>
<string name="584">Away, thank Ilmater! That is all I know, and all I care to know. People of all races were born to suffer. It is my job to try to ease such suffering.</string>
<string name="585">But that does not mean I have to enjoy watching them suffer! I am so sick of it, I cannot even begin to tell you. I have no energy left, so if the kobolds come again... well, it would be bad.</string>
<string name="586">Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="587">Of course, but in order to assist the others of this town, the poor, and those who cannot defend themselves, I will have to ask for a small donation of 20 gold.</string>
<string name="588">Well, it is your life. Anything else?</string>
<string name="589">I guess that depends on how much you value your life. 20 gold is quite cheap, if you look at it as an investment. You are investing in your community, in the church and in your immortal soul.</string>
<string name="590">Viewed from that perspective, I would argue that it is pretty cheap. Perhaps I should even be asking more.</string>
<string name="591">Sorry. If you manage to come up with enough, I would certainly be willing to help you. Anything else?</string>
<string name="592">Very well then.</string>
<string name="593">Anything else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="594">Back again, &lt;FirstName&gt;? How can I help you this time?</string>
<string name="595">Stay away from me, you butcher! Your corrupt soul has revealed its evil nature today!</string>
<string name="596">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="597">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="598">Never mind.</string>
<string name="599">Tell me about Ilmater.</string>
<string name="600">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; So the new Kobold Defense Tax is going to hurt you then.</string>
<string name="601">Could I make a donation?</string>
<string name="602">Never mind.</string>
<string name="603">100 gold.</string>
<string name="604">10 gold.</string>
<string name="605">1 gold.</string>
<string name="606">You sure complain a great deal.</string>
<string name="607">Why are you so drained?</string>
<string name="608">Do you know where the kobolds went?</string>
<string name="609">That&apos;s all my questions.</string>
<string name="610">I need healing.</string>
<string name="611">Never mind.</string>
<string name="612">A small fee? 20 gold is no small fee!</string>
<string name="613">I don&apos;t have that much.</string>
<string name="614">Alright, I will pay.</string>
<string name="615">Could I see what items you have for sale?</string>
<string name="616">Link</string>
<string name="617">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No chance. I&apos;ve seen what the gods have in store for us all.</string>
<string name="618">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe you&apos;re right. I&apos;ll start by defending my wine barrel. I&apos;ll be right back.</string>
<string name="619">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Wh..what.. Maybe you&apos;re right. I need to go home and sleep..</string>
<string name="620">And in the eighth hour of the third night, death came in the dark and left a swath of unbelievers to rot on the ground! It was a message! A portent of the new god who comes to the land!</string>
<string name="621">For the unbelievers, he will come as a dark giant with fiery eyes and unending thirst for blood; but for those who believe, he shall be the gentle cowherd, who protects his followers.</string>
<string name="622">I don&apos;t want to die! I shall follow this new god. What is his name?</string>
<string name="623">That has not been revealed to me yet. But follow me and do as I say, and the god who arises shall look on you favorably.</string>
<string name="624">What lies you spread! I will listen to no more of your foolishness, Piper.</string>
<string name="625">Then damnation be upon your head, fool woman! You will be dead within the week. This much has the new god shown me.</string>
<string name="626">Even you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, shall have to choose! Will you doom yourself and die like farmer Hol, or will you repent of your ways and follow me?</string>
<string name="627">You walk on the dark path, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I foresee your death. It is imminent. Seek the new god, if you would avoid the inevitable!</string>
<string name="628">He comes to purge the wicked! To follow him, give up this worldly life, with all of the trappings of success and give everything to him!</string>
<string name="629">What? Give up everything I have worked so hard to gain? You really are insane! I am going to speak to the mayor about this.</string>
<string name="630">But what about old Hol Halstrom? He called Piper a fool and now he&apos;s dead!</string>
<string name="631">Yeah. Me no want to be dead. Me will follow new god. Me got nothing to give up anyway.</string>
<string name="632">Only a few shall believe and only a few shall be saved! The rest of you will die in the darkness! Soon he comes! Soon he comes!</string>
<string name="633">No! Do not be tricked, my followers, by this unbeliever and &lt;his/her&gt; lies. I am the prophet of the new god!</string>
<string name="634">All praise and worship to the new god and his prophet!</string>
<string name="635">Yes, my faithful cattle! You shall be protected by the new god, for he is the cowherd who drives off the wolf!</string>
<string name="636">There will be panic and pain aplenty when the new god destroys the unbelievers! Verily, they shall all pay with their blood and souls.</string>
<string name="637">It is your words that are blasphemous and you shall pay with darkness and destruction. I foresee your death!</string>
<string name="638">No, the new god protected me from the kobolds! Not one came near my precious shack! All praise to the new god!</string>
<string name="639">I was chosen to save this village from eternal damnation. If they continue down the path into darkness, all will be lost.</string>
<string name="640">If we do not repent, then we shall be struck by a plague, just as Neverwinter has been. They too will heed the warnings of the new god, or be destroyed.</string>
<string name="641">Never before have the people been in such danger. I am the prophet who comes before. When the new god rises, I shall lead the people to him, and we shall all fall down in worship and praise.</string>
<string name="642">There is nothing that godless old fool could have to say to me that my followers cannot also hear. Go on then and make your threats! </string>
<string name="643">Do not forget the fate of those who mock me! Forget not the death of Hol Halstrom!</string>
<string name="644">Push me, shove me, kick me, beat me; I shall rise again, stronger than ever, to proclaim the coming of the new god. Try to drive the truth from this village, at peril of your own soul!</string>
<string name="645">You walk the path of darkness! Someday soon death will come for you.</string>
<string name="646">I told you, the new god will preserve me from harm! There is nothing you can do to me!</string>
<string name="647">It is you who shall die! I smite you in the name of the new god, whatever his name will be!</string>
<string name="648">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You think you can be rid of me that easily? The prophet of the new god sees through your tricks. Be gone foul tempter!</string>
<string name="649">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You may be right. The others of this town will not turn from their dark paths. But where would I go? Who needs to know of the coming god?</string>
<string name="650">Waterdeep? Millions of souls needing to be saved! Yes, that would be a task worthy of the prophet of the new god!</string>
<string name="651">Neverwinter? Yes, I had heard they are troubled by a plague. Surely that is the work of the new god, to weed out the evil in that city.</string>
<string name="652">But that is fairly far away, and I will need provisions for such a trip, and how will I live when I get there? No, it is too difficult. I will stay here.</string>
<string name="653">That is fairly close, but I will need provisions for such a trip, and how will I live when I get there? No, it is too difficult. I will stay here.</string>
<string name="654">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Such fair dealing from you, perhaps you really are a believer. I must make haste. Others need me!</string>
<string name="655">Such fair dealing from you, perhaps you really are a believer. I must make haste. Others need me!</string>
<string name="656">I have explained how the kobolds have come as a warning to the fools on the path of darkness. You are the one who is confused!</string>
<string name="657">Nay! The new god directed that weapon and struck down the one who despised his prophet! It was a deliberate act!</string>
<string name="658">I was the one who found Hol&apos;s corpse. The neck was nearly severed and there were many wounds on his body! The new god must have hated him!</string>
<string name="659">And that shall be the most certain outcome of those who flaunt their disbelief in the new god! Repent or be destroyed!</string>
<string name="660">Even the truth seems like nonsense to those who have not the wisdom to see what should be plainly evident!</string>
<string name="661">It is a testament of his anger! All who deny him shall face his wrath! </string>
<string name="662">The strong, stubborn farmer, slaughtered by an old wisp like me? I don&apos;t think so. Besides I have no weapon to kill him with! The kobolds merely followed the new god&apos;s orders!</string>
<string name="663">All of the new god&apos;s enemies shall perish at his coming. Only the wisest and most fortunate will be brought into his kingdom, which shall last for all eternity!</string>
<string name="664">There are no words that can stop the truth that the new god is coming. Repent and follow me!</string>
<string name="665">No. Only Hol. He was the target of the new god&apos;s vengeance!</string>
<string name="666">All of the new god&apos;s enemies shall perish at his coming. Only the wisest and most fortunate will be brought into his kingdom, which shall last for all eternity!</string>
<string name="667">I didn&apos;t kill him! It wasn&apos;t me, I swear! I only found his corpse and messed it up a bit! I promise! </string>
<string name="668">No, I never did! It wasn&apos;t me, I swear! I only found his corpse and messed it up a bit! I promise!</string>
<string name="669">You defiled Hol&apos;s corpse? He was my friend! I can&apos;t believe this.</string>
<string name="670">You disgust me! I think I had better go apologize to Hol&apos;s widow and see how she is doing.</string>
<string name="671">We all should do that. Piper, you are filth. No one will ever believe your lies again.</string>
<string name="672">Gone! No! They will hurt me. Yes, they will hurt me. I must leave. Run, run, run! Blast you, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I shall not forgive you for this!</string>
<string name="673">Before now, I felt the stirrings of prophecy, but never understood what it was I felt. Now my mind has been opened to the wisdom of the new god.</string>
<string name="674">The god speaks to him! He is the new god&apos;s holy man!</string>
<string name="675">Yes, the god speaks to me, and you must all listen to his wisdom as it pours forth onto you, like a fountain washing you clean! This village needs me!</string>
<string name="676">What would you know of the right way or the wrong way to help this village? You and your fellow students live a life of luxury up in your precious school.</string>
<string name="677">What... what could I possibly do to help this village when all my life I have had nothing? You have been trained. You have weapons! All I have is my prophecies!</string>
<string name="678">And you... you would take them away from me? The new god... the new god will strike you and your unbelieving friends down!</string>
<string name="679">I... I do not know. If I had my old sword and the guards would train me, then I could become a guard too. But... to abandon the new god... but, if I could have my old sword...</string>
<string name="680">Yes, my shiny old sword which I pawned to the smith! I have missed my dear old sword. Then I could become a guard and save the village. Then people would respect me, like a real hero!</string>
<string name="681">But I don&apos;t have my sword! No, and until I have my sword, my weapon must be... the new god! Yes! The new god comes, with a shiny new sword!</string>
<string name="682">&lt;StartAction&gt;[He whispers.]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I could just talk to myself about him, if that would help.</string>
<string name="683">But you have to bring me my sword! Until then, I shall spread the news of the new god!</string>
<string name="684">The doubters always claim that miraculous events are mere luck. But we know better! The new god chose me as his voice and gave me a clear perception of the world.</string>
<string name="685">Speak no more to me! There is nothing you can say to convince me! Begone, young adventurer! Death shall find you soon enough!</string>
<string name="686">It shall avail you nothing! Try what you want, but there is no moving me!</string>
<string name="687">The new god rises more powerful than all the other gods! I see it now! You have cleared my clouded vision! The new god comes to sweep all the other gods away.</string>
<string name="688">The one true god! The one true god!</string>
<string name="689">Yes! Your words which were meant to hinder me have helped instead!</string>
<string name="690">Of course they were! When the god comes he will demand tribute. It is only fitting that he send his minions ahead to capture objects of power!</string>
<string name="691">The new god is coming in glory! We worship his mighty prophet who shines a light on the dark words of the unbeliever!</string>
<string name="692">You see! Your doubting words only serve to bolster my cause! You have strayed from the path of righteousness, turn, turn to the new god!</string>
<string name="693">There is nothing you can say that can drive the truth from our fair village. When the new god rises, you and all your fellow students will bow before him, or you will die!</string>
<string name="694">He comes I tell you! Fall on your knees and weep for forgiveness, before the darkness claims your immortal soul!</string>
<string name="695">I am sorry I followed the dark path! I have committed many indiscretions, and I have had impure thoughts!</string>
<string name="696">He sees the corruption in your body, but the innocence of your soul is made known by your confession! Grovel at my feet and the new god shall forgive you for your past!</string>
<string name="697">And the faithful shall be saved, but those who lack faith shall...</string>
<string name="698">Die?</string>
<string name="699">Yes! Those who lack faith shall die most horrible deaths.</string>
<string name="700">Oh! That is my beautiful sword! Now I can become a guard and help save the village. And the new god will be... oh, right... my promise.</string>
<string name="701">That&apos;s right, there is no new god. Don&apos;t worry... he will not be showing up in two weeks, five hours and twenty three minutes to kill everyone. Go about your business. Nothing to see here.</string>
<string name="702">But what about all the prophesies? Are you sure you made them up?</string>
<string name="703">Yes, yes, they are all made up. Bye, bye now. Run along.</string>
<string name="704">You lucky you got that sword or you be joining you fake god.</string>
<string name="705">Repent of your wickedness! Give yourself to the new god! Worship the prophet of the new god, and you shall be cleansed!</string>
<string name="706">link</string>
<string name="707">No really - take this sword and together we can help defend Hilltop from anything the gods send against us.</string>
<string name="708">Right. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="709">I could use a good laugh. Tell me about this &apos;god&apos;. </string>
<string name="710">Tell me more about this new god.</string>
<string name="711">Maybe I should collect the gold for the new god.</string>
<string name="712">You are going to cause more panic with such stories.</string>
<string name="713">You should not spread such blasphemy.</string>
<string name="714">Did one of the kobolds hit you in the head?</string>
<string name="715">What are you trying to do, old man?</string>
<string name="716">I need to speak to you in private, on behalf of the mayor.</string>
<string name="717">I want nothing more to do with you.</string>
<string name="718">You can leave Hilltop or the next god you see will be in hell!</string>
<string name="719">Leave or die.</string>
<string name="720">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think you have done all you can for Hilltop. Others need to be warned.</string>
<string name="721">So many people live in Waterdeep, surely some of them are worthy of saving.</string>
<string name="722">Neverwinter always has troubles. Perhaps they need your wisdom.</string>
<string name="723">Silverymoon is not so far away. I hear they believe almost anything there.</string>
<string name="724">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; The gods will provide for one as righteous as you.</string>
<string name="725">I will give you ten gold, which should help you on your way.</string>
<string name="726">I think you have been confused by the kobold attack.</string>
<string name="727">Hol died because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was coincidence.</string>
<string name="728">How can you people believe such nonsense?</string>
<string name="729">Why would a god of good defile a corpse in such a way?</string>
<string name="730">Maybe you killed him, Piper!</string>
<string name="731">You must stop this foolishness now.</string>
<string name="732">Did any of the other corpses have such wounds? </string>
<string name="733">That is strange. Did any of the other corpses have such wounds?</string>
<string name="734">You killed him, Piper, so I shall kill you!</string>
<string name="735">Tell us what truly happened, old man! </string>
<string name="736">You killed him, didn&apos;t you? </string>
<string name="737">Did you have anything to do with his death, Piper? </string>
<string name="738">You have made many predictions in the past that weren&apos;t true.</string>
<string name="739">What it needs is another corpse; maybe yours!</string>
<string name="740">There is need for you in this village, but you go about it all wrong.</string>
<string name="741">What if I helped you, so you could protect the town?</string>
<string name="742">If I get your sword back will you stop ranting about this new god?</string>
<string name="743">It was luck and that is all. You were bound to get one right eventually.</string>
<string name="744">Perhaps we should try something else?</string>
<string name="745">Don&apos;t you think the local priest would know if there was a new god?</string>
<string name="746">Maybe I can explain a different way. </string>
<string name="747">The kobolds were thieves, sent to steal artifacts from Drogan&apos;s school.</string>
<string name="748">Well, this is getting us nowhere.</string>
<string name="749">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="750">I have your sword.</string>
<string name="751">Where were Drogan and &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; his big heroes when the villagers were getting murdered? Sho much &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; for relying on them for help.</string>
<string name="752">Sir! You are talking to one right now!</string>
<string name="753">I don&apos;t know what &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; you&apos;re talking about Haniah. Thish is just my old friend Pat!</string>
<string name="754">I wish you would just go lie down and rest, sir.</string>
<string name="755">You know, I&apos;m the mayor here? Damn &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; damn right I am. And in a dinky, little village like thish, you would &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; think that would earn me shome reshpect.</string>
<string name="756">Everyone respects you, sir. Well, except when you are in this condition.</string>
<string name="757">Doesh anyone have a... &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; another bottle of wine? I &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; sheem to be right out.</string>
<string name="758">I think you have had enough, sir.</string>
<string name="759">There&apos;sh never enough. Not when you really &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; need it. Like when my wife died... never enough.</string>
<string name="760">Those damn kobolds think &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; that they can just march into my town and kill &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; my villagers off, do they? Well, jusht let them try that again!</string>
<string name="761">We would rather they just stayed away, sir.</string>
<string name="762">Too late, Haniah! Too &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; late. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sob]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="763">Would you stop swaying back and &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; forth! You&apos;re making me &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; dizzy.</string>
<string name="764">Sir, you are the one who is swaying.</string>
<string name="765">Don&apos;t be &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; ridiculoush. Why would I be shwaying?</string>
<string name="766">Because you are drunk, sir.</string>
<string name="767">Oh ya! I &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; forgot. Somebody fetch me more wine!</string>
<string name="768">There&apos;sh nobody who understands me &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt;, escept for Haniah &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt;. She&apos;sh sho helpful. Like a daughter to me. Yesh shir! &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="769">Thank you, sir. Maybe you should get a little rest?</string>
<string name="770">Nonshensh! My people need me!</string>
<string name="771">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sob]&lt;/Start&gt;... &lt;StartAction&gt;[sigh]&lt;/Start&gt;... I... uh... more wine pleashe...&lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt;.</string>
<string name="772">The wolf looks at you with intelligent eyes. The fact that it bares its teeth and growls slightly tells you it does not care for what it sees.</string>
<string name="773">The wolf pulls its ears back as you approach, obviously not caring for your presence.</string>
<string name="774">The wolf regards you with mild curiosity and does not shy away from you.</string>
<string name="775">This handsome wolf is Farghan&apos;s animal companion. She regards you with intelligent, wary eyes and sends an empathetic greeting.</string>
<string name="776">She acknowledges your departure and returns to her routine.</string>
<string name="777">She sends warm thoughts to you and returns her attention to her new mate.</string>
<string name="778">The wolf seems genuinely surprised that you know of this. She buried an item of her master&apos;s two moons ago to challenge the worth of the local canines.</string>
<string name="779">None of the male dogs have been able to find the item; however, and sadly she thinks they never will. None of them will make a worthy mate.</string>
<string name="780">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; She mulls over the decision for a moment before finally deciding that there is no harm in telling you... the local canines will never find it, anyway.</string>
<string name="781">The item is buried underneath a group of rocks that lay behind a human building that smells of iron and fire.</string>
<string name="782">The wolf is pleased by your manners. She bids you luck on your hunt.</string>
<string name="783">She relates that the item belonged to her master. It smelled strongly of nature and magic... but it was something her master no longer used.</string>
<string name="784">She knows little else about it, and is glad that her master did not miss it.</string>
<string name="785">The wolf relates to you that there is little information that she could offer that you would find useful. Her interests are a wolf&apos;s interests and not &lt;race&gt;.</string>
<string name="786">She tells you, for instance, that there are no worthy mates within the human village. Small canines with weak minds only. She finds this very sad.</string>
<string name="787">The wolf empathetically sends a polite refusal. When the time comes, she insists, her master will assist her.</string>
<string name="788">She says also that her attentions for the moment are wrapped up in her new mate. Apparently one of the local dogs was worthy enough after all.</string>
<string name="789">The wolf responds to your empathic communication with images from her mind. She explains that she fought and killed two of the kobold creatures at her master&apos;s side earlier.</string>
<string name="790">After the battle, however, her master brought her back inside and she was not able to give chase to the creatures. She does not know where they went, sadly.</string>
<string name="791">You fish into your pack for a few strips of dried meat. The wolf sniffs at them delicately but refuses to partake.</string>
<string name="792">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bid the wolf farewell.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="793">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask her about the secret she buried.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="794">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;Ask where she buried this item.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="795">&lt;StartAction&gt;Thank her for the information.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="796">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask her what item she buried.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="797">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask the wolf for any useful information it might have.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="798">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask her if you can help find her a mate.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="799">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask the wolf for information on the kobolds&apos; passing.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="800">&lt;StartAction&gt;Give the wolf a snack.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="801">Your powers have saved me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="802">Oh... uh... help me. I feel so weak...</string>
<string name="803">Thank god you&apos;ve come, &lt;FirstName&gt;.  Please...Tynan is upstairs and I saw a kobold go up there too.</string>
<string name="804">Aaarrrgghhh!</string>
<string name="805">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Gasp!]&lt;/Start&gt; Drogan had better never find out you have this vicious streak, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As a harper, he would have to stop you.</string>
<string name="806">I never would have thought you had it in you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I guess school is out.</string>
<string name="807">Ohh, the pain!</string>
<string name="808">Your powers have saved me...</string>
<string name="809">Ohhh, thank you, that&apos;s much better.</string>
<string name="810">&lt;StartAction&gt;[He drinks the potion.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="811">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, that feels much better.  We should hurry, if we are to save Tynan.</string>
<string name="812">Quickly... please!</string>
<string name="813">Hello &lt;FirstName&gt;. Is... is Tynan alive still? Did you... kill the kobold?</string>
<string name="814">&lt;StartAction&gt;[sob]&lt;/Start&gt; Poor Tynan, butchered before he even had a chance to live. And sweet Nora, how will she recover from this?</string>
<string name="815">I... I do not know how to tell her. I... I must go upstairs and wrap Tynan&apos;s little corpse. I do not want Nora to see him like this.</string>
<string name="816">I... cannot hold him. I am too... weak. Please... please take him out to Nora... and tell her... I... I loved her.</string>
<string name="817">Yes, I was collecting our valuables downstairs when I was attacked.  Here, take this.</string>
<string name="818">We need to hurry if we are to stand a chance.</string>
<string name="819">Thank you for rescuing my child. I will stay here and take care of him. Would you please go and tell my wife?</string>
<string name="820">But... but why would you do that? I can take care of Tynan.</string>
<string name="821">I cannot let you do that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have heard rumors that you have a dark nature, and I cannot let you take my child. Now give him back or I will have to kill you.</string>
<string name="822">Then die, foul fiend!</string>
<string name="823">Thank you. Now please go tell my wife her son and husband are safe.</string>
<string name="824">I would feel more comfortable if you just give my baby back. I do not want him taken outside right now. Not when there might be more kobolds on the loose.</string>
<string name="825">Thank you. You are a kind soul.</string>
<string name="826">Thank you for all that you have done for us, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am very grateful.</string>
<string name="827">Be quiet, I don&apos;t know if there are more kobolds around here. </string>
<string name="828">At least you are alive. </string>
<string name="829">Are you ok?</string>
<string name="830">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Coup de gras]&lt;/Start&gt; Widows are much easier to manipulate. See you in hell.</string>
<string name="831">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Heal]&lt;/Start&gt; Hold still; let me treat you with this healing kit.</string>
<string name="832">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lay on Hands]&lt;/Start&gt; Hold still; let me treat you.</string>
<string name="833">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Use a spell or ability to Cure Adam.]&lt;/Start&gt; Hold still, let me treat you.</string>
<string name="834">Take this healing potion; you look like you need it more than I.</string>
<string name="835">Yes, let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="836">I&apos;ll see what I can do...</string>
<string name="837">I am so terribly sorry.</string>
<string name="838">Here is your child...</string>
<string name="839">The kobold will release your child in exchange for a gem, do you have any?</string>
<string name="840">No, I think I will keep the child.</string>
<string name="841">I think I will keep him.</string>
<string name="842">No, he is mine now.</string>
<string name="843">Fine. Take your babe. He sure smells awful anyways.</string>
<string name="844">I want to take him to his mother.</string>
<string name="845">Alright, I will do that.</string>
<string name="846">The corpse of Adam Blake lies on the floor of his house.  He has been pierced repeatedly by kobold swords.</string>
<string name="847">A fair &lt;quarterday&gt; to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Is there something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="848">I wish both you and your Master Drogan the best of luck, then.</string>
<string name="849">Certainly. As you&apos;re a student of Drogan&apos;s, naturally I&apos;ll give you a good deal on any of my merchandise.</string>
<string name="850">Oh, I mostly sell herbs and others things that come from nature. Plus goods that are useful to druids like myself.</string>
<string name="851">You&apos;ve been here before, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I mostly sell herbs and things that come from nature. Plus other goods that would interest a druid like yourself.</string>
<string name="852">There were plenty just outside my door not long ago. I helped the guards to fight them until they were driven off, thankfully.</string>
<string name="853">Other than those, I only know of a group that ran down from the north. I understand they left Hilltop by the gate.</string>
<string name="854">Hopefully they don&apos;t come back. I&apos;ve never seen kobolds be so aggressive.</string>
<string name="855">What&apos;s this? Oh, my old ring, is it? Well, now, I thought Bethsheba had carried that off months ago and buried it somewhere.</string>
<string name="856">If she was impressed enough with you to tell you where it was, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you&apos;re welcome to keep it. Truly I don&apos;t need it anymore.</string>
<string name="857">Greetings to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Shame about your Master Drogan. Evil creatures those kobolds are. Is he at all better?</string>
<string name="858">Well, if there&apos;s anything I can do to help him, don&apos;t hesitate to ask.</string>
<string name="859">Ahhh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, is it? It&apos;s good to see you&apos;re unharmed. A nasty business with these kobolds. I hope that Master Drogan&apos;s well, also?</string>
<string name="860">That&apos;s a fine attitude to have, you being one of his students. I hope that is merely bravado and not a lack of appreciation for all Drogan has done for you.</string>
<string name="861">Is there something else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="862">Poisoned! By the gods, those kobolds are foul creatures, aren&apos;t they? Well, then... do you know what sorts of herbs you need exactly?</string>
<string name="863">Ah, good, good. Drogan has been a fine addition to this town ever since his arrival. I&apos;d hate to see anything happen to him.</string>
<string name="864">Well, that&apos;s good news at least. There&apos;s been so little as of late. Thank you for telling me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="865">That&apos;s terrible! If there&apos;s anything I can do to help him, don&apos;t hesitate to let me know. Terrible, evil little creatures those kobolds are!</string>
<string name="866">Of course I&apos;ll help if I can. What is it I can do?</string>
<string name="867">Well... if you&apos;re certain. Should that change, don&apos;t hesitate to ask.</string>
<string name="868">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, certainly I... hmmm. I&apos;ve heard the odd tale about you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I won&apos;t fall for your crafty tricks. Is there another way I can help?</string>
<string name="869">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh dear. Well certainly I&apos;ll offer... wait. You&apos;re trying to trick me, aren&apos;t you? Sneaky &lt;boy/girl&gt;. Is there any *other* way I can help?</string>
<string name="870">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh dear. Well certainly I&apos;ll offer what I can. Here... take this. Is there anything else I can do for him?</string>
<string name="871">I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve given away all the tressym tongue and charcoal I had, I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m really not sure where you could go to get more.</string>
<string name="872">That&apos;s odd. Here&apos;s the charcoal you need... but I seem to be out of tressym tongue. I could have sworn I had some.</string>
<string name="873">That&apos;s odd. Here&apos;s the tressym tongue you need... but I seem to be out of charcoal. I could have sworn I had some.</string>
<string name="874">That&apos;s odd. I could have sworn I had some tressym tongue and charcoal... but it&apos;s all gone.</string>
<string name="875">Hmmm. I do happen to have some tressym tongue and charcoal on me. Here... take them, no charge of course.</string>
<string name="876">As for helmthorn berries, you could try asking Mara at the tavern if she still has some. I sold her the last of my stock a week ago.</string>
<string name="877">Oh dear. She wasn&apos;t hurt during the attack, was she? Damnable kobolds! Well... all I can suggest is that you look around her kitchen, sorry.</string>
<string name="878">You do? Well that solves that, then. I hope the remedy works.</string>
<string name="879">No, thanks.</string>
<string name="880">I&apos;d like to see what you have in stock.</string>
<string name="881">What kinds of things do you sell here?</string>
<string name="882">I should go.</string>
<string name="883">Have you seen any kobolds in the area?</string>
<string name="884">I found this ring outside. Does it belong to you?</string>
<string name="885">Yes, he&apos;s recovering... just not completely well yet.</string>
<string name="886">No, he&apos;s not. In fact, that&apos;s why I&apos;m here... I need some herbs for him.</string>
<string name="887">He wasn&apos;t the last time I saw him, no.</string>
<string name="888">I could not care less. I have other things to worry about.</string>
<string name="889">I need some herbs for Master Drogan: he&apos;s been poisoned.</string>
<string name="890">Tressym tongue, charcoal and helmthorn berries.</string>
<string name="891">He was alive, last time I checked.</string>
<string name="892">He was poisoned, but he&apos;s recovering nicely now.</string>
<string name="893">No, he&apos;s not. He was poisoned during a kobold attack.</string>
<string name="894">That&apos;s actually why I&apos;m here. He&apos;s been poisoned.</string>
<string name="895">Never mind.</string>
<string name="896">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; He needs a bunch of your equipment. Free of charge, I assume?</string>
<string name="897">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You could donate some coin. The cure is very expensive.</string>
<string name="898">No, never mind.</string>
<string name="899">I need some herbs. Tressym tongue, charcoal and helmthorn berries.</string>
<string name="900">I&apos;ll try that, thanks.</string>
<string name="901">Mara&apos;s actually not at the tavern anymore...</string>
<string name="902">I really don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be asking Mara anything, actually.</string>
<string name="903">I already have some helmthorn berries, thanks.</string>
<string name="904">You gots me a shiny?</string>
<string name="905">Yip, yip! Me stole the baby, stupid &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;! Me gots control of you now, yip!</string>
<string name="906">Me not think so, yip! Kobolds love them children, so do you. If you want it, yip, you must gives me shiny gem in return.</string>
<string name="907">Yip, me saw human downstairs had nice shiny. You gets and gives to me. Yip, yip!</string>
<string name="908">Yip! Me like songs! You play, that good idea.</string>
<string name="909">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; What? Yip? What happen? Yip, you have the baby! Oh no, me was tricked. Now you pay for that!</string>
<string name="910">Me give baby to you.</string>
<string name="911">Me leave peacefully.</string>
<string name="912">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Yip! You not so tough and me have baby! Why should me ever just give baby for nothing, yip?  You go get me shiny now!</string>
<string name="913">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Yip, that be stupid! No try that again, yip, or me eat baby!</string>
<string name="914">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Yip! No, stupid! Now me have to kill you!</string>
<string name="915">Yip! Yes, go get shiny! Go quick, me gettin&apos; hungry.</string>
<string name="916">Yip, yip, yip! Me so happy, me is now going. You take smelly baby! Him make big stink.</string>
<string name="917">Someone stole the gem I had. Do you have one, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I swear I will pay you back, someday.</string>
<string name="918">Yip! No! Me kill you both!</string>
<string name="919">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt;, I saw you take it, but I did not want to say anything, because I needed your help!</string>
<string name="920">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Then I fear my child is doomed. Kobold, would you allow my friend here to go and look for a gem?</string>
<string name="921">Him go get shiny? Yip! Okay, that be good. Me wait here.</string>
<string name="922">We have no choice, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Please, just trade it to the kobold for my child!</string>
<string name="923">I have a gem. If I give it to you, do you promise to give my son back?</string>
<string name="924">Yip, yes, me will trade! You give me shiny.</string>
<string name="925">There, now give my son back.</string>
<string name="926">Die, sneaky beastie!</string>
<string name="927">Give me the baby and I promise you a quick, painless death. </string>
<string name="928">If you kill the child, I will have to kill you. </string>
<string name="929">Just give me the baby and I will let you go. </string>
<string name="930">The babe looks upset, I will play a song to calm it.</string>
<string name="931">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Fascinate kobold then steal the baby.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="932">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Charm Spell]&lt;/Start&gt; You will give the baby to me.</string>
<string name="933">You will leave peacefully.</string>
<string name="934">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Give me the baby or die, now!</string>
<string name="935">I would rather just kill you and take the baby. </string>
<string name="936">Ok... here you...&lt;StartAction&gt;[Snatch the baby from the kobold]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="937">I will kill you first. </string>
<string name="938">Just give me the baby! </string>
<string name="939">Oops, sorry bout that, I slipped..</string>
<string name="940">I&apos;ll go get one.</string>
<string name="941">Here&apos;s a nice shiny gem. Now give me that child!</string>
<string name="942">Kill it now, while we have it cornered!</string>
<string name="943">I have a better idea. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Snatch the baby from the kobold.]&lt;/Start&gt; </string>
<string name="944">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I don&apos;t have any gems.</string>
<string name="945">Fine. Take the gem, but give us the child.</string>
<string name="946">Yes, I have one, but I don&apos;t trust the kobold.</string>
<string name="947">Yes, I have one. Here, take it and give the child back. </string>
<string name="948">The dog bares its teeth and growls, obviously alarmed by your approach.</string>
<string name="949">The dog wags its tail with obvious uncertainty and shies away from you.</string>
<string name="950">The dog looks at you curiously. It seems friendly enough.</string>
<string name="951">The dog greets you warmly, thinking pleasant thoughts of his new mate Bethsheva.</string>
<string name="952">Hey! Leave my stuff alone! Stop you thief!</string>
<string name="953">Get out of my hovel, you beasts! Leave me alone! Oh, it&apos;s just you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. When my locked door suddenly opened, I thought the kobolds were back.</string>
<string name="954">If you are hunting kobolds, there&apos;s none in here. THEY got the point when they found the door locked and left. Just goes to show, I suppose. So, is the fighting done?</string>
<string name="955">Lousy, snooping adventurers; always going into other people&apos;s homes and stealing their stuff.</string>
<string name="956">Oh, right then. I think I will. Just to be safe.</string>
<string name="957">What ever. Just be gone.</string>
<string name="958">You bashed down my door, so I have nothing to stop any other hungry monsters from wandering into my house and having a little Toman snack, and now you just want to chat a little? Hmm?</string>
<string name="959">Anything else, or has the stench of my poverty finally driven you off?</string>
<string name="960">I suppose so, if you really want to. I imagine it might cost me two gold pieces to replace it, though it did need replacing anyways. The wood was getting a little soft.</string>
<string name="961">Oh, never mind. I know where there&apos;s a little abandoned cabin, not too far from here. I can just take the door off of it. It&apos;s in better shape than mine was anyways. What do you want?</string>
<string name="962">Nothing much recently, unless you include the Red Wizard who came to town. I tremble at the thought of those Thayvians coming here. Evil folk they are.</string>
<string name="963">Last I heard, the mayor and his assistant were going to throw him out of town. I don&apos;t know what happened though, the kobolds attacked before he got an audience with the mayor.</string>
<string name="964">My guess is he&apos;ll be headed out of town. Good riddance and none too soon if you ask me! Other than that, there&apos;s the halfling caravan and that&apos;s about all I know.</string>
<string name="965">Little thieves, that&apos;s what they are! Good thing I don&apos;t have nothing for them to steal. I have kept my distance, just in case though. I don&apos;t know why they&apos;re here.</string>
<string name="966">I think you would get along with them. You could pick each other&apos;s pockets and locks and all that sort of nonsense. For a man like me, I avoid getting to close, just in case.</string>
<string name="967">Well, they look a fair bit like you, which makes sense I suppose. I have kept my distance from them, since some around here claim they&apos;re just a bunch of thieves anyways.</string>
<string name="968">I don&apos;t know anything more about them, but you can go speak to them if you wish. Their caravan is right down the road from here. Anything else?</string>
<string name="969">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You are such a bad liar. You just came here to rob me. So why don&apos;t you go ahead and do that? I don&apos;t have hardly anything other than this hovel.</string>
<string name="970">Maybe you should just kill me and loot my home! Maybe you&apos;ll even find a couple of silver pieces! </string>
<string name="971">Uh... oh, you wouldn&apos;t really do that would you? I don&apos;t want to die. But I really am poor. I am just a little overwrought, what with the attack and all. Any other questions?</string>
<string name="972">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s about time somebody did something to protect us poor citizens. I&apos;m glad to hear the mayor is taking steps.</string>
<string name="973">Here is my gold piece. That&apos;s all I have left. Took me a year to save up that much, but I am happy to part with it, if it goes towards saving my life.</string>
<string name="974">Any other questions?</string>
<string name="975">This is a one-road village. You have lived here for years. What could you possibly need directions to?</string>
<string name="976">Well, I should hope not! Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="977">Right across the road. Look for the sign that says &apos;Blacksmith&apos;. How hard can this be?</string>
<string name="978">Right across the road. Look for the sign that says &apos;Herbalist&apos;, unless Drogan never taught you to read.</string>
<string name="979">Right across the street from the Community Hall.</string>
<string name="980">Right next door in the Community Hall. What else?</string>
<string name="981">You picked the lock to my door so you could loot my hovel, probably broke the lock too, and now you just want to have a little chat? Hmm?</string>
<string name="982">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hey, don&apos;t you threaten me. I&apos;m good friends with the mayor and I&apos;m on speaking terms with Drogan. You little upstarts don&apos;t worry me none.</string>
<string name="983">Just leave me alone. You&apos;ll get yours someday!</string>
<string name="984">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Don&apos;t hurt me, please. I didn&apos;t do anything wrong! Why are you robbing me? I&apos;m just a poor, lonely guy.</string>
<string name="985">I... I guess I can give you my gold piece. That&apos;s all I have though. I would threaten to tell Drogan, but I guess you would hurt me if I did. I&apos;ll keep my mouth shut, I promise. </string>
<string name="986">Just don&apos;t hurt me. Please just go away.</string>
<string name="987">With what, my carving knife? Give me a break. There are plenty of adventurers around here, including yourself. I wouldn&apos;t stand a chance. So is the fighting done or not?</string>
<string name="988">Oh, I see you came back. What do you want now?</string>
<string name="989">Yes. Off you go to rob some other poor sap.</string>
<string name="990">Just go away. I don&apos;t want to talk to you.</string>
<string name="991">I cannot believe I got kicked out my house by that Red Wizard. He had some kind of permit from the mayor, but where will I sleep?</string>
<string name="992">Yes, goodbye.</string>
<string name="993">No, you might want to continue cowering in here for a while.</string>
<string name="994">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="995">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="996">That&apos;s all my questions.</string>
<string name="997">Sorry, can I fix the door or pay you for the damage?</string>
<string name="998">Besides the attack, what has happened recently?</string>
<string name="999">Tell me about the halflings.</string>
<string name="1000">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Lie]&lt;/Start&gt;So have you heard about the new Kobold Defense Tax?</string>
<string name="1001">I need directions.</string>
<string name="1002">Maybe I don&apos;t need directions after all.</string>
<string name="1003">Where is the blacksmith?</string>
<string name="1004">Where is the herbalist?</string>
<string name="1005">Where is the local tavern?</string>
<string name="1006">Where would I find the mayor?</string>
<string name="1007">I don&apos;t need any more directions. </string>
<string name="1008">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Not for you, unless I see some gold!</string>
<string name="1009">Why didn&apos;t you come out and help drive off the attack?</string>
<string name="1010">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1011">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1012">Don&apos;t mind him. My brother don&apos;t talk much. Especially not today, with all the fighting and such.</string>
<string name="1013">Yes? What is it? What brings you to Daschnaya&apos;s little wagon, hmm?</string>
<string name="1014">And so you should. Off with you, then.</string>
<string name="1015">I am Daschnaya, as I said. If you&apos;ve come for a reading, you&apos;ll have to run along. I&apos;ve no cards to ply my trade with, thanks to the kobold thieves.</string>
<string name="1016">Are you deaf, &lt;man/woman&gt;? A reading of your future, yes. I have the gift of foresight... for all the good it does me without my cards.</string>
<string name="1017">Now shoo. Be off. Daschnaya&apos;s wagon is small enough without crowding it.</string>
<string name="1018">Oh? So you do, so you do. So it&apos;s you after all, is it? I should have recognized you for who you are. Well, well, it&apos;s done.</string>
<string name="1019">I suppose you&apos;ll be wanting a reward for returning my cards to me, yes? What shall it be? What does the &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt; wish?</string>
<string name="1020">Ah, yes, Daschnaya does have a few coins. Not enough to call a fortune, and no doubt less than half what a greedy &lt;man/woman&gt; would wish.</string>
<string name="1021">Of far more worth is information... such as information of your future. Would you not consider that in trade, instead?</string>
<string name="1022">Then gold you shall have. And here it is... all that I possess which the kobolds did not take for the one thing I prize which they did.</string>
<string name="1023">So there it is done. You have my payment and my thanks. Now we are quits, you and I. May the future find you well.</string>
<string name="1024">No doubt she did. Very well, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;... Daschnaya is willing to look into your future, if that is your true wish. Is it?</string>
<string name="1025">Such a sweet &lt;boy/girl&gt; you are. Thank you most kindly. Are you sure you will not allow me to do a brief reading for you? Free of charge?</string>
<string name="1026">Believing is not the same thing as truth... but knowledge will come whether you wish it or not. As it will for you, in time, so be it.</string>
<string name="1027">As you wish, as you wish. Daschnaya is not one to force knowledge on one who does not wish it.</string>
<string name="1028">I thank you for returning an old fortune-teller&apos;s cards to her. May the future find you well, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="1029">Ahhh, good. Good! Allow Daschnaya to prepare, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;, and we shall see what the future holds, eh?</string>
<string name="1030">Hmmm. Most interesting... Daschnaya sees a long road ahead before you, fraught with perils. Something valuable has been stolen and you seek to find it.</string>
<string name="1031">It lies in the hands of one who... who hides in a village to the east. But this one is not of that village. Frightened, is he, frightened and weak.</string>
<string name="1032">He will ask your help, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;, and you must not refuse it should you wish to gain what was stolen.</string>
<string name="1033">And you must gain it back. It is most dangerous. More than anything else that was taken. It must not fall into her hands!</string>
<string name="1034">I... know not. I cannot look upon the face of the one who seeks what you seek, and I do not know why. The future is closed.</string>
<string name="1035">That is all I can say... except that finding what you seek is only the beginning. Be wary, young one... be wary.</string>
<string name="1036">Heed what I say or do not, that is not my concern. You have been given the knowledge; do with it as you will.</string>
<string name="1037">Now I tire. You have my thanks and we are quits. Daschnaya would go to bed... and you have an adventure before you. I hope the future finds you well.</string>
<string name="1038">Daschnaya sees less than she would like, but often more than she should. I can only hope my pitiful skill has offered you some insight.</string>
<string name="1039">Yes? What is it? Why does one of the large folk stumble into Daschnaya&apos;s little wagon?</string>
<string name="1040">Yes? What is it? A halfling, but not one of us, eh? Why do you come to see Daschnaya?</string>
<string name="1041">I&apos;ve no time or energy for readings today, young &lt;man/woman&gt;. Come back another day when Daschnaya can help you.</string>
<string name="1042">You have returned my cards to me and for that Daschnaya is grateful. Now leave an old halfling woman to her peace.</string>
<string name="1043">I should go.</string>
<string name="1044">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1045">A reading?</string>
<string name="1046">Very well. I&apos;ll go.</string>
<string name="1047">I have your cards, here.</string>
<string name="1048">Anything of value. Cough it up or die, woman.</string>
<string name="1049">Coin would be fine. Or gems, jewels, anything valuable.</string>
<string name="1050">Your valuables for your life. Now that&apos;s a fair trade.</string>
<string name="1051">I prize gold much more highly.</string>
<string name="1052">Alright. But make it good.</string>
<string name="1053">Katriana mentioned something about a reading...</string>
<string name="1054">Actually, I&apos;d prefer something more substantial as a reward.</string>
<string name="1055">Yes, I&apos;d like that.</string>
<string name="1056">Perhaps not. But take the cards anyway, they&apos;re yours.</string>
<string name="1057">I need no reward. The cards are yours.</string>
<string name="1058">I do not believe in your hedge magics.</string>
<string name="1059">No. I&apos;ve no interest in such a thing.</string>
<string name="1060">Very well. That&apos;s very kind of you.</string>
<string name="1061">Whose hands?</string>
<string name="1062">That&apos;s it? I should cut your throat for giving me that garbage!</string>
<string name="1063">Well, thanks for nothing.</string>
<string name="1064">Thank you, Daschnaya.</string>
<string name="1065">Ho there! Best watch your step, friend... there&apos;s kobold entrails all about.</string>
<string name="1066">Best of luck to you, then, friend.</string>
<string name="1067">Alright. Fare you well, big &apos;un.</string>
<string name="1068">You&apos;d probably be better off talking to Katriana. She heads the caravan, you know. But, um, you can ask me whatever you like.</string>
<string name="1069">You mean other than the ones we chased out? Yes, I think so. Torias said he saw some running down from the north a while ago. Went through the gate.</string>
<string name="1070">It&apos;s not that unusual. It&apos;s no different than any other caravan that comes through here, I bet.</string>
<string name="1071">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1072">Well, okay. It&apos;s probably smaller, that&apos;s true.</string>
<string name="1073">Katriana, of course. Go on and talk to her, if you like.</string>
<string name="1074">East, I think. Across the Anauroch Desert. But not until everyone&apos;s healed up properly, I think.</string>
<string name="1075">Maybe so. No reason we can&apos;t be merchants at the same time.</string>
<string name="1076">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1077">True. Like my brother says, big &apos;uns always assume we&apos;re a bunch of thieves so trading&apos;s the only way to be accepted anywhere.</string>
<string name="1078">Naw. Not to say I haven&apos;t nipped the pocket of a big &apos;un or two, right friend? Heh.</string>
<string name="1079">Now that&apos;s a nasty thing for a big &apos;un to say. Certainly not!</string>
<string name="1080">Same thing that happened everywhere else in Hilltop, it looks like: we got attacked by kobolds. Scaly buggers figured they could rob us blind.</string>
<string name="1081">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1082">Yes, brother, I know. We showed them good. Serves them right for underestimating halfling might.</string>
<string name="1083">Well... yeah, they did. They didn&apos;t get as much as they might have liked, but they got away with some of our supplies.</string>
<string name="1084">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1085">You know, you&apos;re right, brother. Hey friend... if you want to help us out, talk to Katriana.</string>
<string name="1086">Sounds good to me.</string>
<string name="1087">I don&apos;t know. Katriana makes all our deals. Ask her.</string>
<string name="1088">Typical big folk indifference. Okay, be that way.</string>
<string name="1089">Not even some fellow halflings? Okay, then, be that way.</string>
<string name="1090">Oh. Well, never mind, then.</string>
<string name="1091">Because Katriana&apos;s our leader. She&apos;s the one that makes all the deals wherever we go.</string>
<string name="1092">Sure did. We&apos;re used to defending our caravan from bandits and the like. They took us by surprise though, sneaky critters, so a few of us got hurt.</string>
<string name="1093">They ran off out of town, but I don&apos;t know where. Torias chased after them, so he&apos;d know more, I guess.</string>
<string name="1094">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1095">Yeah. What&apos;s so funny about that? We beat &apos;em off, didn&apos;t we? You see anyone around here do any better?</string>
<string name="1096">You big &apos;uns are all the same. Sure, go ahead, laugh. We still beat &apos;em off all the same.</string>
<string name="1097">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1098">I agree. That&apos;s an awfully strange thing for a halfling to say. Shame on you.</string>
<string name="1099">The name&apos;s Furten.</string>
<string name="1100">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1101">And that&apos;s my brother, Birgen. He doesn&apos;t talk much.</string>
<string name="1102">Ho there, big &apos;un. Careful to watch where you step, as there&apos;s halflings about. We tend to get underfoot, so you big &apos;uns keep telling me.</string>
<string name="1103">Oh, you know... big folk. Tall people. Like yourself. No offense.</string>
<string name="1104">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1105">Never you mind with that, brother. These folk seem decent enough.</string>
<string name="1106">Don&apos;t you mind him none. He&apos;s had a bad day. Well, we all have, actually.</string>
<string name="1107">Ho there, friend. Always nice to see another halfling in these parts.</string>
<string name="1108">Hah! Katriana says you&apos;re going to be joining us in the desert, friend.</string>
<string name="1109">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1110">Now that&apos;s not a very nice thing to say, brother. I&apos;m sure &lt;he/she&gt;&apos;ll be fine out there. We&apos;ll look after &lt;him/her&gt;, we will.</string>
<string name="1111">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1112">Oh, yes we will! Heh... don&apos;t mind him, friend. He&apos;s never cared for the Anauroch very much, nope.</string>
<string name="1113">I&apos;ve got to go.</string>
<string name="1114">Mind if I ask you a few questions?</string>
<string name="1115">Have you seen any kobolds leaving town recently?</string>
<string name="1116">This is some kind of halfling caravan, then?</string>
<string name="1117">Who&apos;s in charge, here?</string>
<string name="1118">Where are you headed next?</string>
<string name="1119">You look more like wanderers to me.</string>
<string name="1120">Are you a bunch of thieves?</string>
<string name="1121">What happened here?</string>
<string name="1122">So the kobolds didn&apos;t rob you?</string>
<string name="1123">I&apos;ll do that.</string>
<string name="1124">Is there a reward in it for me?</string>
<string name="1125">I&apos;ve no interest in helping anyone.</string>
<string name="1126">I already spoke to Katriana.</string>
<string name="1127">Why can&apos;t I talk to you?</string>
<string name="1128">You defeated them, then?</string>
<string name="1129">Halfling might? You&apos;re kidding, right?</string>
<string name="1130">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1131">Err... big &apos;uns?</string>
<string name="1132">Does your brother have a problem with big folk?</string>
<string name="1133">Is there something you need? I don&apos;t have time to chat... my mates here need tending to, as I&apos;m sure you can plainly see.</string>
<string name="1134">Right, then. Fare you well.</string>
<string name="1135">The name&apos;s Katriana. I lead the caravan. Why? Who are you?</string>
<string name="1136">Oh, but mine is? Funny, but I remember saying I didn&apos;t have time to chat. Was there actually something you needed?</string>
<string name="1137">Ha! For a halfling, you&apos;re pretty secretive. Have it your way, I guess. Was there something you actually wanted?</string>
<string name="1138">Alright. &lt;FirstName&gt; it is. Nice to meet you. Was there something you wanted from me?</string>
<string name="1139">&lt;FirstName&gt;, eh? Well, what was it you needed from me exactly, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As you can see, my hands are full.</string>
<string name="1140">That so? Dwarven wizard, right? I think I remember him. He&apos;s come to give me messages to take on to other towns, sometimes. Pays handsomely.</string>
<string name="1141">Very well, then, &lt;FullName&gt;, apprentice to Master Drogan. What is it, exactly, that you needed from me?</string>
<string name="1142">If you make it quick.</string>
<string name="1143">I did, as did my grandfather before me and his mother before him. Why? Something odd about that?</string>
<string name="1144">Well, we trade, mostly, moving from town to town around the Silver Marches. Occasionally we&apos;ll range farther west... but not since the plague in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="1145">We&apos;re wanderers, for the most part, but I daresay we do well enough as merchants that we&apos;re welcome most anywhere.</string>
<string name="1146">Not lately. Such are the fortunes of plying your trade in the north, however.</string>
<string name="1147">Somewhat, yes. We&apos;re always looking for guards, however, and the boys don&apos;t do so bad when they&apos;re not surprised like we were today.</string>
<string name="1148">I&apos;m thinking we&apos;ll try crossing the Anauroch desert. There&apos;s goods out east that&apos;ll bring a grand price when we head back this way.</string>
<string name="1149">We can always use another guard... so I can&apos;t see why not. But we&apos;re not going anywhere until everyone&apos;s recovered.</string>
<string name="1150">Try back later. I&apos;ll know our plans for certain, then.</string>
<string name="1151">We can always use another guard... so I can&apos;t see why not. But we&apos;re going to need some time to stock up on supplies.</string>
<string name="1152">Not at the moment. We came to Hilltop to get supplies... and the kobolds took off with much of what we had stored. Sad day, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="1153">You mean since the ones that robbed us ran off? No, sorry. I&apos;ve been busy here, however... maybe you should talk to Torias or Furten. They&apos;ve been on watch.</string>
<string name="1154">Attacked by kobolds, naturally. Seems obvious enough, doesn&apos;t it? They came out of nowhere and tried to rob us.</string>
<string name="1155">They didn&apos;t get away with anything important. Well... that&apos;s not true, exactly. They took Daschnaya&apos;s cards, sadly.</string>
<string name="1156">Maybe you could. They&apos;re a simple pack of fortune-telling cards, but they&apos;ve been in Daschnaya&apos;s family for generations.</string>
<string name="1157">If you get the chance, we&apos;d sure appreciate getting those cards back. We&apos;d even reward you. Not that I expect much. I bet those kobolds are long gone.</string>
<string name="1158">As you wish.</string>
<string name="1159">Torias might. He followed after them a bit when they ran off. Maybe you should talk to him.</string>
<string name="1160">They&apos;re used for telling fortunes. That&apos;s what Daschnaya does... her family&apos;s been at it for generations. It&apos;s a sad thing to have lost her family&apos;s cards.</string>
<string name="1161">Our fortune-teller. She makes a bit of coin at the towns we stop at. Her family&apos;s been using those cards for generations... it&apos;s a sad day that we&apos;ve lost them.</string>
<string name="1162">They took Daschnaya&apos;s cards, but thankfully those have been returned. Otherwise we&apos;re fine.</string>
<string name="1163">You could get Daschnaya&apos;s cards back. I&apos;d consider that a service.</string>
<string name="1164">Uh-huh. Well, maybe you can be, at that. We were attacked by kobolds earlier, as you can obviously see.</string>
<string name="1165">Ha ha! No... no, I think I have everything I need. But thank you.</string>
<string name="1166">Yes, they certainly are. As I already said, those are Daschnaya&apos;s cards. If you bring them to her, I&apos;m sure she will be very pleased.</string>
<string name="1167">Here... I see you&apos;ve misplaced the key for her wagon. Take this and go to her, please.</string>
<string name="1168">You&apos;ll find her in the northern wagon. If I were you, I&apos;d take her up on a reading if she offers you one.</string>
<string name="1169">How did you...? No, never mind. Obviously you took those from the kobold thieves, themselves. I hope you gave them what they deserved.</string>
<string name="1170">Those cards are indeed Daschnaya&apos;s. Out of everything the kobolds took from us, these are all we really wanted returned. I&apos;m sure Daschnaya would be grateful to have them back.</string>
<string name="1171">Here... this is the key to her wagon. If you&apos;re lucky, perhaps she&apos;ll give you a free reading!</string>
<string name="1172">Good. Thank you again for this. Things are looking up, for once.</string>
<string name="1173">Good. Thank you again for this... perhaps you big folk aren&apos;t so terrible after all.</string>
<string name="1174">Daschnaya&apos;s a fortuneteller. It&apos;s in her family&apos;s blood. So far she&apos;s never been wrong.</string>
<string name="1175">Suit yourself. I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll reward you, regardless.</string>
<string name="1176">All she said is that it was important we came to Hilltop, and that we&apos;d be fine. And we are, I suppose.</string>
<string name="1177">Maybe she did.</string>
<string name="1178">Well... you can talk to her about that. They&apos;re her cards. If I were you, though, I&apos;d ask for a reading.</string>
<string name="1179">Right behind me. Daschnaya hasn&apos;t been in the mood to come out since the attack. This should cheer her right up!</string>
<string name="1180">No doubt. I&apos;m sure whatever big folk cleric they have here in Hilltop is busy enough with his own people. Besides, I haven&apos;t the coin to pay for spells.</string>
<string name="1181">Thank you, but I have the situation well in hand. I&apos;d rather not be indebted to anyone; it&apos;s not our way.</string>
<string name="1182">I don&apos;t wish to owe you big folks anything, so no thank you. We&apos;ll make do. Not that I don&apos;t appreciate you offering.</string>
<string name="1183">I appreciate the offer, friend, but no thanks. I&apos;d rather not be indebted to anyone. It&apos;s just our way.</string>
<string name="1184">Thank you. Was there something else you wanted, friend?</string>
<string name="1185">Maybe so. You may not understand it, but our self-reliance is very important to us. We only ask for help when we really need it... and that&apos;s not now.</string>
<string name="1186">So, then... is there something that you actually need from me, or can I return to my work?</string>
<string name="1187">They aren&apos;t going to die. I have the situation well in hand, thank you very much. You may not understand it, but our self-reliance is very important to us.</string>
<string name="1188">Perhaps not, but I would still owe you nevertheless. You may not see that as much, but we do. As I said, it&apos;s just our way... nothing personal.</string>
<string name="1189">You&apos;re joking, right? I meant that these fellows are my good friends as well as workers on the caravan.</string>
<string name="1190">They were injured by them bloody, sneaking kobolds and that means we&apos;re going nowhere until they&apos;re well.</string>
<string name="1191">Hullo there, friend. You&apos;ll have to excuse me if I can&apos;t stop to chat for long... my mates here need tending to.</string>
<string name="1192">You again? Did you forget to ask something the first time?</string>
<string name="1193">Hullo again. Have you had any luck finding those cards? That&apos;s getting my hopes up a bit high, I suppose, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="1194">Nobody. I was just asking. It just seems a shame for Daschnaya to lose something so precious to her.</string>
<string name="1195">Nobody. It was just a simple question. Must you big folk get sensitive over everything?</string>
<string name="1196">Well, I wasn&apos;t expecting much. Like I said, those kobolds are probably long gone.</string>
<string name="1197">Anyway... is there something in particular you need?</string>
<string name="1198">Have you brought those cards to Daschnaya, yet? I&apos;m sure she&apos;s eagerly looking forward to getting them back.</string>
<string name="1199">We don&apos;t tend to look much to others for help, but... thank you kindly. I appreciate what you did for Daschnaya.</string>
<string name="1200">Look... I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re looking for some payment, but I didn&apos;t ask you to heal anyone. We can make do on our own.</string>
<string name="1201">Not for any healing, I&apos;m not! We didn&apos;t ask anyone in town for any help, so if you&apos;re just here to &quot;offer&quot; your services then please go back.</string>
<string name="1202">I don&apos;t mean to sound ungrateful, but we don&apos;t tend to look to others for help. It&apos;s just our way.</string>
<string name="1203">We owe you a debt for bringing those cards back... even though you have yet to give them to Daschnaya. For that, yes, but not for any healing.</string>
<string name="1204">We owe you a debt for bringing those cards back to Daschnaya. We&apos;ll always be grateful for that... but I didn&apos;t ask you for anything else.</string>
<string name="1205">Well... I suppose this does speed up our recovery a bit. We don&apos;t have to stay here any longer than we have to.</string>
<string name="1206">I... thank you. We&apos;re not used to having others help us, that&apos;s all. I don&apos;t mean to sound ungrateful.</string>
<string name="1207">Now, if there&apos;s nothing else, I do have to attend to the others...</string>
<string name="1208">So is there something else you needed?</string>
<string name="1209">Err... and I admit we would all be very grateful if you brought those cards to Daschnaya. </string>
<string name="1210">Especially considering what you did for Daschnaya. You&apos;re always welcome amongst us in the caravan, friend.</string>
<string name="1211">I... well, I see. You struck me as a &lt;man/woman&gt; who was going to charge me for something I didn&apos;t ask for. I see I was mistaken.</string>
<string name="1212">I understand you&apos;re to join us when we cross the desert. We&apos;re about to start preparing for the trip... are you ready to go?</string>
<string name="1213">Fine, fine. We won&apos;t be staying around forever, though, so don&apos;t dally too long.</string>
<string name="1214">Excellent. I assume you won&apos;t object to helping us load up one of the wagons? Let&apos;s hop to it.</string>
<string name="1215">I should go.</string>
<string name="1216">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1217">My name isn&apos;t important.</string>
<string name="1218">Just call me &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1219">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;, apprentice to Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="1220">Mind if I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="1221">You said you lead this caravan?</string>
<string name="1222">So what kind of caravan is this?</string>
<string name="1223">So you must be pretty wealthy...</string>
<string name="1224">Isn&apos;t all that traveling dangerous?</string>
<string name="1225">Where are you off to next?</string>
<string name="1226">Would it be possible to join you on the trip?</string>
<string name="1227">Do you have anything to sell?</string>
<string name="1228">Have you seen any kobolds pass by lately?</string>
<string name="1229">What happened here?</string>
<string name="1230">Maybe I could be of help to you in getting them back?</string>
<string name="1231">I have some other questions.</string>
<string name="1232">These aren&apos;t the cards you&apos;re looking for, are they?</string>
<string name="1233">Does anyone know where those kobolds went?</string>
<string name="1234">What&apos;s so important about some cards?</string>
<string name="1235">Who is this Daschnaya?</string>
<string name="1236">You mean these cards?</string>
<string name="1237">I was just hoping I might be of service to such a pretty halfling lass.</string>
<string name="1238">Are these cards yours?</string>
<string name="1239">I&apos;ll go find her now.</string>
<string name="1240">What do you mean by &apos;reading&apos;?</string>
<string name="1241">I don&apos;t believe in any of that.</string>
<string name="1242">And she didn&apos;t tell you about the kobold attack?</string>
<string name="1243">Maybe she should have foreseen she&apos;d lose her cards.</string>
<string name="1244">I was expecting a reward.</string>
<string name="1245">Where is this wagon of hers?</string>
<string name="1246">Why not see a cleric? A few healing spells and they&apos;d be fine.</string>
<string name="1247">I can help heal your men, if you like.</string>
<string name="1248">As you wish.</string>
<string name="1249">That seems like a stubborn attitude.</string>
<string name="1250">If you&apos;d rather your men died, that&apos;s up to you.</string>
<string name="1251">Really, it&apos;s no trouble. You don&apos;t need to repay me.</string>
<string name="1252">Your mates? All these men are your husbands?</string>
<string name="1253">Who said I was looking for them?</string>
<string name="1254">No, I haven&apos;t found them.</string>
<string name="1255">Are these the cards you&apos;re looking for?</string>
<string name="1256">You&apos;re indebted to me whether you like it or not!</string>
<string name="1257">Well excuse me for offering a hand.</string>
<string name="1258">I didn&apos;t ask you for anything... I was just trying to help.</string>
<string name="1259">I could heal them, too, if you like.</string>
<string name="1260">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1261">Not just yet.</string>
<string name="1262">Yes, I&apos;m ready to go now.</string>
<string name="1263">Wait... are these cards yours?</string>
<string name="1264">The dust on the ground has been disturbed heavily by small tracks... kobolds, without a doubt.</string>
<string name="1265">These appear to be kobold tracks. You cannot determine how many of them, but they seem to have gone into the cellar.</string>
<string name="1266">These appear to be kobold tracks. Three of them seem to have gone into the cellar, but not come back out.</string>
<string name="1267">A small group of creatures passed through this area recently, according to the tracks.</string>
<string name="1268">A small group of humanoids seems to be inhabiting the small cave in front of you.</string>
<string name="1269">A small group of orcs, perhaps six, appear to use this cave as their home. They would appear to be fresh, indicating that some of them are in the cave at this moment.</string>
<string name="1270">&lt;StartAction&gt;[The wolf looks at you with a lopsided grin.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1271">The wolf remembers the smell of blood on the wounds of the kobolds that ran into the cave.</string>
<string name="1272">The wolf scratches at a fleabite, wondering if swimming in the river would be worth the effort to get rid of the pest. </string>
<string name="1273">The wolf appears bored and wonders when you are going to go hunting together.</string>
<string name="1274">The wolf looks you over to decide if you would make a good mate, arriving at the decision that you would not produce good offspring together.</string>
<string name="1275">The wolf complains about a stag he was hunting that kept disappearing into thin air.</string>
<string name="1276">The wolf wonders how you can stand to move about on two legs, since you are obviously much slower.</string>
<string name="1277">Hello, wolf.</string>
<string name="1278">The lock on this cage appears too solid to pick and the bars too thick to break.</string>
<string name="1279">These tracks are from some kind of deer. You cannot tell how fresh the tracks are.</string>
<string name="1280">These stag tracks are growing familiar to you, but you still have not seen the mighty beast that is responsible for them. You do feel like you are drawing closer to your elusive quarry.</string>
<string name="1281">These appear to be deer or stag tracks, but from one you are not familiar with.</string>
<string name="1282">These stag tracks must be from the Shadow Hart. These tracks seem quite fresh. Your quarry must be close.</string>
<string name="1283">These stag tracks are growing familiar to you, but you still have not seen the mighty beast that is responsible for them. You do feel like you are drawing closer to your elusive quarry.</string>
<string name="1284">These appear to be stag tracks, but they are from an unusually large one. One you are not familiar with.</string>
<string name="1285">These stag tracks were from the mighty Shadow Hart.</string>
<string name="1286">You are unable to determine what creature made these tracks. They do seem to generally be leading in the direction of the pass to the Nether Mountains.</string>
<string name="1287">These appear to be kobold tracks. They seem to be leading to the High Pass to the Nether Mountains.</string>
<string name="1288">These appear to be kobold tracks. A large group of perhaps 30 or so of the creatures passed by this way within the last day. They seem to be leading to the High Pass to the Nether Mountains.</string>
<string name="1289">The rat quivers in fear at your approach.</string>
<string name="1290">The rat appears to be shocked at your presence in its mind. You feel the quiet, safe darkness of the passage which the rat calls home.</string>
<string name="1291">Although the passage is quite large, the rat has lived there many years and feels quite comfortable. The rat worries that you are here to steal food from the giant as well.</string>
<string name="1292">Finally, he scurries off in the never-ending quest for food.</string>
<string name="1293">Hello, rat. Where did you come from?</string>
<string name="1294">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Behind this pile of rocks you see a small, darkened crawlspace that leads out to the foothills.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1295">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Behind this pile of rocks you see a small, darkened crawlspace. A possible escape route - if one was to brave the darkness.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1296">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Crawl into the darkness.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1297">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Do nothing...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1298">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Grab Becka and crawl into the darkness to see where it leads...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1299">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Behind this pile of rocks you see a small darkened crawlspace that leads back into Rumgut&apos;s cave.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1300">The tunnel seems to have collapsed behind you. There is no way back into the cave from here.</string>
<string name="1301">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Do nothing...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1302">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Crawl back into the cave...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1303">I gotta do my chores. Leave me alone.</string>
<string name="1304">Hey, what are you doing in here? I suppose Nathan is looking for another farmhand. Well, just watch yourself and don&apos;t go thinking you can just waltz in here and replace me.</string>
<string name="1305">I am the top farmhand for this homestead. Hey, wait, you look familiar. Are you that weakling that started the fight at the Bubbling Cauldron last week?</string>
<string name="1306">Uh... oh, sorry, goodbye.</string>
<string name="1307">Well, my friends aren&apos;t here right now. Why don&apos;t we see who is best?</string>
<string name="1308">He is an old, pathetic failure and I bet he made up all his adventures too!</string>
<string name="1309">I like to cut little beasts, it&apos;s true. Maybe you would like to be my next victim?</string>
<string name="1310">Try dropping to your knees and praying that I don&apos;t send you to meet your pathetic god!</string>
<string name="1311">Your voice is like the croaking of a toad, even when you talk!</string>
<string name="1312">Keep your weapons out of it and we shall see who is best!</string>
<string name="1313">What is this all about? Why are ye fighting with our guest? If my Nathan judges &lt;him/her&gt; to be good enough to enter our home, then ye will treat &lt;him/her&gt; as an honored guest!</string>
<string name="1314">Aw, Toli, it was all in fun. A little harmless bravado... er... right, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="1315">Nathan will dock your pay, lad. Now get out of here and get your chores done.</string>
<string name="1316">Yes Toli. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Grumble, grumble.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1317">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, he can be very short tempered, but he really is a good farmhand, and we do be needing him. But he does need to be punished.</string>
<string name="1318">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I never did like the way ye skulked about here, lad. Ye can just get off our property and we&apos;ll see about hiring a new hand.</string>
<string name="1319">Someday you will all regret this! Especially you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1320">Hmm, well, you had better get outside and get your chores done boy, before Nathan comes back in.</string>
<string name="1321">Yes Toli. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Whispers]&lt;/Start&gt; Thanks, I owe ya.</string>
<string name="1322">Oh, sorry about that. You sure look like that chump though. Anyways, I better get back to my chores. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1323">You have the wrong person. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1324">And I would have won that fight, if your friends hadn&apos;t interfered.</string>
<string name="1325">You insulted my teacher! Drogan&apos;s powers deserve your respect.</string>
<string name="1326">You and your friends were bragging about your cruelty to animals. It was the least you deserved.</string>
<string name="1327">You insulted my god in public! What else was I supposed to do?</string>
<string name="1328">You are the one that made fun of my music! I ought to teach you a lesson in manners.</string>
<string name="1329">That&apos;s right, you cowardly dog! I bested you then and could take you again!</string>
<string name="1330">He&apos;s right. It was all good spirited humor. </string>
<string name="1331">No. I have never been so insulted.</string>
<string name="1332">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; No, this brute is a violent, evil man. You should get rid of him.</string>
<string name="1333">I suppose you could call it that.</string>
<string name="1334">No, you have mistaken me. I am one of Drogan&apos;s pupils.</string>
<string name="1335">Talk to Nathan, he&apos;s the boss around here. I have chores to do.</string>
<string name="1336">Good to see the rescuer of me daughter back in me lands again. I hope all goes well for ye.</string>
<string name="1337">I see ye be back and me little girl is not. I hope ye have some idea of how desperate me situation be.</string>
<string name="1338">Aye, be on your way then.</string>
<string name="1339">I am sure ye are, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Tis just hard to be the worried parent with no recourse but to wait. Good luck to ye.</string>
<string name="1340">Take those words back! Do not utter such things! Me girl cannot be dead, tis a lie to unman me! Gods no! &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sob]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1341">Go from me. I must needs be alone. Thank... thank you for returning to tell me though. Now go, and leave a man to his grief.</string>
<string name="1342">Aye, that be true, but I had hoped that a pupil of Drogan&apos;s might have a change of heart and do the right thing. I guess I was wrong. Be off with ye then.</string>
<string name="1343">Ho there, stranger! If ye come lookin&apos; for treasures, just keep on goin&apos; for ye will no find easy pickin&apos;s in this home! Nathan Hurst has a spirit more fierce than a dozen wolves.</string>
<string name="1344">So tell me who ye are and where ye be from, that I might know if ye be friend or foe!</string>
<string name="1345">Aye, I be Duergar, at least in flesh and birth. But me soul is just dwarven, simple and pure. I be married to a shield dwarf, and if she can find the strength to forgive me race, I expect no less of others.</string>
<string name="1346">And if ye do not trust that, then ye can visit the village of Hilltop and speak to me old friend Drogan. Now who else can have such noble company to vouch for them, I ask ye?</string>
<string name="1347">Be gone stranger, or I shall bury your corpse in a shallow, unmarked grave. I have neither time nor patience to deal with close-minded fools. Wait, have I not seen ye before?</string>
<string name="1348">Now I recognize ye. Somethin&apos; about your face was pullin&apos; at me mind, but I am too distracted by my own troubles to recall ye, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We have never met, but I have seen ye from a distance.</string>
<string name="1349">Drogan would not have mentioned me, as I asked him not to speak of me, lest he get himself into trouble for befriending one of my kind.</string>
<string name="1350">What honest person could be passing through in this territory? Wait, now that I get a better look, I recognize ye, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Ye be one of Drogan&apos;s pupils. </string>
<string name="1351">That be truth in any land, but it sounds like the wisdom of me old friend Drogan. And now that I get a better look at ye, I recognize ye, &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="1352">I occasionally buy supplies in the village of Hilltop, and now that I hear your name I think I remember ye. A student of my old friend Drogan&apos;s, if I be not mistaken. </string>
<string name="1353">Ah, Drogan! Well do I know the old dwarf. We have shared a glass or two on a cold night. I think I remember ye now. I saw ye from a distance when I was speakin&apos; with Drogan.</string>
<string name="1354">Be welcome then, but know that ye come in hard times, and look not to me for great hospitality.</string>
<string name="1355">Ye will find that difficult to do, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I shall bury your corpse in a shallow, unmarked grave and not trouble Drogan with the troubling truth about his wayward pupil.</string>
<string name="1356">That be just as well. When a man can no longer protect his own, it be best not to offer protection to others.</string>
<string name="1357">Well, there has been some trouble from the wee scaly folk, but there always be trouble from one group of monsters or another. We defend what be ours, with little worry for them.</string>
<string name="1358">Aye, there has been some trouble from the wee scaly folk, but there always be trouble from one group of monsters or another. We defend what be ours, with little worry for them.</string>
<string name="1359">The reason this be a dark time is that me daughter, Becka, has been kidnapped and I cannot leave me pregnant wife, who be so close to term. </string>
<string name="1360">The babe could come at any moment, but I swear to Chauntea, when the child is born, it shall have hill giant for supper. That drunken oaf Rumgut will rue the day he turned to villainy.</string>
<string name="1361">If ye happen across a hill giant cave, be sure to kill him swiftly and free me girl, Becka. I can promise ye a reward, though not much, I fear.</string>
<string name="1362">Aye, go right ahead. I don&apos;t promise ye no answers though. Too much on me mind to be thinkin&apos; of ought else.</string>
<string name="1363">Will ye help me with me daughter, Becka, or are ye too hard of heart to care.</string>
<string name="1364">I hope ye will find me daughter soon. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1365">It is to the west of here. Just keep your eyes open and ye shan&apos;t have much trouble finding it.</string>
<string name="1366">Aye, Chauntea might be human, but she represents all that I have become, so I invoke her name when I mean somethin&apos; to be true.</string>
<string name="1367">She favors farmers and fertility, two things I quite depend on in me newest profession. There be precious few dwarven farmers, and damned few Duergar ones, but I figure she&apos;ll have me.</string>
<string name="1368">I changed me name, for safety reasons. Some of me kin were huntin&apos; me and I figured that takin&apos; a human name might throw them off the trail. So far it seems to have worked.</string>
<string name="1369">Tis a long and unpleasant story, let me assure ye. Drogan and I started off as enemies and we fought several times before we ended up in a situation where we were forced to work together.</string>
<string name="1370">I will not tell ye all the details, but we ended up trapped in a tomb with a bloody lich. The cursed thing would have killed us both, but we managed to escape by settin&apos; aside our differences.</string>
<string name="1371">It was Drogan who convinced me that there could be a better life than the one my race has chosen. Times have been rough, but I have no regrets now. That be all I have to say. Anything else?</string>
<string name="1372">I never asked ye to care! I was merely speakin&apos; me mind out-loud. So, since ye seem bored by me tale of woe, ye might as well be gone. But I will tell ye one thing.</string>
<string name="1373">Ach, there be this hill giant called Rumgut, on account of his serious drinking habits. Despite bein&apos; a bit strange, he actually made a fair neighbor, as he never got along with goblins. </string>
<string name="1374">Never had any serious problems with him until now. Two days ago I be milkin&apos; me cows when all of a sudden I hear me daughter screamin&apos;. </string>
<string name="1375">I go runnin&apos; just in time to see Rumgut run off with a sack over his shoulder. He took her to his cave which is somewhere in the hills to the west. Would ye be willin&apos; to help me poor child?</string>
<string name="1376">Ye should watch your tongue, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I am in the kind of mood where I would cut it out with nary a pang of guilt.</string>
<string name="1377">Now be off with ye. I do not need your kind of black thinkin&apos; around here.</string>
<string name="1378">That be as I feared. Let me just say that if ye do happen to find yourself in Rumgut&apos;s cave, if ye save me daughter I can promise ye a reward.</string>
<string name="1379">If ye do not, then it shall fall upon me own shoulders, just as soon as me babe be birthed.</string>
<string name="1380">Aye, I hope ye have a change of heart, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="1381">I can offer ye a reward, though I will have to think on what I can give. I have little gold these days. Still, I shall think of something worthy of me daughter&apos;s rescuer.</string>
<string name="1382">I see that Drogan has trained a fine, young &lt;lad/lass&gt;, indeed. Go to the west and ye shall find his cave. </string>
<string name="1383">Be careful though. He might not be the smartest fellow, but he still be strong, like all his kind.</string>
<string name="1384">I remember seeing you with Drogan one night, about six months ago. I was quickly bored by your discussion of agriculture; a dull topic for a famous adventurer.</string>
<string name="1385">Xanos, I remember that. You interrupted one of our fireside conversations. We were speaking of you and the other pupils, not real agriculture. Drogan thought he had found a good &quot;crop&quot; of seeds in you four.</string>
<string name="1386">I remember seeing you with Drogan one night, about six months ago. You were discussing planting and harvesting, which seemed an odd topic for someone like Drogan.</string>
<string name="1387">Ah, Dorna, yes, you interrupted one of our fireside conversations. We were speaking of you and the other pupils, not real agriculture. Drogan thought he had found a good &quot;crop&quot; of seeds in you four.</string>
<string name="1388">Ah, me little girl has come back to me and she tells me that I have ye to thank for it. Do not be thinking that I do not recognize how hard ye worked for it.</string>
<string name="1389">I have a reward for ye. A little something I picked up in me old adventurin&apos; days. Try this on for size and see if it be a worthy gift.</string>
<string name="1390">Ye will always be welcome in me little home. If ever ye need a safe haven to rest, just come on back, me friend.</string>
<string name="1391">You are a right, fine &lt;lad/lass&gt;, and ye always have a welcome in this home.</string>
<string name="1392">How dare ye threaten me little girl! That act will be the last of ye, I promise ye that!</string>
<string name="1393">Leave me be, that I might grieve for me daughter. And if ye would do a kindness, pray that me second child be born healthy and strong.</string>
<string name="1394">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1395">I am trying.</string>
<string name="1396">Your daughter is dead.</string>
<string name="1397">Explain what happened. </string>
<string name="1398">I have decided to help you. </string>
<string name="1399">I want to ask you some questions. </string>
<string name="1400">I didn&apos;t say I would help you.</string>
<string name="1401">Aren&apos;t you one of the dwarven race known as the Duergar?</string>
<string name="1402">You lie; I know all about Duergar and their evil ways.</string>
<string name="1403">I am Drogan&apos;s pupil and he never mentioned you. </string>
<string name="1404">Well, as a matter of fact, I know Drogan well.</string>
<string name="1405">You have no need of a name. I am simply passing through.</string>
<string name="1406">Recognize a friend by &lt;his/her&gt; face; words can be lies.</string>
<string name="1407">The people of Hilltop know me as &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1408">I am &lt;FirstName&gt;, a pupil of Drogan&apos;s back in Hilltop.</string>
<string name="1409">I&apos;ll just take what I want off your corpse then.</string>
<string name="1410">No trouble, good Master Hurst. I am not here to stay.</string>
<string name="1411">What is bothering you so greatly?</string>
<string name="1412">Have you been bothered by the kobolds too?</string>
<string name="1413">Good luck and goodbye.</string>
<string name="1414">I just want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="1415">That&apos;s all my questions.</string>
<string name="1416">Where is the hill giant&apos;s cave?</string>
<string name="1417">Why did you mention Chauntea? Isn&apos;t she a human goddess?</string>
<string name="1418">What kind of name is Nathan, for a dwarf?</string>
<string name="1419">How did you, a Duergar, come to live on the surface?</string>
<string name="1420">I don&apos;t care about your troubles.</string>
<string name="1421">Tell me more, perhaps I could help.</string>
<string name="1422">Forget it. She&apos;s probably already been roasted on a spit.</string>
<string name="1423">I have my own problems.</string>
<string name="1424">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1425">I changed my mind. I will help you.</string>
<string name="1426">Is there a reward?</string>
<string name="1427">I can help you.</string>
<string name="1428">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Whispers]&lt;/Start&gt; Please, ye have got to help me! I must get out of here. The stench alone is almost enough to kill me.</string>
<string name="1429">No, do nae hurt him. He is nae evil, just misguided. He has actually treated me fair. He also helps protect the lands around here from goblins and kobolds.</string>
<string name="1430">I mean, if ye have to kill him, then I suppose I can live with that, but I would surely like it if ye would try another way first.</string>
<string name="1431">My name be Becka. I be the daughter of a farmer who owns a small homestead not too far from here.</string>
<string name="1432">I was out doin&apos; me chores, when Rumgut comes runnin&apos; up, grabs me and throws me over his shoulder and carries me up here.</string>
<string name="1433">He had never done us any harm before, but for some reason he got it in his fool head that he just had to have a wife. And since I be the only female around these parts, I was the unlucky pick.</string>
<string name="1434">I do nae wish to be a bother, but I would rather not spend me life here, serving a drunken giant.</string>
<string name="1435">Me father would surely give ye a reward for settin&apos; me free. I have nothin&apos; to give ye, meself.</string>
<string name="1436">He be attached to me somethin&apos; awful, but perhaps you could persuade him to let me go, or perhaps get him drunk. He does drink many a bottle of rum.</string>
<string name="1437">Good luck.</string>
<string name="1438">No...&lt;StartAction&gt;[sob...sob]&lt;/Start&gt; Please, do somethin&apos;. Anythin&apos;.</string>
<string name="1439">I suppose that if ye leave and wait for his next meal. I can cook him a big pot of kobold stew. He do be very susceptible to falling asleep after supper. Ye would have to be very quiet though.</string>
<string name="1440">What do ye mean a special powder? Like a poison? I would nae want to kill him. I am sure I can get him to sleep without it.</string>
<string name="1441">Ye be the rescuer, I suppose I must follow your lead, whether I agree with it or no. I will take your powder then.</string>
<string name="1442">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, as long as he will no be hurt, a little extra caution be the smart way to go. I will take your powder then.</string>
<string name="1443">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Choking powder destroyed.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1444">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I will take this. Leave and allow me to make the meal and then return.</string>
<string name="1445">Well, ye be free and I be in here. I am afraid I be out of great ideas. See if ye can come up with somethin&apos; better.</string>
<string name="1446">Alright, I will add as much seasoning as possible, to make him gorge himself. Remember, be silent when ye return and come speak quietly with me. I will tell ye where he puts the keys.</string>
<string name="1447">What are ye doin&apos; back here? Are ye mad? Rumgut will get suspicious.</string>
<string name="1448">Yes. Please do.</string>
<string name="1449">I can nae believe ye came stompin&apos; in here like a bloody ogre and woke him up. The point of our little exercise was for you to sneak in here.</string>
<string name="1450">I can nae believe ye got yourself thrown in here with me. When I first saw ye, I thought a rescuer had come at last. Now you be just another mouth to feed, or maybe the next main dish.</string>
<string name="1451">So how do ye imagine we will get out of this little predicament, might I ask?</string>
<string name="1452">Ahhh! A rat! Kill it, kill it!</string>
<string name="1453">Ah... you be right. I thought that the rocks over there were just from a bit of a cave in. I never thought to check them out.</string>
<string name="1454">Ah... I do nae know. I thought that the rocks over there were just from a bit of a cave in. I never thought to check them out.</string>
<string name="1455">First, kill the rat, please.</string>
<string name="1456">Ah, fine. I will put up with the rat, if there is the possibility we can escape.</string>
<string name="1457">I hate rats! They are so dirty and they bite. Oh, please just kill it!</string>
<string name="1458">Oh, thank you. Check where it came from too. Maybe there be hope after all.</string>
<string name="1459">When I saw ye were a fellow dwarf, and male to boot, I began to get all sorts of romantic notions in me head. Ah, what a fool-headed lass I turned out to be, as me father would say.</string>
<string name="1460">Please, let us hurry and get out of here.</string>
<string name="1461">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Whispers]&lt;/Start&gt; Thank ye, but please hurry and open the gate.</string>
<string name="1462">Good, please be quick.</string>
<string name="1463">What? Nae now! Once we are out of here, then we can speak. Hurry &lt;man/woman&gt;!</string>
<string name="1464">I will follow ye down there. It can nae be any worse than staying here with the stench of old Rumgut.</string>
<string name="1465">Thank ye for savin&apos; me life. I thought I was goin&apos; to be stuck, married to that giant with his huge belly and tiny mind forever.</string>
<string name="1466">If ye go to me father&apos;s farm in the east, I assure ye, he will want to thank ye and give ye a reward.</string>
<string name="1467">What? But... but... no! How could that be? He was fine the last I saw him!</string>
<string name="1468">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; That is a hard jest to stomach. I do nae wish to be near ye. Come to my father and he will give ye a reward.</string>
<string name="1469">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Ye... ye lie. I can see it in your eyes. Ye killed me father and now ye would kill me.</string>
<string name="1470">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; No! I... I will go and find out who did this. I will track them down! They will pay, I swear on me life, they will pay!</string>
<string name="1471">I will kill ye, horrid beast!</string>
<string name="1472">Well, we be out of the giant&apos;s grasp, what other trouble could there be?</string>
<string name="1473">No! I shall not go from horror to another. You horrid beast!</string>
<string name="1474">I cannot let you terrorize this child, a kin of mine, any more. Let her go.</string>
<string name="1475">I think we could use the reward more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. She would only slow us down.</string>
<string name="1476">You... oh, ye two must be joking. That&apos;s not very funny though. Come see my father and you will get your reward.</string>
<string name="1477">Thank ye again, kind &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I did need to be gone from there.</string>
<string name="1478">I can nae ever thank ye enough for the rescue, me friend. Should ye ever come back this way, I do hope ye will stop in and have some good cheer with us.</string>
<string name="1479">Thank Vergadain, Rumgut finally passed out. Now hurry, I saw him drop the key to the cage over by his mat.</string>
<string name="1480">Rumgut... he is nae sleepin&apos;; he be dead! Ye tricked me into killin&apos; the creature. Ye should have told me what would happen. T&apos;was a wicked thing, killin&apos; the fool giant.</string>
<string name="1481">Let us get out of here quickly. I nae want to see his corpse lyin&apos; there.</string>
<string name="1482">I wish Rumgut had cooperated and just let me go. I had no desire to see him dead, but even less to remain here. I think he might have carried the key to the cage or its over by his mat.</string>
<string name="1483">I&apos;ll have nothing further to do with ye.</string>
<string name="1484">Thank ye for savin&apos; me life. I thought I was goin&apos; to be stuck, married to that giant with his huge belly and tiny mind forever.</string>
<string name="1485">If ye go to me father&apos;s farm in the east, I assure ye, he will want to thank ye and give ye a reward.</string>
<string name="1486">Right, I will just kill him.</string>
<string name="1487">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1488">Let me see what I can do.</string>
<string name="1489">What is it worth for me to do this?</string>
<string name="1490">What am I supposed to do with the giant right there?</string>
<string name="1491">I&apos;ll be right back.</string>
<string name="1492">That might work, but it might not. Any other possibilities?</string>
<string name="1493">Actually I have some special powder &lt;StartHighlight&gt;[choking powder]&lt;/Start&gt; here.  I could give you some to put into his food. </string>
<string name="1494">Do it my way, or I won&apos;t help you!</string>
<string name="1495">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; It won&apos;t hurt him, it will just help him sleep.</string>
<string name="1496">I changed my mind. Let&apos;s try it your way. </string>
<string name="1497">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Craft Trap]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Use choking powder to make a poison.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1498">Let&apos;s try it your way then. </string>
<string name="1499">I don&apos;t like that plan. I think we should try something else.</string>
<string name="1500">Let&apos;s give that a try.</string>
<string name="1501">Right. I&apos;ll be back later.</string>
<string name="1502">What am I supposed to do again? </string>
<string name="1503">Fine, I&apos;ll go kill it. </string>
<string name="1504">That wasn&apos;t in here a second ago.</string>
<string name="1505">Where did it come from though?</string>
<string name="1506">I&apos;ll go look, but I won&apos;t kill the rat.</string>
<string name="1507">Why do I have to kill the rat?</string>
<string name="1508">Alright.</string>
<string name="1509">I&apos;ll get it.</string>
<string name="1510">Maybe we should talk first.</string>
<string name="1511">Your father is dead.</string>
<string name="1512">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, bad joke. He&apos;s fine.</string>
<string name="1513">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t know how it happened.</string>
<string name="1514">I had to kill him. Now, back to business.</string>
<string name="1515">Who said you were safe?  </string>
<string name="1516">You are right. I will meet you at your father&apos;s farm. </string>
<string name="1517">I think I would like to kill you now. </string>
<string name="1518">There is a reward a young, female like you could give me. </string>
<string name="1519">I think I could use a personal slave.</string>
<string name="1520">I will meet you there then.</string>
<string name="1521">Ah, what I would give for a nice jug of dwarven ale! I will never have another child again, I swear it!</string>
<string name="1522">A week overdue! When will this child come?</string>
<string name="1523">Gah! I have known cows who weighed less than I do now! This is why I did nae want another child for so long.</string>
<string name="1524">My husband will nae tell me what is going on. He wishes not to worry me, but I am sick with worry, nonetheless.</string>
<string name="1525">Me precious daughter! Where be me daughter?</string>
<string name="1526">Ah, I want this child out of me! I am so sick of being this heavy and awkward.</string>
<string name="1527">Ah, it be so good of ye to have brought Becka back to us. Now she can help me have this child.</string>
<string name="1528">I can feel something be wrong with me daughter. I think her life has passed from this mortal coil.</string>
<string name="1529">Ye are evil, pure and true. Ye shall pay for your deeds!</string>
<string name="1530">The pure white stag stares at you, its flanks heaving, and its thoughts skittish. The one thought that stands out is an image that is quickly translated into a name, Shadow Hart.</string>
<string name="1531">The stag watches you go nervously.</string>
<string name="1532">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[The stag calms down and tilts its head slightly, in a friendly gesture.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1533">The stag gazes at you curiously. It seems unsure of what you want.</string>
<string name="1534">The stag gives its head a shake, snorts and eyes you to see if you have anything else to say.</string>
<string name="1535">The stag dips its head and forequarters in an attempt at a bow, then bounds away.</string>
<string name="1536">It snorts and paws the air, showing you a spot of blood on its hooves. Obviously it is no friend to what it considers annoying, little reptiles.</string>
<string name="1537">The stag stares at you, not comprehending your question. To it, all creatures are separated into those who hunt and those who are hunted. It clearly views itself in the second category.</string>
<string name="1538">Images and feelings brush your mind: cold wastes, peopled by barbarians and shadowy wolves, as well as creatures of myth that have not been seen on this plane of existence for millennia.</string>
<string name="1539">More: fear of large open spaces, where packs of hunters and dogs drag their prey into the ground; love of the close, shadows of the trees, with the protection and shelter they offer.</string>
<string name="1540">And the last image, the strongest image, a giant tree, with green energy pulsing out, like nothing you have ever encountered before.</string>
<string name="1541">The image of the tree comes clearer to the stag&apos;s mind. Creatures of all sorts surround the tree and bask in its magical radiance, filled with a sense of safety and joy.</string>
<string name="1542">Then the tree grows dark and brittle and the creatures begin to war on each other. The tree shatters and the stag is no longer sure where it is. </string>
<string name="1543">This world is a foreign place, where the stag has been stranded for centuries. The images fade and the stag looks at you with watery eyes.</string>
<string name="1544">The stag allows you to touch it, emanating a sense of peace, before bounding off.</string>
<string name="1545">The stag calmly watches you approach. Just as you move to attack its eyes grow large and frightened.</string>
<string name="1546">The Shadow Hart regards you warmly and you feel a deeper connection with the earth, then it quickly disappears. Something inside your soul tells you that Shadowhart is now safe.</string>
<string name="1547">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Walk away.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1548">Run Shadow Hart, hunters are near.</string>
<string name="1549">Be calm. I am a friend.</string>
<string name="1550">May I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="1551">That&apos;s all the questions I have.</string>
<string name="1552">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1553">Have you seen any kobolds?</string>
<string name="1554">What are you?</string>
<string name="1555">Where do you come from?</string>
<string name="1556">What was this tree?</string>
<string name="1557">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Calmly approach the stag, and touch its forehead.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1558">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Calmly approach the stag, then attack it.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1559">You are being hunted, Shadow Hart. You must flee these lands.</string>
<string name="1560">What can I do for you today, my friend?</string>
<string name="1561">Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;, my friend.  As you can see, we have a lot of unpacking to do.  Fortunately, I was able to find some &apos;help&apos;. Was there anything you wanted?</string>
<string name="1562">Then I shall see you again soon, I hope. Good bye, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1563">Mmm, an excellent specimen, and it seems to have some magical properties. Still, it would need to be used by the right craftsman to make it into something useable.</string>
<string name="1564">I once saw something very similar, made by a kobold of all things. It is unfortunate that I do not know any kobold craftsmen, but I imagine my contacts in Thay might know what to do with it.</string>
<string name="1565">The tooth is powerful, yet it will cost me a good sum of gold to transform it into something useful. The best I can offer you is 500 gold.</string>
<string name="1566">Ha! Just in case you run into a kobold craftsman? Good luck. Anything else?</string>
<string name="1567">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, there is too much risk involved. What if I cannot find anyone to shape it into something useful? 500 gold, or nothing, that is the best I can do.</string>
<string name="1568">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I can always just raise the end price of the product. I just hope I do not lose money on this deal. 700 gold is the best I can offer.</string>
<string name="1569">Excellent. I will get this back to Thay immediately and see if I can find a craftsman to work with it.</string>
<string name="1570">Excellent. I will get this back to Thay immediately and see if I can find a craftsman to work with it. Was there anything else?</string>
<string name="1571">You would try to sell me a broken artifact? I am so disappointed in you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I thought we had a good thing going here, and then you would try to cheat me?</string>
<string name="1572">I am not interested in garbage, even if it was once valuable. Broken magic is dangerous magic. Was there anything else; maybe something not broken?</string>
<string name="1573">That is an unusual artifact, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Are you sure you wish to part with it? I can offer you 1000 gold for it, but I am not sure that it is not worth more than that.</string>
<string name="1574">It would take someone with more arcane knowledge than I possess, to tell you the exact value and properties of this item.</string>
<string name="1575">Probably a wise decision, though I am curious about what it might be capable of. I do not think I would be anxious for someone like Szazz Tam to get a hold of it.</string>
<string name="1576">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; I am afraid not. I can only offer you 1000 gold.</string>
<string name="1577">Very well, I shall take it off your hands. I wonder who might be interested in buying this? Perhaps my mistress? Maybe I will make it a gift to her.</string>
<string name="1578">But enough of this prattle. I worry that I go on so at my age. Imagine how annoying I will be when I get old and never shut up. What else can I do for you?</string>
<string name="1579">I see that you have a keen eye for valuable artifacts. I am sure that there are many who would be interested in purchasing this item.</string>
<string name="1580">I can offer you 1000 gold for it.</string>
<string name="1581">That is unfortunate. But such is life. Anything else?</string>
<string name="1582">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I can offer you no more than that, I am afraid. 1000 gold is the best I can do.</string>
<string name="1583">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I might cut my own profits a bit, or maybe I will just charge more for it. I can go as high as 1200 gold.</string>
<string name="1584">An excellent trade, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Together, you and I could go far. Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="1585">An excellent trade, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Together, you and I could go far. Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="1586">&lt;FirstName&gt;, you never fail to surprise me. There is a great market for such things in Thay. I could offer you 700 gold, or an interesting magic item I recently acquired.</string>
<string name="1587">The item is a cloak that belonged to a friend of mine in Thay. When we were young and in school together, his cloak came in quite handy, as the blue glow it gave off protected us from a firetrap.</string>
<string name="1588">The trap was supposed to seal off the pleasure slave area from the younger students. Needless to say, our education was that much superior to our classmates. So which would you prefer?</string>
<string name="1589">Holding out for a better bargain? Well, I doubt you will find one, but good luck. Anything else?</string>
<string name="1590">Though I am loath to part with it, I have no need for it either. I am pleased that we could do business once again. Is there anything else you would like?</string>
<string name="1591">700 gold it is. I am pleased that we could do business once again. Is there anything else you would like?</string>
<string name="1592">What are you speaking of my friend? What do you have there?</string>
<string name="1593">A baby? Azuth take me, what kind of trouble are you trying to bring down upon me, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Are you honestly offering me a local child as a slave?</string>
<string name="1594">You are a strange &lt;lad/lass&gt;, but I still like you. I really do. Please, do not strain our friendship like that again though.</string>
<string name="1595">Ha! I start to like you more and more, my fine, young friend. It will cost me to raise a child, not to mention to keep the townspeople from noticing, I shall have to send it back to my estates in Thay.</string>
<string name="1596">But to prove to you my absolute loyalty to our friendship I will offer you 500 gold. Do not ask for more, for I am being far more than generous.</string>
<string name="1597">Then the child is yours. I do not know what you shall do with it, but when it cries at midnight and one and two and three in the morning, remember the offer I made in friendship.</string>
<string name="1598">A wise choice, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Mutual admiration is the way a friendship blossoms, good friend. I have the greatest of respect for you.</string>
<string name="1599">When the caravans begin to arrive, then I will have proper supplies. Unfortunately, I have only a few things to offer you, but I will give you great prices.</string>
<string name="1600">Nothing thanks.</string>
<string name="1601">Would you like to buy this dragon&apos;s tooth?</string>
<string name="1602">Maybe I will just hang on to it.</string>
<string name="1603">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; It must be worth more than that!</string>
<string name="1604">I&apos;ll take it.</string>
<string name="1605">I&apos;ll take it.</string>
<string name="1606">Would you like to buy this tower statue?</string>
<string name="1607">Would you like to buy this mummified hand?</string>
<string name="1608">I guess not.</string>
<string name="1609">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Can you not offer me more for it?</string>
<string name="1610">Alright, deal.</string>
<string name="1611">I don&apos;t care. I just want the gold.</string>
<string name="1612">Would you like to buy this magical mask?</string>
<string name="1613">I guess not.</string>
<string name="1614">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This is a very valuable item. Surely you can offer me more?</string>
<string name="1615">I&apos;ll take it.</string>
<string name="1616">I&apos;ll take it.</string>
<string name="1617">Would you be interested in a dragon&apos;s egg?</string>
<string name="1618">Neither thanks.</string>
<string name="1619">I will take the cloak.</string>
<string name="1620">I will take the gold.</string>
<string name="1621">Would you like to buy a slave?</string>
<string name="1622">No, I was just testing you.</string>
<string name="1623">Uh... maybe? </string>
<string name="1624">Yes. If you have the right price.</string>
<string name="1625">I don&apos;t think so.</string>
<string name="1626">I will take it.</string>
<string name="1627">May I see what you have for sale?</string>
<string name="1628">T&apos;is a better life out here than back in Thay.</string>
<string name="1629">A large group of creatures passed through this area recently, according to the tracks.</string>
<string name="1630">A large group of humanoids came from the forest and headed towards the road not long ago. According to the tracks, they took the same route back.</string>
<string name="1631">A large group of gnolls, perhaps three dozen, followed this path out of the forest towards the road not long ago. About half that many gnolls returned by the same route later. The tracks indicate that they took with them perhaps half a dozen kobolds... perhaps prisoners?</string>
<string name="1632">The small humanoid tracks in the area are numerous and scattered. They seem to head in every direction, almost.</string>
<string name="1633">There are many small humanoid tracks seemingly running to and fro in the area... probably belonging to kobolds. There seem to be far more of the older tracks heading towards Hilltop than returning to the mountains in the north.</string>
<string name="1634">There are scatterings of many small humanoid tracks in the area... kobold tracks, without a doubt. The older and more numerous tracks head towards Hilltop. A much smaller number head north, back towards the mountains, and those tracks seem to indicate the kobolds were running or fleeing at the time.</string>
<string name="1635">There is a scattering of small humanoid tracks... probably kobold... heading in this direction. You suspect that these kobolds fled from the battle nearby.</string>
<string name="1636">A large group of humanoids came from the forest and headed towards the road not long ago. According to the tracks, they took the same route back.</string>
<string name="1637">It is obvious from the tracks that a group of kobolds fled the battle at some point and ran in this direction. There appears to have been little pursuit by any other creatures.</string>
<string name="1638">&lt;StartAction&gt;[There is an old inscription on this pillar. The language is unfamiliar, but further study could possibly reveal its nature.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1639">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[The inscriptions appear to be in the elven tongue, describing the history of the fallen city, Ascalhorn.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1640">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Though you discern that the writing is some form of story or history for a city called &quot;Ascalhorn&quot;, you cannot make out the details.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1641">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[The inscriptions appear to be in the elven tongue, describing the history of the fallen city, Ascalhorn.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1642">&lt;StartAction&gt;[The words inscribed on this pillar are in the elven tongue, describing the history of the fallen city, Ascalhorn.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1643">&quot;All together, come and mourn,
For our fair city, Ascalhorn.&quot;</string>
<string name="1644">&quot;Like a crowning jewel was Ascalhorn, for proud Earlan, her beauty borne.
Yet even at the height of power, when we ascended like a tower,
And other lands most jealous grew, still we sought to prove us true,
For mastery over ancient force.&quot;</string>
<string name="1645">&quot;We looked at the growing race of man, and fear of weakness through us ran,
Reaching down to Shadow&apos;s heart, for greater forces than our art,
But like reaching out to touch the sun, we were burned, our strength undone,
And evil through our city did course.&quot;</string>
<string name="1646">&quot;So, for the evil that we had become, it was up to us to make undone,
We tore it down and slew our kin, and in blood and death repaid our sin,
We are the traitors and the faithful, and in death we lay here shameful,
Forever shall our souls feel this remorse.&quot;</string>
<string name="1647">&quot;May those who come upon our sleeping, do not waste your time in weeping,
For evil done and good repaid, we hope our lives a balance made,
And do not harshly judge us now; we gave our all, best we knew how;
But all together, come and mourn, for our fair city, Ascalhorn.&quot;</string>
<string name="1648">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Leave the pillar alone.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="1652">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Read the history.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1653">Squeak... Squeak...</string>
<string name="1654">As your mind brushes against theirs, you discover the bat&apos;s love for the crypt as a home, and their anger at a recent intrusion of small, scaly lizard-like creatures.</string>
<string name="1655">You also get a sense of revulsion from an image of something that stalks the bats. Things with great hunger and nimble legs.</string>
<string name="1656">The bats seem to marvel at your presence near their minds; then they lose interest and begin to hunt for insects again.</string>
<string name="1657">The strange squeaking of the bats increases as they nimbly dive and catch the crumbs out of the air.</string>
<string name="1658">You suddenly feel the presence of a very old bat, one that has lived well beyond the years of a normal rodent. Its mind comes to you clearer than the other bats&apos;.</string>
<string name="1659">You see a door at the bottom of the steps and beyond the door you feel a powerful presence of benevolence and duty. The old bat then leaves your mind, but with a clear feeling of friendship.</string>
<string name="1660">You see great bloated creatures on eight legs, slipping through the darkness. It quickly becomes obvious that giant spiders have made a nest in the lower levels.</string>
<string name="1661">You see a large number of kobolds entering the crypts and descending to the lower level, where the bats seldom venture. They obviously fear something else down there.</string>
<string name="1662">Thank you. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1663">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Throw a few crumbs of food to the bats.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1664">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Focus on the hunters.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1665">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Focus on the kobolds.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="1667">&quot;Damnable elves! Death awaits on path. Should have walked on the oth...&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Apparently he died before he could finish.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1668">Oh... wrenched from the darkness of death... where has it gone... can feel it close... so close, yet gone... </string>
<string name="1669">Oh... you are different from the last one... but you have nothing to take from me... not anymore... Isande is all but forgotten... now I am defiled...</string>

<string name="1679">My sword... now I can rest... at last... this could be helpful for you...choose one item from my chest... with my gratitude.</string>
<string name="1680">Now, back to the darkness....</string>
<string name="1681">What disturbs your rest, spirit? </string>
<string name="1682">What is gone?</string>
<string name="1683">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1684">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1685">May I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="1686">What was stolen from you?</string>
<string name="1687">I have too much to do already. Sorry. </string>
<string name="1688">What does the sword look like?</string>
<string name="1689">Who stole your sword?</string>
<string name="1690">Do you want me to find it?</string>
<string name="1691">I will be going then.</string>
<string name="1692">Not yet.</string>
<string name="1693">Is this your sword, spirit?</string>
<string name="1694">Is Gnoll! Kill it! Kill it!</string>
<string name="1695">Not Gnoll! Kill anyway!</string>
<string name="1696">Kip, kip, you no talks to me. You talks to boss! Urko, him be good boss, kip!</string>
<string name="1697">Is gnoll! We die now! AHHH!!</string>
<string name="1698">Is not gnoll! You be so stupid!</string>
<string name="1699">Oh? We watches you! We watches you very close! Kip kip!!</string>
<string name="1700">Yip. Who be you? You be gnoll? You comes to kill us? We barricades door, so you not gets in! Yip yip!</string>
<string name="1701">Grrrr..... no! Yip yip! We be safes in here! You go away!</string>
<string name="1702">Urko in charge, yip. But he be at back of room and me is here in charge of door! Now you answers questions! Yip! Who be you and what you wants?</string>
<string name="1703">Hmmm... you not sounds like gnoll... but how me knows me can trusts you, yip? There be lots things down here that tries to kills us! Maybe... maybe you be skeleton!</string>
<string name="1704">Ummm... that be true, so you not be skeleton, me guesses. Maybe you be giant talking spider! Me gets in big trouble if me lets in big, bad spider!</string>
<string name="1705">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No! Yip yip! You maybe skeleton that come because we touches old bodies and steals stuff! You not comes in!</string>
<string name="1706">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well... me guesses me can lets you in. But you better not tries to kills us! We not needs more enemies, no no. Yip!</string>
<string name="1707">Me unlocks door and you then steps away. You come and speaks to Urko... he at back of room. But you puts weapons away! If you pulls weapons, you dies!</string>
<string name="1708">Me not hears skeletons talk, so you not skeleton, probably. Maybe you be giant talking spider! Me gets in big trouble if me lets in big, bad spider!</string>
<string name="1709">Yip! It be my job to keeps door close and room safe! Me not just lets anybody in, you knows! </string>
<string name="1710">That make sense, me thinking. Me thinks you might be okays, maybe.</string>

<string name="1716">Yip yip! Me tells you to put weapons away! Now you dies! Yip yip yip!</string>
<string name="1717">Open the door now, or I&apos;ll break it down and kill you all.</string>
<string name="1718">Who is in charge in there?</string>
<string name="1719">I am &lt;FullName&gt; and I would speak with your leader. </string>
<string name="1720">I am not a gnoll. I am &lt;FirstName&gt; and I just want to talk.</string>
<string name="1721">Skeletons do not talk, stupid kobold!</string>
<string name="1722">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Just open the door and you will see that I am no enemy.</string>
<string name="1723">I am not a skeleton.</string>
<string name="1724">How stupid are you? Just open the damn door!</string>
<string name="1725">If I was a talking spider, I would web the door and wait for you to come out for food.</string>
<string name="1726">I am not a spider either. I am not here to kill you.</string>
<string name="1727">Grrr! Gets out now!</string>
<string name="1728">Aiiiee! Yip yip!</string>
<string name="1729">Yip! Me not wants to die!</string>
<string name="1730">All fleshy peoples should die!</string>
<string name="1731">You be careful or you be dead! Yip yip!</string>
<string name="1732">Me friend no likes you, yip!</string>
<string name="1733">Yip! Me no likes you!</string>
<string name="1734">Grrr! Gets it now!</string>
<string name="1735">Aiiiee! Yip yip!</string>
<string name="1736">Me not wants to die!</string>
<string name="1737">Die, die!</string>
<string name="1738">Grrr! Yip yip!</string>
<string name="1739">Kill it! Kill it!</string>
<string name="1740">Me kills you good!</string>
<string name="1741">Beware, mortal, for you trespass within the tomb of Nilmaldor, Knight-Gallant of Ascalhorn. Why have you come? Looting shall earn you only the foulest of curses to destroy your very soul.</string>
<string name="1742">But if you come with a heart of courage, then I welcome you and would speak with you for a turn.</string>
<string name="1743">Everything that happens here is my concern, mortal. If you do not wish to speak, so be it... but tread with care. You walk in halls that will not be defiled lightly.</string>
<string name="1744">I am no foul fiend come to haunt a murder, if that is what you ask. I am the guardian spirit of this crypt. It is my duty and my honor to watch over the dead of my people.</string>
<string name="1745">In life, I was a warrior of rank and privilege. The price was this eternal duty, and I accepted it willingly. But my duty has been foiled, so now here I remain in this single chamber.</string>
<string name="1746">I am unable to protect the rest of my brethren, for I have been driven from the rest of the tombs, but perhaps you might be willing to assist me?</string>
<string name="1747">I sense that you come here seeking an artifact of power, carried by the foul kobolds who have invaded this restful place.</string>
<string name="1748">You agreed to vanquish the spiders that infest the western crypt. All of the spiders and their egg sacs must be destroyed, but I sense the deed has not yet been done.</string>
<string name="1749">Ask what questions you have and I shall strive to answer them. This is not a place of urgency, as you can well imagine.</string>
<string name="1750">They have barricaded themselves in the southeast crypts. What they plan to do, I have no idea, but they show great fear with each movement.</string>
<string name="1751">They are cunning creatures... they learned quickly not to loot the corpses of my brethren, for then the warriors arise and do battle. Few thieves have survived the justice of the dead.</string>
<string name="1752">Still, the ugly creatures have no sense of respect and they defile our sanctuary. It would be good to have them gone from this place as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="1753">Eons ago, Ascalhorn was the crown jewel and capitol of the realm of Earlan. We were a proud and powerful nation of the fair folk.</string>
<string name="1754">I would rather not speak of the details, but our people sought power they should not have and in so doing corrupted all that was once graceful and beautiful.</string>
<string name="1755">Being a practitioner of the arcane arts yourself, I am sure you understand how the pursuit of power for its own sake can corrupt even the purest of souls. Such was the case with Ascalhorn.</string>
<string name="1756">But as we watched the human race grow in strength, our rulers became jealous and sought to further their power through the pursuit of the darkest arts. It corrupted all that was once beautiful.</string>
<string name="1757">We who are buried here are those elves of Ascalhorn who turned against our masters and burned our fair city by our own hands. We are betrayers and saviors both, and here we lie forgotten.</string>
<string name="1758">And so we do. We would not see fair Ascalhorn turned into a tyranny of evil and darkness; we could not bear it.</string>
<string name="1759">Stronger than our desire to not see fair Ascalhorn turned into a tyranny over man and elves both? What we did was to preserve all others as much as what was good in ourselves.</string>
<string name="1760">Perhaps so. I would rather have Ascalhorn remembered for what it once was, but that shall never be.</string>
<string name="1761">Many lives were lost, but none of them innocent. Such is the price we paid for our pride. My only hope is that the gods one day forgive us our folly.</string>
<string name="1762">Is there anything else you would like to know?</string>
<string name="1763">I am the guardian of this crypt, mortal. It is my eternal duty and my honor to watch over the dead of my people.</string>
<string name="1764">I felt their fearful passing a short time ago, and they remain within the crypt still. Know that they have caused great mischief and destruction here... I would be eager to have them gone.</string>
<string name="1765">I would consider it a boon, in fact, should you remove the vermin. Indeed, if you are willing to render me assistance, I believe I can even provide you a simple manner to accomplish that feat.</string>
<string name="1766">An age ago, a malevolent wraith invaded our crypt. I did battle with the creature and destroyed it, but not before it weakened me greatly.</string>
<string name="1767">Ever since I have been forced to remain close to my own remains. I cannot roam the crypt freely as I once did... and this means I cannot perform my duty.</string>
<string name="1768">Living creatures... giant spiders, in fact... have infested one of the western tombs. They have damaged much and I can do nothing.</string>
<string name="1769">If you be bold enough to destroy these spiders and their egg sacs, mortal, I would be more than willing to aid you with the kobolds.</string>
<string name="1770">If you refer to wealth, then there is little I can do for you. What possessions the dead keep in this hallowed place are not for you. All I can offer is to assist you with your goal.</string>
<string name="1771">I see. Should you have a change of heart, mortal, then speak to me again. Until that time I warn you to tread lightly in these halls.</string>
<string name="1772">I am well pleased to know there is such a &lt;man/woman&gt; of courage left in the living world. Return to me once your task has been completed.</string>
<string name="1773">You return to my tomb. Do you have the courage to assist me now. mortal?</string>
<string name="1774">Beware, mortal, for you trespass within the tomb of Nilmaldor, Knight-Gallant of Ascalhorn. I warn you not to disturb the graves of my elven brethren.</string>
<string name="1775">However, I would reward you for a service you unwittingly provided. You destroyed an infestation of spiders that had defiled our resting place.</string>
<string name="1776">If you told me your purpose for entering our crypt, perhaps I could decide upon an appropriate reward.</string>
<string name="1777">Then be gone, mortal, before our tomb soon becomes your grave also.</string>
<string name="1778">You are a common grave robber? Then you deserve little, but perhaps if I gave you access to treasure you would leave my companions to their rest.</string>
<string name="1779">I welcome your return, adventurer. </string>
<string name="1780">Time means nothing to the dead. Come and go as you wish.</string>
<string name="1781">To be rid of their filth and destruction fills me with joy. Now I shall help you be done with the creatures you hunt.</string>
<string name="1782">The kobolds are barricaded in a room that was once also an elaborate trap. A grave-robber of long ago once disabled this trap... but it is merely disabled, not destroyed.</string>
<string name="1783">The trap can be reactivated in a separate control room, which can be accessed by way of a secret door in the hallway south of the entrance to the kobolds&apos; barricaded hall.</string>
<string name="1784">Destroy them as you wish, it matters little to me. I offer the knowledge of this trap only to make your task easier, as the numbers of the kobolds may be too great for any single warrior.</string>
<string name="1785">Now that you know it is there, it should not be too hard to find. </string>
<string name="1786">Use the lever inside to enable the trap, and then take one of the magical helms to protect you from the poisonous effect of the trap. </string>
<string name="1787">Once the trap is enabled, just step on the pressure plate in the kobold&apos;s barricaded room and the gas will stun the kobolds. You should make short work of them after that.</string>
<string name="1788">As you desire, mortal. Before you go, there is one thing I would present you with, for your courage and assistance.</string>
<string name="1789">I was about to give you something else, something worthy of the courage you have shown me, yet your impatience does not bode well. Perhaps you are not deserving of more.</string>
<string name="1790">You have earned nothing but my contempt. Leave quickly, before this tomb becomes your own grave!</string>
<string name="1791">There is one more thing, brave adventurer.</string>
<string name="1792">In the upper crypt is a reliquary that holds an item of value to us. I would see it returned to the hands of the living, but only to one who is worthy.</string>
<string name="1793">Take this key, and use it to enter the eastern hall of the upper crypt. Perhaps you shall find this item of use.</string>
<string name="1794">Go, and escape this tomb soon, before it becomes your own grave.</string>
<string name="1795">You throw this honor back at me, do you? Go, fool... leave this place. May your rewards be exactly what you deserve.</string>
<string name="1796">Farewell, and may your bravery carry you far in your future endeavors, mortal.</string>
<string name="1797">I have no more advice for you, adventurer. Go, and may you learn much in your journeys.</string>
<string name="1798">I sense that the kobold presence has been ended. Now perhaps peace shall reign in this place once again.</string>
<string name="1799">I welcome your return, adventurer.</string>
<string name="1800">To be rid of their filth and destruction fills me with joy. And since you have also dealt with the kobold intruders, I believe you deserve a reward.</string>
<string name="1801">And you must be the one I have to thank for not only their infestation, but that of the spiders in the western crypts as well. You are deserving of reward, I think.</string>
<string name="1802">And you must be the one I have to thank for their elimination. Might you consider using your strength to aid me in a task, stranger?</string>
<string name="1803">Then leave quickly, before this tomb becomes your own grave.</string>
<string name="1804">An age ago, a malevolent wraith invaded our crypt. I did battle with the creature and destroyed it, but not before it weakened me greatly.</string>
<string name="1805">Ever since I have been forced to remain close to my own remains. I cannot roam the crypt freely as I once did... and this means I cannot perform my duty.</string>
<string name="1806">Living creatures... giant spiders, in fact... have infested one of the western tombs. They have damaged much and I can do nothing.</string>
<string name="1807">If you were to destroy the spiders and all of their egg sacs, mortal, I would be most grateful and would reward you for your kindness.</string>
<string name="1808">Ah, the mighty slayer of our defilers returns. I sense the spiders are now destroyed. You have my thanks for such generous assistance.</string>
<string name="1809">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Nilmaldor seems distracted in thought and ignores you.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1810">You were instructed to leave. Now you will face my eternal wrath, defiler of the dead!</string>
<string name="1811">Be gone, spirit. My presence is none of your concern.</string>
<string name="1812">What kind of undead creature are you?</string>
<string name="1813">Tell me what help you need.</string>
<string name="1814">May I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="1815">I will be going now. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="1816">What have the kobolds been up to?</string>
<string name="1817">Where are your people from?</string>
<string name="1818">You deserve your fate, as I see it.</string>
<string name="1819">Then your masters were fools. The dark arts should have made them stronger.</string>
<string name="1820">Such is the price paid for consorting with evil.</string>
<string name="1821">That is a terrible shame.</string>
<string name="1822">You want to speak with me? What for?</string>
<string name="1823">I seek a group of kobolds who may have entered this crypt.</string>
<string name="1824">The kobolds are here? That&apos;s all I needed to know. Farewell.</string>
<string name="1825">I don&apos;t need your help, spirit.</string>
<string name="1826">You can tell me what you want, but don&apos;t get your hopes up. </string>
<string name="1827">What do you need my help with?</string>
<string name="1828">I&apos;ll only do this for the right reward.</string>
<string name="1829">I guess you&apos;re stuck with the spiders then. Sorry. </string>
<string name="1830">I have no time for spider-killing. I have enough problems of my own.</string>
<string name="1831">I suppose so, if it will make my job easier. </string>
<string name="1832">I will help you..</string>
<string name="1833">No, goodbye. </string>
<string name="1834">I will help you. </string>
<string name="1835">It is none of your business, spirit.</string>
<string name="1836">I seek treasure.</string>
<string name="1837">I seek the kobolds who recently entered this crypt. </string>
<string name="1838">I should go.</string>
<string name="1839">I have destroyed a nest of spiders and their eggs.</string>
<string name="1840">This sounds complicated. Why don&apos;t I just kill the kobolds?</string>
<string name="1841">How do I find the secret entrance?</string>
<string name="1842">Please, continue. </string>
<string name="1843">Now it is time to go slaughter some helpless kobolds.</string>
<string name="1844">That&apos;s it? That&apos;s all I get for killing all those spiders?</string>
<string name="1845">Just give me the reward. I have earned it.</string>
<string name="1846">I am sorry. I am just tired. </string>
<string name="1847">That should make my job much easier. Thank you, spirit.</string>
<string name="1848">Ah, magic! Now I shall be more powerful than ever!</string>
<string name="1849">Great, more fighting, thanks a lot.</string>
<string name="1850">You are very kind, good spirit. Thank you.</string>
<string name="1851">The spiders and their eggs are destroyed.</string>
<string name="1852">I have no time for that.</string>
<string name="1853">Tell me what aid you need.</string>
<string name="1854">Safe becomes death and death becomes safe when one has what he desires.</string>
<string name="1855">&lt;StartAction&gt;[While faded and cracked with age, the statue depicts a handsome elven man wielding a glittering sword and wearing an amulet engraved with a crescent moon.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1856">&lt;StartAction&gt;[The elf appears to gaze down at you with sad, unearthly eyes and you are left with the definite impression that you are watched. An inscription at the statue&apos;s base reads:]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="2043">The kobolds fled this way and continued north, according to the tracks in the dust. This lone straggler has been severely gnawed on by the local rat population.</string>
<string name="2044">The kobolds clearly passed this way, being chased by rats that managed to take down this lone straggler (and have been feasting upon him for at least several hours). The tracks in the dust show that the kobolds continued to flee north, going lower into the crypt.</string>
<string name="2045">You have proved yourself worthy, paladin.  Take the trappings of your new station and go forth to fulfill your destiny.</string>
<string name="2046">There are signs of sticky webbing at various places on the doorway. You suspect that spiders are nearby... giant ones, in fact.</string>
<string name="2047">The dust on the ground has been disturbed heavily by small tracks... kobolds, without a doubt.</string>
<string name="2048">There are numerous tracks belonging to humanoids... kobolds, no doubt... heading north. You cannot determine how many, exactly, but more than a dozen at least.</string>
<string name="2049">There are numerous kobold tracks scuffed into the disturbed dust, here. Around twenty or so kobolds ran through this area in a hurry, heading north. There is no evidence of them returning the same way, although examining the tracks closely leads you to believe that at least one kobold snuck back out of the crypt very recently.</string>
<string name="2050">According to the disturbed dust, you believe the kobolds have passed through this section of the hall several times.</string>
<string name="2051">The kobolds obviously continued along this hallway, but you cannot tell which direction they took at the intersection.</string>
<string name="2052">The kobolds continued this way, according to the tracks, and turned right at the intersection.</string>
<string name="2053">There are many tracks in the dust. Wherever the kobolds are hiding, they are likely very close.</string>
<string name="2054">The kobold tracks along this hall are heavy. Wherever they are hiding, it is nearby and likely further down the hall.</string>
<string name="2055">It&apos;s obvious to you that the kobolds slowed along this hallway, and numerous tracks run back and forth along its length. You are quite sure that the kobold lair is close... perhaps further down the hall from here at the next doorway.</string>
<string name="2056">The bear turns to regard you with its fierce eyes and growls low in its throat. This beast has obviously been beaten and starved to turn it into a killer.</string>
<string name="2057">The bear stares at you suspiciously. It&apos;s thoughts are full of pain and hunger... obviously the gnolls have conditioned it to become a killer.</string>
<string name="2058">The bear turns its pain-filled thoughts elsewhere for now, wondering faintly if you too will beat it if it acts wrongly.</string>
<string name="2059">Since you have control over the bear for the moment, you quickly distract it and then kill it. Its thoughts of shock and hate fade away as it dies.</string>
<string name="2060">The images the bear sends you are a mixture of hatred and pain. It knows little of the gnolls beyond the torture they have inflicted on the beast.</string>
<string name="2061">You gather some scraps to feed to the bear, and it all but flies into a rage as it chews down the meat quickly. Obviously it half-expects you to take its meal away.</string>
<string name="2062">Rather than making the bear more agreeable, feeding it seems to make it more suspicious. From the images in its mind, it seems the gnolls only fed it before combat.</string>
<string name="2063">You attempt to pat the bear&apos;s fur and speak to it calmly, but it flinches away from you as if expecting to be beaten.</string>
<string name="2064">Even though the bear knows instinctively that you are a friend, the gnolls have all but ruined the bear&apos;s mind. Inside its hate-filled mind, the bear wishes it was dead.</string>
<string name="2065">Whispering a prayer to the gods of nature, you call it near and suddenly give it a quick and merciful death. Its last, fleeting thoughts are of gratitude.</string>
<string name="2066">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the bear alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2067">&lt;StartAction&gt;Surprise the bear and kill it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2068">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask the bear about the gnoll caves.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2069">&lt;StartAction&gt;Give the bear some food.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2070">&lt;StartAction&gt;Attempt to soothe the creature.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2071">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put the poor creature out of its misery.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2072">You... you&apos;re &lt;race&gt;! Please... all the gnolls seem to have left the cave! Is that true? Are we free to go?</string>
<string name="2073">We... we are? You&apos;re sure? Oh, thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, thank you!</string>
<string name="2074">I... I know it is much to ask, but there was another amongst us who survived. His name is Glendir, but the gnolls took him. He... he could be alive, somewhere...</string>
<string name="2075">Before we go, we must know... is the village of Hilltop safe? It&apos;s the only settlement near this forest, and we can&apos;t return to Blumberg now.</string>
<string name="2076">Then... then we must make the trek westward towards Silverymoon. I can only hope we will all survive to see it. Fare you well, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2077">Then we must chance that Hilltop still stands. I can only pray it is so. Fare you well, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2078">That is such a relief, thank the gods! Tell me, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... might we know the name of our savior?</string>
<string name="2079">As you wish. May the gods watch over you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="2080">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. May the gods watch over you always.</string>
<string name="2081">You... you are too generous! Thank you ever so much, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Fare you well, and may the gods watch over you always!</string>
<string name="2082">It is generous of you to offer, my &lt;lord/lady&gt; but we would not want to be a burden. We can make it on our own. Tell me... might we know the name of our savior?</string>
<string name="2083">You... you wouldn&apos;t! Please don&apos;t say such a thing!!</string>
<string name="2084">We... we have nothing, stranger. The gnolls took us prisoner in Blumberg... all we have are the rags they left us with.</string>
<string name="2085">Does... that mean you will not free us? Please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, say that isn&apos;t so! Nobody could be that cruel-hearted!</string>
<string name="2086">Then... then we are stuck here, still. Stuck here until we die. You are a cruel, evil &lt;man/woman&gt;,  you are.</string>
<string name="2087">We are from Blumberg... or, rather, I should say we were. The gnolls descended on our village not more than a day ago.</string>
<string name="2088">We don&apos;t know why they came or what they wanted. They... they killed most of us. We&apos;re all that&apos;s left.</string>
<string name="2089">Oh, please... is there no way you could release us? I&apos;m begging you! We will surely die here if we do not escape!</string>
<string name="2090">Oh, please... is there no way you could release us? I&apos;m begging you! We will surely die here if we do not escape!</string>
<string name="2091">Oh, please... if there&apos;s any pity in you, you&apos;ll free us from this misery! Have mercy on us, stranger!</string>
<string name="2092">You would abandon innocent folk in need? Then... then we are doomed.</string>
<string name="2093">Oh, please... if the gnolls are really gone, could we not flee from here? Is it not safe?</string>
<string name="2094">You have? I... I don&apos;t know how you did it, but you are a marvel of a &lt;man/woman&gt; to accomplish such a feat! Does this mean we can leave this horrid place?</string>
<string name="2095">You... you&apos;re &lt;race&gt;? Are you in league with these gnolls somehow? Was it you who ordered us turned into slaves?</string>
<string name="2096">I... I... y-yes, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;...</string>
<string name="2097">I... you are an evil, cruel &lt;man/woman&gt; for what you&apos;ve done to us. I hope the gods make you pay for this!</string>
<string name="2098">Then please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! Take pity on us! Free us from this hell-hole, I beg you!</string>
<string name="2099">You... you&apos;re willing to anger these gnolls and free us?</string>
<string name="2100">Bless you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! Bless you!</string>
<string name="2101">Then... then we are doomed. Go then... go and do whatever you believe is so important that you abandon innocent folk to such a gruesome fate.</string>
<string name="2102">Oh, thank you! Thank you! Please hurry, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;!</string>
<string name="2103">I will believe that when I see it.</string>
<string name="2104">We... we have nothing, stranger. The gnolls took us prisoner in Blumberg... all we have are the rags they left us with.</string>
<string name="2105">Does... that mean you will not free us? Please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, say that isn&apos;t so! Nobody could be that cruel-hearted!</string>
<string name="2106">You&apos;ve... taken control of them? How did... never mind that, couldn&apos;t you free us, then? Couldn&apos;t you let us go?</string>
<string name="2107">You... you&apos;re &lt;race&gt;! Thank the gods! Please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... please let us out of this place! The gnolls will be the death of us for sure!</string>
<string name="2108">I... I think we will have to take our chances, then. Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt; for setting us free.</string>
<string name="2109">What do you want? To torment us helpless folk?! If these gnolls are really gone can we not even leave this hellish place?</string>
<string name="2110">What do you want with us? Are you here to torment us more?! Will you not attempt to free us?!</string>
<string name="2111">It&apos;s you again! Please tell us that we are free to go, please!</string>
<string name="2112">Very well, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, but be quick I beg you!</string>
<string name="2113">What do you want with us? Are you here to torment us more?! Will you not free us from this place?</string>
<string name="2114">It&apos;s you again! Please tell us that we are free to go, please!</string>
<string name="2115">Please! Please help us be free of this place, we beg you!</string>
<string name="2116">You&apos;re free to go, certainly.</string>
<string name="2117">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Hilltop is in ruins. You don&apos;t want to go there.</string>
<string name="2118">I don&apos;t really care where you go, just go.</string>
<string name="2119">That&apos;s a good idea. Go to Hilltop... you&apos;ll be safe there.</string>
<string name="2120">My name is unimportant.</string>
<string name="2121">Give thanks to the gods and that will be enough recognition for me.</string>
<string name="2122">My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="2123">My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;. And here... 100 gold to help you rebuild your lives.</string>
<string name="2124">Hilltop is safe. In fact, I&apos;ll take you there myself.</string>
<string name="2125">Actually, I think I&apos;m in need of some target practice.</string>
<string name="2126">And what will you give me to let you go?</string>
<string name="2127">I apologize. The way is clear... you&apos;re free to leave.</string>
<string name="2128">Go, then. I could not care less, really.</string>
<string name="2129">Sounds to me like you need to be put out of your misery.</string>
<string name="2130">Are you really that certain?</string>
<string name="2131">First tell me who you are and how you got here.</string>
<string name="2132">Forget it. Rot here, for all I care.</string>
<string name="2133">Of course... you&apos;re free to go.</string>
<string name="2134">I&apos;ve driven the gnolls from the cave, that&apos;s true.</string>
<string name="2135">Wait... who are you people? What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="2136">Don&apos;t back-talk me, slave, or suffer the consequences!</string>
<string name="2137">And so what if I did? What are you going to do about it?</string>
<string name="2138">I&apos;ve arranged for peaceful passage through these caves, no more.</string>
<string name="2139">I&apos;d have to deal with the guards, first...</string>
<string name="2140">There are no guards here... you should be able to flee safely.</string>
<string name="2141">I will try to speak to the chieftain, then.</string>
<string name="2142">No, you&apos;re right... I can&apos;t do that. You&apos;ll have to stay here.</string>
<string name="2143">Yes, I am. You should go now, quickly!</string>
<string name="2144">Sorry... I&apos;m not willing to make the gnolls angry.</string>
<string name="2145">I will speak to the chieftain about this.</string>
<string name="2146">Perhaps... if you make it worth my while.</string>
<string name="2147">Fine, fine. I will speak to the chieftain.</string>
<string name="2148">I&apos;ve taken control of the gnolls, but I didn&apos;t make you slaves.</string>
<string name="2149">I suppose I could, at that. Very well... you&apos;re free to go.</string>
<string name="2150">You&apos;re free to go. The way is clear.</string>
<string name="2151">What do I care? Come or go, as you wish.</string>
<string name="2152">Not yet, but be patient.</string>
<string name="2153">*growl!* Gishnak say hold! You come no further! We speak now, not fight!</string>
<string name="2154">Why you come here, Furless One? *growl* You kill many gnolls of tribe... why? What you seek?</string>
<string name="2155">*growl!* Then you only finds your own death, &lt;race&gt; fool! *snarl!* Attack it! Attack it, all of you!!</string>
<string name="2156">*growl* Gishnak is chieftain of gnolls. I learn much so I can lead tribe. *growl* Human tongue hard to speak for us, but I learn it well.</string>
<string name="2157">The fact I speak human tongue is not important, however. *growl!* What is important is that you tell Grishnak why you are here!</string>
<string name="2158">You invades our cave, you do! *snarl!* You no doubt kills many of our tribe! *growl!* Of course it is business of gnoll chieftain!</string>
<string name="2159">*growl* You might be strong, &lt;race&gt; invader, but you not walk into presence of Grishnak with impudence. Tell me why you are here!</string>
<string name="2160">*growl!* You will not! Kill the Furless One now! Kill it, all of you!!</string>
<string name="2161">*snarl* Ahhh, you seek the items of power taken by the little creatures you call kobolds, yes?</string>
<string name="2162">The mistress J&apos;Nah seeks them as well. *growl* This is why she commanded Gishnak to send his gnolls to attack the kobolds and take them.</string>
<string name="2163">No, I do not. *snarl!* We found only one item with the kobolds, the tooth of a dragon. *growl!* That is not enough for the mistress. She wants them all!</string>
<string name="2164">*growl!* I do not know, Furless One. Nor do I care! *snarl!* All I wish is for J&apos;Nah to find these items and leave gnolls alone forever!</string>
<string name="2165">Hah hah haa! *growl!* That is why you come here? For few puny humans we not kills in village raid? You make Gishnak laugh!</string>
<string name="2166">We not release slaves! *growl!* You give Gishnak another reason why you come to caves! *snarl!*</string>
<string name="2167">Hah hah haaa! *growl!* This be amusing. Kill the Furless One now!</string>
<string name="2168">*growl! snarl!* You seek J&apos;Nah, do you? *snarl!* For what reason? Our hated mistress sees no-one!</string>
<string name="2169">*growl!* J&apos;Nah brings those she wishes to see to her directly... not through gnoll caves! *snarl!* Why she want to see you?</string>
<string name="2170">Hah! *growl!* I thought as much! Why do you seek our hated mistress, then?! *snarl!*</string>
<string name="2171">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You lie! *snarl!* You are no friend of the mistress! Kill it! Kill it now, before the mistress punishes us all!!</string>
<string name="2172">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *growl!* Is that so? I let the mistress decide if that is true... if you can reach her!</string>
<string name="2173">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *growl!* Is that so? I let the mistress decide if that is true... if you can reach her!</string>
<string name="2174">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *growl!* Is that so? I let the mistress decide if that is true... if you can reach her!</string>
<string name="2175">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I do not believe you! You lie! Kill it... kill it, all of you! Before the mistress punishes us!!</string>
<string name="2176">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *growl!* Maybe... maybe the mistress does wish to see you. *snarl!* I let her decide... if you can reach her!</string>
<string name="2177">But why should Gishnak let you through caves to see her? *snarl!* You invade caves, kill gnolls, challenge rule of chieftain! *growl!* Why should I help you?</string>
<string name="2178">Then I decide no! *growl!* I care not if J&apos;Nah wishes to see you! You will pay for coming into our caves, Furless One!</string>
<string name="2179">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *growl...* Gishnak is not convinced that your word is good, but I will not offend J&apos;Nah. You may pass through our caves.</string>
<string name="2180">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I do not care what J&apos;Nah thinks of Gishnak! And I decide that you will *not* pass through caves! *growl!* Kill it now!</string>
<string name="2181">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *growl...* Gishnak is not convinced that your word is good, but I will not offend J&apos;Nah. You may pass through our caves.</string>
<string name="2182">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; *snarl!* You dare! Kill the &lt;race&gt; intruder now, all of you! Kill it!!</string>
<string name="2183">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *growl...* Very well. You may pass through our caves to find J&apos;Nah, &lt;race&gt; intruder.</string>
<string name="2184">I will give you the key you will need to open great doors in the back of this chamber. *snarl!* They lead down to ancient ruins where J&apos;Nah lies.</string>
<string name="2185">*growl!* The gnolls will not attack you, Furless One... so long as you do not attack us, nor disturb our caves further. *growl* Our treasures and slaves are ours.</string>
<string name="2186">*growl!* Then you die! Kill the Furless One, all of you... kill it now!</string>
<string name="2187">*snarl* Then take the key and go, find the sorceress.</string>
<string name="2188">You... wish to kill J&apos;Nah? *growl* I find this... intriguing.</string>
<string name="2189">*growl!* J&apos;Nah has great power, much magic. She come to the gnoll caves two moons ago and drive out old chieftain, Nashekk. He flees with many gnolls, and J&apos;Nah commands caves now.</string>
<string name="2190">She is not gnoll. *snarl!* She spends all time down in ruins beneath gnoll caves, digging. She kills gnolls who disobey. *growl!* We not want her here!</string>
<string name="2191">We gladly try to kill her, but J&apos;Nah is too strong. *growl* Her magic too strong. *snarl!* We gnolls need... help... if she be killed.</string>
<string name="2192">*growl!* Then we kill you, Furless One, before you get the chance! *snarl!* All of you, kill it! Kill it now!!</string>
<string name="2193">*growl...* I suggest that if you begin fight against J&apos;Nah... *snarl* ...and only if, then tribe of gnolls could fight alongside you.</string>
<string name="2194">I am not sure we can trust you... *growl* ...but we do want J&apos;nah gone from caves...</string>
<string name="2195">*growl* Then you may pass through our caves safely, Furless One. *growl* And should you strike against J&apos;Nah, we will be there to help you.</string>
<string name="2196">I will give you the key you will need to open great doors in the back of this chamber. *snarl!* They lead down to ancient ruins where J&apos;Nah lies.</string>
<string name="2197">I warn you, however. *growl!* From this point on, you not steal more from us, you not touch our slaves and you not attack us... or there is no deal!</string>
<string name="2198">*snarl...* Gishnak... surrenders to you, Furless One. *growl* Do not slay me! I will do as you command!</string>
<string name="2199">*growl* You wish passage? Then you may have it. I will take the tribe and leave the caves. *snarl* Then you do as you wish.</string>
<string name="2200">*growl!* Then you take this... the key that leads to the ruins below. *snarl!* There lies the sorceress J&apos;Nah!</string>
<string name="2201">If you defeat Gishnak and his tribe... maybe you kill sorceress, as well! *snarl!* More likely she strips the flesh from your bones! Hah!!</string>
<string name="2202">*growl...* Then... you are in charge of the tribe, Furless One. Until you leave or the hated J&apos;Nah comes to challenge you... *snarl!* ...we do as you command.</string>
<string name="2203">*snarl!* No! *growl!* Gishnak would rather die, first!!</string>
<string name="2204">*hooowwwlll!* I need help! Slay the Furless One!!</string>
<string name="2205">*growl!* Ask, then. *snarl!* But they will avail you little against J&apos;Nah!</string>
<string name="2206">What else do you need of Gishnak, then?</string>
<string name="2207">*growl...* You have other commands, Furless One?</string>
<string name="2208">Then what do you wish Gishnak to do? *snarl!*</string>
<string name="2209">*growl!* I already tell you much. Gnolls not even know ruins beneath caves until J&apos;Nah come. She let no gnolls down there... we not see ruins.</string>
<string name="2210">J&apos;Nah find ancient ruins beneath gnoll caves. *snarl* Gnolls not even know they there before she come. J&apos;Nah spend all time there, digging.</string>
<string name="2211">You want to go to J&apos;Nah? *growl* You take this... this is key to doors in back of this chamber. They lead to ruins below.</string>
<string name="2212">Doors in back of this chamber lead to ruins. You use key I gives you and go through doors... you find J&apos;Nah in ruins quick.</string>
<string name="2213">*growl!* J&apos;Nah has great power, much magic. She come to the gnoll caves two moons ago and drive out old chieftain, Nashekk. He flees with many gnolls, and J&apos;Nah commands caves now.</string>
<string name="2214">I do not know where J&apos;Nah come from. *growl* She smell like elf, but she not elf. Ever since she come, all she does is dig.</string>
<string name="2215">She digs and digs in old ruins beneath gnoll caves. *growl!* What she find there, we not know. Why she want items of power from human village we not know.</string>
<string name="2216">J&apos;Nah never speak to chieftain... she give order! *snarl!* She tell chieftain what to do! I gladly kill her if I have power!!</string>
<string name="2217">*growl!* I do not know, Furless One. Nor do I care! *snarl!* All I wish is for J&apos;Nah to find these items and leave gnolls alone forever!</string>
<string name="2218">She is not gnoll. *snarl!* She spends all time down in ruins beneath gnoll caves, digging. She kills gnolls who disobey. *growl!* We not want her here!</string>
<string name="2219">We gladly try to kill her, but J&apos;Nah is too strong. *growl* Her magic too strong. *snarl!* We gnolls need... help... if she be killed.</string>
<string name="2220">*growl!* Then you die slowly, you will. We gnolls not care.</string>
<string name="2221">*growl!* So you tell her! *snarl!* This be no surprise to J&apos;Nah! We not want her in caves!</string>
<string name="2222">Hah! *growl* J&apos;Nah not have same reservation... Gishnak certain she try to kill you if she find you in caves!</string>
<string name="2223">*growl...* I suggest that if you begin fight against J&apos;Nah... *snarl* ...and only if, then tribe of gnolls would gladly fight alongside you.</string>
<string name="2224">Is this what you wish? *growl* We gnolls just want J&apos;Nah gone, even if it means we trust Furless One such as you.</string>
<string name="2225">*snarl!* Then we gnolls will be there. When and if you fight her.</string>
<string name="2226">*growl...* If you not makes gnolls leave caves... if you not kills gnolls... then we fight by your side when and if you attack J&apos;Nah.</string>
<string name="2227">J&apos;Nah tells the gnolls to attack the kobolds. *growl* She say they come from human village and carry items of power that she seeks.</string>
<string name="2228">But they only has one item. *snarl!* J&apos;Nah say she not want just one, she want them all! She takes it but is very angry with gnolls.</string>
<string name="2229">But it not fault of gnolls! *growl!* Kobolds run away very fast, we not catch all of them! Kobolds we bring to caves only has one item of power.</string>
<string name="2230">*growl!* We keeps little kobolds in cages, west of this chamber. They knows nothing. *snarl* We kill them later.</string>
<string name="2231">*snarl...* What does the &lt;race&gt; intruder wish of Gishnak now?</string>
<string name="2232">*growl* Then begone, and go where you must quickly, Furless One!</string>
<string name="2233">*snarl!* The Furless One betrays us! Kill it! Kill it now!!</string>
<string name="2234">*growl* When you strike against J&apos;Nah, the gnolls will be there and will help you, Furless One.</string>
<string name="2235">*growl!* You demands nothing! *snarl!* We takes prisoners in fair raid on village... we keeps them for slaves!</string>
<string name="2236">You go now. *growl!* You make Gishnak very angry!</string>
<string name="2237">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; There be nothing! *growl!* We keeps the prisoners and you says nothing more about it, Furless One!</string>
<string name="2238">*growl!* They loses and we keep them until they die. *snarl!* This is gnoll way, and Gishnak not change for you, Furless One!</string>
<string name="2239">*growl* Ask, then. *snarl!* But Gishnak&apos;s answers will help you little against J&apos;Nah!</string>
<string name="2240">*snarl...* Gishnak... obeys the Furless One.</string>
<string name="2241">*growl!* Gishnak... understands.</string>
<string name="2242">*growl!* No! No gnolls of the tribe go with you! *snarl!* You only kill them, or let them be killed!</string>
<string name="2243">*snarl* Gishnak not listen to Furless One for long. You will have to kill Gishnak first! Go and do what you come here for!</string>
<string name="2244">*growl! snap!* I will not! No gnolls go with you! None!!</string>
<string name="2245">*growl!* So long as you are here, Gishnak obeys. You leave the caves, Gishnak is chieftain again!</string>
<string name="2246">*snarl!* Gishnak change nothing! Gnolls stay gnolls... we not be furless and toothless like you!</string>
<string name="2247">*growl* When you strike against J&apos;Nah, the gnolls will be there and will help you, Furless One.</string>
<string name="2248">The gnolls are... *growl* ...grateful for your help, Furless One. We are glad the hated sorceress is dead.</string>
<string name="2249">*growl!* Gishnak will not release prisoners. They were taken in battle. *snarl!* You wish them, you must do same!</string>
<string name="2250">*growl!* Then you not speak of it again!</string>
<string name="2251">If... if you wish to release prisoners, they are yours. *growl!* You do with them as you want, Furless One.</string>
<string name="2252">*growl!* Yes. *snarl!* We are eager to see you leave our caves, as well.</string>
<string name="2253">*growl!* Then we go. Come, tribe! All of you! We go now!!</string>
<string name="2254">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; *growl!* You do not rule the gnolls! We would die first!!</string>
<string name="2255">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *growl!* You are no different than the hated sorceress! *snarl!* Take what gold we have, Furless One! Take all you wish!</string>
<string name="2256">Come, tribe! We leaves this area now! We leaves caves far, far behind! Deeper into the forest we go!</string>
<string name="2257">*growl* Make no mistake, we are eager to see you leave as well, Furless One. We hope that is soon.</string>
<string name="2258">I seek your deaths, monsters, and nothing more!</string>
<string name="2259">How is it that you speak my language?</string>
<string name="2260">What I&apos;m looking for is none of your business.</string>
<string name="2261">This is pointless. Time for you to die!</string>
<string name="2262">I&apos;m not telling you anything, beast.</string>
<string name="2263">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; I can kill you all with ease. I&apos;ll ask the questions around here!</string>
<string name="2264">I&apos;m looking for some artifacts that were stolen from Hilltop.</string>
<string name="2265">So you have the artifacts the kobolds stole, then?</string>
<string name="2266">That&apos;s all I need to know. Time to die!</string>
<string name="2267">I thought you were the chieftain. How could someone command you?</string>
<string name="2268">Why does J&apos;Nah seek these artifacts?</string>
<string name="2269">You don&apos;t sound like you care much for this J&apos;Nah.</string>
<string name="2270">Tell me about this mistress of yours.</string>
<string name="2271">Who is this J&apos;Nah you speak of?</string>
<string name="2272">I demand that you release the prisoners you&apos;ve taken!</string>
<string name="2273">Release the prisoners or die, fiend!</string>
<string name="2274">I&apos;m searching for the sorceress J&apos;Nah.</string>
<string name="2275">Then I&apos;ll simply have to get to her through you, won&apos;t I?</string>
<string name="2276">I think she&apos;ll want to see me.</string>
<string name="2277">I suppose you&apos;re right. She probably doesn&apos;t want to see me.</string>
<string name="2278">I&apos;m here to kill her... and all of you!</string>
<string name="2279">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; We&apos;re old friends. She just doesn&apos;t know I&apos;m here.</string>
<string name="2280">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I have important information for her.</string>
<string name="2281">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Because I can get her what she wants, that&apos;s why.</string>
<string name="2282">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Because I can get her the artifacts she&apos;s looking for.</string>
<string name="2283">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s between me and J&apos;Nah.</string>
<string name="2284">I&apos;m tired of this. I&apos;ll convince you the hard way.</string>
<string name="2285">That&apos;s for you to decide.</string>
<string name="2286">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I could put in a good word with J&apos;Nah for you...</string>
<string name="2287">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You want to stay on J&apos;Nah&apos;s good side, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="2288">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;ll let me through or I&apos;ll kill the rest of you! That&apos;s why!</string>
<string name="2289">I&apos;m not agreeing to this!</string>
<string name="2290">Very well. I agree to this.</string>
<string name="2291">I believe she has some artifacts that were stolen from Hilltop.</string>
<string name="2292">I&apos;ve come to kill her, of course.</string>
<string name="2293">Your hated mistress?</string>
<string name="2294">And does she know you want to kill her? Because I could always tell her...</string>
<string name="2295">I certainly have no intention of helping you monsters!</string>
<string name="2296">But I don&apos;t intend to kill her. I just want to speak to her.</string>
<string name="2297">Are you saying you&apos;d help me fight her?</string>
<string name="2298">Forget it. I don&apos;t need your help.</string>
<string name="2299">If she doesn&apos;t give me what I want, then yes... I will fight her.</string>
<string name="2300">If you help me, I will fight her.</string>
<string name="2301">I wish passage through these caves, nothing more.</string>
<string name="2302">Then go. Take your tribe and leave.</string>
<string name="2303">No, you&apos;ll do as *I* wish! I&apos;m in command here, gnoll!</string>
<string name="2304">I&apos;ve changed my mind. You must die, gnoll.</string>
<string name="2305">I have questions I want answered, first.</string>
<string name="2306">I want you to leave these caves at once. Pray we never cross paths again!</string>
<string name="2307">Then I am in charge, now! You will do as I say!</string>
<string name="2308">Not good enough! You do *whatever* I say!</string>
<string name="2309">Good. Now answer my questions.</string>
<string name="2310">No deal! You die now, monster!</string>
<string name="2311">Then answer my questions, first.</string>
<string name="2312">I don&apos;t have any more questions.</string>
<string name="2313">You&apos;re going to do whatever I tell you to. I&apos;m in charge, now.</string>
<string name="2314">I&apos;m finished with you... now you die.</string>
<string name="2315">Tell me about these ruins J&apos;Nah is in.</string>
<string name="2316">Where do I find this J&apos;nah?</string>
<string name="2317">I want to know everything you do about J&apos;Nah.</string>
<string name="2318">Tell me more about this J&apos;Nah.</string>
<string name="2319">Why does J&apos;Nah seek the artifacts?</string>
<string name="2320">You don&apos;t seem to like this J&apos;Nah much.</string>
<string name="2321">Even if I wanted to fight her, I wouldn&apos;t want your &quot;help&quot;.</string>
<string name="2322">And does she know you want to kill her? Because I could always tell her...</string>
<string name="2323">But I don&apos;t know if I even intend to fight her.</string>
<string name="2324">Are you saying you&apos;d help me fight her?</string>
<string name="2325">Forget it. I don&apos;t need your &quot;help&quot;.</string>
<string name="2326">If she doesn&apos;t give me what I want, then yes... I will fight her.</string>
<string name="2327">If you&apos;re willing to fight her, then yes... that&apos;s what I want.</string>
<string name="2328">Do you have any of the artifacts stolen from Hilltop?</string>
<string name="2329">Where are those kobolds now?</string>
<string name="2330">Nothing. I should go.</string>
<string name="2331">I&apos;ve decided you need to die, creature!</string>
<string name="2332">So you are going to help me when I fight J&apos;Nah, correct?</string>
<string name="2333">You mentioned that you wanted J&apos;Nah gone?</string>
<string name="2334">I demand that you release the prisoners you&apos;ve taken!</string>
<string name="2335">Fine, do what you like.</string>
<string name="2336">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there nothing I can offer you in exchange for them?</string>
<string name="2337">Release them or die, fiend!</string>
<string name="2338">Slaves?! That&apos;s horrible!</string>
<string name="2339">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="2340">Good. Let&apos;s keep it that way.</string>
<string name="2341">I want some gnolls to travel with me.</string>
<string name="2342">Fine, have it your way.</string>
<string name="2343">I&apos;ll go now, then.</string>
<string name="2344">I think I&apos;ll kill you now, fool!</string>
<string name="2345">Bah! This is useless! Die!!</string>
<string name="2346">You will do as I say, gnoll!</string>
<string name="2347">I thought you agreed to obey me?</string>
<string name="2348">I want some changes made to the way you do things.</string>
<string name="2349">So you are going to help me when I fight J&apos;Nah, correct?</string>
<string name="2350">Then perhaps you will release your prisoners.</string>
<string name="2351">Then battle it is!</string>
<string name="2352">No, I don&apos;t want that.</string>
<string name="2353">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="2354">Why be glad? You&apos;re next, monster!</string>
<string name="2355">Now take your tribe and leave this area. I don&apos;t want to see you ever again.</string>
<string name="2356">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; I think it&apos;s time to give some tribute to your ruler, don&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="2357">You are very welcome.</string>
<string name="2358">And I thank you for helping me fight her.</string>
<string name="2359">Thank you for releasing me. I thought I was never getting out of there! Now, uh... can you show me where the exit is?</string>
<string name="2360">I *really* appreciate this. Thank you very much.</string>
<string name="2361">Right, well... okay. I&apos;ll try looking for the exit, then. Uhhh... good luck!</string>
<string name="2362">What?! You&apos;re joking, aren&apos;t you? Ahhhhh!!</string>
<string name="2363">Oh... well I... uh, that is... you did sort of get that from me under pressure, you know?</string>
<string name="2364">Wait! Wait wait! I&apos;ve, uh, I&apos;ve changed my mind? No? Ahhhhh!!</string>
<string name="2365">Oh. Well I, uh... look over there! AHHHHH!!!</string>
<string name="2366">That&apos;s, uh, kind of what I was hoping you&apos;d think. Would you... still show me where the exit is?</string>
<string name="2367">I... I... well I just... ohhh, damn it anyway!</string>
<string name="2368">Look, I... I told the gnolls that so they would think I was worth something as a hostage! So they wouldn&apos;t eat me! And... I didn&apos;t think you would free me, either.</string>
<string name="2369">The truth is... I don&apos;t have any money. Everything I had was in Blumberg and now it&apos;s gone. My sister is a smith in Hilltop, but she certainly isn&apos;t rich.</string>
<string name="2370">You... still want the promissory note? But, uhhh... Fiona won&apos;t pay this, I&apos;m sure!</string>
<string name="2371">Okay... uhhh... will you still show me where the exit is?</string>
<string name="2372">I... I... suppose that&apos;s, uh, between you and her, then. Here you go. Will you show me to the exit now?</string>
<string name="2373">It is, I&apos;m afraid. Will you, uh... still show me to the exit?</string>
<string name="2374">Uhhh... yes, her name is Fiona. But I don&apos;t know if she would help me out at all. Does... does this mean you won&apos;t show me to the exit now?</string>
<string name="2375">Oh... of course. Uhhh... here you go. Now will you take me to the exit?</string>
<string name="2376">Ah! You there! I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing here in these caves, I&apos;ll just thank my stars you&apos;re not a gnoll. My name&apos;s Glendir, would you terribly mind letting me out of here?</string>
<string name="2377">What?! You&apos;re going to just leave me in here?! I don&apos;t believe it!</string>
<string name="2378">Excellent. You won&apos;t regret it, I assure you!</string>
<string name="2379">But... can&apos;t you do something? You can&apos;t just leave me in here! Please!!</string>
<string name="2380">Thank you! Oh, thank you! Please hurry!</string>
<string name="2381">But... the promissory note! I have it here! Please let me out!!</string>
<string name="2382">I&apos;ll have you know that my name is Glendir, eldest son of the Baron of Hilltop! I&apos;m more than certain my father would reward you well for my release!</string>
<string name="2383">I am Glendir, the eldest son of the Baron of Hilltop, of course! I&apos;m quite valuable... alive, at any rate. If you release me, I&apos;m sure my father would reward you well.</string>
<string name="2384">Wait! Wait! Don&apos;t go!</string>
<string name="2385">Why, yes. I&apos;m sure my father would shower you with gratitude and gold upon my return! A thousand... no, wait, *two* thousand gold!</string>
<string name="2386">I... I can write up a promissory note! That&apos;s it! The gnoll chieftain gave me some parchment to write my ransom note with... you could give the note to my father!</string>
<string name="2387">So... you&apos;ll let me out of here?</string>
<string name="2388">Start writing? Oh, of course! I&apos;ll start that right now! Thank you!</string>
<string name="2389">Uhhh... maybe, but... my father isn&apos;t *that* wealthy.</string>
<string name="2390">I... I... well I just... ohhh, damn it anyway!</string>
<string name="2391">Ahh! No no! No, please, don&apos;t do that! I hate pain!</string>
<string name="2392">Oh... well I, ah, didn&apos;t know you knew that...</string>
<string name="2393">Look, I... I told the gnolls that so they would think I was worth something as a hostage! So they wouldn&apos;t eat me! Can you blame me?</string>
<string name="2394">The truth is... I don&apos;t have any money. Everything I had was in Blumberg and now it&apos;s gone. My sister is a smith in Hilltop, but she certainly isn&apos;t rich.</string>
<string name="2395">No, please! Please! I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll do anything! Anything!</string>
<string name="2396">It is, it is! Please... won&apos;t you let me out of here?</string>
<string name="2397">Uhhh... yes, her name is Fiona. But I don&apos;t know if she would help me out at all. Does... does this mean I have to stay in the cage?</string>
<string name="2398">Yes! Yes, I swear! Anything!</string>
<string name="2399">No-ooo! Please, please! Don&apos;t leave me in here!</string>
<string name="2400">Thank you! Thank you! Please hurry!</string>
<string name="2401">You again? Are you going to let me out of here or not? Please, I&apos;m begging you!</string>
<string name="2402">Uhh... is everything okay?</string>
<string name="2403">Lead on.</string>
<string name="2404">Alright. Don&apos;t go too far, though. These caves are frightening.</string>
<string name="2405">That looks like the exit there. Thank you for saving me! I don&apos;t think I would have made it without you.</string>
<string name="2406">Of course. Follow me.</string>
<string name="2407">Find it on your own. I don&apos;t have time to baby-sit.</string>
<string name="2408">You aren&apos;t going anywhere. Time to die!</string>
<string name="2409">The exit? Haven&apos;t you sworn allegiance to me?</string>
<string name="2410">You&apos;ll pay for this with your life, fool!</string>
<string name="2411">Start running... I don&apos;t want to see you ever again!</string>
<string name="2412">No, you *will* serve me. As promised.</string>
<string name="2413">Oh, forget it, then. It wasn&apos;t even worth it.</string>
<string name="2414">Fine. Follow me.</string>
<string name="2415">You *are* joking, right?</string>
<string name="2416">Don&apos;t you think it&apos;s time you told me who you really are?</string>
<string name="2417">Well, you&apos;re free now. Find your own way home.</string>
<string name="2418">Then I suppose I have to kill you now.</string>
<string name="2419">Good to know. Now hand over the promissory note.</string>
<string name="2420">True... fine, keep it then.</string>
<string name="2421">We&apos;ll see about that.</string>
<string name="2422">Now that sounds more like the truth.</string>
<string name="2423">A smith in Hilltop?</string>
<string name="2424">First there&apos;s the matter of that promissory note.</string>
<string name="2425">First there&apos;s the matter of that promissory note.</string>
<string name="2426">Forget it. I&apos;ve got other things to do.</string>
<string name="2427">Hold on, I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="2428">I can&apos;t let you out. The gnolls will get angry if I do.</string>
<string name="2429">It may be dangerous, but I&apos;ll do what I can.</string>
<string name="2430">If I had some guarantee your father would pay...</string>
<string name="2431">I&apos;ll speak to the chieftain on your behalf.</string>
<string name="2432">Give me one good reason I should let you out.</string>
<string name="2433">First tell me who you are.</string>
<string name="2434">In that case, you can stay in the cage.</string>
<string name="2435">Oh really? The Baron&apos;s son, you say?</string>
<string name="2436">And just how do I make sure I get my money?</string>
<string name="2437">Now that does sound promising.</string>
<string name="2438">No, I don&apos;t think so. Have a nice stay.</string>
<string name="2439">Let you out? After all that lying?</string>
<string name="2440">Start writing that note and I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="2441">So you&apos;re trying to cheat me!</string>
<string name="2442">So I give it to the non-existent Baron of Hilltop.</string>
<string name="2443">I&apos;m sure I could get more money than *that*.</string>
<string name="2444">I suppose two thousand gold will have to do.</string>
<string name="2445">Why stop there? Why not keep lying?</string>
<string name="2446">Alright, what are you hiding? Do I have to beat it out of you?</string>
<string name="2447">Even I can see through that act.</string>
<string name="2448">Do I look that stupid to you?</string>
<string name="2449">Tell me who you really are before I start poking you with sharp objects.</string>
<string name="2450">But there is no Baron of Hilltop.</string>
<string name="2451">In that case, you can stay in the cage.</string>
<string name="2452">Now that sounds more like the truth.</string>
<string name="2453">A smith in Hilltop?</string>
<string name="2454">How about swearing everlasting loyalty to me?</string>
<string name="2455">Hmmm... no, not worth it. You stay in there.</string>
<string name="2456">That&apos;s better. I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="2457">Everything&apos;s fine. Never mind.</string>
<string name="2458">Follow me again.</string>
<string name="2459">Wait here for now.</string>
<string name="2460">You&apos;re going to have to find your own way out from here.</string>
<string name="2461">It seems that the gnolls use this gong as an alarm against possible intruders.</string>
<string name="2462">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Do nothing.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2463">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Ring the gong.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2464">A strong rope dangles down into the darkness below.</string>
<string name="2465">&lt;StartAction&gt;Do nothing.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2466">&lt;StartAction&gt;Climb down the rope.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2467">Ummm... me not taste good. You knows that? Nafeeli tell you that.</string>
<string name="2468">Ahhh! It smell funny! Somebody tells it to go to Nafeeli!</string>
<string name="2469">You talks to Nafeeli. He be leader!</string>
<string name="2470">Ummm... me not speaks &lt;race&gt; good. You speaks to Nafeeli.</string>
<string name="2471">Umm... you not going to hurts us, is you? We just little kobolds, we just wants to flee nasty gnolls...</string>
<string name="2472">Aiiieee! Stop, stop! We is defenseless! You not hurts defenseless kobolds, we begs you!!</string>
<string name="2473">Aiiieee!! Run! It be crazy &lt;race&gt; killer!! RUUUNNN!!</string>
<string name="2474">Umm... we helps you fight gnolls?</string>
<string name="2475">You is merciful &lt;race&gt; person, you is. Nafeeli be very grateful! All of you follows me... we run to freedom! Run run!!</string>

<string name="2477">Then... we be frees to go? We not wants to be gnoll dinner... please lets us go!</string>
<string name="2478">Ummm... we know how to fights little bit, sure. But we not gots weapons. Why you asks?</string>
<string name="2479">You makes Nafeeli very nervous.</string>
<string name="2480">We helps you... fight gnolls? That not goes well first time we tries it...</string>
<string name="2481">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ummm... we fights them? That sounds like good deal, sure. Heh.</string>
<string name="2482">There be door just down passage that go to gnoll chieftain room. Once you starts fight, we runs over and helps you fight chieftain!  We does that you lets us live?</string>
<string name="2483">Okays. We starts to look around for weapons and stuff. If you opens door to chieftain room, we comes running when you starts big fight.</string>
<string name="2484">Ummm... just so you knows, me thinks that door only open from chieftain side. But me be sure you figures out way, somehow.</string>
<string name="2485">Until you start fight with chieftain, we waits! You goes with good luck!</string>
<string name="2486">We sneaks around. There gots to be something around here. We be fine.</string>
<string name="2487">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; We makes amends? Oh... okay. We makes amends, sure. That is, ummm, great idea...</string>
<string name="2488">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Is you crazy?! We not fights gnolls! We not even gots weapons! What we fights with, teeth?</string>
<string name="2489">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Helps you fight gnolls. Okay! We helps you! We fights good, we will!</string>
<string name="2490">Is name that gnolls say sometimes. They say that J&apos;Nah wants all items of power. Maybe is chieftain?</string>
<string name="2491">They big and hairy and they gots bad breath?</string>

<string name="2562">The pool before you is covered with runes, but it is an unknown and ancient language. Carved into its rim appears to be five large symbols.</string>
<string name="2563">The pool is calm but glowing faintly. You get the impression that this device has a specific function here.</string>
<string name="2564">As the token sinks into the bubbling water, it too dissolves. The pool begins to glow even more brightly, and the bubbling becomes so frantic it nearly spills over its rim.</string>

<string name="2717">What can we helps you with, yip? Me not so sure me can answer all questions.</string>
<string name="2718">Grr, then you goes soon?</string>
<string name="2719">Good, grr. Me mean goodbye, yip.</string>
<string name="2720">Grr, questions &apos;bout me? What you want to know about Chief Arzig, yip?</string>
<string name="2721">Yip, most of time me love be chief, &apos;cept when kobolds no listen. But them listens when me teaches them lesson. Kobolds not like lessons much.</string>
<string name="2722">No, yip! Maybe be like Big Master and rule tribe, but never be chief. Me think if Big Master ever gone though, we just rule selves and no be slaves, grr, yip!</string>
<string name="2723">Yip, me win big fight, yip. That be how kobolds pick chief.</string>
<string name="2724">What? Yip? No, not that kind of fight. When there needs to be new chief, all kobolds gets together and picks four best possible chiefs.</string>
<string name="2725">Then four choices goes out and prepares speech, yip! Then four kobolds comes back and tells why him be best chief, or sometimes her, but that be rare.</string>
<string name="2726">When speeches done, kobolds all throw rocks at ones they hate most and kobold left standing is winner.</string>
<string name="2727">Yip, me likes it well enough!</string>
<string name="2728">Not for me, yip! That be kobold way. You no judge us, yip!</string>
<string name="2729">Not kill, yip, well... sometimes, but mostly just hurt them enough to fall down. Many times ones who knows them not likely to wins, them falls down right away, so no one needs throw rocks.</string>
<string name="2730">Course, some throws rocks anyways, but that not sporting, yip! </string>
<string name="2731">Grr, no, me have hardest head!</string>
<string name="2732">What you want know about caves, yip?</string>
<string name="2733">We keeps them in... yip, what, you thinks me stupid? Grr, no treats me like that, just cause me talks different! Me be Chief of whole tribe, what you be chief of?</string>
<string name="2734">You no be chief of nothing, yip! You just keep you hands off kobolds things, sneaky &lt;race&gt; person, grr!</string>
<string name="2735">Yip? We lives here all our lives. Me not know when tribe comes here; just been here long time, yip!</string>
<string name="2736">Yip! Me tells you what me can, but me not know too much &apos;bout Big Master! Grr, Master Jumper keeps me out.</string>
<string name="2737">Why him not be here, grr? You think someone going to tell him no, yip?</string>
<string name="2738">Older than me, yip! Older than any kobolds here! That all me know, yip!</string>
<string name="2739">Grr, yip, what you want to see Big Master for? We cannot sees him right now. Yip, that be impossible.</string>
<string name="2740">Me hates Master Jumper so much, grr, but me find it hard to work without him. Me can no use him rod, yip!</string>
<string name="2741">Grr, me knew me trusts you not. You is on side of Master Jumper. Me *hates* Master Jumper!</string>
<string name="2742">Grr, stupid kobolds who supposed to make rock go up will no listen to me no more.</string>
<string name="2743">The cave is blocked off by a big rock, grr. Stupid kobolds who supposed to make rock go up will no listen to me no more.</string>
<string name="2744">Grr, me wishes it that easy, yip! Them no-good kobold jumpers hides when me come to them. Me waves rod in air and tells them me now Master Jumper, but them says Big Master not say so.</string>
<string name="2745">Grr, him is stupid kobold who tell me no when me want to go see Big Master. Big Master picks one kobold and makes him Master Jumper, grr, but it never be chief.</string>
<string name="2746">Master Jumper tells other kobolds to jump on platform, then platform goes down and big rock goes up, yip! But only Master Jumper with rod can make rock lifting work, grr.</string>
<string name="2747">That why me take rod away and put Master Jumper in prison, &apos;cause he thinks he be all so powerful and tells me no.</string>
<string name="2748">Grr, them stupid kobolds follows you no better than them follows me, yip! Only Master Jumper can use rod, yip!</string>
<string name="2749">Grr, me wanted to ask if me could be Master Jumper and Chief. Yip, that way me gots all power and no have to fight with Master Jumper. Me hoped Big Master sees wisdom in that, yip!</string>
<string name="2750">Yip, but me never gots to ask, so me teaches Master Jumper lesson.</string>
<string name="2751">Him in prison, north of here, but him no can help you, yip! Him can no tell kobolds what to do with out rod.</string>
<string name="2752">What? You killed Master Jumper? Now we never get in to see Big Master! You stupid &lt;man/woman&gt;, Big Master will kill me. Me will kill you then!</string>
<string name="2753">Yip, grr, you back. What you wants now, grr?</string>
<string name="2754">Grr, goodbye.</string>
<string name="2755">Yip, yip, how can Chief Arzig helps you, friend?</string>
<string name="2756">Yip, grr, the champion returns to us. How we helps you, honored one?</string>
<string name="2757">Yip, grr, Master Jumper and me sister be good match. You wants me set you up with me cousin?</string>
<string name="2758">Oh, so you already knows me cousin. Sorry &apos;bout that.</string>
<string name="2759">Fine. But me will keep asking until me finds a fool, umm, me means a companion for me cousin.</string>
<string name="2760">No, me no kid &apos;bout me ugly cousin. Hard to marry ugly kobold off, even to other kobolds.</string>
<string name="2761">I need the Rod of Ruler.</string>
<string name="2762">Fine. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="2763">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Is the rod really worth your life?</string>
<string name="2764">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; What if I could work out a deal between you and the Master Jumper?</string>
<string name="2765">That&apos;s telling him. </string>
<string name="2766">No, Chief, you will do what the Master Jumper says.</string>
<string name="2767">No, Chief, you must compromise as well.</string>
<string name="2768">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Wait for Master Jumper to respond.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2769">What do you want from the Master Jumper, Chief?</string>
<string name="2770">No, Chief, Master Jumper is the one who decides. </string>
<string name="2771">Calm yourself. Let&apos;s see what Master Jumper has to say about it. </string>
<string name="2772">What do you think, Master Jumper? </string>
<string name="2773">You had better shut up and listen! </string>
<string name="2774">Yes, the Chief must have the power!</string>
<string name="2775">Maybe I was a little hasty. Would you reconsider, Chief? </string>
<string name="2776">Be quiet Klumph! </string>
<string name="2777">Calm down or I&apos;ll tie you down!</string>
<string name="2778">But I don&apos;t know what to do with it.</string>
<string name="2779">You could have just done that in the first place. </string>
<string name="2780">I&apos;ll do my best. </string>
<string name="2781">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; He cannot be the chief without power. </string>
<string name="2782">That is a little open. Master Jumper, what do you think? </string>
<string name="2783">That sounds fair.</string>
<string name="2784">Enough! We won&apos;t get anywhere with insults. </string>
<string name="2785">That would solve a lot of problems. </string>
<string name="2786">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Snicker]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2787">Don&apos;t get upset. Klumph, that&apos;ll be enough. </string>
<string name="2788">Klumph, show some respect for your Chief!</string>
<string name="2789">Once per year. </string>
<string name="2790">Once every two months. </string>
<string name="2791">Once per month.</string>
<string name="2792">Are we in agreement then?</string>
<string name="2793">No. You get to live. </string>
<string name="2794">You get your rod back. </string>
<string name="2795">What do you want? </string>
<string name="2796">It&apos;s about time, now give him the rod and let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="2797">Good, now, Master Jumper, is there anything you want?</string>
<string name="2798">That&apos;s terrible. You can&apos;t just give him a wife!</string>
<string name="2799">That sounds like a good deal.</string>
<string name="2800">Just get the rod and let&apos;s get going. </string>
<string name="2801">What will your sister say?</string>
<string name="2802">I can&apos;t believe this. </string>
<string name="2803">What do you mean you&apos;ll give him a wife? </string>
<string name="2804">Once per week.</string>
<string name="2805">Hey, no threats. Let&apos;s try to work this out amicably.</string>
<string name="2806">Do you really want to die Master Jumper?</string>
<string name="2807">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You can trust me with it.</string>
<string name="2808">I was just exploring.</string>
<string name="2809">You just make sure they are careful too. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="2810">I will be careful. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2811">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="2812">I don&apos;t have any more questions.</string>
<string name="2813">I am going now.</string>
<string name="2814">I want to see Tymofarrar.</string>
<string name="2815">I have questions about you.</string>
<string name="2816">Enough about you. </string>
<string name="2817">Are you happy being the chief?</string>
<string name="2818">Could a non-kobold become the chief?</string>
<string name="2819">How did you become the chief?</string>
<string name="2820">You beat up all the other contenders?</string>
<string name="2821">That&apos;s great!</string>
<string name="2822">That&apos;s horrible!</string>
<string name="2823">They kill the others?</string>
<string name="2824">And you had the best speech?</string>
<string name="2825">I have questions about your caves.</string>
<string name="2826">Enough about your caves. </string>
<string name="2827">Where do you keep your valuables?</string>
<string name="2828">When did you come to these caves?</string>
<string name="2829">I have questions about Tymofarrar.</string>
<string name="2830">Can I go see Tymofarrar? </string>
<string name="2831">Why is there a massive boulder in the way to Tymofarrar? </string>
<string name="2832">Why is Tymofarrar here?</string>
<string name="2833">Enough about the dragon. </string>
<string name="2834">How old is Tymofarrar?</string>
<string name="2835">I have come to see Tymofarrar.</string>
<string name="2836">The Master Jumper could help me. </string>
<string name="2837">Because of the massive boulder?</string>
<string name="2838">You will let me go see him! </string>
<string name="2839">Why is that impossible?</string>
<string name="2840">Why won&apos;t they listen to you? </string>
<string name="2841">You are the chief. Make them listen.</string>
<string name="2842">What is a Master Jumper? </string>
<string name="2843">Who is the Master Jumper?</string>
<string name="2844">Could I use the rod?</string>
<string name="2845">Why did you want to see Tymofarrar?</string>
<string name="2846">Where is the Master Jumper?</string>
<string name="2847">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You will let the Master Jumper help me, or else you will die.</string>
<string name="2848">The Master Jumper is dead.</string>
<string name="2849">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2850">That&apos;s disgusting.</string>
<string name="2851">No.</string>
<string name="2852">A kobold? You have got to be kidding!</string>
<string name="2853">links</string>
<string name="2854">Artifacts? Hmm. Every adventurer I have ever met was seeking magical items of some sort. What kind of artifacts would you be looking for?</string>
<string name="2855">You invade my private bolthole and then presume to tell me what is and is not my business? Your temerity is astounding. I wish I knew whether it was mere bravado or true confidence.</string>
<string name="2856">It just so happens that I have a magical artifact in my possession, and would be willing to trade it for one I am seeking. Would you be interested in a little proposition?</string>
<string name="2857">The only way you could know that is if the gnolls told you. Damn their traitorous and foolish hides. I might have to destroy them earlier than I expected. </string>
<string name="2858">They certainly have not proven their worth as guards. I shall have the captain flayed alive and then decide if they shall live.</string>
<string name="2859">Very well, it is true that I have recovered the dragon&apos;s tooth, but it is not the artifact I was seeking. If you are interested in a trade, perhaps we can work something out.</string>
<string name="2860">Ah, this explains so much. You must be &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;race&gt; student of Drogans. You see? I have done my research.</string>
<string name="2861">I hope you are not accusing me of arranging their theft. I was greatly angered when the items were removed from there and I sent my gnolls to stop the kobolds.</string>
<string name="2862">Unfortunately my gnolls were less successful than I hoped, and they allowed many of the kobolds to escape, along with the artifacts.</string>
<string name="2863">You think you can just walk out of here, knowing where my secret lair is? I hardly think so. I am afraid fate has chosen a very short thread for your life. Goodbye, pest.</string>
<string name="2864">I do not care for your tone, &lt;boy/girl&gt;. Watch your tongue around me or you might just lose it.</string>
<string name="2865">You look and sound suspicious, which makes me think you know more than you are letting on. </string>
<string name="2866">What makes you think I would need to pay for your services? Mayhap, what I really want is a new slave.</string>
<string name="2867">Cunning enough to evade my traps; strong enough to defeat my guards; this should be interesting indeed. Must I now contend with a new enemy, stranger? </string>
<string name="2868">With all of the skills you must possess to have gained entrance to my lair, it would be a shame to slaughter you. Perhaps we could even become friends. Come; tell me who you are.</string>
<string name="2869">Ah, you must be one of those who judge swiftly, even without full knowledge of the situation. Everything is always black and white for you, is it? </string>
<string name="2870">I am curious. You call me evil, yet I would know exactly what you base your judgment on. Do you actually have evidence that I am evil? </string>
<string name="2871">Those empty-minded minions? I use them as a hunter uses a bow. A weapon may be used to kill a good woman, or to protect that same woman.</string>
<string name="2872">So you are one of Drogan&apos;s students. I suppose I should have recognized you. Unfortunately you are even more foolish than the old dwarf. I do not have the artifacts.</string>
<string name="2873">I was not the one who organized the attack on your quaint little school, in fact my gnolls attacked the kobolds who carried out the raid and attempted to wrest the artifacts from them.</string>
<string name="2874">Unfortunately my gnolls proved to be even less useful than predicted and they allowed many of the kobolds to escape, carrying the items with them. </string>
<string name="2875">Ha! The treachery of that wyrm knows no bounds. I actually love the irony that he would send you to slay me because I am evil!</string>
<string name="2876">I suppose if a demon told you your own mother was a devil, you would take his words at face value and cut off her head? Be realistic, what does the conniving old wyrm want from me?</string>
<string name="2877">I use them as a hunter uses a bow. A weapon may be used to kill a good woman, or to protect that same woman.</string>
<string name="2878">My gnolls are here to protect me and to further my purposes. When they are of no more use to me, I can dispose of them as easily as an old lover.</string>
<string name="2879">Even if you still perceive me as evil, could there be an alternate destiny for significant people, such as ourselves, that reaches beyond the borders of good and evil?</string>
<string name="2880">So be it. This day brings your death.</string>
<string name="2881">I see I am dealing with one of the slower minded individuals of your race. That is unfortunate, as I do not suffer fools lightly.</string>
<string name="2882">If you wish to be destroyed, I am more than willing to accommodate you. But if you are not positive that we need to be enemies, maybe we could find common purpose? </string>
<string name="2883">Why do you not tell me what drove you to enter my bolthole?</string>
<string name="2884">You could be telling the truth, though I will assume nothing for the moment. I suppose I could make use of the talents of one who is good at overcoming obstacles.</string>
<string name="2885">Very well. I find myself in a position where I need to recover certain artifacts. I was going to recover these artifacts from the past owner, when someone I thought to be an ally double-crossed me.</string>
<string name="2886">There are three missing artifacts. One is a mummified hand, the next a mask, and finally, a tower. While I would like to have all of these items, the only one I absolutely must have is the tower.</string>
<string name="2887">One thousand gold and a magically enchanted dragon tooth would be yours in exchange for the tower. It is an excellent deal, I assure you.</string>
<string name="2888">I think you have been deceiving me about what knowledge you truly possess. Still... it is of no matter to me what deceptions you might be attempting. I think you will find I can pierce your most tangled lies.</string>
<string name="2889">Because I am in a forgiving mood, I will give you one more chance. Are you interested?</string>
<string name="2890">I face an evil and deadly foe; a most cruel beast, Tymofarrar, a white dragon.</string>
<string name="2891">&quot;The frightful king of winter ruled from his crystal splinter, and all around would bow to him alone. If one misspoke a single word, and the mighty dragon overheard, frozen death from him was quickly blown.&quot;</string>
<string name="2892">That is a line from an epic, written about Tymofarrar&apos;s sire many years ago. Although in many ways Tymofarrar has yet to reach such heights of power, still he is a deadly foe. </string>
<string name="2893">What do you mean? Of course he has the tower, his servants returned it to him, I am positive.</string>
<string name="2894">He is full of tricks and wicked lies, but do not be fooled by them. He has the tower, of that I am positive. Most cunning is my foe, with teeth and ice to back up his position.</string>
<string name="2895">One of the dragon&apos;s servants? Why did he not simply return the tower to his master?</string>
<string name="2896">What? Who is this Deekin? Where did he get the tower?</string>
<string name="2897">Hmm... but he claimed to still have the pieces? Obviously he must have. The only way this kobold will survive is if Tymofarrar does not. The white dragon does not just set his servants free.</string>
<string name="2898">I have never heard of Tymofarrar allowing a servant to go free. This could still work. I could help you destroy the dragon, but you would have to return the tower to me when you get it.</string>
<string name="2899">Yes, you would be performing a deed of legendary proportions. Still it will be a difficult battle, and I would not allow an ally to face this creature blind, or I would simply be short an ally. </string>
<string name="2900">Do not fear. I would not allow an ally to face this creature blind, or I would simply be short an ally.</string>
<string name="2901">Would you have me hide the truth from you? I would not allow an ally to face this creature blind, or I would simply be short an ally.</string>
<string name="2902">I have something that might help you face Tymofarrar, but it would only work once, so you would have to make it count.</string>
<string name="2903">If you agree to do this for me, I will give the item to you. My magic will enchant it, so you cannot use it, except within close proximity of the dragon.</string>
<string name="2904">It is the Phylactery of Ice, a weapon I just recently discovered. Breaking it infuses your body with the essence of an ice elemental, giving you great strength and resistance to cold.</string>
<string name="2905">There is also a side benefit, a touch of irony to Tymofarrar&apos;s end. Several years ago, he was defeated by a powerful frost giant. He is young, and he seems to fear and hate them now.</string>
<string name="2906">When the elemental enters your body, you will assume the form of a frost giant. Perhaps you will not even have to fight Tymofarrar. When he sees a frost giant charging at him, he might turn tail and flee.</string>
<string name="2907">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I have to kill you now. You know far to much about me to be allowed to live. What a shame.</string>
<string name="2908">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I have to kill you now. What a shame.</string>
<string name="2909">You mean besides the pleasure of my brilliant smile? Oh, I suppose I could give you a powerful artifact and 1000 gold, in exchange for the tower.</string>
<string name="2910">I happen to have a magically infused dragon tooth in my collection of rare items. I would willingly trade it for the tower. I am sure you would find the tooth of great use.</string>
<string name="2911">I will show you how it works, after you return the tower to me. The death of Tymofarrar is only a side benefit; it is the recovery of the tower he stole that is far more important.</string>
<string name="2912">I would trade the dragon&apos;s tooth for the tower, and 1000 gold beside. Surely that is a worthy offer. The dragon&apos;s tooth is more powerful, but it is not what I need.</string>
<string name="2913">Excellent. Here is the phylactery; remember not to break it until you are in the same cave as the dragon.</string>
<string name="2914">I do not expect to see you again until you have the tower, so if there is anything else, you should ask them now.</string>
<string name="2915">Be wary of tricks and traps, the white dragon is quite capable of the most dangerous cunning.</string>
<string name="2916">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I think you had better count yourself lucky to survive our meeting. You do not want to face my wrath, for my fury knows no bounds.</string>
<string name="2917">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you might need a little something to motivate you. Take this gold, it is but a sample of your reward.</string>
<string name="2918">Anything else?</string>
<string name="2919">I am willing to answer questions, if they are relevant or I find them interesting.</string>
<string name="2920">I am sorry I could not be more informative, but secrecy is a way of life. At least take some comfort in knowing that I did not lie to you.</string>
<string name="2921">You are out of your league foolish male. I would never give myself to one of your kind. Besides, my mate has already been arranged for me, and he is far more powerful than you.</string>
<string name="2922">I would say you have a choice to make. Will you serve the treacherous beast, or will you serve me? I think you will find that I part with treasure far more easily than the greedy dragon.</string>
<string name="2923">You have made your last mistake, fool. Hades take you and that damned dragon!</string>
<string name="2924">A wise choice. Any other questions?</string>
<string name="2925">Have you ever been told to do something that is very important, but not known why it was important? If you have, you will know how infuriating it can be.</string>
<string name="2926">I cannot tell you something I do not know, but if I did know, I still could not tell you. I am afraid I cannot be very helpful. Perhaps if you asked me something else?</string>
<string name="2927">If I told you that, as clich&#1081; as it might sound, I really would have to kill you. Just believe me that when my people rise to power, you will be thankful you joined with me. Anything else?</string>
<string name="2928">I was planning on it, but face it, if I fail, I am dead. If you fail, I still live. I have many important things to do and this is merely a step towards my ultimate goals.</string>
<string name="2929">You may not like my logic, but you can hardly fault it. Now, will you do this thing for me?</string>
<string name="2930">That traitorous wyrm that dares to bear the noble title of dragon? What does the conniving creature want from me?</string>
<string name="2931">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; There will be no truce! You can fight me and die, or you can help me and kill Tymofarrar. There is no other option.</string>
<string name="2932">The avarice and greed of a dragon knows no bounds. He knows very well that I must have the tower he stole, and yet he sends a collector for the one I have. </string>
<string name="2933">So you have come to kill me? Or do you desire to make a small profit and gain a magical artifact as well?</string>
<string name="2934">I think you underestimate my powers. If Tymofarrar frightens you, you know nothing of what I could do to you. Now choose, death or riches.</string>
<string name="2935">You? Ha, ha, ha! You have no chance of defeating us both. The best you can hope for is to choose the right ally, one who can help you defeat the other. I am the right choice, but it is up to you.</string>
<string name="2936">You will die first, but that treacherous dragon will follow soon after!</string>
<string name="2937">Such confidence is admirable, even in one of the lesser races. Still, do not underestimate me, or it will be the death of you. Just a friendly warning. </string>
<string name="2938">Now, I will have your name, or I will have your head mounted on a pike.</string>
<string name="2939">Such confidence is admirable, especially in one of the elven race. Still, do not underestimate me, or it will be the death of you. Just a friendly warning. </string>
<string name="2940">There is a possibility that you might be telling the truth, I suppose. What makes you think I would need to pay for your services? Mayhap, what I really want is a new slave.</string>
<string name="2941">There is a possibility that you might be telling the truth, I suppose. What makes you think I would need your friendship? Mayhap, what I really want is a new slave.</string>
<string name="2942">You may have reached me, but that does not mean you could hurt me. On the other hand, you do present an interesting point. My gnolls have not been as effective as I may have hoped.</string>
<string name="2943">But too often have I seen others in the past, trusting those who offer kind words of friendship, only to be betrayed. </string>
<string name="2944">I consider myself wiser than those fools, so it would take more than words to convince me that you are a worthy accomplice.</string>
<string name="2945">Tell me why you are really here. I find that coincidence or chance is the explanation of liars and politicians. Feel free to tell the truth; our meeting can end only one of two ways.</string>
<string name="2946">What a stunning deduction! You really are a genius, you know. I know you overheard at least part of my conversation with... my superior, so obviously you know I seek something.</string>
<string name="2947">But maybe you know what I am looking for some other way? Try being more open and honest with me about your goals. It could be that we have more in common than you might think.</string>
<string name="2948">I usually deal with such matters on my own. One must be vigilant of one&apos;s friends, lest they turn and loose their venom on you. The fate of traitors has always been death.</string>
<string name="2949">I have many enemies, though few that I fear. It is one&apos;s friends that one needs to be vigilant against, lest they turn and loose their venom on you.</string>
<string name="2950">Is there a particular enemy you had in mind, or were you aiming at being vague in hopes that I might reveal more information?</string>
<string name="2951">Pah! That old fool? He is no longer of any consideration to me. From what I have heard, he will be no more worry to anyone soon.</string>
<string name="2952">However, you have perked my interest. What exactly do you have to do with Drogan? I have heard things about his school, including the description of one like you.</string>
<string name="2953">&lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;race&gt; student, I believe. Yes, I was blind before, but I see you now. I have done my research and I know my enemies.</string>
<string name="2954">You are a small, petty fool, and you will die a most ignoble death!</string>
<string name="2955">Would you offer to help me? Well, I suppose I have indirectly assisted you before. It was my gnolls who attacked the kobolds that invaded your village. I even recovered your master&apos;s magic dragon tooth.</string>
<string name="2956">With a common enemy, maybe we can work together, despite the disdain with which I must hold your master in. Since I hold my own... superior in similar disdain, I hope you can forgive my attitude.</string>
<string name="2957">What have those meddling fools got to do with me? They should not even know of my existence. Come tell me what you know of them. </string>
<string name="2958">Satisfy me that they are your enemy too, or else prepare to meet a swift end.</string>
<string name="2959">No, I am not. I am what is known as a Daemonfey, sun elves bred with demons to produce my family. You are very perceptive.</string>
<string name="2960">Of course, since our existence is a secret, I am afraid I shall have to destroy you so completely that you could not even be resurrected. Goodbye fool.</string>
<string name="2961">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You are a poor liar. I bet you are in league with those bloody meddlers. I know Drogan is one of them; perhaps you are one of his students?</string>
<string name="2962">It matters not. Your fate was sealed the moment you mentioned Harpers. Goodbye fool.</string>
<string name="2963">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You hunt Harpers? Now that is the kind of pastime I could truly enjoy.</string>
<string name="2964">There are some artifacts I seek that the harpers have been protecting. I was unable to acquire them before an old ally betrayed me and attacked the harper school where they were being held.</string>
<string name="2965">I know that name! That meddling elf-bitch has interfered in our plans before. If she is hunting you then you just led her right to my secret bolthole!</string>
<string name="2966">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I know that name! That meddling elf-bitch has interfered in our plans before. If she is hunting you then you just led her right to my secret bolthole!</string>
<string name="2967">I have no patience for such idiocy. All Ayala will find here is your dead body!</string>
<string name="2968">What? You think I fear a pathetic fool like that? He has fewer brains than a goat. I am hardly surprised if he has petty ambitions to regain control of his tribe.</string>
<string name="2969">He shall be dealt with, in my leisure. No, I am hardly impressed and this conversation is beginning to bore me. Speak quickly, or this interview will end at the same moment as your life.</string>
<string name="2970">And what would these things be? Do you have a pretty flower to offer me? Do not think I am easily impressed.</string>
<string name="2971">I am sure it will be, but you will not be alive to witness that day. </string>
<string name="2972">That traitorous serpent that dares to bear the noble title of dragon? Do not think that by mentioning that name you win your way into my good graces. </string>
<string name="2973">Do you serve him? If not, then how do you know him? </string>
<string name="2974">&quot;The frightful king of winter ruled from his crystal splinter, and all around would bow to him alone. If one misspoke a single word, and the mighty dragon overheard, frozen death from him was quickly blown.&quot;</string>
<string name="2975">That is a line from an epic, written about Tymofarrar&apos;s sire many years ago. Although in many ways Tymofarrar has yet to reach such heights of power, still he is a deadly foe. </string>
<string name="2976">Would you pit yourself against the might of this young wyrm? Are you so brave, or foolish?</string>
<string name="2977">An interesting choice, but one which does not fit with my present needs. No, I am afraid you will simply not be of much use to me.</string>
<string name="2978">As I cannot simply allow you to walk out of my secret bolthole, I am afraid this is your unlucky day. But then again, I find people usually make their own luck.</string>
<string name="2979">Goodbye, foolish one.</string>
<string name="2980">I wish I could know for certain whether your confidence is the result of competence or foolishness. Perhaps it is a bit of both.</string>
<string name="2981">Your plan does fit well into my own personal desires, so if you are interested, I can offer you some assistance. There is a price for my help, of course.</string>
<string name="2982">I seek an artifact in the shape of a tower. Tymofarrar has stolen this tower from its rightful owner, and I want it. I will provide a powerful magical item to help you kill Tymofarrar.</string>
<string name="2983">Do not try to play me for a fool! I will not tolerate such attitude. I am J&apos;nah, as you just overheard. I warn you now; do not underestimate me, or you will surely perish.</string>
<string name="2984">Now, if you are finished trying to deceive one who is far smarter than you, you may tell me who you are.</string>
<string name="2985">So, you are the one who killed Tymofarrar. Do not be surprised that I know this already; I watched you do it with my magic.</string>
<string name="2986">I am Daemonfey; elf bred to demon, so my magic is very powerful. Of course, until recently we have been imprisoned.</string>
<string name="2987">It is one of those long, tragic tales that elven bards will often go into great detail about. But the past is irrelevant. I do not suppose you care to hear about me anyways.</string>
<string name="2988">Oh dear, I hate to tell you this, but I am afraid I cannot just allow you to walk out of here and tell others about me.</string>
<string name="2989">What is important is that we have awoken again; to find more of our elven kin are ready to join us. The first step we must take is to find powerful allies to aid us in destroying our enemies.</string>
<string name="2990">Soon we shall rise, with our demon and elf kin and Silverymoon shall be destroyed. We will conquer the Silver Marches, enslave the lesser races and begin our conquest of the Faerun!</string>
<string name="2991">I look forward to personally sacrificing Alustriel on my altar. I often dream of slitting open her throat and feeling her blood crawl down my hands. I wonder how sweet it shall taste?</string>
<string name="2992">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh]&lt;/Start&gt; But alas, my people are not yet ready to reveal themselves. Until we are ready, I am afraid that our secret must be closely guarded.</string>
<string name="2993">You have returned. Do you bring the tower with you?</string>
<string name="2994">Then there is no point in wasting my time. Go now, before I lose patience with you.</string>
<string name="2995">I hope that means you have brought me the tower. Tymofarrar&apos;s death brings me a small amount of pleasure, but the tower is what I must have.</string>
<string name="2996">What do you mean? He had to have it! His kobolds escaped my gnolls.</string>
<string name="2997">Then one of the kobolds must still have it. Well, I am sure I can track some foolish kobold down. I am just pleased that you were able to kill Tymofarrar, as he was the only one powerful enough, around here, to stop my plans.</string>
<string name="2998">Indeed? Well, I am sure I can track some foolish kobold down. I am just pleased that you were able to kill Tymofarrar, as he was the only one powerful enough, around here, to stop my plans.</string>
<string name="2999">And have you recovered the tower from Tymofarrar&apos;s servant?</string>
<string name="3000">Well, it is of no matter. I am sure I can track some foolish kobold down. I am just pleased that you were able to kill Tymofarrar, as he was the only one powerful enough, around here, to stop my plans.</string>
<string name="3001">Since you have proven to be capable, perhaps I should tell you a bit about me, and my plans; that is, if you are interested.</string>
<string name="3002">Oh dear, I hate to tell you this, but I am afraid my plans have changed, now that Tymofarrar is dead. I cannot just allow you to walk out of here and tell others about me.</string>
<string name="3003">No, I think that your life is about to come to a sudden and very tragic ending. Goodbye, sweet fool.</string>
<string name="3004">Do not be so impatient, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You will get your well-deserved reward in due time. Now, do you care to learn something?</string>
<string name="3005">Very well, I shall give you your reward.</string>
<string name="3006">My people are known as the Daemonfey, a powerful race created through the interbreeding of sun elves and demons. Unfortunately, until recently we have been imprisoned.</string>
<string name="3007">It is one of those long, tragic tales that elven bards will often go into great detail about. But the past is irrelevant. </string>
<string name="3008">What is important is that we have awoken again; to find more of our elven kin are ready to join us. The first step we must take is to find powerful allies to aid us in destroying our enemies.</string>
<string name="3009">I am afraid it is you that must be destroyed. You have been a useful, temporary ally, but I simply am not ready for the rest of the world to know of my existence.</string>
<string name="3010">Goodbye, foolish one.</string>
<string name="3011">Please, try not to interrupt me. It has been a long time since I was able to tell someone about all this. I wish to revel in our coming glory, but find myself forced to hide in secret boltholes.</string>
<string name="3012">But this shall soon end! We shall rise, with our demon and elf kin and Silverymoon shall be destroyed. We will conquer the Silver Marches, enslave the lesser races and begin our conquest of the Faerun!</string>
<string name="3013">I look forward to personally sacrificing Alustriel on my altar. I often dream of slitting open her throat and feeling her blood crawl down my hands. I wonder how sweet it shall taste?</string>
<string name="3014">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh]&lt;/Start&gt; But alas, my people are not yet ready to reveal themselves. Until we are ready, I am afraid that our secret must be closely guarded.</string>
<string name="3015">You are elven, so most likely you have heard the ancient tales of our beginnings. I am Daemonfey; elf bred to demon. Of course, until recently we have been imprisoned.</string>
<string name="3016">I do not know where you stand, but I wanted you to know exactly who you have been working for. It has become quite fashionable amongst many elves to study our past. But the past is not important.</string>
<string name="3017">My own brother betrayed me once. I escaped the carefully laid trap, unraveled his scheming and hunted him down. </string>
<string name="3018">It was strange; his heart tasted the same as all the others I have eaten. I guess I expected it would be bitter from all the deceit he practiced. I imagine yours will taste just as sweet.</string>
<string name="3019">I am seeking some artifacts. </string>
<string name="3020">None of your business.</string>
<string name="3021">No, I think I will just be going.</string>
<string name="3022">A dragon&apos;s tooth.</string>
<string name="3023">The only way I would trust you is if you were dead.</string>
<string name="3024">State your offer.</string>
<string name="3025">Ones that were stolen from my school.</string>
<string name="3026">I guess I had better go then.</string>
<string name="3027">You are lying, at least about some of it.</string>
<string name="3028">So you didn&apos;t recover any of them?</string>
<string name="3029">I know you have the tooth. </string>
<string name="3030">I might consider working with you, for the right price.</string>
<string name="3031">You can call me &lt;Master/Mistress&gt; of Shadows. </string>
<string name="3032">I am one who has come to end your evil!</string>
<string name="3033">Even your own followers say you are evil.</string>
<string name="3034">You stole Master Drogan&apos;s artifacts.</string>
<string name="3035">Tymofarrar told me what you are like.</string>
<string name="3036">You surround yourself with evil creatures.</string>
<string name="3037">You are evil and I must smite you. </string>
<string name="3038">I have no idea what you mean.</string>
<string name="3039">I suppose it is possible.</string>
<string name="3040">I was simply exploring. I enjoy a challenge.</string>
<string name="3041">So you already have the dragon&apos;s tooth? </string>
<string name="3042">What is in it for me, if I find this tower? </string>
<string name="3043">No, I think I will be leaving now. </string>
<string name="3044">I thought there were four artifacts.</string>
<string name="3045">Where would I find these artifacts?</string>
<string name="3046">He is not the one who has the tower.</string>
<string name="3047">I spoke to Tymofarrar and he thought you had the tower.</string>
<string name="3048">I found one of his servants, Deekin. He has hidden the tower.</string>
<string name="3049">He has hidden the tower and wants to be free of Tymofarrar.  </string>
<string name="3050">No, Deekin has hidden the tower.</string>
<string name="3051">He&apos;s a stupid kobold and he broke the tower.</string>
<string name="3052">He is a kobold and he never returned the tower to Tymofarrar because he wants to be free.</string>
<string name="3053">A creature of great evil; the perfect quest!</string>
<string name="3054">I cannot face a dragon!</string>
<string name="3055">How would you suggest I defeat him? </string>
<string name="3056">And you expect me to face that?</string>
<string name="3057">Yes, I get it. Only use it near the dragon; now get on with it. </string>
<string name="3058">How does it work? </string>
<string name="3059">What is it?</string>
<string name="3060">I don&apos;t think I want to fight him.</string>
<string name="3061">I think I had better kill you instead.</string>
<string name="3062">What do I get out of this?</string>
<string name="3063">I will do it.</string>
<string name="3064">I will be going now.</string>
<string name="3065">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; How about some gold up front?</string>
<string name="3066">I want to ask you some questions. </string>
<string name="3067">That is all my questions.</string>
<string name="3068">You are quite attractive. How about we spend a little private time together?</string>
<string name="3069">What would you say if I told you Tymofarrar sent me to kill you?</string>
<string name="3070">Now that I have something to help me defeat both of you, I think I will do just that.</string>
<string name="3071">I think I will kill you after all. </string>
<string name="3072">I will kill Tymofarrar for you.</string>
<string name="3073">What do you need the tower for?</string>
<string name="3074">What are you? You do not seem to be truly elven.</string>
<string name="3075">Why don&apos;t you use it then?</string>
<string name="3076">I come, bringing you a message from Tymofarrar. </string>
<string name="3077">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; He would like to arrange a truce.</string>
<string name="3078">He would like to see you chained to a stake, ready for supper. His supper. </string>
<string name="3079">He wants the artifacts you stole from him.</string>
<string name="3080">He wants you dead.</string>
<string name="3081">If you give me your artifact I will let you live.</string>
<string name="3082">Perhaps I should just kill you both!</string>
<string name="3083">What do you offer?</string>
<string name="3084">I will honor my deal with Tymofarrar. </string>
<string name="3085">I haven&apos;t decided if we are friends or enemies, yet.</string>
<string name="3086">Why should I tell you my name? </string>
<string name="3087">I am &lt;FirstName&gt;, a mercenary seeking employment. </string>
<string name="3088">My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;, J&apos;nah. I&apos;m interested in being friends.</string>
<string name="3089">It was too easy to reach you here. You need my protection.</string>
<string name="3090">Then I suppose I will have to kill you. </string>
<string name="3091">What could I do to prove myself?</string>
<string name="3092">I am here to kill you. </string>
<string name="3093">I believe you are looking for something.</string>
<string name="3094">I might be able to help you deal with your traitor.</string>
<string name="3095">You need an alliance against a common enemy.</string>
<string name="3096">I speak of the old dwarf, Drogan.</string>
<string name="3097">Now that introductions are in order, why don&apos;t we get down to business? </string>
<string name="3098">That information won&apos;t save your life.</string>
<string name="3099">I don&apos;t have to be an enemy.</string>
<string name="3100">I guess I&apos;ll be going now. </string>
<string name="3101">I will not work with you. I will destroy you! </string>
<string name="3102">Do you speak of Tymofarrar? </string>
<string name="3103">Tell me of this enemy. </string>
<string name="3104">I spoke of the harpers.</string>
<string name="3105">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You are not fully elven, are you?</string>
<string name="3106">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I am hunting members of the Harpers and they are hunting you.</string>
<string name="3107">There are two harpers nearby; Drogan and a ranger known as Ayala.</string>
<string name="3108">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt;We are both being hunted by a harper named Ayala.</string>
<string name="3109">I spoke of your gnoll chieftain.</string>
<string name="3110">I think there are other things that interest you.</string>
<string name="3111">Your death shall be impressive!</string>
<string name="3112">I was thinking of Tymofarrar.</string>
<string name="3113">One of his servants is hiding from him and I want to help. </string>
<string name="3114">I met him, but I was unimpressed. </string>
<string name="3115">He betrayed you and I would like to help you get your revenge. </string>
<string name="3116">I come as his messenger.</string>
<string name="3117">I want to kill him.</string>
<string name="3118">Maybe not.</string>
<string name="3119">If I had some help, I might. </string>
<string name="3120">I do not fear him. </string>
<string name="3121">That is my plan.</string>
<string name="3122">First, tell me who you are.</string>
<string name="3123">No thanks.</string>
<string name="3124">I guess I&apos;ll hear what you have to say.</string>
<string name="3125">I am very interested.</string>
<string name="3126">That is disgusting! Don&apos;t expect me to help. </string>
<string name="3127">That sounds quite pleasurable.</string>
<string name="3128">Not yet.</string>
<string name="3129">The dragon is dead.</string>
<string name="3130">Tymofarrar did not have it.</string>
<string name="3131">The tower was never returned.</string>
<string name="3132">A kobold named Deekin hid it. </string>
<string name="3133">One of his servants kept it.</string>
<string name="3134">Not yet.  </string>
<string name="3135">I hoped maybe you had found him. </string>
<string name="3136">I cannot find Deekin.</string>
<string name="3137">No, goodbye.</string>
<string name="3138">I think I will kill you instead. </string>
<string name="3139">No, I want my reward now.</string>
<string name="3140">I demand my reward, right now!</string>
<string name="3141">Fine, tell me. </string>
<string name="3142">Yes, please tell me.</string>
<string name="3143">You shall never succeed, for I will destroy you!</string>
<string name="3144">What allies have you gained? </string>
<string name="3145">You are demons? </string>
<string name="3146">Which is where I come in?</string>
<string name="3147">That is disgusting! Don&apos;t expect me to help. </string>
<string name="3148">That sounds quite pleasurable.</string>
<string name="3149">I have decided I must kill you.</string>
<string name="3150">Rrufff! You should talk to the Master Jumper.</string>
<string name="3151">Yip, yip, you comes and shows me what you made of, grr!</string>
<string name="3152">Yip, yip, what you do in here? You no be kobold? Them makes you prisoner like Master Jumper, yip?</string>
<string name="3153">This be bad place to explore. Yip, this be prison. You no find good things in here, yip, yip! &apos;Cept you found Master Jumper, and that be good thing, yip!</string>
<string name="3154">Yip, yip! I be Master Jumper. Me tells kobolds when them can go in and see Big Master. Him no likes many visitors, &apos;specially from kobolds.</string>
<string name="3155">If Master Jumper lets lots of kobolds go in, then Big Master eats Master Jumper and finds new one. Me no wants to be eaten, so me tells chief no.</string>
<string name="3156">Yip, that be why Big Master puts a big rock in front of him cave, well... yip, and to protects him. Yip, yip, that be funny, like Big Master need to be protected, yip!</string>
<string name="3157">Yip! That what me trying to tell you. There no be way in, unless me no be prisoner no more. Yip, &apos;less you gets me Rod of Ruler from chief, then all other kobolds follows me.</string>
<string name="3158">If them follows me, yip, then me can lifts the rock for you! If me not have rod, then them be too scared of chief to listen me, yip.</string>
<string name="3159">Yip, grr, same reason chief can no use it. Kobolds not follow him, them not follow you, them follow Master Jumper. Yip, Big Master tells them so. Them just be scared now of chief.</string>
<string name="3160">Grr, this not so hard as you be making it! Rod of Ruler means me be in charge, without rod, them other kobolds not know me for sure in charge, yip!</string>
<string name="3161">But them knows chief not supposed to have rod, so them not follow him either, them just hide. Yip, if me comes to big rock and has rod, them will listen to me. That be only way.</string>
<string name="3162">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh]&lt;/Start&gt; Yip, that would be nice. Them would have come and frees me. Yip, that be too much risk for them. All them knows is jumping, not thinking of such things.</string>
<string name="3163">And chief no try to kill you? Yip? Guess there be first time for everything, yip.</string>
<string name="3164">You must still get rod from chief, and him no likes me, cause me gots power over him. Yip! Maybe if you talks nice to him, him will let me have rod back? It not likely, but maybe you tries?</string>
<string name="3165">Grr, yip, yip, no, no, me wants to help you. Without me you can no gets rock lifted! You needs me, yip!</string>
<string name="3166">Yip, that probably be best idea, yip. Him no be good chief no how, yip!</string>
<string name="3167">Yip, me has me doubts, but maybe you is smarter than you looks, yip! Good luck.</string>
<string name="3168">Yip! That be good. Give me rod and then me will tell jumpers to lift big rock, yip!</string>
<string name="3169">Should be near where chief was, yip!</string>
<string name="3170">Grr, yip, yip, no, no, me wants to help you. Without me you can no gets rock lifted! You needs me, yip!</string>
<string name="3171">Yip! Me no give up without fight, grrr!</string>
<string name="3172">Yip, grr, same reason chief can no use it. Kobolds not follow him, them not follow you, them follow Master Jumper. Yip, Big Master tells them so. Them just be scared now of chief.</string>
<string name="3173">Grr, this not so hard as you be making it! Rod of Ruler means me be in charge, without rod, them other kobolds not know me for sure in charge, yip!</string>
<string name="3174">But them knows chief not supposed to have rod, so them not follow him either, them just hide. Yip, if me comes to big rock and has rod, them will listen to me. That be only way.</string>
<string name="3175">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh]&lt;/Start&gt; Yip, that would be nice. Them would have come and frees me. Yip, that be too much risk for them. All them knows is jumping, not thinking of such things.</string>
<string name="3176">Yip! You has the rod! Hows you gets it from chief? Yip, no, me not really wants to know that. Maybe we get newer, smarter chief, yip!</string>
<string name="3177">Now me helps you. Me meets you at big rock, yip!</string>
<string name="3178">Yip! Stupid, mean kobold chief be just in cave to south. If you kills him, yip, then maybe me be chief and Master Jumper, yip! That be good idea, yip!</string>
<string name="3179">Yip! That be good to think, but Chief will no like you and will no give up rod, yip!</string>
<string name="3180">Yip! That because Master Jumper be smart kobold, yip! That be why Big Master picks me.</string>
<string name="3181">Yip? Why you no want kill him? Him wants to kill you, most likely, yip! Besides, him cannot give up rod, or no one will listen to chief no more, yip! Yes, me think chief will die, yip!</string>
<string name="3182">Big Master put big rock in front of cave and have big thing that lift it, yip, but years ago, one kobold broke machine and so it not work.</string>
<string name="3183">Yip, now we gots to get kobolds to jump on platform and make lifting thing work. We try using rocks once, but them too heavy and hard to get out, yip. </string>
<string name="3184">Kobolds be easy to get out of platform when Big Master&apos;s visits over, yip! So I tell kobolds jumps and them jumps. It fun to watch, yip! But chief take all fun away. Now Master not get no visitors.</string>
<string name="3185">You be careful of chief, yip! Him be sneaky!</string>
<string name="3186">Grr, yip, me be Master Jumper and me tell chief he no can go in and see the Big Master. Yip! Him gots so mad, him throws me in here.</string>
<string name="3187">Yip! That be Big Master, yip! You know him name, that be good sign. Maybe you be a visitor for him, yip?</string>
<string name="3188">Where you army be, yip? Master is big, scary dragon! You no think you attacks him by youself, yip? Oh, ho, yip, me think Big Master would likes you, least him likes how you taste me bets.</string>
<string name="3189">Yip, me would likes to lets you go in. You is the kind of visitor Big Master would likes to see, but now me is no in charge, yip!</string>
<string name="3190">There no be way in, unless me no be prisoner no more. Yip, &apos;less you gets me Rod of Ruler from chief, then all other kobolds follows me.</string>
<string name="3191">Yip, yip, yip! You are back. You brings me the rod?</string>
<string name="3192">You best hurrys, yip!</string>
<string name="3193">Me try to answer you questions, yip. Me hopes them not be too hard.</string>
<string name="3194">Oh, yip, me name be Klumph, Master Jumper Klumph. Yip, what you name be?</string>
<string name="3195">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Yip, you makes fun of Klumph&apos;s name. That not be nice. Klumph named after kobold hero. You gots any other stupid questions?</string>
<string name="3196">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Yip! That be very odd. Me never know &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;s uses kobold hero names. You gots any other questions, Klumph?</string>
<string name="3197">Yip! That not be nice, but fine. Me no care much, yip! You gots other stupid questions?</string>
<string name="3198">Yip!, That be nice name. You gots other questions, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="3199">Yip, good, you makes it. You ready for jumping, yip?</string>
<string name="3200">Alright, we will waits for you, yip!</string>
<string name="3201">Jumpers!!! Every kobold gets ready! GO!!!</string>
<string name="3202">Good luck with Big Master! You be careful, him mights be hungry. Oh, yip, and you watches out for ice kobolds. Them be different tribe and them be tough!</string>
<string name="3203">I am not a prisoner, I was just exploring.</string>
<string name="3204">What is a Master Jumper? </string>
<string name="3205">Tell me how to get in, or else you die!</string>
<string name="3206">Why shouldn&apos;t I just use the rod?</string>
<string name="3207">But they know the Big Master chose you, why do you have to have the rod?</string>
<string name="3208">That&apos;s just stupid. They should just follow you.</string>
<string name="3209">I already met your chief.</string>
<string name="3210">I think I will just kill you.</string>
<string name="3211">I think I will just kill him.</string>
<string name="3212">I will try.</string>
<string name="3213">I already killed your chief.</string>
<string name="3214">I will go find the rod.</string>
<string name="3215">I think I will just kill you instead.</string>
<string name="3216">I don&apos;t need anybody.</string>
<string name="3217">Why shouldn&apos;t I just use the rod?</string>
<string name="3218">But they know the Big Master chose you, why do you have to have the rod?</string>
<string name="3219">That&apos;s just stupid. They should just follow you.</string>
<string name="3220">Is this the rod? Here you go.</string>
<string name="3221">Where is this chief?</string>
<string name="3222">I will do what needs to be done.</string>
<string name="3223">That sounds like a good idea.</string>
<string name="3224">I do not plan to kill him.</string>
<string name="3225">To block an entire passage, the rock must be huge! What is the secret to lifting it? </string>
<string name="3226">How could you lift the rock?</string>
<string name="3227">I will be going then.</string>
<string name="3228">I need to get in to see your master. </string>
<string name="3229">How do you let visitors in? </string>
<string name="3230">Why are you a prisoner?</string>
<string name="3231">Is your &apos;big&apos; Master the dragon, Tymofarrar?</string>
<string name="3232">No, I just thought I would see what he looked like.</string>
<string name="3233">I am planning to kill him.</string>
<string name="3234">Yes, I need to speak to him.</string>
<string name="3235">Why wouldn&apos;t you let him see this &apos;big&apos; Master? </string>
<string name="3236">I don&apos;t understand. </string>
<string name="3237">Not yet.</string>
<string name="3238">I have some other questions for you.</string>
<string name="3239">That&apos;s all. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="3240">What is your name?</string>
<string name="3241">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; What a coincidence, my name is Klumph too!</string>
<string name="3242">I&apos;m not telling you that.</string>
<string name="3243">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. </string>
<string name="3244">I am &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="3245">Not yet.</string>
<string name="3246">Yes!</string>
<string name="3247">&lt;He/She&gt; is here!</string>
<string name="3248">&lt;He/She&gt; is after me!</string>
<string name="3249">AIIEEEE!!!</string>
<string name="3250">Rrruff! Leave me alone!</string>
<string name="3251">My, my. It seems I am to be continually disturbed this year. Perhaps it is time to find a new cave? Hmmn... something to consider.</string>
<string name="3252">At any rate, you&apos;ve obviously come to bother me for some reason, warmling. Make it good or I may decide to get upset.</string>
<string name="3253">Oh, not *this* again. Either you have some trick up your sleeve or this will be a very short and painful encounter, little one.</string>
<string name="3254">I&apos;ve already spoken as much about J&apos;Nah as I wish to, warmling.</string>
<string name="3255">Is that so? You wish to speak about the elven witch?</string>
<string name="3256">I&apos;ve already spoken about how J&apos;Nah foiled my plan to acquire all the artifacts, warmling. I have but a useless mask... if any have these items you seek, it is her.</string>
<string name="3257">The artifacts from the human village? Indeed?</string>
<string name="3258">Ah, yes. Deekin&apos;s name comes up once again, does it? So what about him, then?</string>
<string name="3259">Yes, yes, it&apos;s been mentioned to me that Deekin wishes to be free. How very wonderful for the free-spirited little traitor.</string>
<string name="3260">I might be willing to discuss the matter with you. I want to know first, however... what do you know of J&apos;Nah?</string>
<string name="3261">I don&apos;t see why I should discuss anything at all with you, seeing as you&apos;re involved with J&apos;Nah. Or are you?</string>
<string name="3262">I don&apos;t see why I should discuss anything at all with you, seeing as you were sent by J&apos;Nah to kill me. Or are you willing to listen to my offer?</string>
<string name="3263">Ahhh, I suppose I should not be so sore with the little lad. I really should never have sent him off to steal those artifacts, really.</string>
<string name="3264">Oh. So it is. Is it time to appoint another Master Jumper already? That would explain why the way up to their caves has been closed for so long.</string>
<string name="3265">Let me take that off your hands... and here, take this as a token. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s worth more than a simple kobold stick to you.</string>
<string name="3266">Now, then... is there anything else?</string>
<string name="3267">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; What&apos;s this? Disturbed again, am I? Ah, well... no rest for the weary, I suppose.</string>
<string name="3268">Very well then, my intrepid little &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;. Have you changed your mind about my proposal? Or is this purely a social visit?</string>
<string name="3269">*Must* we re-visit old ground? I would have to kill you, of course. Or did you think I was actually serious about the social visit?</string>
<string name="3270">Oh, fine, fine. Run along and don&apos;t bother me, then. Why you even came here is a mystery to me, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="3271">My, but you&apos;re a single-minded one, aren&apos;t you? I do hope you have something up your sleeves, lest I be overcome with deja vu.</string>
<string name="3272">Oh. So it is. Is it time to appoint another Master Jumper already? That would explain why the way up to their caves has been closed for so long.</string>
<string name="3273">Let me take that off your hands... and here, take this as a token. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s worth more than a simple kobold stick to you.</string>
<string name="3274">Now, then... about my proposal? Have you changed your mind?</string>
<string name="3275">Hmmm. Will wonders never cease. If it isn&apos;t my intrepid warmling returned to me. Tell me, little one... is the deed done or not?</string>
<string name="3276">Hmph. So J&apos;Nah made you a counter-offer, did she? How very typical. For your sake, warmling, I hope she armed you well!</string>
<string name="3277">I see. You&apos;ve decided to go through with your arrangement with J&apos;Nah after all? A pity. I hope she armed you well, warmling.</string>
<string name="3278">Then what are you waiting for? Off you go. Shoo. You have much to do.</string>
<string name="3279">I am sure you have. We can discuss that later, however... once J&apos;Nah is dead.</string>
<string name="3280">But you haven&apos;t told me if you were successful or not yet. Is she dead?</string>
<string name="3281">Especially considering I didn&apos;t keep it with J&apos;Nah, yes, I see your point.</string>
<string name="3282">Perhaps this will assure you of my sincerity: you have my oath on the draconic blood of my white ancestors that you shall be rewarded as promised and left unharmed.</string>
<string name="3283">Do not question my word further, warmling. Such an oath is not given lightly, even amongst the most evil of my brethren. Now then... is the deed done or not?</string>
<string name="3284">And I promised that I would give you the mask and more. If you&apos;ve thought of something else you want, we can discuss it once J&apos;Nah is dead.</string>
<string name="3285">And I promised my kobolds and I would stick to our mountains in the future. If you&apos;ve thought of something else you want, we can discuss it once J&apos;Nah is dead.</string>
<string name="3286">And I promised that I would not only release Deekin but give you more, as well. If you&apos;ve thought of something else you want, we can discuss it once J&apos;Nah is dead.</string>
<string name="3287">And I promised that I would give you gold and magic enough to satisfy. If you&apos;ve thought of something else you want, we can discuss it once J&apos;Nah is dead.</string>
<string name="3288">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sniff! Sniff!]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmmn. You stink of a lie, warmling. Did you honestly believe that I would be so easy to fool?</string>
<string name="3289">Go now, warmling, and do not return to me until and unless you have succeeded in your task. Go before I decide to take issue with your attempt at deception.</string>
<string name="3290">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sniff! Sniff!]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmm. You do not stink of a lie. Could it be that you are in fact telling the truth? How very amazing.</string>
<string name="3291">You have done me a good turn, my intrepid little &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;. And I have sworn an oath to repay you properly, and so I shall.</string>
<string name="3292">I must admit, you&apos;ve caught me in a generous mood. What would you like, to start off?</string>
<string name="3293">Eh? Are you certain? It is not often I give up anything freely, little one... take advantage of it while you can.</string>
<string name="3294">Odd behavior, but I&apos;ll not be one to question it. Are we through here, then, you and I?</string>
<string name="3295">I knew you could be convinced. What shall it be, then?</string>
<string name="3296">Hmm? Oh... the useless mask. It is the only one my kobolds returned with... and you are welcome to it.</string>
<string name="3297">Here it is, for what good it will do you. Use it however you will.</string>
<string name="3298">Hmph. You wish me to leave the humans alone in their little valley? Ash you wish... I say it is done. We shall restrict ourselves to the mountains henceforth.</string>
<string name="3299">Deekin? You have met my little Deekin, then, have you? And he wishes to be released, does he? Hmmm. How very sneaky of the little lad.</string>
<string name="3300">Very well, I say it is done. Give this... doll... back to Deekin. He shall know what it means.</string>
<string name="3301">Ahhh, you have a greed that I can appreciate, little one. Here... take this, then, and be sated.</string>
<string name="3302">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Chuckle!]&lt;/Start&gt; You wish a piece of my treasure, do you? Very well... this should satisfy your appetite for wealth.</string>
<string name="3303">I believe that should be sufficient rewards, then, don&apos;t you? Are we through here, you and I?</string>
<string name="3304">And after all the good times we had? Tsk. I certainly wasn&apos;t expecting this, after all we&apos;ve been through, warmling. I hope you&apos;re well-armed.</string>
<string name="3305">I see. Well... it&apos;s not worth a terrible amount, is it? At least I don&apos;t think so. 500 gold pieces should be plenty to give it up.</string>
<string name="3306">Your choice, as I said. Are we through, then?</string>
<string name="3307">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps so... but you want it, so it must have value to you, correct? 500 gold pieces, no less.</string>
<string name="3308">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps so. 300 gold pieces, then... and no lower.</string>
<string name="3309">Ahhh, good. I do so love the sight of gold.</string>
<string name="3310">Ahhh, good. I do so love the sight of gold.</string>
<string name="3311">Here you go, then... the mask artifact. At a bargain price, I am quite sure. Is that all, then? Are we through now?</string>
<string name="3312">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmmm. While it&apos;s not worth much to me, it *is* part of my horde. If you would like it, I&apos;m willing to let you negotiate for it.</string>
<string name="3313">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. I suppose it&apos;s of no real use to me. Take it and begone, and do not say I never acted kindly towards you, warmling.</string>
<string name="3314">Hmm? Ahhh... you speak of the useless mask that my kobolds returned with. Something that hardly qualifies as an &quot;artifact&quot;.</string>
<string name="3315">Hmmmmn. No. No, I don&apos;t know what value you attach to whatever&apos;s in the chest, but it&apos;s not worth 2000 gold pieces. Best try again.</string>
<string name="3316">Are you trying to insult my intelligence? There&apos;s nothing in the chest, silly warmling. Best try again.</string>
<string name="3317">Hmmm... there certainly seems to be. I say it is done... Deekin is free. Give this... doll... back to Deekin. He shall know what it means.</string>
<string name="3318">So... is that everything you wanted, my little friend? Are we through?</string>
<string name="3319">Ahhhhh, let&apos;s see. What do I want in return for losing my daily entertainment? Hmmmmn.</string>
<string name="3320">I know. I will put a chest down and you put enough items inside it that are worth 2000 gold pieces or more... then Deekin will be free.</string>
<string name="3321">That should not be too difficult, I hope? Here... I&apos;ll even open the chest for you.</string>
<string name="3322">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Deekin? You have met my little Deekin, then, have you? And he wishes to be released, does he? Hmmm. How very sneaky of the little lad.</string>
<string name="3323">I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ve gotten all the rewards you&apos;ve earned, my little friend. If you want Deekin freed, you must negotiate for it... you choice.</string>
<string name="3324">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Now why would I do that? You have used up your rewards already, warmling. If you want Deekin freed, you must negotiate for it... your choice.</string>
<string name="3325">Oh. So it is. Is it time to appoint another Master Jumper already? That would explain why the way up to their caves has been closed for so long.</string>
<string name="3326">Let me take that off your hands... and here, take this as a token. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s worth more than a simple kobold stick to you.</string>
<string name="3327">Now then... was there anything else? Or are we through?</string>
<string name="3328">You&apos;re a fine sport, my intrepid little &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;. I wish you well.</string>
<string name="3329">I am still willing to give you something more, warmling. Speak... tell me what you wish.</string>
<string name="3330">What?! Are you mad?! Me?! Actually *guarding* some... some human village?!</string>
<string name="3331">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; Very well. I will guard the human village from danger... but only because you have my oath on it.</string>
<string name="3332">Absolutely not! You ask too much of me, warmling!</string>
<string name="3333">I might be willing to give your village wide berth and keep my kobolds from it from now on... but I will promise no more than that!</string>
<string name="3334">As you wish.</string>
<string name="3335">The temerity! I have had enough!! You will die now, warmling!!</string>
<string name="3336">Then consider it done. We shall restrict ourselves to the mountains henceforth. Be glad that I agree to that much.</string>
<string name="3337">You asked for the mask artifact... and here it is. For what good it will do you. Use it however you will.</string>
<string name="3338">You asked that your Hilltop be kept safe from me and my kind. I say it is done. We shall restrict ourselves to the mountains henceforth.</string>
<string name="3339">You asked that Deekin be released. I say it is done. Give this... doll... back to Deekin. He shall know what it means.</string>
<string name="3340">You asked first for gold and magic. I believe this should be acceptable... at least for a start, yes?</string>
<string name="3341">You have done me a good turn, my intrepid little &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;. In return I shall do you one: your death shall be swift and relatively painless.</string>
<string name="3342">That&apos;s rather accepting of you, my little friend. Any last words before we proceed?</string>
<string name="3343">Tsk tsk. You needn&apos;t be such a poor sport, warmling. I certainly hope you&apos;ll be at least a little bit of a challenge... I could use the exercise.</string>
<string name="3344">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Eh? What is that? &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sniff! Sniff!]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmmmn. I don&apos;t like the smell of it. There is too much magic in that little device of yours.</string>
<string name="3345">Pfah. I am too tired and cautious to play with upstart small races all day. Have it your way, warmling... you get one reward from me. Name it.</string>
<string name="3346">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s quite necessary, I assure you. I am a greedy dragon... or did you forget that? I am not about to give up treasure unless I absolutely must.</string>
<string name="3347">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmmmn. I suppose you did rid me of a veritable nuisance. And combat is *such* a bother. Hmmm... what to do, what to do...</string>
<string name="3348">Eh? What&apos;s this?</string>
<string name="3349">Hmph. And she was correct. Why are you little folk constantly surprised when a dragon of my caliber acts according to his evil nature?</string>
<string name="3350">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps so. What does it concern me what a little thing such as yourself thinks of me, hmmn?</string>
<string name="3351">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. I don&apos;t like how that sounds. You are being very slippery, little warmling, impugning my draconic pride.</string>
<string name="3352">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; What?! She said this, did she? Hmph... of all the nerve, maligning my draconic heritage, I should... oh wait, you already did that...</string>
<string name="3353">So I did. What does that have to do with you? Did you think I would give you a generous portion of my treasure out of the goodness of my heart?</string>
<string name="3354">I also agreed to work with J&apos;Nah, didn&apos;t I? Alas, I&apos;m a greedy dragon that isn&apos;t about to part with treasure unless I absolutely must.</string>
<string name="3355">You are still due a reward from me, my little friend. Come... tell me what you wish, and let there be no hard feelings between us.</string>
<string name="3356">Yes? What is it that you wish now, warmling?</string>
<string name="3357">Yes, well... don&apos;t forget to write. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="3358">Well, well, well. A little intruder, is it? &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; Alright, let&apos;s get a look at you, then.</string>
<string name="3359">Hmmmn... mmmm... yes, interesting. Are you quite aware that you&apos;re a &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;, warmling?</string>
<string name="3360">Oh, the usual. You humans have a bit of a smell to you, odd as it is. Nothing as offensive as an orc&apos;s... more like a rabbit&apos;s. Yes, more like that.</string>
<string name="3361">And do not think I missed that display of insolence, little one. Fortunately for you, when all you&apos;ve got for company is kobolds you&apos;re often willing to overlook such foibles in your other guests.</string>
<string name="3362">Now, let&apos;s see... it&apos;s been a while since I saw my last human. Your type breeds so quickly, however, I suppose it was inevitable.</string>
<string name="3363">Hmmm. And you&apos;ve come pretty much alone, have you? Very interesting.</string>
<string name="3364">So! What are you supposed to be, little &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;? I was thinking that you were perhaps the knight of a great kingdom, but then it occurred to me I may as well ask.</string>
<string name="3365">While that is true enough, I *was* enjoying myself with the diversion. It&apos;s not every day I encounter a sentient who isn&apos;t screaming in abject terror, you know.</string>
<string name="3366">So! Enough of what I want. I&apos;d like to find out what you want, warmling. Surely you came here for a reason?</string>
<string name="3367">You wish us to work together, do you? Or do you desire to work for me? More likely you desire me to assist you with something you cannot accomplish on your own.</string>
<string name="3368">As interesting a proposition as that sounds, I find it difficult to believe that you came all the way down here on the off-chance I was in an agreeable mood.</string>
<string name="3369">There is another reason for your appearance in my cave, warmling, and I wish to hear it.</string>
<string name="3370">Mmm. I don&apos;t much care for being threatened, little one. You&apos;d best have something to back up that insolent mouth of yours, or perhaps you should shut it.</string>
<string name="3371">Ah. The dwarven wizard. You are associated with him in some manner, then? Yes, I should have suspected something like this.</string>
<string name="3372">J&apos;Nah. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Growl!]&lt;/Start&gt; How the mere name of that creature fills me with bile. The sheer audacity! The temerity! It is an affront to my draconic stature, I tell you!</string>
<string name="3373">You seem to imply that I regret any actions I have taken to get back at that elven witch. In truth, the only thing I regret is consorting with her in the first place.</string>
<string name="3374">Perhaps much, perhaps little. Regardless, the topic of the elven witch has been broached and I shall grumble about her at my leisure.</string>
<string name="3375">You are the one who brought the elven sorceress up, little one, not I. And now I shall speak of her at my leisure.</string>
<string name="3376">The elven witch sent you to deal with me, did she not? All I wish is to relate the tale of what lies behind our conflict.</string>
<string name="3377">J&apos;Nah first approached me two moons ago, sending a letter introducing herself and making a proposal that she knew I would find hard to resist.</string>
<string name="3378">There were magical artifacts of great power within easy reach, she said, guarded by a dwarven wizard. Working together we could overcome him.</string>
<string name="3379">All she desired in return for her aid, she claimed, was a single artifact... the rest I could keep for myself.</string>
<string name="3380">A statue of a tower, I believe. I imagine now it is the only artifact with any real worth.</string>
<string name="3381">I agreed to her terms, and found out after my kobolds returned from the raid that she had *dared* to attack them! She tried to take all the artifacts herself!!</string>
<string name="3382">Try to keep up with me, warmling. Yes, it is J&apos;Nah who commanded the gnolls to attack my kobolds. I had, after all, sent them in early to take all the artifacts for myself.</string>
<string name="3383">Exactly. I wanted to see this tower statue for myself before I even considered releasing it to her. Why would she want it, after all, unless it was the best?</string>
<string name="3384">I am a dragon and I will not allow myself to be tricked by a mere lesser being. The fact that she attacked my minions only proves her deceitful intent.</string>
<string name="3385">Tell me... what do *you* know of J&apos;Nah, little one? For all I know you could have been sent here by her.</string>
<string name="3386">Speaking of which, it was you who mentioned the witch&apos;s name. Why is that, I wonder? Did she send you here, little one?</string>
<string name="3387">Truly? Now that, my little friend, is a fortunate thing... for both of us.</string>
<string name="3388">There is a saying amongst dragons, warmling. It goes thus: &quot;Sweet as blood, rich as flame, rarer than gold this deadly game.&quot; Do you know what it speaks of?</string>
<string name="3389">Err... no. No, it speaks of revenge, of course. Cold, sweet revenge.</string>
<string name="3390">It speaks of revenge, of course. Cold, sweet revenge.</string>
<string name="3391">Very good. Revenge, indeed.</string>
<string name="3392">I desire vengeance upon J&apos;Nah. Kill her for me, little one, and you shall be rewarded.</string>
<string name="3393">Such words are pleasant to hear. Very well, little one... a bargain it is.</string>
<string name="3394">Here... I am giving you a flask full of powder. Use it on J&apos;Nah and she will be severely weakened. It plays havoc, you see, with her... unique physiology.</string>
<string name="3395">Another gift for you. This is a key... do you see that square-shaped rock beside the wall? Use the key on it and you will be brought straight outside.</string>
<string name="3396">Head south of these mountains into the region you call the High Forest. There is a cave of gnolls there which J&apos;Nah rules.</string>
<string name="3397">Go and do what you must, warmling. I wish you luck.</string>
<string name="3398">You should know where J&apos;Nah&apos;s cave lies, yes? Go there and do what you must, warmling. I wish you luck.</string>
<string name="3399">Should you refuse? Why... then I suppose I would decide to be upset over the great number of kobolds you no doubt have slain in order to get here.</string>
<string name="3400">Well, I *am* a dragon, my little friend. There is no reason for us to go that route, however, is there? I can reward you so well.</string>
<string name="3401">Now that is a fair question, naturally. I would not expect you to perform such a feat on my behalf without some sort of compensation.</string>
<string name="3402">Do you wish gold? Magic? What sort of reward interests you, warmling?</string>
<string name="3403">As you wish. Do not get too extravagant, however, with your request.</string>
<string name="3404">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Chuckle!]&lt;/Start&gt; Certainly. You may have gold and magic both, my little friend. I am certain I can find something to interest you around here.</string>
<string name="3405">Oh-ho! Suddenly my little Deekin enters the picture, does he? How very odd that you should suddenly bring up my lost little bard.</string>
<string name="3406">Ahhhh, poor Deekin. For such a little kobold he has very big dreams. Very foolish dreams, to be sure, but dreams nonetheless. I should never have sent him away.</string>
<string name="3407">But if you wish him freed, it will be done. That and other rewards as well, for his freedom is but a small, small thing.</string>
<string name="3408">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Chuckle!]&lt;/Start&gt; You wish Deekin freed, do you? Very well, you&apos;ll have that and other rewards as well for his freedom is but a small thing.</string>
<string name="3409">Now will you do as I ask, hmmm?</string>
<string name="3410">Indeed. You&apos;re welcome to it... that and other rewards, too, as I hardly think the mask is suitable by itself.</string>
<string name="3411">Mmm. I only possess that useless mask, and you&apos;re welcome to it... that and other rewards, too, as I hardly think the mask is suitable by itself.</string>
<string name="3412">Ahhh... I see. Very well, warmling. It is a small price to pay... there are plenty of humanoids in these mountains to keep me fed and my kobolds occupied, I am sure.</string>
<string name="3413">Especially considering I didn&apos;t keep it with J&apos;Nah, yes, I see your point.</string>
<string name="3414">Perhaps this will assure you of my sincerity: you have my oath on the draconic blood of my white ancestors that you shall be rewarded as promised and left unharmed.</string>
<string name="3415">Do not question my word further, warmling. Such an oath is not given lightly even amongst the most evil of my brethren. Now... do you agree to my task?</string>
<string name="3416">Do not question my word further, warmling. Such an oath is not given lightly even amongst the most evil of my brethren. Now... do you have a reward in mind, even?</string>
<string name="3417">I would be willing to free Deekin from my service, for instance. Does that interest you?</string>
<string name="3418">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Chuckle!]&lt;/Start&gt; Poor little Deekin, is it? Very well, warmling... what else might you ask of me? Gold? Magic?</string>
<string name="3419">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Chuckle!]&lt;/Start&gt; Very well, you&apos;ll have that and other rewards as well, for his freedom is but a small thing.</string>
<string name="3420">I will tell you where to find her, naturally.</string>
<string name="3421">I will give you something that will make killing the sorceress much easier, of course. You did not think I would send you in empty-handed, did you?</string>
<string name="3422">Ahhh, now that is an excellent question. I imagine I very well could do such a thing... hunt down the little villainess and exact my revenge personally.</string>
<string name="3423">J&apos;Nah, however, has... superiors. Superiors who wield a great deal of power. I would rather not anger them, if I can avoid it.</string>
<string name="3424">I do not know for certain. I can only suspect. Still... I would rather the risk be yours than mine. I&apos;m certain you understand.</string>
<string name="3425">Bah! No truce! There shall be no peace between us!</string>
<string name="3426">Why the witch would send you on such a fool&apos;s errand I do not know. I, however, have a different offer for you... if you would consider it.</string>
<string name="3427">I see. That is good, for it gives me an idea.</string>
<string name="3428">Hmmm. I sense that you lie to me, little one. But no matter. If you are deceitful, perhaps you will consider a proposal from myself?</string>
<string name="3429">I see. That is good, for it gives me an idea.</string>
<string name="3430">I see. But I do not have the statue... only a useless mask. Tell me, little one... would you be open to a proposal of a different sort?</string>
<string name="3431">I see. But, as I have already said, I do not have the statue. Tell me, little one... would you be open to a proposal of a different sort?</string>
<string name="3432">Mmm. Then I eat you, of course. I rather thought that would be obvious.</string>
<string name="3433">And? Do you intend to go through with such a hopeless mission, little one? Or are you open to... negotiation?</string>
<string name="3434">And here you are, sent by the witch to kill me. Do you intend to go through with the hopeless mission, little one? Or are you open to... negotiation?</string>
<string name="3435">Ah. I do hope you have something to back up that impertinent mouth of yours, warmling, or this could be a short battle indeed.</string>
<string name="3436">I&apos;m afraid not, little one. You&apos;ve bored me, I fear.</string>
<string name="3437">That is a fortunate thing... for both of us.</string>
<string name="3438">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; Sadly, no, just a mask with no real power. I wanted to see that tower statue for myself before I released it... why would she want it, after all, unless it was the best?</string>
<string name="3439">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; As I already said, just the mask. I wanted to see that tower statue for myself before I released it... why would she want it, after all, unless it was the best?</string>
<string name="3440">And what is the relevance of that? I wanted to see this statue for myself before I even considered releasing it. Why would she want it, after all, unless it was the best?</string>
<string name="3441">No, I don&apos;t believe so. Not that I cared. I sent my kobolds in early to take all the artifacts for myself, but she showed great temerity in attacking me back!</string>
<string name="3442">Indeed. I had sent in my kobolds early in order to take all the artifacts for myself. But what does that matter? How dare she attack me!</string>
<string name="3443">I do not believe that was her intent. I had sent in my kobolds early to take all the artifacts for myself. It was she that had the gall to actually attack me for it.</string>
<string name="3444">I had sent in my kobolds early to take all the artifacts for myself. I had not planned on giving her anything. But she had the distinct gall to actually attack me for it.</string>
<string name="3445">Indeed. The tower statue.</string>
<string name="3446">Laugh if you wish, little one. The elven sorceress has provoked my wrath more than any other creatures has ever dared.</string>
<string name="3447">Hmph. I could not care less what the elven witch thinks. She goes too far with this insult!</string>
<string name="3448">Correction: I sent the kobolds to steal artifacts, not to attack the human village. Kobolds being what they are, however, I&apos;m sure they got carried away.</string>
<string name="3449">Not that I&apos;m very concerned over the matter, but just how is it that you know these were *my* kobolds? This isn&apos;t the only cave of kobolds in these mountains, warmling.</string>
<string name="3450">Clever, clever &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;. Lucky for you I am not concerned over the matter, or I would be angry at being outsmarted by someone so small.</string>
<string name="3451">So Deekin told you about me, did he? That is not so very surprising. I should never have sent him on the mission to the human village in the first place.</string>
<string name="3452">Mmm. I must say that this entire business with the artifacts has been rather irritating. I never really needed them to begin with, and acquiring them has been more difficult than I&apos;d have liked.</string>
<string name="3453">All that effort, for instance, and what do I end up with? A mask that I cannot even use. J&apos;Nah lied about the power these objects hold... and a great many other things, as well, I am certain.</string>
<string name="3454">Ahhh, Deekin. My finest experiment, really. You can lead a kobold to water, but can you make him think?</string>
<string name="3455">At first I thought I would never be able to teach the little lad anything at all. All he would do is cower about me and cry &quot;Master!&quot; if I so much as twitched.</string>
<string name="3456">But he improved remarkably with time. Obviously you&apos;ve encountered him somewhere in the world above, yes? Tell me: where is he now?</string>
<string name="3457">Not very. Keep your information if you wish, I&apos;ll track down little Deekin eventually... it&apos;s of no great concern.</string>
<string name="3458">But you said you wished to talk about Deekin, didn&apos;t you? What about him?</string>
<string name="3459">That&apos;s very silly. Deekin doesn&apos;t want me dead... not truly. I know the lad quite well. This is all about him being free again, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="3460">So take it from him. What do I care? Why would you need to come all this way to tell me that?</string>
<string name="3461">Ahhhh, poor Deekin. For such a little kobold he has very big dreams. Very foolish dreams, to be sure, but dreams nonetheless. I should never have sent him away.</string>
<string name="3462">No? I could force the answer out of you, I&apos;m sure, if I truly desired it. But I don&apos;t just yet... and we&apos;ve been having such a pleasant discussion, why ruin it?</string>
<string name="3463">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sniff! Sniff!]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmmm. I smell a lie on you, warmling. Why would you lie on little, insignificant Deekin&apos;s behalf, hmm? No matter.</string>
<string name="3464">Hiding in a human village? How very odd. Well, so be it... I&apos;ll simply have to retrieve him sometime, if he hasn&apos;t gotten himself killed already, that is.</string>
<string name="3465">Oh. So it is. Is it time to appoint another Master Jumper already? That would explain why the way up to their caves has been closed for so long.</string>
<string name="3466">Let me take that off your hands... and here, take this as a token. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s worth more than a simple kobold stick to you.</string>
<string name="3467">Now I&apos;m sure you came down here for a better reason than to turn over some stick you probably killed for, hmm?</string>
<string name="3468">No? Well, that&apos;s very sad. I do so enjoy being amused.</string>
<string name="3469">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sniff! Sniff!]&lt;/Start&gt; Truly? I don&apos;t catch the barest whiff of magic in you, even. Now that is quite a talent, warmling, I&apos;ll admit. I am impressed.</string>
<string name="3470">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sniff! Sniff!]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes, well... I can smell magic on you, warmling, but you&apos;re no Elminster the Sage. Make no mistake, though, I&apos;m still quivering in my scales.</string>
<string name="3471">Oh dear. Trying to negotiate with the puritanical can be such a bother. At least you look like a knight. I shall just pretend, if it&apos;s all right with you.</string>
<string name="3472">So what does that mean? I don&apos;t even rank a proper knight from an actual kingdom? &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; No offense, warmling, but a dragon has to have his standards.</string>
<string name="3473">Mmm. A religious type, are you? Would you believe an orc convert to Cyric once attempted to proselytize me? I believe he&apos;s still in a block of ice around here.</string>
<string name="3474">Nature has servants? Do you do her laundry, then? Does she wake you in the night to fetch her cake? Oh, you needn&apos;t glare, warmling... I am only teasing you.</string>
<string name="3475">Did you say &quot;martial&quot; arts? I must admit I&apos;ve never heard of such an odd thing. Does that mean you use your hands? Those little appendages? Seriously?</string>
<string name="3476">Yes, well, not to insult the great amount of effort I&apos;m sure you put into your castings, but that&apos;s nothing new in these parts. Even kobolds carry a little draconic blood in them, you know.</string>
<string name="3477">Is that so? Are you here searching for a dragon&apos;s treasure horde, then? If that were the case, one would think it odd that you&apos;d announce such to the dragon, no?</string>
<string name="3478">At any rate... I realize this may not be your forte, warmling, but might you indulge a bored dragon with a song, perhaps? The kobolds are simply awful at such things, you see.</string>
<string name="3479">Well in that case forget I asked. I once had a troglodyte attempt a song-and-dance routine that... let&apos;s just say the nightmares were not worth it.</string>
<string name="3480">At any rate... I&apos;ve heard that elven folk are gifted with a flair for poetry and such. Might you indulge a bored dragon with a little entertainment, hmmm?</string>
<string name="3481">Hmmm. Tempting, but no. I&apos;ve heard too many long and rambling tales as of late... I&apos;d likely fall asleep, and then what would you get up to?</string>
<string name="3482">Truly? I&apos;m rather fond of bards, to tell you honestly. Music, poetry, tales of adventure... all of them make the long years pass that much more enjoyably.</string>
<string name="3483">Seeing as you&apos;re a bard, perhaps you&apos;ll agree to play me a little song? Something to lift a bored dragon&apos;s spirits, hmmm? I could use the entertainment.</string>
<string name="3484">Have it your way, warmling. Though I can&apos;t say I am not disappointed. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="3485">Mmm. Perhaps a little, although I do so enjoy a good song.</string>
<string name="3486">My, my, my. Now that is a fine talent you have there, warmling. Much better than the so-called entertainment I used to get.</string>
<string name="3487">Here... take this. Consider it a trinket of favor bestowed upon you by a grateful patron of the arts, yes?</string>
<string name="3488">And let&apos;s see... hmmm. You&apos;re not alone, either, are you? Most interesting.</string>
<string name="3489">But enough of that. What else do you have with you? Mmmm. A dwarven woman, is it? A beardless dwarven woman, no less.</string>
<string name="3490">You act aged and superior, dragon, but I can see your true age. Do not think that all who are small are also short of wit.</string>
<string name="3491">A good thing for you, too, little one, else you&apos;d barely possess the intelligence to carry your weapon, mm?</string>
<string name="3492">Mock me if you wish, dragon. I am not frightened of you.</string>
<string name="3493">Frightened? Why ever should you be frightened? We are merely conversing here, aren&apos;t we? Like civilized sentient beings, yes?</string>
<string name="3494">But enough of that. What else do you have with you? Mmmm. A half-orc with bad taste in clothing, I see.</string>
<string name="3495">Wha-aat? I am to be judged by an overgrown lizard that lives in a cave? I think not!</string>
<string name="3496">Mind your manners, little one. I&apos;ve never found that poor taste equaled poor taste, if you get my meaning. Still... there is all that orcish blood to get past.</string>
<string name="3497">Are you suggesting you would eat the great Xanos?!</string>
<string name="3498">Ugh. Not unless I had to, that&apos;s for certain.</string>
<string name="3499">And that&apos;s about it, is it? Hmmm. I wonder if I should be insulted or pleased at such a poor showing.</string>
<string name="3500">Now, then, let&apos;s see. Hmmm. You&apos;ve others here, as well. Well, that&apos;s to be expected, I suppose.</string>
<string name="3501">Now, then... what else do you have with you? Mmmm. A dwarven woman, is it? A beardless dwarven woman, no less.</string>
<string name="3502">I believe I had a pair of your grey brethren tunnel their way in here several years ago. Rather stubborn, they were. Stringy, too, not half as tender as I prefer.</string>
<string name="3503">I&apos;ve always wondered... why does your kind not mix blood with the elves? Or the dwarves? Or the gnomes, now there&apos;s a thought. Never mind, keep your secrets.</string>
<string name="3504">I wonder... when was the last time I saw one of your kind? Elves, yes. Humans, yes. But the only place they&apos;ve mixed was in my stomachs.</string>
<string name="3505">Hmmm. The last elf I saw was... well, now, it was a whole army of elves, wasn&apos;t it? I don&apos;t recall what they were so upset about, but there you have it.</string>
<string name="3506">When was the last time I saw a gnome? Hmmm. Some of your grey-kin spilled into my cavern a long time ago, I believe. Rather bland and chewy, to be honest.</string>
<string name="3507">Hmmm. When was the last time I saw one of your kind? I seem to remember halflings as crunchy yet unfilling, but I don&apos;t remember how.</string>
<string name="3508">Are you joking? I&apos;ve yet to meet a dwarf who didn&apos;t smell like a slab of rock and look the part, as well. I must say I&apos;ve seen better beards, however.</string>
<string name="3509">Well, the smell, for starters. It&apos;s rather unique, and not all the human blood in Faerun will hide it much.</string>
<string name="3510">It&apos;s difficult with your kind, but I&apos;d have to go with the ears. Sometimes they&apos;re hard to spot, however, with all that shaggy human hair your people possess.</string>
<string name="3511">Oh, the usual... the ears, the slight bone structure, that sense of superiority etched into your facial expression. Oh, don&apos;t bother denying it.</string>
<string name="3512">It&apos;s true, I thought you were perhaps a halfling at first. The nose is a bit of a giveaway, I&apos;m afraid. Are you gnomes sensitive about such things?</string>
<string name="3513">The diminutive stature and the oddly-shaped head, if you must know. Why, you&apos;re no larger than one of my tiny kobolds, are you?</string>
<string name="3514">You needn&apos;t get so excited, little one. It&apos;s hard enough to tell the small races from one another even without all your silly in-breeding, so don&apos;t get angry at me.</string>
<string name="3515">Of course I have. If I&apos;d never seen one of you, I wouldn&apos;t be able to identify you now, would I? Though I admit all the in-breeding does get confusing.</string>
<string name="3516">Nothing wrong with *your* eyes, I see. The name is Tymofarrar, little one. You may add on &quot;the White&quot;, &quot;the Magnificent&quot; or any other appellation you feel matches my grandeur.</string>
<string name="3517">So it knows my name, does it? How very interesting. Does this mean I&apos;ve become famous in the world above? Have you come to worship me adoringly?</string>
<string name="3518">No, your kind never does, does it? Not since the really olden days, of course, but let&apos;s not jest with ourselves. Those days are long over.</string>
<string name="3519">Hmmmn... mmmm... yes, interesting. Are you quite aware that you&apos;re an &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;, warmling?</string>
<string name="3520">Then get upset. I&apos;ve come to kill you, dragon.</string>
<string name="3521">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Break the Ice Phylactery]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ve got something up my sleeve alright!</string>
<string name="3522">I want to talk about J&apos;Nah.</string>
<string name="3523">I want to talk about the artifacts you stole.</string>
<string name="3524">I want to talk about Deekin.</string>
<string name="3525">I think this rod is yours.</string>
<string name="3526">Never mind that. I&apos;m here to kill you, dragon.</string>
<string name="3527">And if I haven&apos;t changed my mind?</string>
<string name="3528">Err... then I&apos;ll just go back the way I came...</string>
<string name="3529">Then you leave me no choice. We fight.</string>
<string name="3530">And what would I get if I agreed?</string>
<string name="3531">Which proposal is that?</string>
<string name="3532">I think this rod is yours.</string>
<string name="3533">Actually, I&apos;ve decided to kill you instead.</string>
<string name="3534">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Break the Ice Phylactery]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m armed well, indeed.</string>
<string name="3535">No, she&apos;s not dead yet.</string>
<string name="3536">I&apos;ve been thinking about my reward...</string>
<string name="3537">I want to be sure, first, that you&apos;ll honor your deal.</string>
<string name="3538">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s done. J&apos;Nah is dead.</string>
<string name="3539">It&apos;s done. J&apos;Nah is dead.</string>
<string name="3540">That&apos;s enough. I don&apos;t want anything.</string>
<string name="3541">The time has come for you to die.</string>
<string name="3542">I do not want any more &quot;rewards&quot; from you.</string>
<string name="3543">Perhaps you&apos;re right.</string>
<string name="3544">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Break the Ice Phylactery]&lt;/Start&gt; My reward will be your death!</string>
<string name="3545">I want whatever artifacts you stole from Hilltop.</string>
<string name="3546">Give me the mask artifact.</string>
<string name="3547">I want you to act as Hilltop&apos;s guardian against danger.</string>
<string name="3548">I want you to leave Hilltop alone from now on.</string>
<string name="3549">I want Deekin released from your service.</string>
<string name="3550">I want more gold and magic.</string>
<string name="3551">I would like gold and magic.</string>
<string name="3552">The time has come for you to die.</string>
<string name="3553">I would like to negotiate for the mask artifact.</string>
<string name="3554">Forget it.</string>
<string name="3555">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s a little steep for something you don&apos;t want.</string>
<string name="3556">Very well. 300 gold it is.</string>
<string name="3557">Done. Here you go.</string>
<string name="3558">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I need that mask artifact, as well.</string>
<string name="3559">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I want whatever artifacts you stole from Hilltop.</string>
<string name="3560">Is there enough in the chest to free Deekin?</string>
<string name="3561">I would like to negotiate for Deekin&apos;s freedom.</string>
<string name="3562">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Would you consider releasing Deekin from your service, as well?</string>
<string name="3563">I should go.</string>
<string name="3564">I believe this rod is yours?</string>
<string name="3565">Yes, we&apos;re through.</string>
<string name="3566">But I don&apos;t want you to leave Hilltop alone... I want you to guard it from danger.</string>
<string name="3567">Why not? Are you saying you can&apos;t do it?</string>
<string name="3568">Not always, just if it&apos;s ever threatened again.</string>
<string name="3569">You gave your oath, remember?</string>
<string name="3570">You did promise that Hilltop would be safe.</string>
<string name="3571">Forget it, then. I&apos;ll ask for something else.</string>
<string name="3572">No! That&apos;s not good enough!</string>
<string name="3573">That will have to do.</string>
<string name="3574">Uh-oh...</string>
<string name="3575">I figured as much. Have it your way, then.</string>
<string name="3576">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Break the Ice Phylactery]&lt;/Start&gt; How about &quot;phylactery&quot;?</string>
<string name="3577">You traitorous creature! I&apos;ll kill you for this!</string>
<string name="3578">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Break the Ice Phylactery]&lt;/Start&gt; How&apos;s this for a challenge?</string>
<string name="3579">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m warning you... attack me and I use this phylactery!</string>
<string name="3580">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Is this really necessary? Can&apos;t we talk this over?</string>
<string name="3581">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You know, this is just what J&apos;Nah warned me you would do...</string>
<string name="3582">J&apos;Nah told me you couldn&apos;t be trusted.</string>
<string name="3583">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; But you&apos;re so intelligent, I was sure you could be reasoned with that all this isn&apos;t necessary...</string>
<string name="3584">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade/Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; So J&apos;Nah was the more trustworthy of you two.</string>
<string name="3585">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade/Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; So she was right. You aren&apos;t noble and benevolent like other dragons.</string>
<string name="3586">But I thought you wanted J&apos;Nah dead!</string>
<string name="3587">But you agreed to reward me!</string>
<string name="3588">Nothing. I should go.</string>
<string name="3589">What was your first clue?</string>
<string name="3590">What I am isn&apos;t important.</string>
<string name="3591">I&apos;m hoping we can work together.</string>
<string name="3592">I&apos;m here to kill you, actually.</string>
<string name="3593">I will destroy you, dragon. Let&apos;s end this now.</string>
<string name="3594">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Break the Ice Phylactery]&lt;/Start&gt; I have something to back up my threat, all right!</string>
<string name="3595">You&apos;re responsible for nearly killing Master Drogan!</string>
<string name="3596">You must pay for sending your kobolds to attack Hilltop!</string>
<string name="3597">J&apos;Nah may have sent me to kill you, but that doesn&apos;t mean I will do it.</string>
<string name="3598">I want to talk about J&apos;Nah.</string>
<string name="3599">Are you trying to shift responsibility for what you&apos;ve done?</string>
<string name="3600">What does this have to do with me?</string>
<string name="3601">Why? What did this J&apos;Nah do?</string>
<string name="3602">Which artifact was that?</string>
<string name="3603">J&apos;Nah commands the gnolls, then?</string>
<string name="3604">Smart move on your part.</string>
<string name="3605">Actually, I killed her.</string>
<string name="3606">J&apos;Nah is my enemy, as she is yours.</string>
<string name="3607">I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="3608">Umm... life?</string>
<string name="3609">Umm... death?</string>
<string name="3610">Umm... gems?</string>
<string name="3611">Power?</string>
<string name="3612">Murder?</string>
<string name="3613">Revenge?</string>
<string name="3614">Revenge, of course.</string>
<string name="3615">Very well. I agree.</string>
<string name="3616">And should I refuse?</string>
<string name="3617">Then you leave me little choice. I agree.</string>
<string name="3618">Then I refuse. I would rather kill you, beast.</string>
<string name="3619">What do I get if I agree, then?</string>
<string name="3620">You would attack me?</string>
<string name="3621">What do I get for doing this?</string>
<string name="3622">I&apos;ll think of something later.</string>
<string name="3623">Magic interests me.</string>
<string name="3624">Gold sounds like a good start.</string>
<string name="3625">I want Deekin freed from your service.</string>
<string name="3626">I want the mask artifact.</string>
<string name="3627">I want any of the artifacts you took from Hilltop.</string>
<string name="3628">I want Hilltop to be safe.</string>
<string name="3629">How do I know you&apos;ll even keep your word?</string>
<string name="3630">It&apos;s a good start.</string>
<string name="3631">Not really, no.</string>
<string name="3632">Yes, Deekin must be freed.</string>
<string name="3633">And where do I find this J&apos;Nah?</string>
<string name="3634">And just how would I be able to kill her?</string>
<string name="3635">Why not kill her yourself?</string>
<string name="3636">Who are these superiors of hers?</string>
<string name="3637">And what if I said I already killed her?</string>
<string name="3638">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; She sent me to arrange a truce between you.</string>
<string name="3639">No, but I&apos;ve heard of her.</string>
<string name="3640">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; No, but I&apos;ve heard of her.</string>
<string name="3641">She sent me to retrieve the tower statue.</string>
<string name="3642">And if I&apos;m not?</string>
<string name="3643">I guess I&apos;ll hear your proposal, then.</string>
<string name="3644">Not if I kill you first, you won&apos;t.</string>
<string name="3645">She sent me to kill you, actually.</string>
<string name="3646">I can&apos;t back out, now. I have to kill you.</string>
<string name="3647">Wait! I&apos;ve changed my mind!</string>
<string name="3648">I never intended to do as she asked, anyhow.</string>
<string name="3649">I&apos;m willing to listen to what you have to say.</string>
<string name="3650">But you didn&apos;t get all the artifacts, right?</string>
<string name="3651">So you broke your deal with her?</string>
<string name="3652">So she lied about only wanting the tower statue?</string>
<string name="3653">But she said it was you who betrayed *her*.</string>
<string name="3654">But all J&apos;Nah wanted was the tower statue. Why try to take the rest?</string>
<string name="3655">But why attack you if the deed was already done?</string>
<string name="3656">The tower statue.</string>
<string name="3657">The two of you don&apos;t get along, do you?</string>
<string name="3658">Odd. She says you deserve to die for the same reasons.</string>
<string name="3659">I suppose it&apos;s a good thing I killed her, then?</string>
<string name="3660">You sent those kobolds to attack Hilltop!</string>
<string name="3661">I have my sources.</string>
<string name="3662">I followed their tracks back here, actually.</string>
<string name="3663">J&apos;Nah told me all about it.</string>
<string name="3664">Deekin told me about you.</string>
<string name="3665">You just told me. That&apos;s how I know.</string>
<string name="3666">I want to talk about the artifacts you stole.</string>
<string name="3667">I&apos;m here to talk to you about Deekin.</string>
<string name="3668">How badly do you want to know?</string>
<string name="3669">Deekin wants you dead.</string>
<string name="3670">Deekin said you sent the kobolds to attack Hilltop.</string>
<string name="3671">He has an artifact that I need.</string>
<string name="3672">Because I&apos;m here to kill you so I can get it.</string>
<string name="3673">Deekin&apos;s hidden it. He won&apos;t give it to me unless I prove to him you&apos;re dead.</string>
<string name="3674">Deekin&apos;s hidden it. He won&apos;t give it to me unless you free him from your service.</string>
<string name="3675">I don&apos;t understand. Aren&apos;t you trying to collect all the artifacts?</string>
<string name="3676">He wants to be free of your service.</string>
<string name="3677">I&apos;m not going to tell you that.</string>
<string name="3678">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I believe he&apos;s deep within the High Forest.</string>
<string name="3679">He&apos;s probably hiding in Blumberg.</string>
<string name="3680">I believe this rod is yours?</string>
<string name="3681">I am not here to amuse you, dragon!</string>
<string name="3682">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade/Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; I am a great and powerful mage! You&apos;d best beware.</string>
<string name="3683">I am a champion of law and justice above all else.</string>
<string name="3684">I may not be a knight, but I am a warrior.</string>
<string name="3685">I am a cleric, dragon. A servant of the gods.</string>
<string name="3686">I am a servant of nature, if you must know.</string>
<string name="3687">I am a master of the martial arts.</string>
<string name="3688">I am no knight. I am a wielder of the arcane arts.</string>
<string name="3689">I am a rogue, dragon, and nothing more.</string>
<string name="3690">I&apos;m not certain I&apos;d be better than your kobolds.</string>
<string name="3691">I could tell you a tale, if you&apos;re willing.</string>
<string name="3692">I can play you a song, if you wish.</string>
<string name="3693">I am a bard, if you must know.</string>
<string name="3694">I&apos;d prefer to discuss matters seriously.</string>
<string name="3695">I will not be toyed with, dragon!</string>
<string name="3696">I do hope you&apos;re joking.</string>
<string name="3697">Play you a song? Certainly.</string>
<string name="3698">Of course I&apos;m aware of that!</string>
<string name="3699">Have you never seen my kind before?</string>
<string name="3700">Err... you&apos;re a dragon, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="3701">Are you Tymofarrar?</string>
<string name="3702">Yip, good thing chief be smart and no tries to kill you. </string>
<string name="3703">Yip, me remembers you! You speak to Chief, him will wants to speak to you, yip.</string>
<string name="3704">Yip! You talks to chief!</string>
<string name="3705">It is likely that this mechanism is here to help lift the boulder, but it seems to be missing the part to make the machine operational.</string>
<string name="3706">As you place the rod in the slot, you hear a loud rumbling as the machine comes to life.</string>
<string name="3707">Do nothing.</string>
<string name="3708">Place the Rod of Ruler in the slot.</string>
<string name="3709">The oxen snort in your direction, being typically ornery animals.</string>
<string name="3710">The ox has an itch right behind its ear and wishes you would just open the gate a little and come give it a nice scratching. It really thinks you might fall for this ploy to open the gate.</string>
<string name="3711">The ox waxes philosophical, wondering if it is really a butterfly dreaming it is an ox, or an ox dreaming it is a butterfly, dreaming it is an ox.</string>
<string name="3712">The ox wonders if you could just open the gate a little so it could go for a leisurely stroll. Despite its protests to the opposite, you are pretty sure it would immediately stampede across the bridge.</string>
<string name="3713">The ox wonders how stupid the kobolds must be, since they have been trying to breed the oxen, but there are no females in the herd.</string>
<string name="3714">The ox tells you that yesterday its good friend Tom was led off to the east and never returned. The week before it was Sam. He is almost positive ox-heaven might be just past the bridge.</string>
<string name="3715">The ox huffs about the lack of sunlight to nap in and the lack of delicious fresh grass.</string>
<string name="3716">The ox gazes at you with big, soft, oxen eyes and you sense the deep gratitude of the beast.</string>
<string name="3717">Hello ox.</string>
<string name="3718">On closer inspection, there appears to be a large and obvious keyhole carved into the center of this stone.</string>
<string name="3719">On closer inspection, there appears to be a large and obvious keyhole carved into the center of this stone.  A large stone key seems to be stuck in the keyhole.</string>
<string name="3720">Do nothing.</string>
<string name="3721">Insert the stone key into the keyhole.</string>
<string name="3722">Turn the key.</string>
<string name="3723">On closer inspection, there appears to be a large and obvious keyhole carved into the center of this stone.</string>
<string name="3724">On closer inspection, there appears to be a large and obvious keyhole carved into the center of this stone.  A large stone key seems to be stuck in the keyhole.</string>
<string name="3725">Do nothing.</string>
<string name="3726">Insert the stone key into the keyhole.</string>
<string name="3727">Turn the key.</string>
<string name="3728">Oh, it be you again! That not take very long. You gots good news for Deekin maybe?</string>
<string name="3729">Ummm... Deekin not want to be offensive, but Deekin gots big trouble believing that. You gots something to prove Master dead, maybe?</string>
<string name="3730">That big surprise? Someone say they kill dragon, you not asks for proof? Killing dragon happen every day where you comes from?</string>
<string name="3731">Then Deekin gots no choice. He gots to wait here until &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; brings him proof. Deekin is sorry.</string>
<string name="3732">Mask? Oh... magic stuff we stole. Deekin not know Master even has mask... so how that be proof? Proof you steals back, maybe, but not proof Master be dead.</string>
<string name="3733">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You think Deekin born yesterday? It not happen that someone kill big dragon every day... Deekin not think asking for proof very big deal.</string>
<string name="3734">So you gots proof or not? You say you kill old Master, Deekin say that pretty big claim.</string>
<string name="3735">Ahhh! You no loses cool now! Please please, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;! Deekin gladly give you statue... he just must be sure!</string>
<string name="3736">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ummm... okay, okay. Deekin take your word for it. You looks like you go through hell and back anyways...</string>
<string name="3737">...so this mean old Master is dead? He really dead!! Deekin be free, yay!! Deekin be free!</string>
<string name="3738">Deekin so happy! You waits here... Deekin get statue and be right back!</string>
<string name="3739">Ohhh? And, ummm, what he say, exactly...?</string>
<string name="3740">Uh-huh. Deekin thought so... &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; just wants statue for free. Shames on you! Shames on &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;!</string>
<string name="3741">Deekin just waits right here until you goes and does what he asks.</string>
<string name="3742">Well, that hurt Deekin&apos;s feelings, it does. But Deekin gots great confidence in abilities of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; to convince Old Master!</string>
<string name="3743">Oh! Goody! Then you go and does that and Deekin be free! Deekin so happy!</string>
<string name="3744">Deekin wait here until you goes and kills that one you say. Cannot be hard as dragon to kill, yes?</string>
<string name="3745">Old Master... give you Deekin&apos;s doll? &lt;StartAction&gt;[sniff!]&lt;/Start&gt; Deekin all choked up now. Deekin really be free! Yay!!</string>
<string name="3746">Ummm... yup, that sound like Master, alright. He not gives you doll, maybe? Ahh, is no matter. Deekin free now! Yay!!</string>
<string name="3747">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; And, ummm... he not gives you anything to gives to Deekin?</string>
<string name="3748">Deekin gots hard time believing that you tells the truth. Old Master would gives you something if he say Deekin free.</string>
<string name="3749">No no! Please no hurt Deekin! Deekin just want not to be afraid anymore! Please... &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; talks to old Master, please! Then Deekin give you statue, Deekin promises!</string>
<string name="3750">Aahh! Deekin so sorry! Deekin not mean to get &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; upset! Please forgive little Deekin! Please please!</string>
<string name="3751">Oh. Deekin just ask little question of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Deekin not mean to make &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; mad, no no! Deekin sorry!</string>
<string name="3752">Oh, that be okay. Deekin be very confident that &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; comes through for Deekin in the end. That how all great stories go!</string>
<string name="3753">Maybe... maybe &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; needs help from Deekin? Deekin help &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; gladly! Anything &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; wants!</string>
<string name="3754">Deekin didn&apos;t think so, but Deekin always willing to try his best. It is one of Deekin&apos;s better qualities... or so old Master used to always tell him.</string>
<string name="3755">Oh! Deekin knows much, he does! Deekin know all stories and songs, knows bardic lore like back of hand!</string>
<string name="3756">What does &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; wants to know? Deekin, he tell you everything!</string>
<string name="3757">Ummm... you just gots to takes word of Deekin on that.</string>
<string name="3758">Deekin can describes little statue good. At least... Deekin remembers what it look like before it gets all broken.</string>
<string name="3759">But there be shiny little rock inside statue! How Deekin know that if he not gots it?</string>
<string name="3760">If &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; wants to look for statue elsewhere, you can go do that... but you not finds it, and Deekin not be tricked to give it up before he good and ready!</string>
<string name="3761">Ummm... Deekin knows you looks for statue, but he not knows why. You tells Deekin then he knows.</string>
<string name="3762">You see for yourself when Deekin give you statue, Deekin not lies! You think Deekin not surprised when he see rock inside?</string>
<string name="3763">Oh. Well, it does got little shiny rock, Deekin swears. Deekin not know why statue had rock inside. Maybe it hide in there?</string>
<string name="3764">Deekin not know much. Deekin never see scary gnoll ever before they attacks us.</string>
<string name="3765">They runs out from forest and surrounds us. They say in snarly tongue that they wants all magic stuff we steals, or they kills us.</string>
<string name="3766">Urko think he so big and tough, he tell gnolls to blow idea out their hiney. Gnolls not like that. Ummm... last me remember, me fleeing into scary dead place.</string>
<string name="3767">Gnolls not come, no. Deekin not know why not. When Deekin sneak out later, gnolls all gone so Deekin run off as quick as he can.</string>
<string name="3768">Because they wants magic stuff? Deekin not know.</string>
<string name="3769">Kobolds is all Redclaw tribe. We lives in big caves in mountains to north, and old Master lives in bigger cave below us.</string>
<string name="3770">All of tribe works to make old Master happy, to keep his belly full. Big Chief and Master Jumper run tribe. Ice Hounds protect old Master. </string>
<string name="3771">Ummm... there be magic way in, but only old Master know how to use it. Deekin wishes he knew... sorry.</string>
<string name="3772">You think so? There be lots of kobolds. Master not thinks about us much... he always get more, easy.</string>
<string name="3773">Deekin not know, really. Deekin never need to try to come into cave... he live below with Master, remember?</string>
<string name="3774">But Deekin think there be lots of traps. What kobolds lack in big muscle and big magic they makes up for with big brains. Master call us &quot;cunning worms&quot; and he not kidding.</string>
<string name="3775">They be toughest of kobolds. Very mean and nasty to Deekin, they are. They kills anybody who come to bother Master.</string>
<string name="3776">Master Jumper is only kobold who can opens up passage to lower cave where old Master be. That make him very important.</string>
<string name="3777">Deekin know that Big Chief get jealous of Master Jumper sometimes, but he gots no choice. Master Jumper control who gets to see old Master.</string>
<string name="3778">Yup. He big shaman who run tribe, has great dragon blood inside him that make him powerful. He not so important as Master Jumper, though.</string>
<string name="3779">You wants to know about old Master? Okay, Deekin tell you what he know, for sure.</string>
<string name="3780">Long time. Long before Deekin born, that for sure. Years, maybe.</string>
<string name="3781">Deekin is little kobold. Everything seem powerful!</string>
<string name="3782">But, ummm, old Master be really big and old. Many generations of Redclaw tribe serves him. He gots powerful spells, too.</string>
<string name="3783">He be smart, too, but Deekin think &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; be smarter. You win, Deekin be sure.</string>
<string name="3784">Ummm... no. He not like fire, because he a very cold white dragon. But... ummm... you needs lots of fire to really hurts him, Deekin thinking.</string>
<string name="3785">He not likes frost giants much. He fights one long ago, he say, and giant almost win. Deekin thinks Master has old grudge, maybe.</string>
<string name="3786">But, ummm, Deekin not know any weakness. Old Master really smart. He gots good magic, too. Way better than Big Chief, even.</string>
<string name="3787">Nuh-uh. Old Master never mention magic stuff until not long ago, so Deekin thinks that maybe somebody told old Master that magic stuff was there.</string>
<string name="3788">Even so, Deekin not know why old Master want magic stuff so bad. He gots more magic stuff than he knows what to do with.</string>
<string name="3789">Yup. But he hide lots away. Whenever he gets big pile, he get all nervous and think other dragons come take it away.</string>
<string name="3790">You think Master tell Deekin where he hide stuff? Pfah. Master trust Deekin least of all.</string>
<string name="3791">Deekin not know why. Old Master gots lots of treasure... he gots treasure coming out of ears, sometimes, he sure not needs more.</string>
<string name="3792">But he say he want kobold tribe to steals magic stuff real bad. Wants them to bring it all back. Is weird, though, because old Master never mention it before.</string>
<string name="3793">Me not tells you that already? You go north to mountains, you do. You finds big cave full of kobolds... you knows it when you finds it.</string>
<string name="3794">Then all you needs to do is to gets Master Jumper to moves the big rock so you can go see Old Master. Me not sure how you do that, though.</string>
<string name="3795">You mean... why Deekin want to be free instead of asking Master to forgives Deekin? Ummm... Deekin not sure, really.</string>
<string name="3796">All Deekin know during short kobold life is caves. Deekin learn lots from Master, about other places... hot places and big places. Places far away, places with no kobolds.</string>
<string name="3797">Deekin... Deekin want to see places. Deekin want to know places be real, not just stories. Deekin want to be hero and traveler, like you... that what Deekin want.</string>
<string name="3798">Maybe people hurts poor Deekin because he be kobold. Maybe Deekin not go far. But Deekin learn more than any kobold learn... he can not stops now. He gots to try.</string>
<string name="3799">But you coulds be. You is great &lt;race&gt; hero, so you travel far, Deekin thinking. If Deekin could go where you goes, Deekin be very happy.</string>
<string name="3800">You does? Sometimes Deekin thinks Deekin be crazy. Maybe people kills Deekin because he be kobold. But Deekin gots to try, or he never be happy.</string>
<string name="3801">Mmm... name sounds little bit familiar to Deekin, maybe.</string>
<string name="3802">Deekin is thinking that maybe old Master talks to someone named J&apos;Nah lately. They sends messengers back and forth with letters.</string>
<string name="3803">Deekin never get to see letters. Old Master very private when he writes, he is... he hate it when Deekin peek over shoulder.</string>
<string name="3804">All Deekin know is that old Master get very angry at someone by name of J&apos;Nah. That why he send kobolds to steal magic stuff.</string>
<string name="3805">Deekin guesses so. Maybe he think that if kobolds make big raid that J&apos;Nah get angry? Deekin not exactly confidante to big dragon, you knows.</string>
<string name="3806">Deekin already tells you: you gets Deekin free from old Master and Deekin gladly gives you statue. Not before then, nuh-uh.</string>
<string name="3807">Deekin not wants to make &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; angry, but Deekin gots no other choice. He be kobold, sure, but he likes to be alive too.</string>
<string name="3808">Oh? You is Deekin&apos;s friend? Deekin glad, but...</string>
<string name="3809">Wait... &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; tries to cast spell on Deekin! Deekin knows! Is good thing old Master cast big spell on Deekin long ago... Deekin never be charmed that way.</string>
<string name="3810">Master not wants people to gets dragon secrets out of Deekin. Though, really, what Deekin tell? That dragon like it when Deekin tickle big belly? What big deal?</string>
<string name="3811">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Okay, me go now and... waaaiiit a minute. You tries to trick Deekin! Deekin shows you statue and you just takes it from him!</string>
<string name="3812">Deekin thinks that &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; be very smart and tricky, but Deekin not falls for it today! Deekin stand firm, he does!</string>
<string name="3813">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Promises shmomises! Kobolds be small and not very strong, you know, we only survives because we is smart!</string>
<string name="3814">You gets statue when Deekin be sure he is free, and not one seconds before that!</string>
<string name="3815">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You is... very scary, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. But... Deekin be not so dumb! If Deekin gives you statue you just squish Deekin like old Master.</string>
<string name="3816">No no no! No hurts Deekin, please! Deekin knows you wants statue... you hurts Deekin you never gets it!</string>
<string name="3817">Please please... Deekin be forever grateful to &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; if you helps him! Deekin just wants to be free!</string>
<string name="3818">Ummm, okay. What do you wants Deekin to call you?</string>
<string name="3819">Ummm... then Deekin calls you &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, because that is what you are!</string>
<string name="3820">Umm, okay. Deekin calls you &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, Deekin not mind. Deekin just wants to make &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; happy.</string>
<string name="3821">You wants Deekin to do something else for you, maybe?</string>
<string name="3822">You going to leave Deekin alone, now? Okays. Deekin knows that &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; won&apos;t let Deekin down.</string>
<string name="3823">Nuh-uh. Deekin stays right here and hides! If Deekin steps out, then old Master swoop down on poor Deekin for sure and eats him!</string>
<string name="3824">You would not wants that to happen to poor little Deekin, would you?</string>
<string name="3825">It be hards to forget. All Deekin can thinks about is old Master&apos;s big teeth going &quot;crunch, crunch!&quot; on poor Deekin. It gives him nightmares!</string>
<string name="3826">Deekin be very happy to follow around hero like you once Deekin be free. Deekin even write great ballad in your honor! But, umm... not until then.</string>
<string name="3827">You not knows that for sure. Old Master hold grudges long time, centuries or more maybe. Deekin not gots that long to live, even.</string>
<string name="3828">It be funny to watch Deekin go squish? You is very mean. Deekin sits here, a sad and heart-broken kobold.</string>
<string name="3829">See? Deekin knew that &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; loves Deekin! You not want old Master to make Deekin go squish, that makes him very happy!</string>
<string name="3830">Ooo! Wait wait wait! Deekin must talk to you! You wait there!</string>
<string name="3831">&lt;StartAction&gt;[pant!]&lt;/Start&gt; You... &lt;StartAction&gt;[pant!]&lt;/Start&gt; ...you runs so fast! Deekin so out of breath! &lt;StartAction&gt;[pant!]&lt;/Start&gt; It so hard to catch up!</string>
<string name="3832">Deekin not follow you! Well, okay, maybe he follow you a little... but he only watch to see that you be great &lt;race&gt; hero! Deekin need your help!</string>
<string name="3833">Deekin not so bad! Honest! Deekin only go with other kobolds to human village because Master tells Deekin to. Deekin not hurt anybody!</string>
<string name="3834">Deekin is servant to the Master. Deekin sings songs, tells tales that keeps Master happy. That why Master send Deekin on raid... so Deekin write story for Master later.</string>
<string name="3835">Only... Deekin do something very bad. Master will be very angry at Deekin! Deekin cannot go back to Master, not ever! Deekin so frightened!!</string>
<string name="3836">Ahhh!! No hurts Deekin, please! If... if you hurts Deekin, then you never gets little broken tower statue! Deekin hide it good!</string>
<string name="3837">Deekin not want to be so sneaky, but... he knows you want tower statue. Deekin only gives it if you helps him.</string>
<string name="3838">Deekin... he carries little tower statue when we leaves human village. When gnolls attack, he get excited and he... drops the little statue.</string>
<string name="3839">Statue is all broken now because of Deekin. He cannot bring it back to Master, because Master be angry at him! But... if Deekin stay away, Master be even angrier!</string>
<string name="3840">Deekin knows you look for little statue. Deekin, he... gives it to you if you helps him...? That good idea, yes?</string>
<string name="3841">Ooo! Deekin just knew that you would help him! He just knew it! Deekin is so happy now... but, ummm, still a little scared.</string>
<string name="3842">You goes and finds old Master and do what you going to do. Deekin stays here in little shop and hide. You comes back when you done, okay?</string>
<string name="3843">You goes and finds old Master and do what you going to do. Deekin goes to human village off to east and hides there, okay?</string>
<string name="3844">Deekin not know what humans call these places. But Deekin go there and hide good... you come and finds Deekin when you done, okay?</string>
<string name="3845">Ummm... Deekin does?</string>
<string name="3846">Oh. Deekin knows what you did. You tries to charm Deekin. Master cast big spell on Deekin long time ago so Deekin not be charmed. That way Master&apos;s secrets all safe.</string>
<string name="3847">That pretty sneaky, but Deekin not finds little broken tower statue for you unless you helps him. No ifs, ands or buts.</string>
<string name="3848">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sometimes Master say that Deekin is dumb, but Deekin not that dumb. Deekin just little kobold to you... he gives you statue and you leaves him high and dry!</string>
<string name="3849">Umm... you is scaring Deekin lots right now. You is very scary. But... Deekin not so dumb he go get statue from where he hides it.</string>
<string name="3850">You helps Deekin and Deekin goes and finds it for you. That only way... even if you be very scary and mean.</string>
<string name="3851">You be great &lt;race&gt; hero! Deekin knows this... he be watching you! You go and seek out Deekin&apos;s old Master, Tymofarrar!</string>
<string name="3852">Maybe you talks to Master, makes him let Deekin go. Makes him free Deekin. Then Deekin gives you little broken tower statue.</string>
<string name="3853">That be such nasty word. Deekin be sneaky because Deekin is forced to be sneaky. Deekin want you to help because you so smart and strong... more than Deekin, anyway.</string>
<string name="3854">Because... because you is smart. You is great &lt;race&gt; hero. Deekin watches you, he knows this. You think of something to convince Master.</string>
<string name="3855">You... you thinks you could? Deekin not mind, Deekin no big friend of Master. You kills Master, Deekin think that okay.</string>
<string name="3856">Oooh... no no, Deekin not free yet. Deekin hiding, but if Master wants to find Deekin he comes and finds him.</string>
<string name="3857">And if Master forced to come and find Deekin... well, that not be very pretty picture. That why Deekin so scared. Master is big, Deekin is very small.</string>
<string name="3858">If you wants to talk to Master or kills him, Deekin all for it. Deekin gives you broken little statue when you done.</string>
<string name="3859">Deekin gots complete confidence in you. Deekin knows that you is great hero, you is!</string>
<string name="3860">Deekin drops it on rock when gnolls scare him. Was accident! It go crack and there be shiny thing inside. Very pretty.</string>
<string name="3861">Deekin not know shiny rock was inside, honest! Deekin find statue and shows it to you if you helps him.</string>
<string name="3862">Well... Deekin not have the little broken tower statue *now*, but Deekin knows where Deekin hides it. He finds statue for you if you helps him.</string>
<string name="3863">Because if Deekin not be faithful, you... you probably hurt Deekin. Ummm... Deekin not want that. You be very scary.</string>
<string name="3864">Jester?! Deekin be great kobold bard! Deekin know all stories of dragons and heroes! Well, okay, some stories. Well... a few, maybe, &apos;cause they is long and hard to read.</string>
<string name="3865">Deekin keep great Master happy. Deekin sing and tell stories and go warn kobolds when Master is grumpy so they not get squished. Deekin very important!</string>
<string name="3866">Master like Deekin, but... but now Deekin screw it all up. Deekin do terrible thing and now he never able to go back to Master, or Master squish him!</string>
<string name="3867">Umm... yup, Deekin cast a spell. Maybe two. Deekin try to understand Master when he teach Deekin. Master so patient... he must like Deekin lots!</string>
<string name="3868">Deekin is important too, he is! One time chief get mad and start yelling at Deekin. Master swat chief all across cave and he go squish, Master like Deekin that much!</string>
<string name="3869">Master is great dragon Tymofarrar, ruler of kobolds! Very scary, he is. Very sharp teeth and bad breath, too, but he think Deekin very funny, go figure.</string>
<string name="3870">Okay. Deekin tell you all you wants if you just helps him.</string>
<string name="3871">Deekin worry that you might say that, so Deekin... he hide little broken tower statue real good.</string>
<string name="3872">Oooh, he be very big and very old and very smart. We kobolds be related to dragons, but Master not thinks much of that. He says kobolds too puny to be cousins.</string>
<string name="3873">Master tells kobolds what to do, and we runs to do it. Sometimes he takes kobold aside and teaches them stuff... like with chief kobold or Deekin, even. But only if he thinks them smart.</string>
<string name="3874">Ummm... Master also be beautiful white. He like it when it be very cold. Me once see him breathe ice on kobold, make little lizard icicle!</string>
<string name="3875">You go north into mountains, you find kobold caves. Master live below kobolds, big big cavern. Hard to miss.</string>
<string name="3876">Oohhhh no, no no no! Deekin cannot go near Master! Deekin be so scared of what Master do when he know what Deekin done!</string>
<string name="3877">Master tells kobolds he wants them to go to human village and steals magic stuff, so yes he behind it. Deekin not know why Master wants it all.</string>
<string name="3878">Kobolds be attacked by gnolls on way home, anyway. They want to take artifacts away. Master will be very angry! Deekin shake when Master angry.</string>
<string name="3879">Deekin not know. Maybe because gnolls be greedy? We runs into scary dead place with some magic stuff... not know what gnolls do after.</string>
<string name="3880">Er... you could talk to him, maybe. Deekin talk to Master all the time. Master says &quot;You talks to me now, Deekin,&quot; so Deekin talks.</string>
<string name="3881">One time Master say he could not sleeps, so Deekin talks to Master for two days straight about mating habits of orcs. Finally Master snores and poor Deekin collapses.</string>
<string name="3882">Master be very smart. Deekin be sure he listen to great &lt;race&gt; hero if you just gets to him.</string>
<string name="3883">Well... Deekin not hurt nobody in village. Deekin only go on raid because Master tells Deekin to.</string>
<string name="3884">No no! Do not hurt little Deekin! Deekin means no harm to the great &lt;race&gt; hero, no harm! Deekin needs help, he does!</string>
<string name="3885">Deekin ran from the scary dead place. Deekin did something very bad... that is why Deekin needs help of great &lt;race&gt; hero!</string>
<string name="3886">Deekin watches you, sees you be great &lt;race&gt; hero! Deekin needs your help, he does... needs help real bad!</string>
<string name="3887">Ooo! Wait wait wait! You no hurts Deekin... Deekin must talks to you! Please you listens to Deekin!</string>
<string name="3888">Umm... Deekin not knows what happens in little village. When Deekin comes to human village, he sees gnolls here already... maybe they raids it? Deekin came to little store to hide because nobody here.</string>
<string name="3889">Deekin speaks the truth. He not hurts nobody! He hides here and waits for you... you be great &lt;race&gt; hero, you are! Deekin need your help real bad!</string>
<string name="3890">No-ooo! No no no! You not listens to Deekin! Deekin need your help... you helps Deekin and Deekin helps you!</string>
<string name="3891">Ohhh, Deekin finds you! Deekin was so scared, he thinks he never sees you again!</string>
<string name="3892">Deekin hide in little ruined store like he say, but then big gnolls come and they starts to search everywhere. Deekin had to run!</string>
<string name="3893">Gnolls not finds Deekin, which is good thing because Deekin not likes thought of being eaten. Why everybody wants to eat Deekin?</string>
<string name="3894">But now Deekin finds you and all is good! You gots good news for Deekin, maybe?</string>
<string name="3895">Wow. Deekin wonder what he do now...</string>
<string name="3896">Ahhh! Deekin run, now! Deekin run! No hurt, no hurt!!</string>
<string name="3897">Deekin looks around, maybe. Now that no dragon swoop down and eats him...</string>
<string name="3898">Hmmm. Deekin takes you up on that some day, maybe. He think you big hero... maybe he learns something then. But not now... Deekin need time with Deekin.</string>
<string name="3899">Maybe Deekin see you around. Deekin think &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; be subject of next epic saga, maybe... what you thinks of that?</string>
<string name="3900">Here it be! Here it be! Broken, as Deekin said... though not Deekin&apos;s fault, really, and Deekin not think it worth discussing that little detail again.</string>
<string name="3901">Tymofarrar is dead.</string>
<string name="3902">You want proof?!</string>
<string name="3903">No, I don&apos;t have any proof.</string>
<string name="3904">I got the mask artifact from him, didn&apos;t I?</string>
<string name="3905">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade/Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Trust me, Deekin... he&apos;s dead.</string>
<string name="3906">That&apos;s it! You&apos;re going to die for this insult!!</string>
<string name="3907">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Trust me, Deekin... he&apos;s dead.</string>
<string name="3908">I have his head. How&apos;s that for proof?</string>
<string name="3909">Well, I talked to Tymofarrar...</string>
<string name="3910">Never mind.</string>
<string name="3911">It doesn&apos;t matter. He&apos;s dead, now.</string>
<string name="3912">I haven&apos;t persuaded him to free you, yet.</string>
<string name="3913">He wants me to kill J&apos;Nah... and then he&apos;ll let you go.</string>
<string name="3914">He said you&apos;re free to go. He gave me this... doll... to give to you.</string>
<string name="3915">He said he really didn&apos;t care what you did.</string>
<string name="3916">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade/Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; He said you&apos;re free to go.</string>
<string name="3917">I got news for you, alright: you&apos;re dead!</string>
<string name="3918">Get away from me, you filthy cretin!</string>
<string name="3919">If I have something to tell you, I&apos;ll tell you.</string>
<string name="3920">Sorry, Deekin, nothing yet.</string>
<string name="3921">I don&apos;t need your help.</string>
<string name="3922">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="3923">No more questions, here.</string>
<string name="3924">How do I know you even have the tower statue?</string>
<string name="3925">Fair enough, I suppose.</string>
<string name="3926">What use is a broken statue to me?</string>
<string name="3927">There is no shiny rock inside. You&apos;re lying!</string>
<string name="3928">I didn&apos;t know it was there, either, until you told me.</string>
<string name="3929">I want to know more about these gnolls.</string>
<string name="3930">What happened during the attack?</string>
<string name="3931">And the gnolls didn&apos;t chase you?</string>
<string name="3932">Why did they attack you, then?</string>
<string name="3933">Tell me about the other kobolds.</string>
<string name="3934">Enough about the kobolds.</string>
<string name="3935">Is there a secret way in to find Tymofarrar?</string>
<string name="3936">Well... won&apos;t Tymofarrar be angry if I kill all his kobolds?</string>
<string name="3937">What protections do these caves have?</string>
<string name="3938">Ice Hounds?</string>
<string name="3939">Master Jumper?</string>
<string name="3940">Big Chief?</string>
<string name="3941">Tell me about Tymofarrar.</string>
<string name="3942">Alright, enough about the dragon.</string>
<string name="3943">How long has Tymofarrar lived in the area? Do you know?</string>
<string name="3944">Just how powerful is Tymofarrar, anyway?</string>
<string name="3945">Does this dragon have any weaknesses that you know of?</string>
<string name="3946">Do you know how Tymofarrar knew that Drogan had those artifacts?</string>
<string name="3947">He has a lot of treasure, does he?</string>
<string name="3948">Do you know where he hides it?</string>
<string name="3949">Why would Tymofarrar want to steal the artifacts?</string>
<string name="3950">Where do I find him?</string>
<string name="3951">Why don&apos;t you want to go back to your old Master?</string>
<string name="3952">You really think that&apos;s possible?</string>
<string name="3953">Don&apos;t be ridiculous. You&apos;re just a kobold!</string>
<string name="3954">Oh, I&apos;m not such a great traveler.</string>
<string name="3955">I think that&apos;s an admirable goal.</string>
<string name="3956">Do you know anything about a sorceress named J&apos;Nah?</string>
<string name="3957">He sent the kobolds on the raid because he was angry?</string>
<string name="3958">What I want is that tower statue.</string>
<string name="3959">Alright, have it your way.</string>
<string name="3960">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Charm Person]&lt;/Start&gt; But I&apos;m your friend, Deekin.</string>
<string name="3961">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; How about you just show it to me, so I know you do have it?</string>
<string name="3962">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Don&apos;t you trust me? I promise I&apos;ll free you.</string>
<string name="3963">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Listen... give me the statue *now* and this will hurt a lot less.</string>
<string name="3964">That&apos;s it! I&apos;d rather kill you than get the statue!</string>
<string name="3965">For starters, stop calling me &quot;&lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;&quot;.</string>
<string name="3966">I don&apos;t really care.</string>
<string name="3967">Call me &quot;Mistress&quot;!</string>
<string name="3968">Call me &quot;Master&quot;!</string>
<string name="3969">I&apos;d prefer you didn&apos;t talk to me at all.</string>
<string name="3970">&quot;The great &lt;FirstName&gt;&quot; will do, I suppose.</string>
<string name="3971">My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="3972">I should go.</string>
<string name="3973">I could use some help. Why don&apos;t you travel with me?</string>
<string name="3974">Oh, forget it.</string>
<string name="3975">Tymofarrar is not going to swoop down on you, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="3976">It would be funny to watch, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
<string name="3977">No, I suppose not.</string>
<string name="3978">Why are you following me? Speak quickly!</string>
<string name="3979">I would never help an evil creature such as you!</string>
<string name="3980">You should be more frightened of me! Die, monster!!</string>
<string name="3981">And why would I even consider helping you?</string>
<string name="3982">So what did you do that is so terrible?</string>
<string name="3983">Alright. I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="3984">You mean Blumberg?</string>
<string name="3985">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Charm Person]&lt;StartAction&gt; I think you want to give me that statue now.</string>
<string name="3986">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Give me the statue and I might consider helping you.</string>
<string name="3987">Hand the statue over right now, kobold. Your life depends on it!</string>
<string name="3988">So how am I supposed to help you?</string>
<string name="3989">Are you blackmailing me?!</string>
<string name="3990">And why should your Master listen to me?</string>
<string name="3991">What if I just killed him, instead?</string>
<string name="3992">Why do you need him to free you? Aren&apos;t you already free?</string>
<string name="3993">What do you mean the tower statue is &apos;broken&apos;?</string>
<string name="3994">What shiny thing inside? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="3995">You have the tower statue on you?</string>
<string name="3996">How do I know you&apos;ll keep your word?</string>
<string name="3997">Are you saying that you&apos;re some kind of... kobold jester?</string>
<string name="3998">If you&apos;re so important, why do you need my help?</string>
<string name="3999">You&apos;re a bard? Can you even cast spells?</string>
<string name="4000">Uh-huh.</string>
<string name="4001">Who is this Master you speak of?</string>
<string name="4002">I want to ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="4003">Forget it. Now you die, little beast!</string>
<string name="4004">I&apos;m not helping you with anything.</string>
<string name="4005">Tell me more about this dragon.</string>
<string name="4006">Where can I find this Master of yours?</string>
<string name="4007">Maybe you should come and show me.</string>
<string name="4008">So this Tymofarrar was behind the theft of the artifacts?</string>
<string name="4009">So what am I supposed to do against a dragon?</string>
<string name="4010">Why did these gnolls want the artifacts?</string>
<string name="4011">A dragon?! What am I supposed to do against a dragon?!</string>
<string name="4012">Help you? After what you did to Hilltop and Master Drogan?!</string>
<string name="4013">You need my help?</string>
<string name="4014">Back off! I&apos;ll have no tricks out of you!</string>
<string name="4015">Deekin? The kobolds in the crypt mentioned you.</string>
<string name="4016">A kobold? What do you want?</string>
<string name="4017">What happened here? Why are you in this ruined store?</string>
<string name="4018">Deekin? What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="4019">What happened to you? Where did you go?</string>
<string name="4020">Now that I have the statue, you die!!</string>
<string name="4021">Just go. I don&apos;t want to see you ever again, creature!</string>
<string name="4022">I don&apos;t really care what you do.</string>
<string name="4023">You&apos;re welcome to come with me, if you like.</string>
<string name="4024">A blessed... sight you are, &lt;sir/madam&gt;! I... I am almost done for... but... you must flee... flee from this place. Blumberg is... destroyed.</string>
<string name="4025">Aaarrrgghhh!</string>
<string name="4026">Oh, the pain!</string>
<string name="4027">Your powers have saved me!</string>
<string name="4028">Ohhh, thank you, that&apos;s much better.</string>
<string name="4029">Thank you so much, stranger. I feel so much better, why I do not think I have felt this good in years! Why, even the pain in my back is gone, and I have had that agony for a decade.</string>
<string name="4030">Oh, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, I cannot tell you how wonderful it feels. If I had any worldly possessions left, I would gladly share them all with you.</string>
<string name="4031">Unfortunately the gnolls have stolen or burnt everything. Such is life, to go from the richest man in the village, to the only surviving man.</string>
<string name="4032">No gold at all? &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh]&lt;/Start&gt; The reward is in the deed. The reward is in the deed. I must remember that.</string>
<string name="4033">Of course, we manage to rescue a beggar! I am so pleased we wasted our time on this, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4034">We were attacked by gnolls! They came in and burned the entire village to the ground. Some people were hauled off as slaves, but most were killed.</string>
<string name="4035">They said they were looking for a kobold, but I never saw any such creature in Blumberg.</string>
<string name="4036">I think there may be some of the villains left in the village, but now that you are here, I am sure we can take them on!</string>
<string name="4037">Oh, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, I am ready! Nothing will hold me from taking my revenge! Give me a weapon and armor and I will serve you until...</string>
<string name="4038">What is that noise?</string>
<string name="4039">&lt;StartAction&gt;[He drinks the potion.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="4040">Gnolls... they came and... burned... everything. They said something... about a kobold... I managed to crawl... this far... but, I...</string>
<string name="4041">What is that... sound?</string>
<string name="4042">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Coup de grace]&lt;/Start&gt; You will be much easier to rob once you&apos;re dead.</string>
<string name="4043">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Heal]&lt;/Start&gt; Hold still; let me treat you with this healing kit.</string>
<string name="4044">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lay on Hands]&lt;/Start&gt; Hold still; let me treat you.</string>
<string name="4045">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Use a spell or ability to cure him.]&lt;/Start&gt; Let me heal you.</string>
<string name="4046">Is it really that good?</string>
<string name="4047">Who attacked you?</string>
<string name="4048">I like your attitude! </string>
<string name="4049">You were just dying. Do you really want to face that again? </string>
<string name="4050">Aren&apos;t you a little old for this? </string>
<string name="4051">We? I don&apos;t think so.</string>
<string name="4052">Here, drink this potion.</string>
<string name="4053">What happened here?</string>
<string name="4054">Greetings traveller.  We&apos;re waiting on a shipment of &apos;blah&apos; from some merchants before we can being our journey down the River Dessarin to Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="4055">Maybe you could look for the stuff for me..</string>
<string name="4056">Well - I just saw a  bunch of merchants had been killed on their way here.</string>
<string name="4057">Maybe not</string>
<string name="4058">Maybe</string>
<string name="4059">You cannot leave until you have paid me. Here, this will help keep you honest.</string>
<string name="4060">You had better have the gold to pay to use that. It is one hundred gold for each charge.</string>
<string name="4061">What is it that brings you to the home of a humble child of the Lady&apos;s peace? On second thought, forget that I asked. It is none of my business, so long as you bring no evil to my home.</string>
<string name="4062">Listen &lt;lad/lass&gt;.  I like it nice and quiet, so if you are being hounded by gnolls, hunted by assassins, or chased by Cyric himself, I do *not* want to hear about it.</string>
<string name="4063">I want nothing to do with your problems. I do not want to even know your name. I would like your gold though, so you can buy some of my magical goods, or I can teleport you somewhere.</string>
<string name="4064">Yes, go on; get out of here. And do not touch my recharging box, unless you have gold to pay for it.</string>
<string name="4065">Good. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4066">One hundred gold for each charge.</string>
<string name="4067">You put in magic items that need more charges, and they are recharged. </string>
<string name="4068">No! Ugh, what an evil thing! Hmm, it does seem to have some power though. I&apos;ll tell you what, I&apos;ll take it off your hands for 500 gold. But don&apos;t even think about asking for more.</string>
<string name="4069">Right, you keep the cursed thing. Not my problem. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4070">Right, I don&apos;t even know if I can sell this. Not in Silverymoon, the elf woman would kill me. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4071">That thing? It&apos;s broken! Do I look that stupid to you? Try your tricks somewhere else. Now do you have a serious proposition?</string>
<string name="4072">Well, that looks interesting. I guess I could offer you 500 gold for it. It&apos;s not really worth much, unless you happen to know someone who can craft it into a useful item.</string>
<string name="4073">Right, forgotten already. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4074">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; No, it&apos;s not. 500 gold, that&apos;s it.</string>
<string name="4075">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; Fine then, 700 gold is the best I can offer.</string>
<string name="4076">Right you are. Here&apos;s your gold. Now, what would you like?</string>
<string name="4077">Right you are. Here&apos;s your gold. Now, what would you like?</string>
<string name="4078">I suppose I might be interested. 700 gold, take it or leave it.</string>
<string name="4079">Have it your way. What else do you want?</string>
<string name="4080">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; Not a chance. I told you 500 gold, not a copper more!</string>
<string name="4081">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; Fine, fine, I&apos;ll just have to charge more to the next fool. 1000 gold, final offer.</string>
<string name="4082">Good. Hopefully some fool will wander buy here and I can sell it. Otherwise I&apos;ll have to take it to Silverymoon, I guess. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4083">Good. Hopefully some fool will wander buy here and I can sell it. Otherwise I&apos;ll have to take it to Silverymoon, I guess. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4084">Well, now that does look like a valid specimen. And it just happens that I know this great, giant of a man who collects odd creatures. Works with some wizards, taking care of their beasts.</string>
<string name="4085">I suppose I could give you 700 gold for it. Don&apos;t even bother asking for more, you won&apos;t get it from me. What do you say?</string>
<string name="4086">Fine then. What else do you want?</string>
<string name="4087">Good enough. Here is your gold, and I will take the egg. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4088">You are the one who came in here without an invitation. I would suggest that you might be the one with an attitude problem.</string>
<string name="4089">I hate questions. Questions want answers, and answers are almost always wrong in one way or another.</string>
<string name="4090">Do you want to buy something, or are you on your way?</string>
<string name="4091">Mystra, the goddess of magic. You might have heard of her. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4092">I did have a young halfling in here about ten or more years ago with a magical ruby pendant, but I was not buying. I am not sure he was selling either. He just kept playing with it.</string>
<string name="4093">He said he was headed up to Icewind Dale, though I never asked him. Have no idea if the item was stolen or what became of it though, and I do not want to know either. </string>
<string name="4094">It did seem rather powerful. I probably should have bought it, but for some reason I can&apos;t remember I decided against it.  Hmmm, seems strange to me now.</string>
<string name="4095">I have a few. Just take a look at my inventory. I might have something you have always wanted. </string>
<string name="4096">I also have the magic recharging box, an invention of my own design. You will have to pay to use it though.</string>
<string name="4097">Of course you do. I am beginning to think we are just going to stand here for the rest of our natural lives, asking and answering questions.</string>
<string name="4098">Of course I know about them, but they have never managed to find my home, so I do not bother them. Give them no reason to look for me, and they will stay away, or so I believe.</string>
<string name="4099">They have been a little more restless since that elf, or whatever she is came into the forest. I did not like the looks of her, I tell you. I am pretty confident of my abilities, but testing them against her?</string>
<string name="4100">Not a chance. There is something about her that just is not right. She looks like an elf, but that is about where the similarity ends.</string>
<string name="4101">I heard one of the gnolls tell her something; it sounded like he was commenting on her jaw or he wanted something to gnaw, but you know how hard it is to understand anything a gnoll says.</string>
<string name="4102">First of all their teeth are too big. Now, if I was creating the world, I would have given them huge claws and retractable teeth, but the gods never really seem to ask my advice.</string>
<string name="4103">You see? That is exactly what I mean about questions. I could tell you my name, sure, but would I be telling the truth? You would have no idea.</string>
<string name="4104">On the other hand, maybe I could tell you my name, and think I am telling the truth, but maybe I am wrong. Maybe I just think that&apos;s my name, but in reality, my mother called me something else entirely.</string>
<string name="4105">So how about we avoid any personal questions so that I can avoid accidentally lying to you? Hmm?</string>
<string name="4106">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You dare to threaten me in my own home? I do not fear you.</string>
<string name="4107">Well... hmph... I should say so. Now, ask me something more relevant to your life, buy one of my magic items, or leave.</string>
<string name="4108">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; If it will stop your incessant questioning, then fine. My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4109">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; That is it! No more questions. You can buy something from me, but if you will not respect my privacy, then I will simply ignore your questions.</string>
<string name="4110">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; If it will stop your incessant questioning, then fine. My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4111">How do you know I have the same name as you? Perhaps &lt;FirstName&gt; is not really your name. Maybe you are lying to me.</string>
<string name="4112">But let us say for a minute that I had actually traveled to the small, unpleasant village of Hilltop to speak with an old acquaintance. </string>
<string name="4113">I might have heard the name, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and liked it so much that I adopted it as my own. The point being, I do not wish to tell you my name, so quit asking!</string>
<string name="4114">Sure, why not? It is a nice name. Do you have a problem with it?</string>
<string name="4115">I told you right up front that there was a good chance that I might lie about such a question. It is not my fault you did not listen. Besides, that might be my real name.</string>
<string name="4116">Good, now what else did you want to know?</string>
<string name="4117">Good. I will try to answer any question that does not infringe on my privacy.</string>
<string name="4118">If that is what passes for humor in the outer world, then I am glad to have chosen to ignore it. I can ignore you too if you would like. </string>
<string name="4119">However, I would rather you either made a purchase and left, or just left. I will answer no more of your questions.</string>
<string name="4120">Yes, go on; get out of here. And do not touch my recharging box, unless you have gold to pay for it.</string>
<string name="4121">Good.</string>
<string name="4122">One hundred gold for each charge.</string>
<string name="4123">You put in magic items that need more charges, and they are recharged. And then you pay me.</string>
<string name="4124">I charge 500 gold each time, and you can only go to a place you have been before.</string>
<string name="4125">Very well. I&apos;ll just take the gold and off you go.</string>
<string name="4126">Very well. I&apos;ll just take the gold and off you go.</string>
<string name="4127">Very well. I&apos;ll just take the gold and off you go.</string>
<string name="4128">Very well. I&apos;ll just take the gold and off you go.</string>
<string name="4129">What kind of confidence game are you trying to run here? You don&apos;t have that kind of gold!</string>
<string name="4130">Very well. I&apos;ll just take the gold and off you go.</string>
<string name="4131">That sounds like a meddling type of question. There is nothing wrong with me, I just do not like strangers, and &lt;lad/lass&gt;, you are stranger than most.</string>
<string name="4132">Because it seemed like an appropriate insult at the moment. Now, are you going to buy something, or did you just come to chatter inanely. </string>
<string name="4133">You again?  What do you want this time &lt;lad/lass&gt;?</string>
<string name="4134">If you buy enough, maybe I won&apos;t have to go into Silverymoon this year. That would be nice.</string>
<string name="4135">You owe me &lt;CUSTOM501&gt; gold, for using my machine.</string>
<string name="4136">Trying to leave without paying me, huh? Well, you owe me &lt;CUSTOM501&gt; gold, so pay up!</string>
<string name="4137">Have a look then.</string>
<string name="4138">Then you will just have to sell me some items, and then pay me what you owe.</string>
<string name="4139">Anything else then?</string>
<string name="4140">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4141">I won&apos;t.</string>
<string name="4142">How much does it cost?</string>
<string name="4143">What is a recharging box?</string>
<string name="4144">Would you be interested in buying a mummified hand?</string>
<string name="4145">No thanks.</string>
<string name="4146">I&apos;ll take it.</string>
<string name="4147">Would you be interested in buying a tower statue?</string>
<string name="4148">Would you be interested in buying a dragon&apos;s tooth?</string>
<string name="4149">Never mind.</string>
<string name="4150">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; It must be worth more than that!</string>
<string name="4151">I&apos;ll take it.</string>
<string name="4152">I&apos;ll take it.</string>
<string name="4153">Would you be interested in buying a magical mask?</string>
<string name="4154">I&apos;ll leave it.</string>
<string name="4155">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This is a very valuable item. Surely you can offer me more?</string>
<string name="4156">I&apos;ll take it.</string>
<string name="4157">I&apos;ll take it.</string>
<string name="4158">Would you be interested in buying a dragon egg?</string>
<string name="4159">No thanks.</string>
<string name="4160">Yes.</string>
<string name="4161">I think you might be my problem, with an attitude like that.</string>
<string name="4162">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="4163">That&apos;s enough questions.</string>
<string name="4164">Who is the &quot;Lady&quot; you spoke of?</string>
<string name="4165">I am looking for some stolen magical artifacts. Has anybody tried to sell you any?</string>
<string name="4166">Do you have any powerful magic items?</string>
<string name="4167">I have other questions.</string>
<string name="4168">Do you know about the gnolls here in the forest?</string>
<string name="4169">Did you notice anything else about her?</string>
<string name="4170">Who are you?</string>
<string name="4171">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me your name or I&apos;ll have to force it out of you! </string>
<string name="4172">I was just joking.</string>
<string name="4173">Sorry, my mistake.</string>
<string name="4174">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Please, tell me your name.</string>
<string name="4175">You have the same name as me.</string>
<string name="4176">Really?</string>
<string name="4177">I think you are lying.</string>
<string name="4178">No, that is fine.</string>
<string name="4179">Fine, I&apos;ll ask you something else.</string>
<string name="4180">What name did your mother call you?</string>
<string name="4181">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4182">I won&apos;t. </string>
<string name="4183">How much does it cost?</string>
<string name="4184">What is a recharging box?</string>
<string name="4185">I want you to teleport me somewhere.</string>
<string name="4186">Send me to my party leader.</string>
<string name="4187">Send me to the foothills.</string>
<string name="4188">Send me to the kobold caves.</string>
<string name="4189">Send me to Blumberg.</string>
<string name="4190">Send me to Hilltop.</string>
<string name="4191">Why are you so uptight?</string>
<string name="4192">Why do you say that?</string>
<string name="4193">Just show me what you have for sale.</string>
<string name="4194">Let me sell you something so I can get enough money.</string>
<string name="4195">I do not have enough gold.</string>
<string name="4196">Well let me see what I can sell you then.</string>
<string name="4197">Fine, I&apos;ll pay.</string>
<string name="4198">A large group of creatures passed through this area recently, according to the tracks.</string>
<string name="4199">A large group of humanoids came from the foothills and headed north not long ago.</string>
<string name="4200">A large group of gnolls, perhaps three dozen, followed this path through the forest to the north not long ago. The tracks indicate that they took with them perhaps half a dozen kobolds... perhaps prisoners?</string>

<string name="4213">Who&apos;s going to clean this up? Not Riisi, no no!</string>
<string name="4214">What a mess! What a mess! Me-oh-my, what a mess!</string>
<string name="4215">Ooooh, Master Drogan will be so upset!</string>
<string name="4216">Hee hee! You not know how to get past the ward! Riisi does!</string>
<string name="4217">Oh my, what is this? Is it another kobold come to wreak havoc on Master&apos;s things? Well, Riisi will fight them, yes she will. She will protect her master&apos;s things this time!</string>
<string name="4218">No, no, no, it is someone I recognize. Gladdens my heart, yes it does. Hello there, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4219">Riisi says goodbye, but will she be missed? No, no, she will be sad and lonely until Master Drogan is better.</string>
<string name="4220">Riisi was in great danger, yes I was. I was here when the stupid, ugly kobolds stole Master&apos;s stuff, yes, yes, yes!</string>
<string name="4221">That is not such a nice way to greet me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, oh no it is not. We should be speaking in nice ways to each other, since we both serve Master, yes we do.</string>
<string name="4222">I am still being Riisi, oh yes, I am not dead, that is a good thing. But you should be knowing that kobolds stole Master&apos;s stuff, yes they did!</string>
<string name="4223">But &lt;FirstName&gt;, you cannot help, for they are gone, and that is sad. But Riisi feels something is wrong with the Master! Tell me what happened to him, please, oh please!</string>
<string name="4224">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, no, no, Riisi can sense that Master is hurting, yes she can. She would go up to see Master, but he told her, &apos;Riisi, you stay here,&apos; Yes he did!</string>
<string name="4225">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, Riisi is very glad to hear it. I was worried, oh yes I was. But you have put my mind to rest, yes, yes. Still, Riisi can feel Master has pain, even if he will be alright.</string>
<string name="4226">Oh no, oh no, poor, poor Master. Poor, poor Riisi. If Master dies then Riisi will be all alone. Riisi should go up to Master, yes she should.</string>
<string name="4227">But Master wanted Riisi to stay down in his laboratory, oh yes, that is what he said. And Riisi must obey kind Master.</string>
<string name="4228">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, Riisi feels terrible right now. Maybe if we talk a bit you will make me feel better? Yes, yes, I love to talk! Do you want to hear a riddle?</string>
<string name="4229">Questions are not as good as riddles, unless the questions are riddles, but you ask and I will try to answer.</string>
<string name="4230">Then Riisi will go back to guarding Master&apos;s laboratory, yes I will. I will do a good job for dear Master. No more kobolds can enter here, no, no, no.</string>
<string name="4231">Riisi took some of Master&apos;s magic things and his key and hid them, yes she did! She hid them from nasty, ugly kobolds in a safe place. Kobolds do not get everything, no they did not!</string>
<string name="4232">But now Master is upset and Riisi is afraid that he will not be able to use the things Riisi saved. Oh, what is I to do, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="4233">That is good, because they are Master&apos;s items and they do not belong to you, no they don&apos;t!</string>
<string name="4234">You want Master&apos;s magics just like kobolds did. Riisi could give you the items, but kobolds had magic powers to get past Master&apos;s ward.</string>
<string name="4235">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You want Master&apos;s magics just like kobolds did. Riisi could give you the items, but kobolds had magic powers to get past Master&apos;s ward.</string>
<string name="4236">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, you do not look too much like a kobold, no, no, no. Riisi could give you the items, but kobolds had magic powers to get past Master&apos;s ward.</string>
<string name="4237">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Gasp.]&lt;/Start&gt; What if you be kobold in disguise? Oh me, oh my, then Riisi would be giving Master&apos;s magic things to kobolds and that would be very bad, yes, yes, yes!</string>
<string name="4238">Testing you, that is the only way Riisi can be sure you are not a kobold. Riisi will tell you riddles, and if you answer true, then you be smarter than a kobold and me give you magic for Master.</string>
<string name="4239">What you mean? You would attack your Master&apos;s familiar? Riisi knows what is going on, yes she does and you will not be tricking her, nasty little kobold!</string>
<string name="4240">Riisi will hide and you will not find her, no you will not! Because you cannot get past the wards, oh no, you cannot. You must try my riddles and prove you are not a kobold.</string>
<string name="4241">No, no, no, you may hate riddles, but it is the way Riisi can test you yes. If you want Master&apos;s items you must prove you be Master&apos;s apprentice.</string>
<string name="4242">Riisi will ask you three riddles, yes she will. You get all three riddles right and then I know you not be kobold in disguise.</string>
<string name="4243">Riisi likes numbers and I think kobolds too stupid to know them, so tell me, how many nines you use to count to one hundred?</string>
<string name="4244">Hmm, Riisi not realize that kobolds know how to count, but then I not know ugly kobolds could break Master&apos;s spell either. I better ask you another question, yes, yes, yes.</string>
<string name="4245">You must be kobold to be so stupid! Riisi will hide now and keep Master&apos;s magic safe.</string>
<string name="4246">Yikes! Riisi does not want to die, no she does not! Oh, Riisi is in big trouble now, yes, yes, she is! Oh, what a quandary! Oh, what a dilemma!</string>
<string name="4247">If Riisi gives you another chance to prove you no be a kobold, will &lt;FirstName&gt; let me live? Will &lt;he/she&gt;?</string>
<string name="4248">Oh, poor Master. Riisi can feel he is suffering and needs help. Maybe you are not a kobold. I will give you another chance, yes I will.</string>
<string name="4249">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Riisi will not fall for that old trick, no she will not. She knows better than that. I will leave now, yes I will.</string>
<string name="4250">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, that is sometimes so true. I often forget just how smart Riisi is, yes I do! I guess Riisi could give you another chance.</string>
<string name="4251">This is so simple; how can you get it wrong? There are twenty uses of nine on the way to one hundred. How simple can you be?</string>
<string name="4252">Perhaps you slept through too many of master Drogan&apos;s lessons, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but the answer is twenty.</string>
<string name="4253">You answered one riddle correctly already, yes you did, so Riisi will just give you two more riddles to answer, because she is kind and caring, yes she is.</string>
<string name="4254">A prisoner is going to be killed and is told by executioner that him must make one statement. If his statement be true, then him will be drowned. If his statement be false, him will be hanged.</string>
<string name="4255">What statement can him make to confuse the executioner and not be killed at all?</string>
<string name="4256">You will not even guess? Why do you give up when it is so easy?</string>
<string name="4257">The executioner would agree with you and you would be drowned! That would not work, no, no, no.</string>
<string name="4258">Then the executioner would think you were lying and you would be hanged! That would not work, no, no, no.</string>
<string name="4259">Yes! Yes, yes, yes, that is the thing to say! Then the executioner cannot hang you, or you told truth and he should drown you. If him drowns you, then, you lied and should be hanged.</string>
<string name="4260">You be pretty smart; much smarter than kobold, I am thinking, but kobolds turned out to be smarter than me thought when them break Master&apos;s ward.</string>
<string name="4261">This is a hard riddle, so you should take your time to figure it out, yes you should. Are you ready?</string>
<string name="4262">There be an island, which is deserted, yes it is. This island has four fruit trees, each with a different kind of fruit. There be a group of wizards who visit the island each year, for they like it, yes they do.</string>
<string name="4263">Each wizard eats two types of fruit, but each group of two trees can only have one wizard in common, which means only one wizard can eat from the apple tree and the pear tree.</string>
<string name="4264">So, what you must be telling me is, how many wizards belong to this group?</string>
<string name="4265">That is very smart of you to know that. It took Riisi a long time to figure that one out. I guess you must be who you seem to be, and I will have to trust you to help Master.</string>
<string name="4266">I will go and fetch the items for you from my secret hiding place. Riisi hopes you will really help Master, &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="4267">That is not right, no, no, no. I do not know if I can trust you, so Riisi wants to go and hide, so she can protect what she has saved. </string>
<string name="4268">But Riisi feels that Master is very scared and is hurting and maybe you are the only one who can help him. Riisi must help you, even if you do not deserve it.</string>
<string name="4269">This is supposed to be a challenge? There can only be six wizards using this island, though the riddle itself is as foolish as any I have ever heard.</string>
<string name="4270">I am almost certain that the answer must be six. Yes, only six wizards are using the island.</string>
<string name="4271">What? The executioner would say you were telling the truth and he would drown you! That would not work, no, no, no.</string>
<string name="4272">You... you cannot get anything right. This is the second riddle you got wrong. Riisi is really wondering if you could be a kobold in disguise, yes she is.</string>
<string name="4273">Riisi is trembling with fear, yes she is, but I must go on. Will you try the third riddle?</string>
<string name="4274">Oh, terror and shivers afflict Riisi, yes they do. She does not make such a good guard for her master and now feels terrible, yes she does.</string>
<string name="4275">Riisi thinks that you are not a kobold, but really just a bad person, yes she does. If Riisi was not so worried about Master, she would not help you, no she would not.</string>
<string name="4276">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You should not push me so hard, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am trying to help you and keep Master safe at the same time.</string>
<string name="4277">You try one more riddle and see if you can do it. Then Riisi will help you, yes she will.</string>
<string name="4278">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; It is true that this is not so much fun as Riisi had hoped. I suppose Riisi can trust you are not a kobold, just a really thick-witted &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="4279">Riisi is glad you like riddles so much, but wishes you were better at them, yes, she does.</string>
<string name="4280">Ha! That is a famous old riddle, where I come from. A good rogue should always have a quick mind and a quicker tongue. &apos;I will be hanged,&quot; would baffle the executioner.</string>
<string name="4281">Have you no ability to use the least bit of logic, &lt;FirstName&gt;? He would have to tell the executioner that he will be hanged.</string>
<string name="4282">Kobolds no be in laboratory, no, not anymore. But Riisi was surprised how them got in.</string>
<string name="4283">I saw them coming to the laboratory and I knew they could not get across, and I thought it was going to be such fun watching them from behind the magic circle.</string>
<string name="4284">I was about to appear to them and taunt them, yes I was, but then they stopped and you would not believe what they did, no you would not. They threw dust on the circle.</string>
<string name="4285">It must have been magic dust, oh yes, or it would not have worked, no, no, no. Stupid ugly kobolds walked right over the symbol and looted all of Master&apos;s things.</string>
<string name="4286">Well, maybe not all of his stuff, no, no. There be some stuff left. Little bits of stuff that stupid kobolds not think would be important, or no could find.</string>
<string name="4287">But you want to know what is still in Master&apos;s laboratory, do you?</string>
<string name="4288">Oh, Riisi no can tell you that, no, no, no. Master never tells anybody that, except for Riisi. And now Master is upset, oh yes he is. Riisi can feel it, yes, yes, yes.</string>
<string name="4289">Master trusted Riisi to protect his treasures and now Riisi has failed. Never will Riisi fail Master again. You no ask to get in anymore, no, no, no!</string>
<string name="4290">No! What are you, stupid like kobold? Me said no and me mean no! </string>
<string name="4291">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No! What are you, stupid like kobold? Me said no and me mean no!</string>
<string name="4292">But wait! Riisi knows what is going on, yes she does and you will not be tricking her, nasty little kobold!</string>
<string name="4293">You have a nicer way of speaking than a kobold, but I still see the truth.</string>
<string name="4294">You must be a kobold in disguise, that is what I mean. You will not be getting past me, nor will I bring the treasure to you!</string>
<string name="4295">Unless, maybe if Riisi could test you, then maybe she could bring you Master&apos;s items, yes, yes, yes. Maybe Riisi could ask you riddles, that would be good, yes it would.</string>
<string name="4296">You cannot get in the way the kobolds did, no you cannot. Riisi cannot even believe that kobolds did get in.</string>
<string name="4297">I saw them coming to the laboratory and I knew they could not get across, and I thought it was going to be such fun watching them from behind the magic circle.</string>
<string name="4298">I was about to appear to them and taunt them, yes I was, but then they stopped and you would not believe what they did, no you would not. They threw dust on the circle.</string>
<string name="4299">It must have been magic dust, oh yes, or it would not have worked, no, no, no. Stupid ugly kobolds walked right over the symbol and looted all of Master&apos;s things.</string>
<string name="4300">Well, maybe not all of his stuff, no, no. There be some stuff left. Little bits of stuff that stupid kobolds not think would be important, or no could find.</string>
<string name="4301">But you cannot get into Master&apos;s laboratory, no you may not.</string>
<string name="4302">Oh, it was terrible, yes it was. I was just having a nap and dreaming about a lovely meadow filled with flowers and butterflies. It was wonderful, &lt;FirstName&gt;, yes it was. Do you have dreams like that?</string>
<string name="4303">You are a very strange &lt;man/woman&gt;, &lt;FirstName&gt;, yes you are.</string>
<string name="4304">What a sad, sad life you live, yes you do.</string>
<string name="4305">Well, I was woken by a dreadful noise and I immediately turned invisible. When I saw that dreadful kobolds were in the house I thought Master Drogan would come here right away.</string>
<string name="4306">I saw them coming to the laboratory and I knew they could not get across, and I thought it was going to be such fun watching them from behind the magic circle.</string>
<string name="4307">I was about to appear to them and taunt them, yes I was, but then they stopped and you would not believe what they did, no you would not. They threw dust on the circle.</string>
<string name="4308">It must have been magic dust, oh yes, or it would not have worked, no, no, no. Stupid ugly kobolds walked right over the symbol and looted all of Master&apos;s things.</string>
<string name="4309">Well, maybe not all of his stuff, no, no. There be some stuff left. Little bits of stuff that stupid kobolds not think would be important, or no could find.</string>
<string name="4310">Oh, shame on Riisi! Shame, shame, shame! I hid. I was so scared and thought they were powerful kobolds, for they were the first to pass Master&apos;s magic.</string>
<string name="4311">Now Master will never trust Riisi again, oh no, he will not! Now Master will dismiss Riisi and she will have to leave and return to her home in disgrace.</string>
<string name="4312">Except that Master is very loving, and maybe Riisi can earn back his trust by never letting anyone in ever again! Yes, yes, yes, that is it. Riisi will be the best guard ever!</string>
<string name="4313">And try not to answer in riddles, little pest. Your mind is like a young puppy, chasing its tail in circles with no idea what it would do if it caught up and took a bite.</string>
<string name="4314">Riisi hears a voice, but she does not see where it is coming from. Could it be a ghost? </string>
<string name="4315">Oh wait, way down there! It is a voice from a bump in the ground. Riisi did not know that small lumps of dirt could speak, no she did not.</string>
<string name="4316">Yes, Riisi is very helpful, yes she is! Dorna is just too slow to understand Riisi&apos;s wit.</string>
<string name="4317">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, Dorna and Riisi talk like this to each other all the time. It is only playful banter, nothing more.</string>
<string name="4318">Yes. Why do we not find out what the annoying little dragon-pest has to say? If we make it think, perhaps its head will implode.</string>
<string name="4319">Riisi sees that you have Xanos with you, and he thinks he knows so very, very much, that he should be able to answer all questions you may be having, yes he should.</string>
<string name="4320">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you should not speak to Riisi so, no you should not. She is trying to be helpful, yes she is. Even though you are mean to me, I will still try to help.</string>
<string name="4321">Yes, Riisi is very helpful, yes she is! Xanos is just full of ego, with no room for wit.</string>
<string name="4322">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, Xanos and Riisi talk like this to each other all the time. It is only playful banter, nothing more.</string>
<string name="4323">That is a sad thing to say, yes it is. Riddles make the mind stay sharp. You must have a dull mind if you do not like riddles.</string>
<string name="4324">Kobolds have dull minds too, yes they do. And I do not like kobolds at all, no I do not.</string>
<string name="4325">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, that is a horrible thing to say, yes it is. It is the kind of thing a stupid, ugly kobold would say, yes it is.</string>
<string name="4326">When you say things like that it makes me think awful thoughts. Master Drogan would not want me to do things like that to you, oh no, he would not.</string>
<string name="4327">You are ugly, yes, very ugly, like a kobold, but when you say such things it makes you even uglier than a kobold, so let us say nice things to each other.</string>
<string name="4328">You are not beautiful, but you are not so ugly as a scaly kobold either, but when you say such things it makes you seem ugly, so let us say nice things to each other.</string>
<string name="4329">But you are beautiful, and kobolds are not beautiful, but when you say things like that it makes you seem less beautiful, so let us say nice things to each other.</string>
<string name="4330">Oh, yes, yes, my riddle. A fine choice for a fine &lt;man/woman&gt;. Here is my riddle. A woman has five children and half of them are sons. Is this possible?</string>
<string name="4331">That is too bad, yes it is. You should have guessed, because there is a good chance you would have gotten it right. You are not much smarter than a kobold, I am afraid.</string>
<string name="4332">Oh, no. You are very, very wrong. You are not much smarter than a kobold I am afraid. No, no, not at all.</string>
<string name="4333">This is a waste of valuable time, but I should tell you that it is indeed possible for half to be male, so long as the other half is also male.</string>
<string name="4334">Oh yes, Xanos, you are being right. You are very smart but I wish you were nicer to me. You are a hard man to like, Xanos, yes, you are.</string>
<string name="4335">I can see through this trickster&apos;s quick wit, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Obviously if half of the five were male, then the other half would also be male. That is how it would be possible.</string>
<string name="4336">Oh yes, Dorna, you are being right. You are much fun and you are good at riddles. I do like you Dorna, yes, I do.</string>
<string name="4337">This is just silly, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I think I know the trick to answering this riddle. Half of the children could be male, but only if the other half is also male.</string>
<string name="4338">Oh yes, Mischa, you are being right. You are very smart and you are so nice to me. I do like you Mischa, yes, I do.</string>
<string name="4339">Oh, yes, yes, it is true. Riisi thinks you are smarter than you look, or else very lucky.</string>
<string name="4340">It is true if the other half of the children are also males. She must have five boys. It is a trick, see? I never said the other half were not boys.</string>
<string name="4341">Do you want to talk about something else?</string>
<string name="4342">Back you come to speak with Riisi, yes you do. What would you like to know? A riddle, perhaps?</string>
<string name="4343">No more kobolds will get by Riisi, no, no, no!</string>
<string name="4344">You take this and help Master. I worry about him much, oh yes I do. Good luck be with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you will need it.</string>
<string name="4345">Master Drogan is okay! Riisi is so happy!! Thank you, thank you!</string>
<string name="4346">How Riisi clean all this up? This be so impossible!</string>
<string name="4347">Riisi cannot wait to see Master Drogan!</string>
<string name="4348">Whee!! Riisi feels good again!!</string>
<string name="4349">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4350">What happened here, Riisi?</string>
<string name="4351">So, Master Drogan&apos;s annoying familiar, Riisi, survived.</string>
<string name="4352">Hello Riisi, how are you?</string>
<string name="4353">Drogan was wounded and will likely die.</string>
<string name="4354">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Master Drogan is fine. </string>
<string name="4355">Master Drogan was poisoned by the kobolds.</string>
<string name="4356">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="4357">I have no more questions.</string>
<string name="4358">What is in the laboratory?</string>
<string name="4359">I don&apos;t care about your items.</string>
<string name="4360">I will take the items to Drogan.</string>
<string name="4361">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Give the items to me.</string>
<string name="4362">Give me the items or I&apos;ll strangle you.</string>
<string name="4363">Fine, ask me your riddles, stupid faerie dragon. </string>
<string name="4364">I hate riddles.</string>
<string name="4365">Alright, ask me your riddles then. </string>
<string name="4366">Ask me your riddles.</string>
<string name="4367">25 </string>
<string name="4368">20</string>
<string name="4369">19 </string>
<string name="4370">15 </string>
<string name="4371">10 </string>
<string name="4372">9</string>
<string name="4373">You help me, or your life ends now!</string>
<string name="4374">If you give me what I want, then yes. </string>
<string name="4375">I don&apos;t want to hurt you, but you must take this seriously, Riisi. </string>
<string name="4376">Yes, just get on with it. </string>
<string name="4377">No, please, wait! Master Drogan desperately needs our help!</string>
<string name="4378">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Riisi, you are just too smart for me. Please give me another chance.</string>
<string name="4379">I don&apos;t know. </string>
<string name="4380">I am guilty.</string>
<string name="4381">I am innocent.</string>
<string name="4382">I will be hanged.</string>
<string name="4383">Just get on with it. </string>
<string name="4384">Yes.</string>
<string name="4385">Sixteen. </string>
<string name="4386">Twelve. </string>
<string name="4387">Ten. </string>
<string name="4388">Eight. </string>
<string name="4389">Six.</string>
<string name="4390">Four. </string>
<string name="4391">I will be drowned.</string>
<string name="4392">If you ask me one more riddle, I&apos;ll end your irritating little life!</string>
<string name="4393">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This isn&apos;t going well. Riisi, could you please just trust me?</string>
<string name="4394">I love riddles. Please, continue.</string>
<string name="4395">Yes, I will try it. </string>
<string name="4396">A little dirt disrupted Drogan&apos;s protective magic?  </string>
<string name="4397">What did that do?</string>
<string name="4398">That is what I asked you in the first place! </string>
<string name="4399">Yes, please tell me. </string>
<string name="4400">How do I get into the laboratory?</string>
<string name="4401">You let me in, or I will wring your leathery little neck!</string>
<string name="4402">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Surely you can trust me to go in.</string>
<string name="4403">I think you are confused, fair creature. </string>
<string name="4404">Stupid fairie dragon, who are you calling a kobold? </string>
<string name="4405">What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="4406">A little dirt disrupted Drogan&apos;s protective magic?  </string>
<string name="4407">What did that do?</string>
<string name="4408">Why can&apos;t I go in? </string>
<string name="4409">Can you tell me exactly what the kobolds did?</string>
<string name="4410">And in this dream, is there a knight in shining armor, who speaks poetry to you? </string>
<string name="4411">Do your dreams have naked nymphs and dryads too?</string>
<string name="4412">No, I don&apos;t have stupid dreams like that. Now, get on with it.</string>
<string name="4413">Get to the story. </string>
<string name="4414">Yes, but please get to what happened.</string>
<string name="4415">A little dirt disrupted Drogan&apos;s protective magic? </string>
<string name="4416">What did that do?</string>
<string name="4417">What did you do when the kobolds crossed the barrier?</string>
<string name="4418">Dorna is right. Do you have a single, useful thing to say, Riisi? </string>
<string name="4419">Dorna, Riisi is trying to be helpful, leave her alone.</string>
<string name="4420">Alright, that will be enough out of both of you. </string>
<string name="4421">Xanos is right. Do you have a single, useful thing to say, Riisi?</string>
<string name="4422">Xanos, Riisi is trying to be helpful, leave her alone.</string>
<string name="4423">Alright, that will be enough out of both of you. </string>
<string name="4424">I hate riddles.</string>
<string name="4425">Kobolds are fun to kill. I wonder if faerie dragons are fun to kill too?</string>
<string name="4426">Tell me your riddle.</string>
<string name="4427">I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="4428">No. </string>
<string name="4429">Yes.</string>
<string name="4430">Drogan, you live! Mystra be praised!</string>
<string name="4431">It was... the artifacts they were after. They are stolen... all four of them. I could do nothing...</string>
<string name="4432">I thought as much. How could anyone have found out you even had them? This is terrible news.</string>
<string name="4433">When Drogan retired to Hilltop, the Harpers entrusted four dangerous artifacts to his care. We thought this area remote enough that they would be safe.</string>
<string name="4434">They were. I... do not know... how they were discovered...</string>
<string name="4435">We&apos;ll have to find out. Those artifacts are too powerful and dangerous to be left in unknown hands.</string>
<string name="4436">I can&apos;t leave. Drogan will die unless I tend to this poison. The help I can offer is limited until he gets better.</string>
<string name="4437">I&apos;m glad you agree. I won&apos;t be able to follow you, however... I need to stay here and tend to Drogan&apos;s poison.</string>
<string name="4438">That&apos;s good to hear. I will need to stay here and tend to Drogan&apos;s poison... the help I can offer is limited until he gets better.</string>
<string name="4439">&lt;FirstName&gt;... my eldest student. It is... up to you. It is vital... that you find these items and bring them back...</string>
<string name="4440">Such... such courage. Dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;, you do me proud...</string>
<string name="4441">Only you can... do this. You are needed, my &lt;boy/girl&gt;... you must have courage!</string>
<string name="4442">There are rewards... beyond wealth, my &lt;boy/girl&gt;. Only you can do this. You... are needed, you must have courage!</string>
<string name="4443">There is... no-one else. The other apprentices... can only follow your lead. You are needed, my &lt;boy/girl&gt;... you must have courage!</string>
<string name="4444">Your ring... will protect you. &lt;FirstName&gt;, my &lt;boy/girl&gt;... you are needed. You must have courage!</string>
<string name="4445">This will be your... final test. I know that you are ready! So much... so much relies on you. I know... you will not let me down...</string>
<string name="4446">I... I cannot... unnnghhh!...</string>
<string name="4447">Drogan? He&apos;s... passed out from the pain. It is up to you, then, &lt;FirstName&gt;, as he said. You must recover these artifacts before they can be put to dangerous use.</string>
<string name="4448">There are no others in this area that I know of. And even should I send word of what has happened, it would be too late before anyone could respond.</string>
<string name="4449">No, it is truly up to you to find the artifacts if they are going to be found at all. Your preparation is paramount at this point.</string>
<string name="4450">I&apos;m sure you have many questions, &lt;FirstName&gt;... and I will help you as much as I can. There is much you must prepare for, first, however.</string>
<string name="4451">Even the longest journey begins with a few simple steps, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You know what you must do... you simply have to prepare for it.</string>
<string name="4452">If you need assistance, think of asking Dorna or Xanos to accompany you. The others can remain here and help guard the school.</string>
<string name="4453">That would be me. I wish I could go with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are so lucky.</string>
<string name="4454">And &lt;he/she&gt; will be luckier still to have the great Xanos by &lt;his/her&gt; side!</string>
<string name="4455">Get over yourself already, Xanos. &lt;FirstName&gt; will pick whomever &lt;he/she&gt; picks... and it will probably be someone &lt;he/she&gt; can stand.</string>
<string name="4456">Yes, yes, as I said. Me!</string>
<string name="4457">There is also bound to be some equipment here in the school which can help you. See if you can find some. Healing equipment especially... if you can&apos;t find potions, healing kits will have to do.</string>
<string name="4458">As for the artifacts themselves, I can tell you what I know about them if you wish. It&apos;s not much, but it might help.</string>
<string name="4459">Beyond that, all that remains is to go out into Hilltop and follow the trail of the kobolds. It should not be difficult... their passing will have been noticed, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="4460">I will help you as much as I can, but my first duty is to keep Drogan alive. Whatever this poison is inside him, I intend to fight it.</string>
<string name="4461">Excellent. I will tend to Drogan, then. Return to me when you have discovered anything.</string>
<string name="4462">Not well. Until I get those supplies, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll see much of an improvement. Remember: I still need &lt;CUSTOM1005&gt; as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="4463">Poorly. It takes all the magic I can muster to keep the poison from killing him. I will do what I can... he is a strong dwarf, I&apos;m sure he will pull through.</string>
<string name="4464">Yes, actually, perhaps there is. I believe the poison is a magically-altered form of snake venom... perhaps from an asp or something similar.</string>
<string name="4465">If that is the case, there may be some herbs that can speed Drogan&apos;s recovery. There is an herbalist in Hilltop who should have them.</string>
<string name="4466">Go to the herbalist and tell him that you need a tressym tongue, some charcoal and some helmthorn berries. Then bring those back to me.</string>
<string name="4467">Fine, for now, thanks to those herbs. He lapses in and out of consciousness and still needs my attention, but the prognosis is good.</string>
<string name="4468">You can try to speak to him if you wish. His mind is a bit... fevered, however, so do not overtax him.</string>
<string name="4469">I will go with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You will have need of my powerful magics and not so much of Dorna&apos;s little sneakings, yes?</string>
<string name="4470">Powerful magics? Are you talking about the few little spells you can fire off before you run screaming like a naked halfling?</string>
<string name="4471">I know nothing what you speak of, little dwarf. Xanos has great magics and fights well to boot!</string>
<string name="4472">I see. Well maybe you&apos;ll introduce me to him, sometime.</string>
<string name="4473">I&apos;ll go with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Our skills will complement each other... and besides, I expect you&apos;ll need some muscle to back you up.</string>
<string name="4474">Muscle? Eh? All I see is little dwarf with very big mouth.</string>
<string name="4475">Better that than a big half-orc with an oversized ego.</string>
<string name="4476">You make fun of Xanos, but you shall see. &lt;FirstName&gt; will pick Xanos gladly and then Xanos will laugh at you. Ha ha ha!</string>
<string name="4477">There are other students who can accompany you on this mission. You might also think of asking Dorna or Xanos to accompany you. The others can remain here and guard the school.</string>
<string name="4478">And what do you intend to do, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Let Drogan die? Let whoever was behind this attack do as they wish with these artifacts?</string>
<string name="4479">Is this what Drogan trained you to become? Someone so selfish that &lt;he/she&gt; would sooner stand around and act like a petulant child than face a real adventure when it arises?</string>
<string name="4480">Thank the gods. I was beginning to wonder what sort of &lt;man/woman&gt; Drogan chose as his prize pupil... I&apos;m glad to see he was not mistaken.</string>
<string name="4481">Drogan&apos;s life is already on the line, as are many others who will be endangered should those artifacts not be retrieved. And they do not have the benefit of your ring!</string>
<string name="4482">Oh no? If the fact that Drogan is responsible for what you are now and trusts you is not enough, then do it for yourself!</string>
<string name="4483">Gods help us that we would have to turn to one so craven for aid, but one would think you would look forward to the experience to back up your mouth at the very least!</string>
<string name="4484">Or is that not why you came to this school, seeking wealth or power? Whatever your reasons, find them... but you *will* help us in this!</string>
<string name="4485">The gods help us if one such as you is considered by Drogan to be his prize pupil. If you are able to do this, however, I suppose his trust is justified.</string>
<string name="4486">I doubt your hands are any better than the hands the artifacts currently lie in... but I am not their keeper. Find and retrieve them. That will be enough.</string>
<string name="4487">I am not in charge of you in the slightest, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am here to help Drogan and see these artifacts returned, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="4488">Nothing? The poison resists? How can that be? This is no simple toxin these kobolds have used, here.</string>
<string name="4489">How could they have acquired such a poison, I wonder. And why did they come all this way just to strike at Master Drogan? There must be an answer!</string>
<string name="4490">What kind of question is that? Of course he is not going to die, not if I can help it. Does that disappoint you somehow?</string>
<string name="4491">Please ignore &lt;FirstName&gt;&apos;s rudeness, my lady. We appreciate your assistance, naturally, it&apos;s just that... we don&apos;t know who you are.</string>
<string name="4492">I don&apos;t know, to tell the truth. The fact that this poison resists curative magic disturbs me greatly. I shall try my best to aid him.</string>
<string name="4493">I find it more than a little suspicious that some helpful stranger would show up just as these little creatures attack, eh?</string>
<string name="4494">How rude! This lady aids us without asking for anything in return. Would you repay her with suspicion?</string>
<string name="4495">Rude or not, I&apos;d like an answer, as well. You have remarkable timing, my lady.</string>
<string name="4496">Of course you are suspicious. I would be, as well, were I in your shoes. Allow me to introduce myself: my name is Ayala Windspear.</string>
<string name="4497">I have been following the tracks of these kobolds for almost two days, now. I thought it odd that they would range so far from their home caves in the Nether Mountains.</string>
<string name="4498">I never imagined they would do something like this, however. As soon as I realized they were headed for Hilltop I came as quickly as I could... but too late.</string>
<string name="4499">Believe me or not, as you wish. I was only passing through this area when I noticed the activity of these kobolds. It was my responsibility to investigate.</string>
<string name="4500">There will be time enough for that. Our first priority is to find out why this happened... and what can be done to help Drogan.</string>
<string name="4501">But I don&apos;t understand... why would anyone want to attack Master Drogan?</string>
<string name="4502">I was just passing through this area, to be perfectly honest. It&apos;s my responsibility to take note of strange occurrences and investigate them, however.</string>
<string name="4503">What do you mean it&apos;s your responsibility?</string>
<string name="4504">I am a Harper, as is Drogan. Do you know what a Harper is?</string>
<string name="4505">I&apos;m sure everyone is shocked. The Harpers are a group of fools who meddle in the affairs of others to maintain their own interests.</string>
<string name="4506">That is a viewpoint born of ignorance. We Harpers band together to fight evil wherever it arises, even though some may call it &apos;meddling&apos;.</string>
<string name="4507">This naturally means that the Harpers have many enemies. I suspect one of them is responsible for this attack. I hope I am wrong.</string>
<string name="4508">I... believe... I can shed some light on that...</string>
<string name="4509">Master Drogan!</string>
<string name="4510">One that secretly meddles in the affairs of others, whether they are welcome or not.</string>
<string name="4511">Indeed, you are well-informed. Doing so has left the Harpers with many enemies, however. It may be one of those that is behind this attack.</string>
<string name="4512">That&apos;s it? The little beasts are all gone? Then I shall see to Drogan now. I can only imagine what they did to make him fall.</string>
<string name="4513">Poison? I cannot tell the type, but I should be able to counter it with my magic. Hold on, good dwarf...</string>
<string name="4514">Have you any news of the artifacts, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="4515">Excellent. To be honest, this artifact was the one I was most afraid of ending up in the wrong hands. Belpheron was a frightening villain, to say the least.</string>
<string name="4516">I do remember something about this hand, now that I think about it. It... it is possible that it might be able to point the way to the other artifacts. Quite literally.</string>
<string name="4517">You could try... using the hand to direct you to them, if you feel it is necessary. Do you want to keep it for that?</string>
<string name="4518">As you wish. It&apos;s probably for the best... there&apos;s no telling just what Belpheron&apos;s hand is capable of, really.</string>
<string name="4519">I see. I won&apos;t argue with you for now... at least it&apos;s not in unknown hands. I&apos;d be careful with that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You don&apos;t know what it can do.</string>
<string name="4520">Very well. Be careful with it. It&apos;s ability to point out things may not be all it&apos;s capable of, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4521">You have? Good. I don&apos;t know what powers the tooth might bring to a dragon or similar creature, but the possibilities are frightening enough.</string>
<string name="4522">Good work, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That makes one less artifact that we need to worry about.</string>
<string name="4523">Have you found anything else, yet?</string>
<string name="4524">J&apos;Nah? Hmmm. I can&apos;t say that I do, really, though the name does... ring a bell. A sorceress, you say?</string>
<string name="4525">I will think on it, &lt;FirstName&gt;. In the meantime, I suggest you find her lair and learn who she is... or who she serves. This information may be vital.</string>
<string name="4526">Tymofarrar... that does sound familiar. He is a young white dragon from the Nether Mountains, I believe. Relatively benign, as far as his kind can be... but very selfish.</string>
<string name="4527">Is he the one that is behind the kobolds? That would make sense. Tymofarrar would want the artifacts for himself if he ever heard of them.</string>
<string name="4528">But how did he hear of them? Tymofarrar is a potent beast, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but he is no great wizard and not overly intelligent for a dragon.</string>
<string name="4529">Very odd. Your only recourse may be to find his lair in the Nether Mountains and learn more. You must be stealthy, however... battling him would be your death.</string>
<string name="4530">And there&apos;s no other way to get it from him? Then you may have to help him, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Hopefully what he wants isn&apos;t... distasteful.</string>
<string name="4531">Have you learned anything else?</string>
<string name="4532">Ambushed by gnolls? The only gnolls from this area come from the High Forest... but they&apos;ve no reason to attack the kobolds.</string>
<string name="4533">Could it be that someone sent the gnolls to steal the artifacts for themselves? But then someone else would have had to know about them.</string>
<string name="4534">You may have to look into both the gnolls and the kobolds in order to find th rest of the artifacts, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Be careful.</string>
<string name="4535">Thank the gods! Let me see what you have...</string>
<string name="4536">...hmmm. I still need a tressym tongue. Without it, I can&apos;t help Drogan. Please do what you can, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4537">...hmmm. I still need some charcoal. Without it, I can&apos;t help Drogan. Please do what you can, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4538">...hmmm. I still need some helmthorn berries. Without them, I can&apos;t help Drogan. Please do what you can, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4539">...hmmm. I still need some helmthorn berries and some charcoal. Without them, I can&apos;t help Drogan. Please do what you can, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4540">...hmmm. I still need some helmthorn berries and a tressym tongue. Without them, I can&apos;t help Drogan. Please do what you can, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4541">...hmmm. I still need a tressym tongue and some charcoal. Without them, I can&apos;t help Drogan. Please do what you can, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4542">Good, good. I have all the herbs I need for Drogan, now. Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;... you&apos;ve managed wonderfully.</string>
<string name="4543">There. That should do it. Hopefully we will see some kind of improvement soon.</string>
<string name="4544">You&apos;re certain? Never mind... I&apos;m sure you&apos;re trying your best, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4545">Is there something I can help you with, then?</string>
<string name="4546">Then I wish you luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Return to me when you have discovered anything.</string>
<string name="4547">I can try. Where do you need to go?</string>
<string name="4548">I believe I can. Allow me to scry their location...</string>
<string name="4549">There. I will send you there now, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Hold on.</string>
<string name="4550">A grim thought, isn&apos;t it? I would suggest that this might not be a good idea if whatever wounded you so terribly is still there. Are you ready to go?</string>
<string name="4551">Let&apos;s see... I just need the location from the ring. Yes... there. I have it. Hold on and I&apos;ll send you there now.</string>
<string name="4552">Are you certain? If you left danger in the spot you came from, it will still be there. I would not want you to waste crystals unnecessarily.</string>
<string name="4553">Alright. I should be able to pick up the location from your ring... yes, good, it&apos;s within range. One moment, please...</string>
<string name="4554">What would you like to know?</string>
<string name="4555">You want to know more about... me? Whatever for? My past isn&apos;t important here.</string>
<string name="4556">I&apos;m not trying to be unfriendly, &lt;FirstName&gt;... it&apos;s just that there are far more important things to do here than chatting with each other.</string>
<string name="4557">Believe me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, when I say we will have plenty of time to swap stories once this is all over, alright?</string>
<string name="4558">Drogan recognized me. Isn&apos;t that enough?</string>
<string name="4559">Good point. Regardless, you&apos;re going to have to take my word for it this once. Now I&apos;m sure you have something better to do...</string>
<string name="4560">I see. No offense, friend, but you&apos;re not my type. And this isn&apos;t exactly my idea of the perfect time.</string>
<string name="4561">You want to swap tales while I care for your dying mentor? Maybe another time, my friend.</string>
<string name="4562">Oh? Very cute. If you see some, do let me know.</string>
<string name="4563">Only very little. I came across their tracks when crossing one of the mountain paths through the Nether Mountains to the north.</string>
<string name="4564">When I realized that they had left the highlands and come down into the valley, I became alarmed. For kobolds to range so far from their home caves is unusual.</string>
<string name="4565">Kobolds are tiny, draconic predators that rely more on their cunning than their strength to survive. For them to be so bold means they either have much to gain... or much more to fear.</string>
<string name="4566">There&apos;s not much more to tell, I think. The Harpers seek to maintain a balance in the world even in the face of those who would abuse their powers.</string>
<string name="4567">Some claim we are spies, others consider us dangerous meddlers or even outright assassins. In truth we are a little of all things, when the situation warrants it.</string>
<string name="4568">You know... it was always our hope that Drogan&apos;s students might take the cue from their tutor and become Harpers themselves, in fact. What do you think of that?</string>
<string name="4569">That&apos;s good. You certainly seem like the sort of &lt;man/woman&gt; who would do well amongst the Harpers. We will have to wait and see.</string>
<string name="4570">Oh? I wonder why that would be? You don&apos;t strike me as the sort of &lt;man/woman&gt; who would be interested. We&apos;ll have to wait and see.</string>
<string name="4571">Well, you have plenty of time. It would be too soon to even consider membership in the Harpers... but perhaps this is your chance, no?</string>
<string name="4572">Truly? That&apos;s too bad. You seem like the kind of &lt;man/woman&gt; the Harpers could use more of.</string>
<string name="4573">Hmm. Perhaps that&apos;s for the best. You strike me as the sort of &lt;man/woman&gt; who wouldn&apos;t sit well with the Harper ideals.</string>
<string name="4574">I know a little about these artifacts, but keep in mind that anything I tell you comes mostly from memory. I wish I had more detailed information to offer.</string>
<string name="4575">Let&apos;s see... if I remember correctly, there are four artifacts in total: a mummified hand, a dragon&apos;s tooth, a statue of a tower and a mask.</string>
<string name="4576">All four of them have considerable power of a malevolent nature, although we have yet to discover an application for any of this power.</string>
<string name="4577">The fact that the power exists could be tempting enough for some... and it&apos;s very possible that there may be someone out there who knows more about these artifacts than we do.</string>
<string name="4578">The trouble will be figuring out which artifact the thief is, in fact, interested in... and what they intend to do with it. Considering the nature of these items, it is certainly evil.</string>
<string name="4579">And where, exactly, would somewhere safe be? Behind the walls of a keep, surrounded by guards? What better way to announce that you hide something of value.</string>
<string name="4580">No, the Harpers believed that this school was remote enough and nondescript enough to be considered safe from molestation. For many years that has indeed been the case.</string>
<string name="4581">That once belonged to a high priest of the Lord of Shadows, I believe, and is imbued with considerable power... though nobody has figured out how to use it.</string>
<string name="4582">Seeing as the God of Thieves rarely produces items of benevolent purpose, it was decided best to keep the mask safe and out of his followers&apos; hands.</string>
<string name="4583">Perhaps someone has figured out how to use the mask&apos;s power? If so, any amount of mischief could be expected as a result.</string>
<string name="4584">I... actually do not know much about that. I believe it was found in a desert tomb many years ago, and one of our wizards detected powerful and destructive magic within it.</string>
<string name="4585">The nature of the magic could not be discerned, however, so it was put aside to be kept safe until more could be discovered about it.</string>
<string name="4586">I have my doubts that the statue would be of use to anyone. Perhaps its theft was only incidental because it lay with the rest.</string>
<string name="4587">A remnant of the great wyrm Hephaestagon, a great dragon that also wielded the most evil of the black arts.</string>
<string name="4588">The dragon died long ago... but it&apos;s possible that the kobolds could have some interest in it, seeing as they are of draconic origin themselves.</string>
<string name="4589">I have trouble believing the kobolds are the instigators of this theft, however. It&apos;s more likely they serve another... perhaps even a dragon aspiring to have Hephaestagon&apos;s power.</string>
<string name="4590">It belonged to a powerful lich named Belpheron, as I understand it. The hand was all that was left when he was destroyed.</string>
<string name="4591">I remember it being said that some of Belpheron&apos;s power remained in the hand. Perhaps someone is trying to tap into it... or perhaps one of Belpheron&apos;s old followers wants him resurrected.</string>
<string name="4592">If that was the case, it would be terrible news. Belpheron threatened to destroy Faerun the first time... we certainly don&apos;t need him trying again.</string>
<string name="4593">I wish I could help you, but until Drogan&apos;s condition stabilizes all my magic is needed just to keep him alive.</string>
<string name="4594">There is a temple within Hilltop, isn&apos;t there? Perhaps there is a cleric there who can provide you some healing.</string>
<string name="4595">I&apos;m sorry, but I need all my magic just to keep Drogan alive. If you get those herbs from the herbalist for me, perhaps I could stabilize his condition.</string>
<string name="4596">Certainly. Allow me a moment to prepare my spells...</string>
<string name="4597">Well, that depends... is Drogan still using the teleportation rings he created?</string>
<string name="4598">Hmm. Yes, I see that he did.</string>
<string name="4599">Yes. He gave one to each of us, actually.</string>
<string name="4600">The fact that you have them is good. As I recall, the ring uses the energy of a focus crystal to pull you to Drogan in the instant before death, correct?</string>
<string name="4601">You can also use them voluntarily to return to Drogan&apos;s side. Seeing as I&apos;ll be wherever Drogan is in both cases, we can use that to our advantage.</string>
<string name="4602">I should be able to use the connection between the ring and the spot you came from to teleport you back there, if need be.</string>
<string name="4603">I wouldn&apos;t advise jumping back somewhere dangerous... but I will at least be able to save you some time. I&apos;m afraid there&apos;s not much more I can do to help.</string>
<string name="4604">No, of course not. I would imagine that Drogan has a lab around here... perhaps in his room? If you can find it, there might be a way to make more crystals.</string>
<string name="4605">You know about them? He gave a ring to each of us.</string>
<string name="4606">Bah! Too bad he did not wear one himself!</string>
<string name="4607">I don&apos;t think it works like that.</string>
<string name="4608">If you ask whether or not he still gives the rings to his students, the answer is yes. Thankfully, yes.</string>
<string name="4609">You needn&apos;t get so excited about them, Xanos. They&apos;re just rings.</string>
<string name="4610">You keep that smirk where I cannot see it, dwarf. These rings will save our lives plenty in the days to come!</string>
<string name="4611">Where did  you go?  I was just looking at the herbs you brought back.</string>
<string name="4612">You should speak to Drogan. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s eager to discuss what you&apos;ve been up to.</string>
<string name="4613">I am not sure if we&apos;ll meet again, so I wish you well. You are braver than any of us could have imagined.</string>
<string name="4614">What artifacts are you talking about?</string>
<string name="4615">I guess you&apos;ll be leaving, then...</string>
<string name="4616">You&apos;d better hurry if you want to catch up to those creatures.</string>
<string name="4617">Well, if the kobolds stole these artifacts, we should get them back!</string>
<string name="4618">I&apos;ll help in whatever way I can.</string>
<string name="4619">You can count on me, Master Drogan. I won&apos;t fail you.</string>
<string name="4620">Are you sure, Master Drogan? If this is so important...</string>
<string name="4621">I assume the Harpers will reward me handsomely if I help out?</string>
<string name="4622">I&apos;m not your errand &lt;boy/girl&gt;. Get somebody else to do it.</string>
<string name="4623">What?! Why me?! I&apos;ll get killed!</string>
<string name="4624">Can&apos;t the Harpers help at all?</string>
<string name="4625">Tell me why are these artifacts so important.</string>
<string name="4626">I will do my best. Do you have any advice?</string>
<string name="4627">But I haven&apos;t a clue where to start!</string>
<string name="4628">I should go and get ready.</string>
<string name="4629">How is Master Drogan doing?</string>
<string name="4630">Is there something I can do to help Master Drogan?</string>
<string name="4631">Forget it. I&apos;ve got better things to do.</string>
<string name="4632">I suppose you&apos;re right...</string>
<string name="4633">I don&apos;t do anything unless there&apos;s some profit in it.</string>
<string name="4634">A real adventure? I&apos;m more worried about my own neck.</string>
<string name="4635">I don&apos;t owe Drogan anything, thank you very much.</string>
<string name="4636">Alright, alright, enough. I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="4637">And should I decide to keep these artifacts once I find them?</string>
<string name="4638">Fine. But I won&apos;t be bossed around by you.</string>
<string name="4639">So the old dwarf is finally going to die, I take it?</string>
<string name="4640">Is Master Drogan going to be alright?</string>
<string name="4641">You just happened to arrive too late, huh? Likely story.</string>
<string name="4642">Why would anyone want to attack Master Drogan? I don&apos;t understand.</string>
<string name="4643">Shouldn&apos;t we chase down these kobolds? We can&apos;t let them get away!</string>
<string name="4644">Why were you following these kobolds to begin with?</string>
<string name="4645">No, no idea at all.</string>
<string name="4646">Someone who interferes in the business of others?</string>
<string name="4647">The Harpers... it&apos;s some kind of secret organization, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="4648">Aren&apos;t the Harpers some kind of secret society that fights evil?</string>
<string name="4649">Who are you to be demanding answers, anyway?</string>
<string name="4650">Thank you for your help, but... who are you?</string>
<string name="4651">I have recovered the mummified hand.</string>
<string name="4652">No, I don&apos;t need it.</string>
<string name="4653">I don&apos;t need the help, but I&apos;ll keep it.</string>
<string name="4654">If it can help, then yes... I&apos;ll hold onto it.</string>
<string name="4655">I have recovered the dragon&apos;s tooth.</string>
<string name="4656">I have recovered the mask.</string>
<string name="4657">Do you know anything about a sorceress named J&apos;Nah?</string>
<string name="4658">Do you know anything about a dragon named Tymofarrar?</string>
<string name="4659">A kobold by the name of Deekin holds the tower statue... but he won&apos;t give it to me unless I help him.</string>
<string name="4660">It seems the kobolds were ambushed by gnolls outside of Hilltop.</string>
<string name="4661">No, but I do have some of the herbs you asked for.</string>
<string name="4662">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I haven&apos;t found anything.</string>
<string name="4663">No, nothing yet.</string>
<string name="4664">I should be going.</string>
<string name="4665">Can you teleport me somewhere?</string>
<string name="4666">Nowhere, at the moment.</string>
<string name="4667">I need to find the party leader.</string>
<string name="4668">I need to go to the spot where I &quot;died&quot;, so to speak.</string>
<string name="4669">No - maybe not just yet.</string>
<string name="4670">Yes - I&apos;m ready.</string>
<string name="4671">I need to go back to the last place I used the ring.</string>
<string name="4672">No, never mind.</string>
<string name="4673">Yes, I want to go.</string>
<string name="4674">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="4675">I don&apos;t have any more questions.</string>
<string name="4676">Tell me more about yourself.</string>
<string name="4677">I suppose you&apos;re right.</string>
<string name="4678">Would it hurt to get to know each other a bit?</string>
<string name="4679">I want to be sure you are who you say you are.</string>
<string name="4680">He could have been just delirious from the poison.</string>
<string name="4681">I just thought a beautiful woman like yourself could use some decent company.</string>
<string name="4682">Can you tell me more about the kobolds?</string>
<string name="4683">I want to know more about the Harpers.</string>
<string name="4684">I&apos;d very much like to become a Harper.</string>
<string name="4685">I&apos;d have to think about it.</string>
<string name="4686">Not interested, thanks.</string>
<string name="4687">Tell me more about these artifacts.</string>
<string name="4688">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="4689">Why are these items so dangerous?</string>
<string name="4690">Why were the artifacts kept here, then? Why not somewhere safer?</string>
<string name="4691">Tell me more about the mask.</string>
<string name="4692">Tell me more about the tower statue.</string>
<string name="4693">Tell me more about the dragon&apos;s tooth.</string>
<string name="4694">Tell me more about the mummified hand.</string>
<string name="4695">I need some healing.</string>
<string name="4696">I have some of the herbs you asked for.</string>
<string name="4697">How else can you help me, exactly?</string>
<string name="4698">Do you have more crystals for the rings?</string>
<string name="4699">[Drogan barely stirs when you approach him. He is sweating profusely and stirs agitatedly as if caught in the grips of a bad dream.]</string>
<string name="4700">[Drogan stirs slightly as you approach, looking up at you with tired eyes.] ...&lt;FirstName&gt;? Does... all go well?</string>
<string name="4701">Thank you... &lt;FirstName&gt;, my &lt;boy/girl&gt;. I... know you will do well...</string>
<string name="4702">Do not strain yourself, Drogan. As &lt;FirstName&gt; said, you need your rest.</string>
<string name="4703">I... wish that were so, &lt;FirstName&gt;. This... poison... still courses through me...</string>
<string name="4704">Enough. Drogan cannot help you just yet, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though the dwarf is stubborn enough I almost think he might try. Please let him rest.</string>
<string name="4705">I... am sorry... that was necessary, &lt;FirstName&gt;. This is... too important. I know... you will not fail us.</string>
<string name="4706">That&apos;s enough, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Drogan needs his rest if he has any hope of recovering fully.</string>
<string name="4707">I knew... that you were... capable, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You have my... full confidence...</string>
<string name="4708">Do not overtax Master Drogan just yet, &lt;FirstName&gt;, please. He needs as much rest as he can get.</string>
<string name="4709">[Drogan&apos;s condition has improved, and his hands are cool to the touch. For the moment he appears to be deeply asleep.]</string>
<string name="4710">[For once, Drogan seems to be resting peacefully. The sweat beading his brow is the only indication that he is ill.]</string>
<string name="4711">[Drogan looks to be a fair amount better, though still far from healthy. He does not wake as you approach.]</string>
<string name="4712">Please do not disturb him, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We must let him rest while he can.</string>
<string name="4713">[Drogan stirs as you approach, moaning. His eyes clear as he looks at you with pained affection.] &lt;FirstName&gt;... my &lt;boy/girl&gt;... [Then he lapses back into unconsciousness.]</string>
<string name="4714">[You try to speak to Drogan, but he barely reacts to your words. He seems fevered and while his eyes flutter open several times, they do not focus on you.]</string>
<string name="4715">The worst is over, I believe, but Drogan still needs time to rest. Perhaps you will be able to talk to him later, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4716">[While Drogan&apos;s color has improved significantly, he currently cannot be roused from his unconsciousness. His breathing is shallow and irregular.]</string>
<string name="4717">It is good to see you back. I... feel much recovered, though my nurse here seems to believe otherwise.</string>
<string name="4718">You should be in bed, you stubborn dwarf. Look at you! Your legs are shaking! The poison has still not completely left your system.</string>
<string name="4719">Enough, woman! I will not lay about like an invalid if I have the strength to stand! Especially not while &lt;FirstName&gt; is running about endangering &lt;him/her&gt;self for our benefit!</string>
<string name="4720">Suit yourself. Should you collapse before the hour&apos;s over, I&apos;ll not take responsibility for you.</string>
<string name="4721">Hrrumph! I&apos;ll take my chances. Better that than to be prodded by an over-concerned elf all day long. Tell me, &lt;FirstName&gt;... how fares your hunt?</string>
<string name="4722">Hah! You think to fool your old mentor, do you? Well, what else is new? I may have been poisoned, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;, but that certainly doesn&apos;t make me any blinder than I was.</string>
<string name="4723">I can sense that you have at least one of the artifacts on you. Let&apos;s take a look, shall we?</string>
<string name="4724">Ahhh, good, good! Well done, my &lt;boy/girl&gt;! Let&apos;s see it, shall we?</string>
<string name="4725">So you do, so you do. Well done, my &lt;boy/girl&gt;! Let&apos;s see them, shall we?</string>
<string name="4726">What&apos;s this? This is definitely the tower statue, but it&apos;s been broken... and there&apos;s something inside of it? How very odd.</string>
<string name="4727">You&apos;ve the reward of experience, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;... and by the look of it, you&apos;ve found plenty else along the way. There&apos;s little more one could ask for, yes?</string>
<string name="4728">Patience, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. You&apos;ve proven yourself and then some... but allow me first to examine this bauble.</string>
<string name="4729">Hmmm. How interesting. However this statue became broken, that seems to have been a fortuitous event indeed.</string>
<string name="4730">We do not normally go about breaking magical artifacts we find, you see... and so we would not have realized that this statue was a container and not the artifact, itself.</string>
<string name="4731">And inside... a crystal. A crystal giving off far, far more power than we detected previously. Perhaps the statue itself was shielding the crystal from detection? How interesting.</string>
<string name="4732">I must admit, however, that I&apos;ve never seen anything of its like before. Is there anything you&apos;ve learned about this crystal during your adventure, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="4733">But not why... hmmm. A true mystery, then. Well, it is no longer safe here. Whoever sent J&apos;Nah to retrieve it will no doubt try again.</string>
<string name="4734">I will need to take this crystal and get it looked at by someone who knows of such things. Until then, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I think you --</string>
<string name="4735">Are you certain that is wise, Drogan? Whoever wants this crystal would be keeping an eye out for you, don&apos;t you think? They already felled you once.</string>
<string name="4736">And what do you propose, Ayala? I will not huddle in my home out of fear.</string>
<string name="4737">I&apos;m simply suggesting that perhaps &lt;FirstName&gt; might be better suited to taking this artifact to be identified. No-one will be watching &lt;him/her&gt;.</string>
<string name="4738">Perhaps... but Ayala has a point when she says that they have taken me down once. Whoever is behind this knows who I am. But I doubt they know who you are.</string>
<string name="4739">We cannot be sure. But it seems safe to say that whoever is behind this had no idea of your capabilities before now... I hope that that continues.</string>
<string name="4740">I... know that this is much to ask of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can only say that this mystery is vital to solve and that only you can rise to this challenge.</string>
<string name="4741">Whoever wants this crystal knows more about it than we do. We need to catch up, &lt;FirstName&gt;, so we will know why they want it.</string>
<string name="4742">And, truth be told, I suppose I am not fully... recovered... from the poison. I would be no match for anything they would surely send my way.</string>
<string name="4743">Your final test is over, my dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. I am no longer your master. All I can ask you as a peer and proud former tutor that you undertake this dangerous mission.</string>
<string name="4744">If that&apos;s what you desire, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I&apos;ll not stand in your way. I will be sad to see you go, but I&apos;m confident you&apos;re ready for this kind of task.</string>
<string name="4745">If it&apos;s a reward you want, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, there will be plenty to find on the way... and if this is as important as I suspect I&apos;m sure there will be rewards for you afterwards, as well.</string>
<string name="4746">Hah! I&apos;m glad to see you don&apos;t let any of this business get to you. I think you will do just fine, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="4747">You needn&apos;t call me Master Drogan anymore, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Just Drogan will do. And I&apos;m quite sure that your best will be more than good enough.</string>
<string name="4748">The man you will need to show the crystal to is an old friend by the name of Garrick Halassar. An expert in the field of dweomer analysis, as it were.</string>
<string name="4749">Hmn. Now that&apos;s a good question. I&apos;d assume he&apos;s still out in the Anauroch desert digging up Netherese artifacts. He took the caravan out of Hilltop headed there about a year back.</string>
<string name="4750">If you are referring to the halflings, Drogan, that caravan is in Hilltop now.</string>
<string name="4751">Truly? That is most fortunate. They might even know exactly where Garrick is, then.  There you go, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You can travel with the caravan.</string>
<string name="4752">I&apos;ll make arrangements for you and the other apprentices to join them. Ayala and I, in the meantime, will contact the Harpers and do what we can.</string>
<string name="4753">So are you ready to go? Or is there something you need to do beforehand?</string>
<string name="4754">Then I suggest you do it quickly. Collect whatever equipment you need and then come tell either me or the caravan leader when you are ready to leave.</string>
<string name="4755">Good. If the gods smile on us, then the situation is not as dire as I fear. If not... well, then I wish you the best of luck.</string>
<string name="4756">I would not even worry about that right now, my &lt;boy/girl&gt;. It is obvious that what J&apos;Nah was seeking was this statue... or, rather, this crystal.</string>
<string name="4757">Right now it&apos;s more important that this crystal get identified. We can look at retrieving the other artifacts after that is done.</string>
<string name="4758">I didn&apos;t claim otherwise, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. Believe it or not, however it did become broken might have been a fortuitous occurrence for us.</string>
<string name="4759">Broken by a kobold, you say? Hmmm. Well, believe it or not, that may have been a fortuitous turn of events.</string>
<string name="4760">Hmmm. You know... the fact that this tower statue has been broken may turn out to be a most fortuitous event. Look here.</string>
<string name="4761">I trust you&apos;re ready to leave for the desert, then, yes?</string>
<string name="4762">Don&apos;t worry about it, Master Drogan. You should rest. </string>
<string name="4763">No, not really. Are you well enough to help?</string>
<string name="4764">Well enough, considering you forced me into this.</string>
<string name="4765">It is going well, Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="4766">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Not so good. I haven&apos;t found anything.</string>
<string name="4767">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Give him the tower statue.]&lt;/Start&gt; It went well. I have the broken tower statue here.</string>
<string name="4768">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Only give him the tower statue.]&lt;/Start&gt; It went well. I have the broken tower statue here.</string>
<string name="4769">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Only give him the tower statue.]&lt;/Start&gt; It went well. I have the broken tower statue here.</string>
<string name="4770">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Give all the artifacts you have.]&lt;/Start&gt; It went well. I have some of the artifacts here.</string>
<string name="4771">I sure hope there&apos;s a reward after all that work...</string>
<string name="4772">Look, I did what you asked... is my final test over?</string>
<string name="4773">Only that J&apos;Nah was seeking it for someone else.</string>
<string name="4774">Master Drogan is far more capable than I am, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="4775">How sure can you be that no-one will be watching for me?</string>
<string name="4776">I&apos;m not interested in going anywhere.</string>
<string name="4777">You want me to take the artifact somewhere? Why?</string>
<string name="4778">Spare me the compliments. I suppose it will get me out of here.</string>
<string name="4779">And just what do I get out of it?</string>
<string name="4780">Why not? Sounds like fun.</string>
<string name="4781">I would be honored, Master Drogan. I&apos;ll do my best.</string>
<string name="4782">And where would I find this Garrick?</string>
<string name="4783">I need to do something, first.</string>
<string name="4784">Yes, I&apos;m ready to go.</string>
<string name="4785">But I haven&apos;t even found all the artifacts, yet.</string>
<string name="4786">But you&apos;re far more capable than I am, Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="4787">But I&apos;m not interested in going anywhere!</string>
<string name="4788">So you want me to take this crystal somewhere?</string>
<string name="4789">I don&apos;t know anything about that. That&apos;s how I got it.</string>
<string name="4790">It was accidentally broken by the kobold I got it from, but I don&apos;t know what&apos;s inside it.</string>
<string name="4791">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Give all the artifacts you have.]&lt;/Start&gt; It went well. I have all of the artifacts now.</string>
<string name="4792">Aha! It is &lt;FirstName&gt;! Tell me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, surely you have heard how our dear Mischa fared in her last test?</string>
<string name="4793">I have had enough of your jibes, Xanos. You would have done no better.</string>
<string name="4794">On the contrary, dear lady, I tend to do exactly what Master Drogan asks me to do. If he says to rescue the goblin child, then I rescue the goblin child! It is not so difficult.</string>
<string name="4795">Hmph. I somehow doubt Master Drogan would ask you to rescue anything that he didn&apos;t expect you to rob, first.</string>
<string name="4796">Ha ha! You are the aspiring thief amongst us, little Dorna, not I!</string>
<string name="4797">But a goblin is an evil creature, child or no. How can I be expected to lend it aid? It was not a fair test of my abilities.</string>
<string name="4798">Bah! Fair? Who ever said that Master Drogan must be fair? He teaches us of the adventurer&apos;s life, which is never fair!</string>
<string name="4799">And what would you know of the adventurer&apos;s life, Xanos? Do tell the rest of us.</string>
<string name="4800">Bah! Nothing... yet. That will change one day, but not for our Mischa, I think.</string>
<string name="4801">I just do not understand why Master Drogan would expect me to be other than I am. It was an unworthy test.</string>
<string name="4802">Thank you for piping in with such an intelligent observation, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m sure we all feel enlightened now.</string>
<string name="4803">Leave &lt;him/her&gt; alone, Xanos. &lt;FirstName&gt; is the senior student here and has earned far more accolades than you.</string>
<string name="4804">Master Drogan tests us all, &lt;FirstName&gt;, so that we reach the potential we came to his school to achieve.</string>
<string name="4805">Your tests are different than the rest of ours, naturally, but the goal is the same. Master Drogan is a very wise man.</string>
<string name="4806">They say he was a great adventurer before he retired. That is what I hope to benefit from, not his wisdom!</string>
<string name="4807">I don&apos;t know. Perhaps there is a lesson in Master Drogan&apos;s test that I have not yet considered...</string>
<string name="4808">Your tests are more related to stealth and combat, as mine are, but the goal is the same. Master Drogan is a very wise man.</string>
<string name="4809">Your tests are more related to magic, of course, just as Xanos&apos;s are, but the goal is the same. Master Drogan is a very wise man.</string>
<string name="4810">You are a paladin... surely you were tested in some of the same ways as Mischa has been, no? Master Drogan is a very wise man.</string>
<string name="4811">Oh, my. Would one of you ladies be willing to put it in monosyllables for &lt;him/her&gt;?</string>
<string name="4812">Leave &lt;him/her&gt; alone, Xanos. &lt;FirstName&gt; is the senior student here and has earned far more accolades than you.</string>
<string name="4813">Of course I wish to graduate, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I must be what I am, however, or what would be the worth of Master Drogan&apos;s teachings?</string>
<string name="4814">So you know enough to decide which of Master Drogan&apos;s teachings are worthy? Why, he should graduate you right now if you know so much!</string>
<string name="4815">Perhaps... perhaps you are correct. Maybe I have just failed to learn the lesson Master Drogan intended.</string>
<string name="4816">Now *that* should tell you something, Mischa, when &lt;FirstName&gt; is calling you an idiot. Hah!</string>
<string name="4817">You are not a paladin, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I would not expect you to understand. A creature of evil deserves no mercy from the righteous.</string>
<string name="4818">Oh, and of course the child could not be raised differently, could it? It will always be an evil creature?</string>
<string name="4819">This is not about you, Xanos... and besides, you have human blood within to redeem you from your orcish heritage.</string>
<string name="4820">You humans are all the same. Sometimes I wonder just how redeeming my human blood really is. Pfah!</string>
<string name="4821">Perhaps there is a lesson to learn in Master Drogan&apos;s test that you have not thought of yet, Mischa.</string>
<string name="4822">Why? I suppose you have something better to do? All of us are finished our training for the day.</string>
<string name="4823">Just because you are the senior student does not make you superior to us, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Truly, I don&apos;t know why Master Drogan holds you in such high regard.</string>
<string name="4824">Hah! Well put, well put!</string>
<string name="4825">That is beneath you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I don&apos;t know why Master Drogan holds you in such high regard at all.</string>
<string name="4826">You shame me with your wisdom, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Of course you are correct. It is no wonder that Master Drogan holds you in such high regard.</string>
<string name="4827">My, my. Did you think that up all by yourself or did you read it somewhere?</string>
<string name="4828">Thank you for your kindness, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I suspect that Master Drogan will never hold me with the regard he has for you, however.</string>
<string name="4829">Bah! Who cares how the dwarf regards them? I came here to learn what I can from him and that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="4830">Hah! My sentiments exactly! The fact that Drogan is not richer tells me he has only so much adventuring knowledge to pass on!</string>
<string name="4831">Great wealth is not the goal of every adventurer, Xanos.</string>
<string name="4832">I do not speak for the fools, little girl. Let them do as they wish.</string>
<string name="4833">&lt;FirstName&gt;... I heard Master Drogan saying that your final test would be coming very soon. Do you think you are ready for it?</string>
<string name="4834">A reasonable answer. You are more patient than I would be in your shoes.</string>
<string name="4835">Then why did you even come to the school if all you want to do is leave? You sound very impatient.</string>
<string name="4836">Stupid question, is it? Well, we&apos;ll have to see just how ready you are.</string>
<string name="4837">You sound so confident. I wish I could say the same.</string>
<string name="4838">I bet that Master Drogan will take away &lt;FirstName&gt;&apos;s ring for the final test. Ha ha! No teleporting about for you!</string>
<string name="4839">But Master Drogan gave us the rings to keep us safe! They&apos;ve kept all of us from being killed during our training!</string>
<string name="4840">And what better way to test if you are ready to leave the nest, eh? What do you think of that, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Ready to lose your ring?</string>
<string name="4841">Hah! I am with &lt;FirstName&gt; on that one.</string>
<string name="4842">Well, you&apos;ll have to get used to life without it eventually. The ring only works within a few miles of Drogan, anyway, and needs his focus crystals to work.</string>
<string name="4843">Well, later is better than sooner. I intend to pawn it when I leave, anyway.</string>
<string name="4844">Ha ha! Xanos is weak of constitution and constantly in need of rescuing by the ring. That&apos;s why he thinks of it far more than you, I suspect.</string>
<string name="4845">Drogan gave you a ring when you came to the school, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Don&apos;t you still have it? It&apos;s meant to protect you from harm.</string>
<string name="4846">It needs focus crystals in order to work, but it teleports us to Master Drogan when we are badly hurt... or whenever we want to, really.</string>
<string name="4847">Don&apos;t waste the crystals, however. Master Drogan gets very mad if you do that... I learned that the hard way.</string>
<string name="4848">What a surprise. &lt;FirstName&gt; has forgotten about &lt;his/her&gt; ring.</string>
<string name="4849">Ha ha! Xanos is weak of constitution and constantly in need of rescuing by the ring. That&apos;s why he values it so highly, I think.</string>
<string name="4850">Shut up, little dwarf. I notice you&apos;ve no lack of focus crystals to power your precious ring.</string>
<string name="4851">Better to be safe than sorry, I always say.</string>
<string name="4852">Do you know what your final test will be, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Has Master Drogan said anything to you?</string>
<string name="4853">It is just a simple question, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I envy the fact that your final test will be over soon.</string>
<string name="4854">For once I agree with the little girl. I came to Master Drogan to learn how to be an adventurer... I wish to adventure!</string>
<string name="4855">True. I wish something exciting would happen here in Hilltop.</string>
<string name="4856">I know what you mean. I appreciate everything Master Drogan has done for me, but... I cannot wait until my own final test.</string>
<string name="4857">Bloody bards. You think you know everything, do you?</string>
<string name="4858">Bah! You know nothing! Whatever it is, the cunning little dwarf will not make it easy on you.</string>
<string name="4859">I cannot wait until Master Drogan gives me my final test. I wish I was in your shoes, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4860">And if Master Drogan tells you to hop about on one foot, would you do that too?</string>
<string name="4861">If such bootlicking makes one graduate faster, then I question the worth of Master Drogan&apos;s little school.</string>
<string name="4862">Perhaps it is the school that questions *your* worth, half-orc.</string>
<string name="4863">Hmph. For a paladin, you have quite a mouth on you, little girl.</string>
<string name="4864">&lt;FirstName&gt;... I heard Master Drogan saying that your final test would be coming very soon. Do you think you are ready for it?</string>
<string name="4865">Well, it appears that Master Drogan thinks highly of you, regardless, seeing as you are his prize pupil. Odd, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="4866">Do not listen to the little dwarf, &lt;FirstName&gt;. She is just jealous.</string>
<string name="4867">&lt;FirstName&gt;... I heard Master Drogan saying that your final test would be coming very soon. Do you think you are ready for it?</string>
<string name="4868">Oh, yes, listen to &lt;FirstName&gt;. We all know how smart &lt;he/she&gt; is.</string>
<string name="4869">You are a paladin, &lt;FirstName&gt;, how is it that you feel differently? Ours is the arm of the righteous. There can be no quarter with evil creatures.</string>
<string name="4870">I agree, that wasn&apos;t very fair of him.</string>
<string name="4871">Master Drogan wanted you to rescue a goblin? Why?</string>
<string name="4872">You are an idiot, girl. Do you want to graduate or not?</string>
<string name="4873">So you would leave a child to die, Mischa? What kind of paladin are you?</string>
<string name="4874">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh]&lt;/Start&gt;... don&apos;t any of you have anything better to do?</string>
<string name="4875">Or maybe you&apos;re an idiot that will never get out of this school.</string>
<string name="4876">Maybe he was trying to teach you that paladins are merciful as well as righteous.</string>
<string name="4877">You&apos;ll learn in time, Mischa. Don&apos;t worry about it.</string>
<string name="4878">You&apos;re a fool, Xanos. You have obviously learned nothing.</string>
<string name="4879">The rewards will be worth it in the end, I think.</string>
<string name="4880">I don&apos;t know. I will see when the time comes.</string>
<string name="4881">I could not care less. I just want out of here.</string>
<string name="4882">That&apos;s a stupid question. Of course I&apos;m ready.</string>
<string name="4883">I believe I am.</string>
<string name="4884">He&apos;ll have to pry it off my cold, dead finger.</string>
<string name="4885">What ring? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="4886">I&apos;ve never relied on that stupid ring, anyway.</string>
<string name="4887">Mind your own business.</string>
<string name="4888">Whatever it is, I can&apos;t wait for this to be over.</string>
<string name="4889">No, he hasn&apos;t. I have no idea what my final test will be.</string>
<string name="4890">I imagine my stealth and guile will be put to the test, somehow.</string>
<string name="4891">I am a monk. I expect my faith and skill at battle will be challenged.</string>
<string name="4892">I am a barbarian. I certainly hope it is my battle prowess that he will test.</string>
<string name="4893">I am a bard. There is nothing that Drogan can send my way that I&apos;m not prepared for.</string>
<string name="4894">I have no doubt my magical arts will be put to the test.</string>
<string name="4895">I am a druid. I expect my powers over nature will be challenged to the utmost.</string>
<string name="4896">I expect that Master Drogan will test the strength of my faith.</string>
<string name="4897">I am a ranger. I expect my knowledge of the wilderness and battle to be tested.</string>
<string name="4898">I am a warrior. No doubt he will test my battle prowess to the utmost.</string>
<string name="4899">I am a paladin. No doubt he will test my faith and my battle prowess.</string>
<string name="4900">If Master Drogan believes it is necessary, yes.</string>
<string name="4901">I respect Master Drogan. He is a learned man and a great wizard.</string>
<string name="4902">I agree with Xanos. I don&apos;t care what Master Drogan thinks of me.</string>

<string name="4926">Bethsheva is Farghan&apos;s animal companion, a powerful winter wolf bitch, and the dominant canine in Hilltop.</string>

<string name="4928">The guards of Hilltop look battle weary but alert.</string>
<string name="4929">This is a beautiful, young halfling. She appears very concerned with the well being of the other members of the halfling caravan.</string>
<string name="4930">Shadow Hart</string>
<string name="4931">Typically docile in nature, these rare, wild herbivores travel alone.  They possess limited teleportation ability, which they use to escape predators.</string>
<string name="4932">Nora</string>
<string name="4933">Blake</string>
<string name="4934">Nora Blake is a beautiful young woman and a new mother.</string>
<string name="4935">Daschnaya</string>
<string name="4936">This halfling has a wisdom in her eyes that speaks of one who sees more than most.</string>
<string name="4937">Mara the Cook</string>
<string name="4938">This is Mara, the cook at the Bubbling Cauldron.</string>
<string name="4939">Farghan</string>
<string name="4940">This is Farghan, the herbalist. He is a respected member of the community and a strong calming influence for the locals.</string>
<string name="4941">Ferran</string>
<string name="4942">Valiantheart</string>
<string name="4943">This elf has a quiet awareness about him that seems almost uncanny.</string>
<string name="4944">Farm Hand</string>
<string name="4945">This young, human farmhand looks strangely familiar. Perhaps you have met him before in Hilltop.</string>
<string name="4946">Blumberg Refugee</string>
<string name="4947">The refugees fill the back of the town hall, alive and well.</string>
<string name="4948">Piper</string>
<string name="4949">Piper has always been a little strange, making prophecies that never seem to come true. He spends a lot of time annoying the local guards and the mayor. Despite that, he has always been a harmless nuisance and most people ignore him completely.</string>
<string name="4950">Adam</string>
<string name="4951">This was Adam Blake, husband to young Nora and father of Tynan, a mere babe. Nora will be devastated to lose her husband.</string>
<string name="4952">Lodar the Tavernmaster</string>
<string name="4953">This is Lodar the tavernmaster. He is usually quite cheerful, but the kobold attack has left him in a poor mood.</string>
<string name="4954">Mayor Veraunt</string>
<string name="4955">Shuttlescomb</string>
<string name="4956">This is Mayor Veraunt. Although you have never seen him drunk before, he appears to be far gone in his cups at this point.</string>
<string name="4957">Nathan&apos;s farmhands look very physically fit and aware of their surroundings. Obviously they play a role in the survival of the Hurst homestead.</string>
<string name="4958">Nathan</string>
<string name="4959">Hurst</string>
<string name="4960">The dark skin of this dwarf reveals his race to be one of the grey dwarves, or duergar. He has a grim demeanor and a wary eye.</string>
<string name="4961">Becka</string>
<string name="4962">This female dwarf has a grayish cast to her skin that almost seems to be duergar. She wears a scowl on her face, but seems to be quite a pretty dwarf.</string>
<string name="4963">Szaren</string>
<string name="4964">The Red Wizard Szaren has returned to Hilltop and appears to have set up a temporary shop in this house.</string>
<string name="4965">This stranger appears to be wearing the garb of the infamous Red Wizards of Thay.</string>
<string name="4966">Thayvian Slave</string>

<string name="4972">A strange creature that seems to feed on magical emanations of all kinds.</string>
<string name="4973">Azith</string>
<string name="4974">Chief Gishnak</string>
<string name="4975">This gnoll barks orders at the other gnolls. He is obviously the leader here.</string>
<string name="4976">Warrior</string>
<string name="4977">These are exotic and deadly elven warriors, though of a subrace you have never encountered before.</string>
<string name="4978">Glendir</string>
<string name="4979">This half-orc looks to be a very frustrated and uncooperative slave.</string>
<string name="4980">Gnoll Lieutenant</string>
<string name="4981">Hooded Figure</string>
<string name="4982">A strange, shimmering figure stands here. Although she is difficult to see, her presence is almost overwhelmingly powerful and evil.</string>
<string name="4983">J&apos;nah is an unusual looking elf, with features that seem elven, yet of an exotic strain you have never encountered before. Every move seems controlled, every word from her mouth calculated, and her posture is highly arrogant.</string>
<string name="4984">Nafeeli</string>
<string name="4985">While kobolds often seem rather pathetic, this one seems to have taken it to an extreme.</string>
<string name="4986">Quemozeng </string>
<string name="4987">Slave</string>
<string name="4988">This slave looks ragged and miserable.</string>

<string name="4991">Kobold Jumper</string>
<string name="4992">Urko</string>
<string name="4993">This looks like the kobold leader from the elven crypt, Urko. It appears he made it safely back to his kin.</string>
<string name="4994">Kobold Adept</string>
<string name="4995">Chief Arzig</string>
<string name="4996">This kobold belligerently commands the other kobolds. Obviously he is the clan chief.</string>

<string name="5002">Kobold Sniper</string>
<string name="5003">Kobold Sorcerer</string>
<string name="5004">Deekin</string>
<string name="5005">Deekin is a kobold bard, who carries himself with a flair that is unusual in a kobold. The grin on his face and twinkle in his eye show that no matter the circumstances, he is bound to explore the world and attempt to satisfy his curiosity.</string>
<string name="5006">Riisi</string>
<string name="5007">This is Master Drogan&apos;s familiar, the faerie dragon, Riisi. She is flighty and loves to play games. Asking riddles is her favorite form of entertainment.</string>
<string name="5008">Skeleton Archer</string>
<string name="5009">Spirit of Nilmaldor</string>
<string name="5010">The ghostly figure that paces here looks to have once been an elven warrior, but his spirit is now trapped in this crypt.</string>
<string name="5011">Toli</string>
<string name="5012">This dwarven woman appears to be very pregnant.</string>
<string name="5013">Toman</string>
<string name="5014">Bross</string>
<string name="5015">Toman appears a crushed and broken man, now that his home has been taken away from him.</string>
<string name="5016">From the way he is yipping commands at the other kobolds, this is obviously the leader of this small group. He appears to be very tense.</string>
<string name="5017">Dorna</string>
<string name="5018">Trapspringer</string>
<string name="5019">Dorna seldom speaks of her past, but you know she traveled for nearly a week through a treacherous part of the Silver Marches to apprentice herself to Drogan Droganson when he retired and decided to take on some apprentices.  She is somewhat dour and pragmatic.  Her role as professional ambush-spotter and trap-springer has left her with a rather grim outlook on life.</string>
<string name="5020">Mischa</string>
<string name="5021">Waymeet</string>
<string name="5022">This bright-eyed young woman gazes out on the world with an earnest and cheerful expression, despite the ready sword at her side. An elaborate pendant, the holy symbol of Mystra, hangs around her neck, and the aura of grace and gentle power that surrounds her unmistakably marks her as a paladin, unusual though it is to find one of the holy warriors in the service of the goddess of magic. </string>
<string name="5023">Messarmos</string>
<string name="5024">Xanos is a poor tempered, arrogant, but fairly intelligent half-orc. He loves to speak of how much smarter he was than most of his family and has little tolerance for the slow of mind or weak of will. He claims not to care what others think of him, yet spends a lot of time making sure others note his intelligence and power.</string>
<string name="5025">The Alchemist&apos;s Cookbook</string>
<string name="5026">Amongst the more interesting passages are:

&apos;Fenberries are a potent ingredient.  The essence of several fenberries can be used to make the barkskin potion.  A simple bottle is enough to hold the berries essence - no special precautions are needed.&apos;

&apos;Pure quartz crystal is another valuable reagent.  Necessary in many rituals that imbue magical power into various items.&apos; 
</string>
<string name="5027">Amulet of Ascalhorn</string>
<string name="5028">Found in an elven crypt, this item was once the treasure given to elven soldiers who completed their training and successfully passed a dangerous challenge.</string>
<string name="5029">Ancient Sword</string>
<string name="5030">This ancient weapon is set with stones and has an elaborate elven crest worked into the hilt. It does not seem magical, but obviously has some worth. The skeleton this weapon was found on did not appear to be elven, and was most likely a grave robber who found the tomb to be better guarded than expected.</string>
<string name="5031">Ayala&apos;s Armor</string>
<string name="5032">Becka&apos;s Outfit</string>
<string name="5033">Smith&apos;s Outfit</string>
<string name="5034">Dagger</string>
<string name="5035">Deekin&apos;s Crossbow</string>
<string name="5036">This crossbow is finely fashioned and possesses a diamond in its handle that sparkles intensely when looked at. Whether Deekin stole this crossbow out of Tymofarrar&apos;s treasure pile or whether it was given to Deekin is unknown, but the kobold cradles it closely.</string>
<string name="5037">Deekin&apos;s Rapier</string>
<string name="5038">This rapier is finely fashioned and possesses a ruby in its pommel that sparkles intensely when looked at it. Whether Deekin stole it out of Tymofarrar&apos;s treasure pile or whether it was given to Deekin is unknown, but the kobold cradles it closely.</string>
<string name="5039">Dorna&apos;s Battleaxe</string>
<string name="5040">This axe is carved along its blade with large dwarven runes, each indicating a member of Dorna&apos;s clan who has held the weapon prior to her. It is a finely crafted and superior weapon that Dorna will not give up for any reason.</string>
<string name="5041">Drogan&apos;s Robes</string>
<string name="5042">Elven Hall of Trials key</string>
<string name="5043">This key has fine elven designs covering the surface and probably opens something in the elven crypt.</string>
<string name="5044">Elven Trap Protective Helmet</string>
<string name="5045">This helmet was designed to protect the user against the poisonous gases emitted by a special trap in the elven crypt. It is unlikely that the helm would work against other poisons, as it was created for this specific trap.</string>
<string name="5046">Focus Crystal</string>
<string name="5047">Though rather common, these crystals are highly sought for use in controlling, directing and powering magic spells and items.

One crystal is consumed every time use is made of Mystra&apos;s Hand.</string>
<string name="5048">Ilmater Robe</string>
<string name="5049">Giant Spider Bite</string>
<string name="5050">This small golden vessel appears to be an incense burner of some sort.</string>
<string name="5051">This small golden incense burner is etched with a smooth, flowing script spelling out prayers to Akadi. When used, it will summon a fire elemental to serve the user. </string>
<string name="5052">J&apos;Nah&apos;s Outfit</string>
<string name="5053">J&apos;Nah Properties</string>
<string name="5054">Daemonfey Chainmail</string>
<string name="5055">Dark Hood</string>
<string name="5056">Katriana&apos;s Outfit</string>
<string name="5057">Journal</string>
<string name="5058">This is your journal, which chronicles your life at Drogan&apos;s academy. From the day you set foot in the door, to last eve&apos;s entry, all of your experiences are contained within.
One section of the journal talks about your interaction with the other apprentices.  Xanos, the half-orc sorcerer, has a superior attitude that rubs most of the other apprentices the wrong way. Dorna is a dwarven rogue, who loves to incite arguments between Xanos and the third apprentice, Mischa.
Mischa is a human paladin of Mystra, whose vision of the world is limited to black and white, with nothing in between.
You are the fourth and senior apprentice, and Drogan has always held a respect for you and your abilities.
Lately Drogan has begun to seek new apprentices, as your term here has nearly reached completion. Your final examination will soon be upon you.
</string>
<string name="5059">Katana of the North</string>
<string name="5060">The katana is the pinnacle of the swordsmith&apos;s craft, combining grace and artful design with razor-edged efficiency. </string>
<string name="5061">The Katana of the North was crafted by small order of monks in the Nether Mountains.  It grants its wielder some protection from the harsh elements of the north as well as having a calming influence on beasts that may be encountered. </string>
<string name="5062">Klonk&apos;s Ice Blade</string>
<string name="5063">These blades belong to a clan of kobolds known as the Ice Kobolds. Despite their cold-blooded nature, these kobolds have adapted to their cold environment. Even their weapons have been magically altered to send chills of frost into an opponent unlucky enough to be hit with an Ice Blade.</string>
<string name="5064">Kobold Ice Blade</string>
<string name="5065">misclarge</string>
<string name="5066">miscmed</string>
<string name="5067">miscsmall</string>
<string name="5068">miscthin</string>
<string name="5069">The Mummified Hand</string>
<string name="5070">One of the missing artifacts is the mummified hand of the lich, Belpheron, and is said to still retain some of his power. 
Its user must be standing still for its power to function correctly.</string>
<string name="5071">Dorna&apos;s Footlocker key</string>
<string name="5072">Xanos&apos;s Footlocker key</string>
<string name="5073">Room Key</string>
<string name="5074">This is the key to Drogan&apos;s personal quarters. It was guarded by his familiar, Riisi. Drogan&apos;s room is sure to have some useful equipment, including the alchemist&apos;s table, where focus crystals can be made.</string>
<string name="5075">Idol of the Bear</string>
<string name="5076">The great white bear stood on its hind legs and roared its challenge at you to come and fight. Instead you stood your ground and hooted and spun in circles, daring it to come to you. Your patience won out and in great anger, the bear lumbered forward, falling into the pit you had prepared the night before.
Drogan was impressed with how you handled the challenge, and as a trophy, he turned the mighty bear into a frozen statue. Gazing at the statue, you laughed loudly and realized that there was something magical about it. 
Once per day you can use the statue to increase your taunt skill.</string>
<string name="5077">Quality Lute</string>
<string name="5078">The thin, tight-lipped old woman absolutely refused to impart the secrets of her dead husband&apos;s life to anyone, until you came along. He had been quite a local hero, and you knew that his exploits could make an impressive epic ballad, if only the woman would give you the details. 
You played a tune on your old lute, and it took all of your control to keep the old instrument from losing its tuning during the song. The woman was sufficiently impressed with your abilities and relented from her silence. Drogan obviously recognized the struggle you had with your poor old instrument, for upon completion of this test, he presented you with this new, Quality Lute. The most surprising thing about this gift was when you recognized the magic imbued in the lute, that allows you to use the powers of your perform skills to a higher extent, once per day.</string>
<string name="5079">Fortune Cards</string>
<string name="5080">This is an unusual deck of cards.  The cards are covered in strange runes and symbols the likes of which you have never seen before. Despite the markings, there does not seem to be anything magical about them.</string>
<string name="5081">Hilltop Guard Armor</string>
<string name="5082">Hilltop Guard Axe</string>
<string name="5083">Hilltop Guard Helmet</string>
<string name="5084">Piper&apos;s Sword</string>
<string name="5085">Wolf Pelt</string>
<string name="5086">Holy Symbol</string>
<string name="5087">It seemed as though you were trapped in a great war. All around you were the dead and dying. You quickly used up all your spells and potions. Then you turned to your medical kits. One soldier after another was brought to you with wounds. Eventually you had no more energy left. You had to choose; rest or burn yourself out. It was a difficult choice, but you made it decisively and as you lay your head to rest, you knew the next day would be even harder then the day before.
You awoke from the dream to realize that Drogan had been testing you. You passed the test. Drogan told you that had you gone on any longer, you would not have been fit to help anyone the next day. By conserving yourself, you would have saved more lives in the long run. Upon your success, Drogan presented you with this finely crafted symbol of the deity your life is dedicated to. Once per day you can use the power of this symbol to enhance your healing skill.</string>
<string name="5088">Tressym Tongue</string>
<string name="5089">The Tressym is a winged cat about the size of a housecat with a pair of feathered, leathery wings - well known for their immunity to poison.
Their tongues are well known for their poison-immunity qualities.</string>
<string name="5090">Pieces of Charcoal</string>
<string name="5091">A handful of small ground up pieces of charcoal.  Known for their neutralizing qualities when it comes to poisons.</string>
<string name="5092">Helmthorn Berries</string>
<string name="5093">A handful of indigo berries.  Helmthorn berries are tart in flavor and often used in winemaking.  They also can be used in the preparation of certain restorative potions.</string>
<string name="5094">Hurc&apos;s Dagger</string>
<string name="5095">This dagger pulses faintly in the hand when held, but otherwise seems unremarkable in its craftsmanship.</string>
<string name="5096">While the craftsmanship of this blade is rather crude by non-kobold standards, it becomes quickly apparent that this dagger has been strongly enchanted to drain the life force from its victim and add it to that of the user. Peering closely at the blade it is also obvious that this dagger has been often (and recently) coated with poison to supplement its damage.</string>
<string name="5097">Dorna&apos;s Short Sword</string>
<string name="5098">Scented Fetish</string>
<string name="5099">When Drogan announced that a wild panther was slaughtering the local farmers&apos; cattle, you knew you faced a true test of your druidic abilities. Entering the woods, you cautiously followed the creature&apos;s path. You crossed a small stream, and then found yourself facing a protective panther with cubs. It took every ounce of patience and empathy you had to calm the panther and convince her that this area did not make a safe home.
Upon successful completion of this exam, Drogan presented you with a magical scented fetish. Once per day you can use its powers to send forth the scent of a peaceful forest glade, enhancing your animal empathy skill.</string>
<string name="5100">Scale of Discipline</string>
<string name="5101">It was a fairly straight-forward test. All you had to do was run to the top of the hill and grab an item on a pedestal, then return it to Drogan. It was the twenty heavily-muscled orcs waiting to knock you back down the hill, and the strap that held your hands behind your back that gave the task its difficulty.
The first few were easy enough to dodge around, but they got closer and closer together until it was only your bullheaded determination that kept you on your feet.
When the assignment was completed, your body was sore, but the red scale was dropped from your mouth into Drogan&apos;s waiting hands. After cutting the strap around your arms, Drogan explained that the scale had the magical ability to increase your discipline for a short time during battle, but only one time each day. It was a suitable reward for a grueling task.</string>
<string name="5102">Valiantheart Longbow</string>
<string name="5103">This is a finely made longbow, the wood of its shaft richly oiled and carved with delicate elven lettering.</string>
<string name="5104">This finely-crafted longbow most recently belonged to the Arcane Archer Ferran Valiantheart... and has been passed down from generation to generation within the Valiantheart clan for thousands of years. The magic of the bow, a spell written into the grain of the wood in the elven language, is designed to enhance a hunter&apos;s senses... making it easier to spot one&apos;s prey and the archer more accurate with his arrow when firing.</string>
<string name="5105">Horns of the Shadow</string>
<string name="5106">The horns of the Shadow Hart - one of the most unusual creatures in the realms.</string>
<string name="5107">Heart of the Shadow</string>
<string name="5108">The heart of the Shadow Hart - one of the most unusual creatures in the realms.</string>
<string name="5109">Green Spores</string>
<string name="5110">A clump of spores covered in a green mucus like substance.  Touching them causes long emerald strands to form between your hands and the spores.</string>
<string name="5111">Baby</string>
<string name="5112">This small bundle of joy seems to be emanating a peculiar odor. The baby&apos;s name is Tynan, the son of Nora and Adam Blake. He was rescued from a vicious kobold.</string>
<string name="5113">Fortune Teller&apos;s Key</string>
<string name="5114">Crystal of Concentration</string>
<string name="5115">Drogan&apos;s last trial for you seemed to be a bit unfair. To test your powers of concentration, Drogan created a situation filled with interesting distractions, including music, drink and nudity. In the midst of the distraction, Drogan walked into the room and shouted &quot;Now!&quot; Immediately you stumbled to your feet, shook your head to clear the cobwebs and cast a spell.
Surprisingly, you cast the spell quickly and effectively; then you passed out. When you came to, Drogan handed you this crystal. You stared into it, and found your head cleared quickly, with your ability to concentrate improved. The crystal can be used once per day in this manner.</string>
<string name="5116">Censer of Readiness</string>
<string name="5117">When your opponent swings his weapon, don&apos;t be there for him to connect. This is the advice Drogan gave you before a very unusual trial. You had to move through a room that had all sorts of swinging blades and jets of flame firing across.
Despite a few minor nicks and burns, you emerged from the room successfully. Drogan took you to a separate room and lit a small censer filled with incense. After inhaling some of the smoke, you were taken back to the dangerous room and you dodged through it without a single problem.
The magical censer can be used to increase your tumbling skill. After a single use it requires a day to recharge itself.</string>
<string name="5118">Nora&apos;s Wedding Ring</string>
<string name="5119">This is the wedding ring of Nora Blake, given as a reward for saving her child from kobolds.</string>
<string name="5120">Instrument of the Inquisition</string>
<string name="5121">Battle was not an option, unless of course you chose to die. Death seemed a bit of an extreme option, and the brutish horde of orcs around you did not seem particularly bright. With this in mind, you brought a deep scowl to your face and eyed the orc captain.
He would be the first to die, followed by the orc beside him; at least, that is what you told him. The rest might eventually bring you down, but how many of them were prepared to face death over such a small, insignificant object.
Your intimidation tactics worked well and the orcs handed over the odd shaped device, then disappeared as Drogan&apos;s test ended. Drogan told you to keep the instrument, as it was a holy item of the inquisition. The blade may be used once per day to increase your persuasion skill for a short period of time. It was a fine, worthy trophy.</string>
<string name="5122">Practice Sword</string>
<string name="5123">Gift of the Dryad</string>
<string name="5124">The shadows of the forest lay heavy on the ground, as you made your way towards the cries of a wounded animal. Then, suddenly you knew that someone was following you. With all of your senses focused outward, you crept forward quietly. The most minute movement from behind a bush drew your attention and you sprang lightly overtop, to land on a beautiful forest dryad. She giggled, kissed your forehead and slipped out from underneath you. In your hands she left a simple wooden cup.
Drogan congratulated you on your abilities and told you to keep the cup as a trophy to remember that day. Placing the cup to your lips creates a small amount of dryad wine, which heightens the senses, increasing your spot skill. This ability is only usable once per day.</string>
<string name="5125">Horn of Listening</string>
<string name="5126">All was pitch black as you slid through the halls of a wealthy merchant. You could hear his guards moving about, but the magical darkness concealed their position from you. Focusing all your concentration on the sounds of breathing and creaking armor, you slipped around the last of the merchant&apos;s guards and entered his treasure room.
This was the last test Drogan gave you, and though it was not your final examination, it proved your abilities were sharp as a blade. Drogan presented you with this special device, which has the magical ability to enhance your listening skill.</string>
<string name="5127">Rumgut&apos;s Key</string>
<string name="5128">This key belongs to Rumgut, the hill giant. It opens the cage where he is keeping his &apos;wife&apos;.</string>
<string name="5129">Hurst&apos;s Morningstar</string>
<string name="5130">Shadow Helm</string>
<string name="5131">The horns of a Shadow Heart incorporated into this helm give its owner the ability to fade out slightly, once per day.</string>
<string name="5132">Rod of the Magi</string>
<string name="5133">One at a time, they came at you, casting their spells. All you had to do was identify each spell before it was completed and the spell would dissipate, as would the caster. But it was hard, so very hard. Each spell was different, some simple, some complex, but you had to wrack your mind to remember what you had been taught about each. What words, what gestures and what components were used in each spell? 
In the end, you passed with flying colors, and Drogan presented you with a small gift, the Rod of the Magi. The rod can be used once per day to increase your spellcraft ability.</string>
<string name="5134">Szaren&apos;s Cloak</string>
<string name="5135">This cloak belonged to Szaren, the Red Wizard, and was traded for a dragon&apos;s egg. It gives off an eerie blue light that protects the wearer from fire.
</string>
<string name="5136">This cloak belonged to Szaren, the Red Wizard, and was traded for a dragon&apos;s egg. It gives off an eerie blue light that protects the wearer from fire.</string>
<string name="5137">Ring of the Wolf</string>
<string name="5138">This silver ring has a sapphire set into it, making it quite valuable. When you look closely at the gem, it appears to have the faint image of a white wolf within.</string>
<string name="5139">Once belonging to the druid Farghan, this ring has a sapphire set into it that contains the faint image of a wolf within. Wearing it increases one&apos;s ability to communicate with animals... and the wolf within the gem can be summoned to aid the wearer.</string>
<string name="5140">Ancient Tome</string>
<string name="5141">This thick tome&apos;s pages are yellowed and crumbling from extreme age, and the writing within is quite compact and in a language unfamiliar to you. Numerous notes have been scrawled into its sidebars throughout, most in a strange goblin tongue but some in Common. One of the larger notes reads:

&quot;The ruins uncovered below these caves are, in my estimation, none other than Netherese in origin. A remarkable discovery so far outside of the Anauroch Desert. I can only surmise that this facility was some form of training area for Netherese magic, perhaps remotely located from the main Empire. Regardless, it seems it did not escape the destruction of the rest of the Netherese... most of the scrolls and other magic we have uncovered below have been destroyed or useless. What few good artifacts have been found have been jealously snatched by that damnable sorceress. If she would only tell us what she seeks here, this entire process would be much less frustrating! Will send apprentices below again to discover more...&quot;</string>
<string name="5142">Beastmaster&apos;s Horn</string>
<string name="5143">This brass horn is less of an instrument and more of a crudely-made device intended to make one particular note when blown into. It reeks of fur and stale gnoll saliva.
When blown, the horn will make the bears that live in this cave friendly, for a time.</string>
<string name="5144">Cage Key</string>
<string name="5145">A simple brass key bent and twisted with age and use.</string>
<string name="5146">Gnoll Chieftain&apos;s Key</string>
<string name="5147">This key is finely crafted, almost elven in its appearance, and appears to be made out of some kind of brilliant silver alloy. It is doubtful that the gnolls made this.</string>
<string name="5148">Parchments</string>
<string name="5149">These sheets of parchment are all dirty and covered with stains and greasy fingerprints. There are notes in a crude goblin tongue scribbled on most of them, with some parts in simple Common. Some of the clearer sections read:

&quot;Pulled lever and made it to the Waters of Wisdom. Have not figured out the correct cantrip to cast on the Waters of Wisdom yet...I&apos;m not sure if each pedestal will release a token or not...not sure if I want to face the elementals again to find out.&quot;

&quot;The Tokens appear to be used in the central well...I will experiment more one day.  Perhaps Gishnak will send an escort with me.&quot;


&quot;Must identify these soon.&quot;</string>

<string name="5152">This potion shields its imbiber against the forces of nature. It has only one use.</string>
<string name="5153">Promissory Note</string>
<string name="5154">This is a quickly-scribbled note written in Glendir&apos;s shaky script promising two thousand gold pieces to his savior, payable by the Baron of Hilltop. The note has been signed with flourish by Glendir, himself.</string>

<string name="5167">This is a large, rusted iron key that is obviously meant for an equally large lock.</string>
<string name="5168">Slave Den Key</string>
<string name="5169">This is a plain brass key that has been heavily dented and pitted with bite marks along its length.</string>
<string name="5170">Magical Token</string>
<string name="5171">This small token is made of an unfamiliar metal that radiates a slight magical aura. There are small inscriptions chiseled into its face, but they are in an ancient language you do not recognize.</string>
<string name="5172">The Tale of Rusty McFinger</string>
<string name="5173">In the 12th year of Evenstide a vicious outbreak of cats spawned the need for an effective way to deal with these vicious little nasties. 
A gnomish inventor by the name of Rusty McFinger came up with a most ingenious solution; a &quot;trap&quot; (as he called it). These &quot;traps&quot; would be fiendish devices left everywhere where an unsuspecting feline might step upon it and get immediately immolated, frozen, skewered, sizzled and/or exploded on the spot. 
They were so effective that they impressed the current Pasha of Calimshan who commissioned Rusty McFinger to make the most deadly &quot;trap&quot; he could devise. After many, many years of research and thousands of gold invested, Rusty McFinger had finally begun to build the most deadly &quot;trap&quot; in existence... 
On the final day of construction, the god Omnicron ate the planet... and the resulting turmoil toppled Rusty McFinger into his own device, causing his death.</string>
<string name="5174">Stuffed Doll</string>
<string name="5175">This small and vaguely humanoid doll is made mostly of burlap stuffed with hay and dried grass. It is extremely worn and the burlap is torn in many places. Written in a crude, almost child-like fashion on the back of the doll&apos;s head is the word &quot;Deekin&quot;. There is a small cloth tag attached to the doll that has a message written on it in tiny, delicate letters:

&quot;Search for your dreams, lad, and good luck. -- T.&quot;</string>
<string name="5176">J&apos;Nah&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="5177">This is a collection of J&apos;Nah&apos;s personal musings and memories. There are many discussions about her allies and her research, which includes the excavation of these tunnels, an old wizard laboratory, lost for centuries.
Of Tymofarrar, J&apos;Nah writes:
&quot;The haughty beast is ripe for betrayal and I wait only until I can find a willing dupe to take the phylactery and destroy the beast. His arrogance is almost equal to my own and is insufferable.&quot;
and:
&quot;The cold-hearted reptile dares to betray me? If I do not find someone willing to battle this creature soon, I shall probably have to do it myself. Then I will take control of his kobold army and between them and my gnolls, we shall be a force to reckon with.&quot;
Of her mistress, J&apos;Nah writes:
&quot;She is a persuasive creature, but I do not trust her. Once I have collected the artifacts, I will call my sisters to me, and compel her to assist us. If she refuses... she dies. Allies are only useful when they are obedient.&quot;

<string name="5179">Flask of Powder</string>
<string name="5180">The small, heavy flask is filled with a deep red powder... enough for one use, more than likely. It smells strongly of smoke and copper.</string>
<string name="5181">Notebook</string>
<string name="5182">This large tome is filled almost completely with scribbled notes, arcane diagrams, journal entries and often just poorly-drawn doodles. Much of the writing is in draconic, but some parts are in Common. Amongst them such notes as:

&quot;Must look into creating non-freezing ink. Damn kobolds tried thawing the last bottle over a fire and it exploded. Upper cave still dotted with ink marks.&quot;

&quot;Swam to the outside today and encountered a group of orcs on my favorite ledge. Why do orcs have to taste so bad? Note to self: raid for salt.&quot;

&quot;Received an interesting letter today. Interesting proposition. Must remember to practice my Common more often.&quot;

&quot;J&apos;Nah sent me the most interesting vial of poison today. She did not say where it comes from, but it smells like serpent venom. Deekin licked the vial and was in a coma for three days.&quot;

&quot;DAMNATIONS!! Why must every greedy plan of mine end in ruin?!&quot;

&quot;Acquired interesting powder today at great expense. It is only of use against that damned sorceress, but she will certainly not see *this* coming. I am so cunning!&quot;

&quot;Note to self: writing plans out may be bad idea. Stop until after the witch is dead.&quot;

Most of the legible writing seems to end there, though there is one spectacular drawing showing an elven woman being torn to bloody, gory pieces by a large lizard-like creature.</string>
<string name="5183">Stone Key</string>
<string name="5184">This large key is made of oddly-colored stone that is rough to the touch.</string>
<string name="5185">Tymofarrar&apos;s Head</string>
<string name="5186">This large skull once belonged to the white dragon, Tymofarrar. Even in death he appears to be smirking.</string>
<string name="5187">Rusty Key</string>
<string name="5188">This key was dropped by the kobold warden. It probably opens the cell doors, although from the condition of the key, it is unlikely that a lot of prisoners are ever released.</string>
<string name="5189">Rod of Ruler</string>
<string name="5190">The Rod of Ruler is a rather pathetic attempt on the part of the kobolds to create an imperial scepter. The craftsmanship is shoddy, and the gold leaf has mostly peeled off. </string>
<string name="5191">Garg&apos;s Book</string>
<string name="5192">This grease stained, water damaged book was obviously the journal of one of the bandits you killed. The writing is simplistic and the poor spelling and grammar make it almost unreadable.

Apparently the bandit was learning to be a scribe when a large stack of books fell over, landing on his head. The bandit must have taken a severe blow to the head, and he was fired from his job.

Recently, he joined a small group of bandits. The bandits robbed and killed some merchants, finding a key and some notes about an old tomb. They burned the notes and have been looking for the tomb, hoping it will have riches hidden within it.</string>

<string name="5200">Winter Armor</string>
<string name="5201">Bear Hide</string>

<string name="5209">Wolf hide has a small, but vibrant market, particularly in large cities, where wolves are rare, and often feared.</string>
<string name="5210">Censer of Air </string>
<string name="5211">This roughly-polished stone is incised with a few runes spelling out prayers to Grumbar. When used, it will summon an earth elemental to the service of the user. </string>
<string name="5212">Brazier of Fire </string>
<string name="5213">Phylactery of Ice</string>
<string name="5214">Swirling energies of pale blue and white fill this glass container. Cold to the touch, J&apos;nah claims it holds the life force of an ice elemental inside. Whoever breaks the container will be filled with this force and gain the strength and constitution of the elemental. It will also transform the imbiber into the shape of a frost giant.</string>
<string name="5215">Cloak of Ascalhorn</string>
<string name="5216">Found in an elven crypt, this cloak was once given to elven soldiers who completed their training and successfully passed a dangerous challenge.</string>

<string name="5219">Crusader&apos;s Blade</string>
<string name="5220">The Dragon&apos;s Tooth</string>

<string name="5229">Ventrue&apos;s Lucky Charms</string>
<string name="5230">The Mask</string>
<string name="5231">This is one of the artifacts stolen from Drogan by the kobolds. It is a mask that once belonged to a high priest of the god of thieves, Mask. While possessing great power, most of its abilities are unknown... though potentially very dangerous, considering the source.</string>
<string name="5232">Potion of Vitality</string>
<string name="5233">The potion of vitality grants the imbiber the illusion of youth.</string>
<string name="5234">Ventrue&apos;s Rod of Majesty</string>
<string name="5235">The Tinoman</string>
<string name="5236">Tome of Worldly Knowledge</string>
<string name="5237">The Tower Statue</string>
<string name="5238">This is one of the artifacts stolen from Drogan by the kobolds. While it was discerned to have considerable power within it, the nature of that power remained a mystery.
The tower has been broken and there is some sort of glowing orb that must have been hidden inside it.</string>
<string name="5239">The Tower Crystal</string>
<string name="5240">This is the Crystal that was carried inside the Tower Statue, one of the artifacts recovered for Drogan. It has an unusually strong magical aura.</string>
<string name="5241">Valiant Defender</string>
<string name="5242">The shield almost seems to glow with a holy aura. </string>
<string name="5243">&quot;Many an attack has been turned by this shield, my greatest creation!

<string name="5247">Xanos&apos; Bracers</string>
<string name="5248">These bracers are made of heavy brass and are covered with crude drawings... likely orcish runes meant to bless the wearer with protection and good health. Carved into the rim of the brass, by someone other than an orc craftsman, is the word &quot;Messarmos&quot;. Xanos will not give up his prized bracers to anyone.</string>
<string name="5249">Mystra&apos;s Hand</string>
<string name="5250">This ring is one of many forged by Drogan Droganson.  Drogan retired after a long life of adventure and took to training young would-be adventurers how not to get killed.  He gave each of them a ring that would teleport them back to him if they found themselves in mortal peril.
To power this ring, the user must possess a focus crystal.  The focus crystal is consumed during the teleportation.</string>

<string name="5453">The Mask</string>

<string name="5459">Master Drogan has been terribly injured by a band of kobolds that have stolen four artifacts that were given to him for safe-keeping. You are the only one who can track down these kobolds and recover the artifacts. If you find them, bring them back to Ayala at the house.</string>
<string name="5460">Drogan was recovered by the time you returned with the broken Tower Statue, and upon his closer inspection of it he found that it had all along shielded from detection within it a crystal of enormous power. This crystal is what the powerful enemy behind J&apos;Nah really sought, and Drogan has suggested seeking out a man by the name of Garrick Halassar in the Anauroch Desert to identify it... it is the only way to find out what this enemy really wants. The best way to reach Garrick will be to travel with the halfling caravan as it crosses the desert, something that Drogan will now arrange.</string>
<string name="5461">Master Drogan has been terribly injured by a band of kobolds that have stolen four artifacts that were given to him for safe-keeping. Ayala listed off the four artifacts as follows: a mummified hand, a tower statue, a dragon&apos;s tooth and a mask, all possessed of unknown but powerful and dangerous magic. You are the only one who can track down the kobolds and recover these artifacts. If you find them, bring them back to Ayala at the house.</string>
<string name="5462">The Mummified Hand</string>
<string name="5463">One of the missing artifacts is the mummified hand of the lich, Belpheron, and is said to still retain some of his power. Whoever stole it may be trying to access this power or even seeking to resurrect the lich, himself.</string>

<string name="5465">The mummified hand artifact has been recovered, but Ayala suggested that you hold onto it... she believes that the hand might be useable to track down the locations of the other artifacts.</string>

<string name="5468">The Tower Statue</string>
<string name="5469">This is one of the artifacts stolen from Drogan by the kobolds. While it was discerned to have considerable power within it, the nature of that power remains a mystery. The artifact was put safely aside until a time when its power could be properly determined.</string>
<string name="5470">The Tower Statue is, apparently, in the possession of a kobold by the name of Deekin. Deekin is a servant of a dragon, Tymofarrar, who rules over the kobold tribe, and Deekin fears his reprisal because he broke the statue during the gnoll attack. Deekin is willing to hand over the statue if Tymofarrar is either talked into releasing him... or somehow killed. Until one of these things happen, Deekin will be hiding out within a shop in Blumberg, a village to the east of the foothills.</string>
<string name="5471">With Tymofarrar dead, Deekin was more than happy to hand over the broken Tower Statue. As Deekin had claimed, the statue held a small crystal inside it that glows brightly. What the crystal might be remains a mystery at the moment.</string>
<string name="5472">Tymofarrar has agreed to release Deekin from his service, and has given you a... well, a shoe... to give to him as proof of that. Hopefully this will convince Deekin to hand over the Tower Statue he has hidden.</string>

<string name="5936">The horns of the Shadow Hart were given to Fiona - the smith in Hilltop.  She made you a magical helm from them.</string>
<string name="5937"></string>
<string name="5938">Aaaiiiiiiii!!!!</string>
<string name="5939">Uh&#8230; You first!</string>
<string name="5940">I kill you!!!</string>
<string name="5941">Death to&#8230; whoever you are!</string>
<string name="5942">Eeek! I&apos;m dying!</string>
<string name="5943">Help! Heeeeeelp!</string>
<string name="5944">Huh?</string>
<string name="5945">Yes, master.</string>
<string name="5946">No, master.</string>
<string name="5947">Uh&#8230; Back to work&#8230; Yeah, that&apos;s it. Back to work.</string>
<string name="5948">Huzzah!</string>
<string name="5949">Uh&#8230; Excuse me. Hello?</string>
<string name="5950">Why, I oughta&#8230;</string>
<string name="5951">Out of the way. Master Ashtara wants this passage cleared.</string>
<string name="5952">*Cough* *Cough* Curse this dust!</string>
<string name="5953">Be grateful. If you were still a statue, this could be you we&apos;re smashing.</string>
<string name="5954">Ow! Blast and bother, I didn&apos;t need that toe anyway...</string>
<string name="5955">You better do as the Master says. We&apos;ve got this cave-in under control.</string>
<string name="5956">*Sigh* I don&apos;t think we&apos;re ever getting out.</string>
<string name="5957">I&apos;m starting to feel a little claustrophobic. You?</string>
<string name="5958"></string>
<string name="5959"></string>
<string name="5960"></string>
<string name="5961"></string>
<string name="5962"></string>
<string name="5963"></string>
<string name="5964"></string>
<string name="5965"></string>
<string name="5966"></string>
<string name="5967">Peering into the crystal ball, you saw another room.</string>
<string name="5968">Damn! Damn! Damn!! Where is Zidan? Have you seen him?!</string>
<string name="5969">So it appears you have become my slave a little sooner than I had expected. It&apos;s a pity, really... Statues are so much easier to transport.</string>
<string name="5970">Your task is not yet accomplished, my slave. What can I do to aid in its completion?</string>
<string name="5971">The guardians fall silent. You have done well, my slave. My thralls continue to work on the passageway but we are not free yet. For my own safety, I will not remove your collar but you are free to wander where you will.</string>
<string name="5972">Ah, the slave returns to his master&apos;s feet. Have you seen all the glories of Undrentide? Do you come to me bearing her greatest treasures over your shoulder?</string>
<string name="5973">Deekin busy writing great, epic tale of his current master, so he not gots time to talk to you. Maybe Deekin pencil you in as sidekick?</string>
<string name="5974">Ummm... you brings Deekin back? Deekin remembers big, booming voice and then *poof!*, Deekin awake again.</string>
<string name="5975">Ummm... boss?</string>
<string name="5976">Oh... heh heh. The great hero has found little Deekin out. Ummm... maybe the great hero is happy to see Deekin, yes?</string>
<string name="5977">Ummm... this is a very dark and scary place. Maybe Deekin should comes with you again? ...So Deekin helps protects you, of course...</string>
<string name="5978">You changes your mind, Deekin hopes. You takes Deekin along again, maybe? Epic tale not finished yet!</string>
<string name="5979">Deekin is ready to serve!</string>
<string name="5980">No hurts Deekin! Pleeeeaassee!</string>
<string name="5981">You wants Deekin?</string>
<string name="5982">You changes your mind, maybe? You wants Deekin to writes your epic tale now, yes?</string>
<string name="5983">Ummm... you goings to take Deekin with you now, yes? This place is very spooky.</string>
<string name="5984">For honor and glory!</string>
<string name="5985">Do you hear that?</string>
<string name="5986">I don&apos;t believe we have anything to say to one another. Do your job and I&apos;ll be happy.</string>
<string name="5987">Well that could have gone far better, couldn&apos;t it? I am sorry I let you down.</string>
<string name="5988">I would speak with you a moment.</string>
<string name="5989">If you&apos;re to help Master Drogan, you&apos;ll need to get underway as soon as possible. Do you need my help?</string>
<string name="5990">I must admit I&apos;m rather looking forward to exploring some of the ruins we&apos;re sure to find here. Ancient Netheril has always held a certain fascination for me, you see.</string>
<string name="5991">Isn&apos;t it grand? We are inside one of the great flying cities. It is... like a tomb in here. A gravestone of greatness long since past.</string>
<string name="5992">You&apos;re back, I see. Do you need me to travel with you again?</string>
<string name="5993">Yes? What do you need?</string>
<string name="5994">I&apos;m not needed to guard the house, no matter what Ayala says. Take me with you.</string>
<string name="5995">Standing around this camp is not my idea of fun. I&apos;d much rather be out exploring ruins with you.</string>
<string name="5996">I hope you need my help. This city may be dead, but I&apos;ll bet it&apos;s still dangerous.</string>
<string name="5997">You... you will die? But...</string>
<string name="5998">You have the honor of the stones, Master Drogan. F-farewell.</string>
<string name="5999">A-ha! And here you are, just as I thought you might be! I cannot begin to tell you just how relieved I am to see you.</string>
<string name="6000">Wait, wait... I haven&apos;t yet told you how we must face Heurodis.</string>
<string name="6001">That&apos;s it! That&apos;s it, you&apos;ve done it! The portal is active!</string>
<string name="6002">Wait! No... no!! I should have realized this sooner! What a fool I am!!</string>
<string name="6003">Heurodis has laid an insidious trap within the portal&apos;s magic! I have never sensed anything of its like before! I did not discover it... and now it is activated!</string>
<string name="6004">The portal is sealing... and these ruins are caving in! I... I can hold the portal open for only a short time! Quickly, you must go through!</string>
<string name="6005">I... cannot. By holding the portal open, I bare myself to the energies of Heurodis&apos;s trap. I will die, but... that does not matter now.</string>
<string name="6006">It is up to you, now. You must stop Heurodis if you can. If you cannot... then, I beg you, destroy the mythallar. The resulting explosion will end her threat forever.</string>
<string name="6007">Then do what you must. But whatever you do, you must go through! Nothing in this ruin will survive its collapse! Go now... I cannot keep the portal open much longer!</string>
<string name="6008">It is more fragile than you think, trust me. Brute force or magic... the slightest crack and its incredible forces will be released! But do so only as a last resort!</string>
<string name="6009">I know you will. Quickly, then... go now. I cannot keep the portal open much longer.</string>
<string name="6010">I will pray that is the case. Quickly, then... go now. I cannot keep the portal open much longer.</string>
<string name="6011">It is up to you, now. You must see this through! Remember the mythallar... destroy it only if you have to, but Heurodis must be stopped!</string>
<string name="6012">There is no time to look for another way. I must stay and you must go.</string>
<string name="6013">Aye, I know it. I saw the path that lay before you the very first time I saw you. I pray that you will find it long and fulfilling.</string>
<string name="6014">Go through, quickly... and I pray the gods go with you!</string>
<string name="6015">Fulfill the destiny I saw in you that very first time, long ago, and I am no fool at all, am I?</string>
<string name="6016">It... it is.</string>
<string name="6017">I am an old adventurer, far past his glory days. You have your whole life ahead of you. I... I can only hope you will use it well.</string>
<string name="6018">I am proud to have taken a small hand in making you what you are, dear friend. Go... and may the gods go with you.</string>
<string name="6019">Aye, Dorna. I am sorry it has come to this. You have done well for yourself... I am proud of you. Farewell, lass.</string>
<string name="6020">Aye, lad. Believe it or not, Xanos, I&apos;ve always had hope for you. In your heart of hearts you are a good man.</string>
<string name="6021">And you give yourself too little. I hope one day that changes. Farewell, dear lad.</string>
<string name="6022">If you could only sssee what I sssee, old friend... I am joined with the mythal now! Who needsss earthly eyesss when one can sssee with the sssoul of the world!</string>
<string name="6023">I can see all the vassstness of the Anauroch. To the wessst, a Formian queen isss laying an egg that will become her only daughter. To the eassst, the tent of an old Bedine man is buried beneath a sssandssstorm...</string>
<string name="6024">And I sssee you, wreathed in the mythal&apos;sss magic, even now. I sssee how death clingsss to you, waiting in the shadowsss. Within the hour, your life will be over...</string>
<string name="6025">Undrentide wasss not born a corpssse, fit to be buried and forgotten in the sssandsss of time. It belongsss in the sssky and to the sssky I have returned it! All shall bow before itsss power and before me, itsss massster!</string>
<string name="6026">Lossst? It wasss no lossss! Sssuch a sssmall sssacrifice to gain ssso much! I would have gambled everything for even a fraction of the mythal&apos;sss power! Besidesss, my gaze hasss ssserved itsss purpossse, hasss it not? You would know...</string>
<string name="6027">Don&apos;t be a fool! It protectsss me, don&apos;t you sssee? I am sssafe in itsss embrace and, with itsss power, I ssshall have my vengeance upon all the world!</string>
<string name="6028">With the mythal&apos;sss power, no harm can come to me. Let usss ssspar for old time&apos;sss sssake, then, atop thissss city as it flies. Thisss time I will turn you to ash, not to ssstone!</string>
<string name="6029">Fool! Without the mythal, the city will fall!</string>
<string name="6030">Ah. You have come to join me at last.</string>
<string name="6031">Not the dwarven mage, Drogan, as I was expecting... but I see you&apos;ll do nicely. Tell me... do you have a name?</string>
<string name="6032">As you already know, I am Heurodis... daughter of the medusae and sorceress supreme. I welcome you to my new realm: the flying city of Undrentide.</string>
<string name="6033">Of course... Undrentide flies no longer. It crashed to the earth long, long ago when all the other flying cities of Netheril did the same... though Undrentide fared better than most.</string>
<string name="6034">Be that as it may, Undrentide is buried deep under ages of sand and quite lifeless. It requires the power of ancient Netheril in order to rise once again...</string>
<string name="6035">...power that you have brought to me in the form of the mythallar.</string>
<string name="6036">Oh, I sensed that it was nearby. I had hoped that my rather public display back at the portal ruin would bring it to me... and here you are.</string>
<string name="6037">Now Undrentide shall rise again! And all the power of ancient Netheril that lies within it is mine! All of Faerun shall hear my name and fear me!</string>
<string name="6038">And you... you, my petrified subject... you shall have the honor of being the first monument to my victory. You shall get to watch it all! Ha ha ha!</string>
<string name="6039">I think this spot&apos;s going to have to do for the night. Let&apos;s set up camp... and make sure it&apos;s secure this time, Torias.</string>
<string name="6040">Any news? Have you found Zidan or not?</string>
<string name="6041">Ah-ha! There you are, Zidan! You&apos;re a sight for sore eyes... I was beginning to think we&apos;d have to wander back to Blacksands before long.</string>
<string name="6042">So... are you ready to move on? No point in getting sand in our boots, you know.</string>
<string name="6043">We could be in some trouble, friend. The oxen have gone through the water rations much faster than expected. There is an oasis near here, but we have had some trouble with the tribe that guards it.</string>
<string name="6044">You have a way of dealing with problems that I seem to lack. If you could just go and talk to the Bedine, maybe they would allow us to restock our water supplies.</string>
<string name="6045">I see you have returned. Have you gotten permission to take their water?</string>
<string name="6046">Well, we finally got here. I want to thank you for all your help. I know that I was a bit hard on you at times... we probably wouldn&apos;t have made it this time without you.</string>
<string name="6047">You will probably be wanting to hire a guide to take you to the dig site where your Garrick fellow went. It&apos;s a little ways into the desert, I understand, and only the locals really know the way.</string>
<string name="6048">I am sure one of the Ao worshippers will be willing to take you. They&apos;re a fairly agreeable bunch, if a bit daft. Is there anything else you want before you leave?</string>
<string name="6049">The sounds of battle!  From downstairs!</string>
<string name="6050">Master Drogan is in trouble!  Use your rings!</string>
<string name="6051">Xanos has no business with you. If you are looking for idle &apos;chit-chat&apos;, look elsewhere.</string>
<string name="6052">Hmph. If you were better at this, Xanos would not have to undergo such unpleasantness.</string>
<string name="6053">Hold! Xanos wishes to speak!</string>
<string name="6054">Hah! It seems the dwarf has finally gotten himself into a bind, and now he needs us to come to his rescue.</string>
<string name="6055">This desert is a vile land full of nothing but sand and death, and the quarters are half too small for anyone! What are we doing here?!</string>
<string name="6056">So we are within one of the fabled Netherese flying cities, eh? There is much power to be found here, if we are watchful.</string>
<string name="6057">You have come to ask Xanos to rejoin you, yes?</string>
<string name="6058">What do you want?</string>
<string name="6059">So have you come to your senses? You need Xanos&apos;s skills, now, yes?</string>
<string name="6060">I hope you have come to take Xanos away from this caravan. These halflings grow more irritating by the minute.</string>
<string name="6061">Xanos would prefer to join you. It is preferable to standing here doing nothing.</string>
<string name="6062">You... sacrifice yourself for us? For Xanos?</string>
<string name="6063">You... give me too much credit, Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="6064">Death comes to you&#8230;</string>
<string name="6065">The very sand cries out!</string>
<string name="6066">Fools and their flesh are often parted&#8230;</string>
<string name="6067">Only the blood of our enemies can appease us!</string>
<string name="6068">See how I bleed? Heal me, my thralls&#8230;</string>
<string name="6069">All hands to me! I need your aid!</string>
<string name="6070">Death&#8230;</string>
<string name="6071">Vengeance&#8230;</string>
<string name="6072">Fury&#8230;</string>
<string name="6073"></string>
<string name="6074"></string>
<string name="6075"></string>
<string name="6076"></string>
<string name="6077">Come, let us share wine together.</string>
<string name="6078">I would deny you nothing.</string>
<string name="6079">It will not be so.</string>
<string name="6080">Long life and good journeys&#8230;</string>
<string name="6081"></string>
<string name="6082">Ah, the sweet taste of triumph&#8230;</string>
<string name="6083">There are words I must share with you.</string>
<string name="6084">Your life holds no meaning.</string>
<string name="6085">Join the battle! Evil must be vanquished!</string>
<string name="6086">You will never defeat us!</string>
<string name="6087">Run while you can!</string>
<string name="6088">A blow well struck!</string>
<string name="6089">I need healing at once!</string>
<string name="6090">I need another by my side!</string>
<string name="6091"></string>
<string name="6092"></string>
<string name="6093"></string>
<string name="6094"></string>
<string name="6095"></string>
<string name="6096"></string>
<string name="6097">&lt;gasp!&gt; The gods shall avenge me!</string>
<string name="6098">Greetings, my friend.</string>
<string name="6099">Aye.</string>
<string name="6100">Nay.</string>
<string name="6101">Fare you well.</string>
<string name="6102"></string>
<string name="6103">The gods have smiled on us today!</string>
<string name="6104">Allow me to speak.</string>
<string name="6105">Nothing you can say shall help you now!</string>
<string name="6106">Then they charges into certain death!</string>
<string name="6107">He smites his enemy!</string>
<string name="6108"></string>
<string name="6109">Huzzah! </string>
<string name="6110">Oh! The kobold is in dire needs of a healer&apos;s art!</string>
<string name="6111">The tiny bard is beset on all sides! He calls for help!</string>
<string name="6112">The enemy is spotted!</string>
<string name="6113">&lt;terrified scream&gt; Run away! Run away!</string>
<string name="6114">You tells me your name. Me wants to get it right on your epitaph&#8230;</string>
<string name="6115">You keeps Deekin safe?</string>
<string name="6116">Waits here! Deekin comes right back!</string>
<string name="6117"></string>
<string name="6118"></string>
<string name="6119"></string>
<string name="6120"></string>
<string name="6121"></string>
<string name="6122"></string>
<string name="6123">Suddenly death was loooooming!</string>
<string name="6124">Oh! &#8230;the tragedy!</string>
<string name="6125">Too late he realizes their cowardly foe had poisoned him...</string>
<string name="6126">And just then, his magic fails!</string>
<string name="6127">The weapon could do nothing! Doom was at hand!</string>
<string name="6128">Come! Come! This way! Follow Deekin!</string>
<string name="6129">Ooo! Ooo! Here it is!</string>
<string name="6130">Come on, gather round!</string>
<string name="6131">Please, let Deekin through! Me not sees through big legs!</string>
<string name="6132">A devious mechanism bars their way!</string>
<string name="6133">The heroes were on the lookout, wary of danger!</string>
<string name="6134">He creeps along like shadow in the night...</string>
<string name="6135">Ummm&#8230; okay!</string>
<string name="6136">Ummm&#8230; nope. Me can&apos;t do that.</string>
<string name="6137">Huzzah! </string>
<string name="6138">Me... Not... Carry... All... This... Phew... We gots to get rid of somethings.</string>
<string name="6139">Deekin?</string>
<string name="6140">Deekin greets the noble hero!</string>
<string name="6141">Is okay!</string>
<string name="6142">Nope.</string>
<string name="6143">Wait! Stop!</string>
<string name="6144">Umm&#8230; we gots to rest for a moment so me can organize notes.</string>
<string name="6145">Could we go do something heroic now, maybe?</string>
<string name="6146">Fare well, may your looting be plentiful.</string>
<string name="6147">Oh, thank you thank you thank you!</string>
<string name="6148"></string>
<string name="6149">Oh that make Deekin so-oooo mad!!</string>
<string name="6150">And there was much rejoicing!</string>
<string name="6151">You wants to know what Deekin think?</string>
<string name="6152">Oooo! That sound good!</string>
<string name="6153">Ummm&#8230; you thinks of something else now, okay?</string>
<string name="6154">You keeps that up and Deekin write you out of saga completely!</string>
<string name="6155">For honor and glory!</string>
<string name="6156"></string>
<string name="6157">By the blood of the All-Father!</string>
<string name="6158">Fall before me!</string>
<string name="6159">I need to be healed!</string>
<string name="6160">Give me a hand here!</string>
<string name="6161">There, up ahead.</string>
<string name="6162">We must get out of here!</string>
<string name="6163">Is that all you&apos;ve got?</string>
<string name="6164">Watch my back!</string>
<string name="6165">Stay here and don&apos;t move.</string>
<string name="6166"></string>
<string name="6167"></string>
<string name="6168"></string>
<string name="6169"></string>
<string name="6170"></string>
<string name="6171"></string>
<string name="6172">If you&apos;re going to do something, do it fast!</string>
<string name="6173"></string>
<string name="6174">Ah, Poison!  I should have known...</string>
<string name="6175">What? Now my magic is failing?</string>
<string name="6176">My weapon cannot hurt this one!</string>
<string name="6177">Follow me closely, now.</string>
<string name="6178">Hmm. Found something.</string>
<string name="6179">We should stick together, here.</string>
<string name="6180">Please, let me through.</string>
<string name="6181">Allow me.</string>
<string name="6182">Let me see&#8230;</string>
<string name="6183">Where the shadow goes, so do I.</string>
<string name="6184">Indeed.</string>
<string name="6185">I can&apos;t do that.</string>
<string name="6186">All done here.</string>
<string name="6187">I can&apos;t carry that. We&apos;ll have to leave something behind.</string>
<string name="6188">What now?</string>
<string name="6189">Well met.</string>
<string name="6190">Yes, of course.</string>
<string name="6191">Certainly not.</string>
<string name="6192">Stop right there!</string>
<string name="6193">I believe we should rest soon.</string>
<string name="6194">I don&apos;t see what we&apos;re accomplishing sitting around like this.</string>
<string name="6195">Perhaps we&apos;ll meet again.</string>
<string name="6196">I appreciate that.</string>
<string name="6197"></string>
<string name="6198">By Clangeddin&apos;s beard!</string>
<string name="6199">I knew this would go well!</string>
<string name="6200">Hold on a minute, I have a suggestion.</string>
<string name="6201">Hmm.. That may work.</string>
<string name="6202">That won&apos;t work.</string>
<string name="6203">Berronar help me, I&apos;ll strike you down where you stand.</string>
<string name="6204">We shall triumph this day! Attack!</string>
<string name="6205">Back with you!</string>
<string name="6206">You will not win this time!</string>
<string name="6207">Right shall prevail!</string>
<string name="6208">Don&apos;t just stand there! Help me!</string>
<string name="6209">I need assistance!</string>
<string name="6210"></string>

<string name="6216">Aargh!</string>
<string name="6217">Well, hello there.</string>
<string name="6218">Very well.</string>
<string name="6219">I think not.</string>
<string name="6220">I wish you well.</string>
<string name="6221"></string>

<string name="6437">Hilltop: one of many small villages that dot the most remote regions of the northern wildlands known as the Silver Marches.</string>
<string name="6438">Few would choose so cold and inhospitable a land to make their home. Only those seeking a new life -- or to escape their past. </string>
<string name="6439">&quot;The North has no memory,&quot; they say. But it has more than its share of danger... and evil.</string>
<string name="6440">It is in Hilltop that your mentor, Master Drogan, chose to settle after a lifetime of adventure. Here he would pass on his knowledge to you and a select few others with promise.
</string>
<string name="6441">It is here that evil comes, in the shadows, and behind it a sinister purpose that will see your own promise either realized in full...  or extinguished forever.
</string>
<string name="6442">The caravan makes slow progress as it leaves Hilltop, trudging through snowy hills for several weeks before finally the vast wasteland of the Anauroch Desert opens up before you.
</string>
<string name="6443">This is a parched land said to be the bones of the once-great Netheril Empire, its complete destruction a mystery lost to the passing of ages.
</string>
<string name="6444">The mythallar is hers, at long last.
</string>
<string name="6445">What follows is the oldest of Netherese rituals, lost to time but unearthed from the sands by Heurodis and now used by her to access the power of the mythallar in full.
</string>
<string name="6446">You know that it is only a matter of time before Undrentide responds to her urging, the power of the mythallar forcing the city to rise slowly through the sands of the Anauroch, forcing it to take to the skies as it once did so long ago. 
</string>
<string name="6447">The groaning city begins to lean in its flight like a wounded bird...</string>
<string name="6448">The crash into the ground that marks the second fall of Undrentide is heard and felt throughout Faerun. Most folk will stop and wonder and never know how close Heurodis came to dominating them through the sheer power of the long-buried past.
</string>
<string name="6449">Some, however, such as the Harpers, know well the part you played in Heurodis&apos;s end. They name you a hero and, throughout the realms, songs are sung of the sacrifices that you and Drogan made for them all.
</string>
<string name="6450">As for your own fate after escaping into the Plane of Shadow, it is unknown even to the Harpers. The slave collar shattered on Ashtara&apos;s death, so you are free... . Wherever your adventures lead you, however, one thing is certain: your own tale is far from over...&quot;

<string name="6531">&quot;And the heroes explored the dreaded dungeon, sweat beading on their brows! Huzzah!&quot;</string>
<string name="6532">Oooo... Deekin see dead people...</string>
<string name="6533">This be place you supposed to go, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;? It not very big. Deekin is very disappointed... this just gets footnote in epic tale, Deekin thinks...</string>
<string name="6534">Oh, there is the water! Where it come from? Suddenly Deekin feel very thirsty...</string>
<string name="6535">&quot;The heroes came within sight of the big, nasty evil person at last! Their doom was at hand! Doom! Doom doom doom!! DOOM!!&quot;</string>
<string name="6536">That be very big statue. Deekin sure hope it not walk around and eats little kobolds...</string>
<string name="6537">It look very deep down there. &quot;The valiant heroes cross the bridge with trepidation! Deekin is very glad to have &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; at his side!&quot;</string>
<string name="6538">This be pretty messy for big church. We kobolds got nicer stuff than this.</string>
<string name="6539">Where is all the water? Deekin not sees no water nowhere!</string>
<string name="6540">&lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;! There be human guide! And, ummm... lots of other nasty creatures...</string>
<string name="6541">Ummm... &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;? You know this place goes even deeper, now? Either they eats guide human or he down there, Deekin guesses.</string>
<string name="6542">Umm... wait, let me writes this down. &quot;And the heroes entered the stinky scorpion-thingy caves...&quot; ...umm, no, let me think...</string>
<string name="6543">Ooo! Look, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;! Is big hole! Maybe desert human be down there?</string>

<string name="6564">Ooo! You wants to hear Deekin sing! Deekin gladly sing for &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;!</string>
<string name="6565">Ummm... Deekin might be able to cast a spell for you, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, sure. What you wants Deekin to cast?</string>
<string name="6566">You wants something else, then, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;?</string>
<string name="6567">Okay. Who shoulds Deekin cast it on?</string>
<string name="6568">Okay. Who shoulds Deekin cast it on?</string>
<string name="6569">Deekin do his best! Holds on!</string>
<string name="6570">Deekin always happy to talks to &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. What you wants to talk about?</string>
<string name="6571">Deekin tired. Feet is sore. Back is hurting. Little Deekin feel like bag of clamshells bashed on ground repeatedly. Overall is good.</string>
<string name="6572">You wants to talk about something else, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;?</string>
<string name="6573">Deekin gots little indigestion, maybe. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Burp!]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh... there it goes.</string>
<string name="6574">Hmmm. Is good. Deekin just not remember where he leaves pot of ink. How you supposed to write if you not gots ink?</string>
<string name="6575">Is all okays. How about you, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Everything okays with you?</string>

<string name="6577">Ummm... is okay. Except Deekin not remembers how you spells &quot;adventurer&quot;.</string>
<string name="6578">Deekin busy writings latest chapter in epic story of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. It goings to be really good. Peoples reads it everywhere!</string>
<string name="6579">Ummm... is okay, Deekin guesses, except Deekin not sees much. Where you at, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;?</string>
<string name="6580">Deekin gots some scratches and stuff, but it mostly okay. Deekin tougher than he looks.</string>
<string name="6581">Deekin hurts pretty bad. Is adventuring always likes this? Is hard to write epic story when blood be everywhere.</string>
<string name="6582">Ooo... Deekin not feels good. He hurts really bad. Maybe we rests now?</string>
<string name="6583">Deekin thinks he be poisoned. He burps lots and skin feels like it on fire. Old Master sometimes give Deekin poison for fun... Deekin not thinks it so fun.</string>
<string name="6584">Ummm... Deekin not feels so good. He gots bad rash, and just wants to curls up somewhere. Bleh.</string>
<string name="6585">Ummm, okay. What do you wants Deekin to call you?</string>
<string name="6586">Ummm... then Deekin calls you &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, because that is what you are!</string>
<string name="6587">Umm, okay. Deekin calls you &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, Deekin not mind. Deekin just wants to make &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; happy.</string>
<string name="6588">Ummm... Deekin try to gets real good at sneaky skills for &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. If you wants, Deekin go back to telling tales and cast spells like Deekin does best?</string>
<string name="6589">Ummm... okay. Deekin keep it up for you, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="6590">Yayy!! Deekin like being bard the best! Deekin enjoys to sing praises of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;!</string>
<string name="6591">Ummm... Deekin works hard at being bard, of course. Deekin always be bard. If &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; wants, though, Deekin focus more on sneaky skills in future?</string>
<string name="6592">That sound good. Deekin is good bard!</string>
<string name="6593">Okay, Deekin will do his best. Deekin always keep working on epic tale of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, though, you gets no worried about that!</string>
<string name="6594">Ummm... Deekin not be sure. Deekin go to Dalelands, maybe.</string>
<string name="6595">Yup. Deekin think maybe he go visit Elminster the Sage. That human writes lots of books that Deekin read.</string>
<string name="6596">Yup, Deekin knows that. Deekin think he checks out Witch-King of Vaasa, maybe, on way. Deekin always wonder what he look like.</string>
<string name="6597">Maybe Deekin make few other stops on way. He not kidding when Deekin say he wants to travel.</string>
<string name="6598">Deekin also thinks maybe he goes to Amn. Then maybe he goes to Waterdeep. That be big city... maybe gots a thousand humans, even.</string>
<string name="6599">Deekin used to thinks about the places he one day go every night before he sleeps. Old Master would laughs at Deekin, but Deekin not care.</string>
<string name="6600">Then one day after Deekin done with travels, he comes back to kobold caves and he be greatest chieftain ever. He bring kobolds out of caves, he will!</string>
<string name="6601">Deekin brings them out whether they likes it or not. Kobolds lives with humans like halflings do and stop raidings and fightings. Deekin do it, too, you will see.</string>
<string name="6602">How Deekin forgets that? Deekin knows kobold heart better than &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; knows. One day kobolds be like dragon and stops being small and mean and frightened.</string>
<string name="6603">Maybe &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; and Deekin even travels together once adventure be done? What you thinks of that?</string>
<string name="6604">Goody! First Deekin finish epic story of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; and then both he and &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; be famous everywhere they travels!</string>
<string name="6605">Soon, maybe. Once Deekin knows how it all ends, Deekin shows it to you. One day &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; be really big star.</string>
<string name="6606">For now, we shoulds continue adventure... or Deekin never find out how epic story ends!</string>
<string name="6607">Oh. That too bad. Deekin make sure he finish epic story of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, first, anyway. Then he be famous.</string>
<string name="6608">Oh. Deekin guesses that be true. Okay. In meantime, Deekin gots to finish epic story of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, anyway.</string>
<string name="6609">Okay, Deekin can waits. Deekin gots to finish his epic story of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, first, anyway.</string>
<string name="6610">Deekin happy you says that. If Deekin tells kobolds what great things kobolds could be, maybe they changes. Maybe.</string>
<string name="6611">Maybe. But it not be dream if Deekin not tries.</string>
<string name="6612">Oh, Deekin not go nowhere right now. Deekin leaves later, once adventure in flying city is all done.</string>
<string name="6613">Deekin not means nothing by it. Deekin could leaves Old Master, so Deekin could leaves &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Deekin is bard, after all, and bard gots to travel.</string>
<string name="6614">Oh, Deekin not go nowhere right now. Deekin leaves later. Maybe. Deekin likes you lots and you travels lots, so Deekin not sure he want to go.</string>
<string name="6615">Oh. Maybe they is, but dreams be really big. Bigger than kobold or even &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Old Master says that once.</string>
<string name="6616">Deekin gots list of three spelling errors he gives to old human. There be no excuse for spelling errors, you knows.</string>
<string name="6617">Why not? He be private like dragon? You think he eats kobold, maybe?</string>
<string name="6618">Then what be wrong? He just write lots of books, he not be great wizard or nothings. Gosh, you not knows much, does you?</string>
<string name="6619">Ummm... okay. Let Deekin think...</string>
<string name="6620">We is doomed! Doom doom doom-doom doom DOOM!! Doom doom doom-doom doom DOOM!! Doom doom doom-doom doom DOOM!!</string>
<string name="6621">DOOM!! Doom doom doom-doom doom DOOM!!</string>
<string name="6622">Umm... mumble... mumble mumble... Deekin forgets the lyrics... la-te-da...</string>
<string name="6623">Oh-hhhh! Deekin&apos;s singing a song, yeah! Deekin&apos;s singing a song! He forgets how it goes, but nobody knows, &apos;cause Deekin&apos;s singing a so-ooong!!</string>
<string name="6624">Dum-de-dum! Deekin and the &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;! De-dum-de-dum! Deekin and the &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, yeah!!</string>
<string name="6625">There once was a lady from Icewind Dale,
Who baked cakes that soon went stale.
The smell, unappealing,
had the entire town reeling,
Until a dwarf ate the cakes with his ale.</string>
<string name="6626">There once was a man from Waterdeep,
Who had three wives he couldn&apos;t keep!
When asked, &quot;Why not one?&quot;
He said, &quot;Because it&apos;s fun!&quot;
&quot;Though I never get much time to sleep!&quot;</string>
<string name="6627">There once was a wizard of Thay,
Who never had time to play!
His patience eroded
until his head exploded,
and the stain never quite went away!</string>
<string name="6628">There once was a man from the Moonsea,
Whose limericks only went to line three,
And never went farther.</string>
<string name="6629">I went with the Duchess to tea,
Her manners were shocking to see!
Her rumblings abdominal
Were simply phenomenal,
And everyone thought it was me!</string>
<string name="6630">Deekin sings you the doom song! Doom doom doom! DOOM! Doom! Doom doom doom! DOOM!!</string>
<string name="6631">Deekin knows one good story, maybe. Is long, though.</string>
<string name="6632">Okay, Deekin reads it once in book of Old Master&apos;s. Old Master likes it lots. There be far away human kingdom, right? It gots human king... that why they calls it that.</string>
<string name="6633">Yup. Anyways, there is lots of humans in kingdom who not likes King. They rebels, but King captures their leader. He be called Count... ummm... Fred.</string>
<string name="6634">Well, Deekin forgets real name. He be Count, though... noble human who is cousin to King. King be very mad. He says that Count must be tortured lots and tell King all about rebels.</string>
<string name="6635">So they gets mean, nasty torturer to come and he cuts off toes of Count. Count hurts lots, but he not tells about rebels.</string>
<string name="6636">So then torturer cuts off fingers. Count screams and screams but still he not tells about rebels.</string>
<string name="6637">Deekin gettings there. He tells you it be long story.</string>
<string name="6638">So torturer cuts off nose, but still Count not talk. Torturer cuts off ears and feet and hands... Count screams and screams but he not talk about rebels.</string>
<string name="6639">So finally King gets respect for Count. He says Count be very brave, and even though he be rebel he allow torturer to kills Count finally and puts him out of misery.</string>
<string name="6640">As torturer raise hatchet, Count screams loud and says, &quot;Wait! Me tells! Me tells!&quot; But it be too late... torturer swings hatchet and Count be dead.</string>
<string name="6641">You knows what moral of story be?</string>
<string name="6642">&quot;Never hatchet Counts before they chicken.&quot;</string>
<string name="6643">Oh! Oh no, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;! Ummm... Deekin do better next time! Deekin promises! Heh... is just funny story...</string>
<string name="6644">That not good. Maybe you shoulds get that checked out.</string>
<string name="6645">Thanks. Old Master laugh every time Deekin tell that story, laugh until he pee himself. Every time.</string>
<string name="6646">Yeah, Deekin know. But Old Master like story lots, like Deekin say. Go figure.</string>
<string name="6647">Deekin tells you that Old Master likes it lots, didn&apos;t Deekin? Old Master likes stories where helpless maidens gets eaten by dragon, too.</string>
<string name="6648">Ummm... is about human kingdom. And rebels. And torture, lots of torture. Old Master likes it lots.</string>
<string name="6649">Deekin wants to travel. Did Deekin not tells you all this?</string>
<string name="6650">Sure, Deekin owes Old Master lots. But Deekin pays lots, too. He be with Old Master morning, noon and night for long, long time. That not picnic, you knows.</string>
<string name="6651">Deekin used to asks Old Master if Deekin would ever gets to go to places he reads about, and Old Master would only says one thing.</string>
<string name="6652">He would says, &quot;Deekin, one of these days you goings to learn that there only be one way you ever be free.&quot;</string>
<string name="6653">Deekin gots to be dragon. He gots to be brave like dragon, he gots to be strong like dragon and he gots to fight for what he wants.</string>
<string name="6654">It mean Deekin only ready to be on own when he gots courage to leave. That be what Deekin learn from Old Master... when Old Master not belches or sleeps.</string>
<string name="6655">When Deekin finally sees chance, he scared lots... but he knows this be one chance to leaves. It be now or nevers.</string>
<string name="6656">Deekin gets to see desert. Deekin gets to travels with &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; and be adventurer. Now Deekin be in very own story instead of just reads about it.</string>
<string name="6657">Is best thing Deekin ever does. Deekin wishes it could go on forever.</string>
<string name="6658">Maybe we keeps going? Deekin can not waits to see what part come next!</string>
<string name="6659">He maybe says it once or twice. Mostly Deekin picks it up from other stuff Old Master says.</string>
<string name="6660">Ummmm, yup, Deekin was so scared. He more scared then when orcs come to invades kobold caves, even.</string>
<string name="6661">Was okay, sometimes, when Old Master not gets hungry or rolls over on Deekin when he asleep. Old Master gots strange sense of humor.</string>
<string name="6662">Old Master teaches Deekin to be bard. Deekin already tells you that.</string>
<string name="6663">Well... Old Master not goes around looking for bard, neither. He picks little Deekin for something else, first.</string>
<string name="6664">Old Master sees little Deekin and sees that he gots lots of talent for magic. Old Master says he going to make Deekin great kobold sorcerer... Deekin be next chief!</string>
<string name="6665">Ummm... Old Master be bored, maybe? Plus when Deekin was young kobold, orcs of Nether Mountains comes to raid kobold caves lots.</string>
<string name="6666">Deekin coulds be good chief! One day maybe he goes back to kobold caves and Deekin be greatest chief ever!</string>
<string name="6667">But, ummm, it not be normal for Old Master to trains kobold. When Deekin was young pup, orcs in Nether Mountains would raids kobold caves lots.</string>
<string name="6668">Nope. He trains none, in fact. But back when Deekin was young kobold, orcs in Nether Mountains raids kobold caves lots.</string>
<string name="6669">Old Master likes to be left alone. He not be very happy that kobolds be slaughtered all the time and orcs comes and disturbs him. Old Master thinks orcs taste funny.</string>
<string name="6670">So Old Master says he trains great kobold sorcerer who keeps orcs away always. That be little Deekin.</string>
<string name="6671">Oh, well... Deekin not be very good student. Deekin like to read, though! He reads all books Old Master gots! Books that gots stories and pictures of many places!</string>
<string name="6672">So Deekin not works hard like he supposed to. When next orc raid comes, Old Master send Deekin to go fights orcs with magic he not gots.</string>
<string name="6673">That what Old Master say. He finds Deekin hiding in barrel while rest of kobolds gots killed. Old Master laugh lots at that.</string>
<string name="6674">Rest of tribe be very angry and says Deekin must die, but Old Master says no. He says Deekin smart to hide, but not very brave. Deekin not good chief but Deekin funny.</string>
<string name="6675">So Old Master lets Deekin stay so long as Deekin keeps Old Master amused. That how Deekin becomes bard.</string>
<string name="6676">Deekin gots to work hard to keep Old Master happy, yes. Deekin learns lots of stories and songs, whatever it take.</string>
<string name="6677">Old Master threatens to eats Deekin lots. And he make big, smelly noises when he sleeps... but is okay compared to usual kobold life.</string>
<string name="6678">And now Deekin is adventurer! How many kobolds gets to do that?</string>
<string name="6679">You gots that right. Quick, let&apos;s go! Deekin gots urge to kill something nasty.</string>
<string name="6680">Meh. Not so much.</string>
<string name="6681">Tribe goes through chief every year or two. It not gots long life expectancy. Deekin not stupid, remember?</string>
<string name="6682">At least Old Master keeps Deekin around long time. Deekin learns lots of stories and songs, whatever it take to keep Old Master in chuckles.</string>
<string name="6683">No, it not go good at all. Deekin hides while rest of kobolds gets killed. Old Master think it very hilarious.</string>
<string name="6684">No, Deekin not dies. Deekin hides while rest of kobolds gets killed. Old Master think that be very funny.</string>
<string name="6685">Ummm... that is true. No other kobold is bard that Deekin knows about. Old Master not really wants bard at first, neither.</string>
<string name="6686">Oh. You mean why Deekin be bard and not sorcerer, maybe? That is good question... Old Master not wants bard, at first.</string>
<string name="6687">AHHHHHHH!! Deekin... heart...</string>
<string name="6688">Deekin worships ground &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; walk on! Honest! Please not be so angry at Deekin!</string>
<string name="6689">Deekin not worthy! Deekin not worthy!</string>
<string name="6690">Deekin is so sorry, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;!! Please no hurts!</string>
<string name="6691">Please, please no hurts Deekin, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;!</string>
<string name="6692">Ahhh! No hurts Deekin! Deekin sorry, he tries to do better!</string>
<string name="6693">Deekin is but little, little worm before &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;! Forgive little Deekin!</string>
<string name="6694">Deekin learns lesson good, he promises! Deekin do better, he will!</string>
<string name="6695">Yay! Deekin so happy! Deekin do his best from now on, Deekin promises!</string>
<string name="6696">Ummm... okay. Deekin keep trying to write epic tale... it not so interesting, though, when all Deekin gots to write about is clouds and maybe occasional limerick...</string>
<string name="6697">&quot;The &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; and &lt;his/her&gt; faithful kobold companion were re-united once again!&quot;</string>
<string name="6698">Deekin not falls out of line. Oh... you means Deekin should shuts up and comes with you. Of *course* Deekin do that!</string>
<string name="6699">Yup, Deekin is lucky kobold to have &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; as his friend! Deekin never think he have to stays still so long before.</string>
<string name="6700">Deekin thought he be statue forever. Deekin gots this little itch under tail that just drive Deekin crazy! Deekin thought his head explode!</string>
<string name="6701">Ummm... yup, Deekin is okay. Deekin never stay still for so long before, though, so is completely new experience for Deekin.</string>
<string name="6702">One time Old Boss tell Deekin to stand still. He say Deekin run around so much he drive Old Boss crazy. Finally he cast spell on Deekin that make Deekin still.</string>
<string name="6703">It not same thing, though. It not lasts so long and Deekin never worry that bird poops on him or anything.</string>
<string name="6704">Ummm... sometimes Deekin is glad that &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; not be big dragon like Old Master.</string>
<string name="6705">Oh, it only be horrible when Old Master use paralyzed Deekin to pick teeth. That not so fun.</string>
<string name="6706">Sometimes Deekin talk too much, too.</string>
<string name="6707">Deekin gots question. Snake lady turns us into statues just by lookings at us, yes? What we do if we meets her again?</string>
<string name="6708">Oh. Deekin was hoping you would knows. Deekin not really likes thought of being statue again.</string>
<string name="6709">Ummm... does &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; knows how long &lt;he/she&gt; and Deekin be statues? Deekin not really able to tell.</string>
<string name="6710">Well... Deekin just wonders... what snake lady be doing while &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; and Deekin be statues?</string>
<string name="6711">Deekin was afraid you says that. We be trapped in old city really far under sand, and snake lady be out there. Is good story... Deekin just wishes Deekin not stars in it.</string>
<string name="6712">Deekin prefers to stay with you, but... if you is sure... okay.</string>
<string name="6713">Ooo... Deekin has sudden chill. Deek keeps quill ready... it be certain there going to be lots to writes about now...</string>
<string name="6714">Okay, that sounds like good plan. Deekin likes good plans.</string>
<string name="6715">Aahhh! No, please please don&apos;t hurt Deekin, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;! Deekin explain himself, honest!</string>
<string name="6716">Oh. That not good. Deekin was, ummm, hoping for better reception. Maybe Deekin should explain himself?</string>
<string name="6717">Deekin serve as cook for halflings, he does! Deekin is, ummm, a very good cook? You not believes that, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, no?</string>
<string name="6718">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; Deekin follow &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; after we last meets. Deekin wants to see world, but... Deekin not know where to go! World is so, so big!</string>
<string name="6719">So, umm, Deekin watch &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; because Deekin sure &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; go on to more adventures. And Deekin was right!</string>
<string name="6720">When &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; leave on caravan, Deekin follow it. Deekin ask halfling girl to hires Deekin on as cook. Then... then Deekin maybe be adventurer, too?</string>
<string name="6721">But... but Deekin was hoping he could travel with &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;! He be sidekick! Deekin would write great, epic tale of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;&apos;s adventures!</string>
<string name="6722">Deekin know that. Deekin was hoping... maybe he travel as &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;&apos;s sidekick? Deekin write the great, epic tale of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;&apos;s adventure!</string>
<string name="6723">Deekin wants to be adventurer, yes! Deekin could... travel with &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; as sidekick, maybe? Deekin write the great, epic tale of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;&apos;s adventure!</string>
<string name="6724">Just thinks of it! Deekin&apos;s story would travel across land, and you becomes famous! What not good about that?</string>
<string name="6725">Aww. Then... then Deekin guesses he stays and works as cook for halfling girl. Maybe... maybe you changes mind. Someday...</string>
<string name="6726">Deekin be less annoying! Deekin promises!!</string>
<string name="6727">It be epic tale of... of fighting and big, nasty villains! Songs of bravery! Whispers of deeds better left unmentioned! It be really, really good! Deekin promises!</string>
<string name="6728">Ummm... a little?</string>
<string name="6729">Me gots a *few* spells. Deekin is bard, after all, and not big, nasty sorcerer kobold...</string>
<string name="6730">Bad back. But Deekin great for morale!</string>
<string name="6731">Yay! You not be sorry! Deekin make best, most epic tale of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; ever!</string>
<string name="6732">So-oooo... when we begins? We kills something now?</string>
<string name="6733">[Chapter 1. Initial greeting.]</string>
<string name="6734">Okay, Deekin is sorry. Deekin is hushed up now.</string>
<string name="6735">Ummm... big fight with scary snake lady is real close, huh?</string>
<string name="6736">Deekin wonders if he gets chance to finish epic tale of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Snake lady might turns Deekin to stone again.</string>
<string name="6737">Deekin not be coward! Deekin not running away... he gots to see how epic tale ends, after all, he not just makes stuff up you know.</string>
<string name="6738">It just makes Deekin think. Maybe Deekin still be here to finish epic story... but maybe &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; not be.</string>
<string name="6739">No, Deekin not means that. Deekin helps you this far... he be faithful kobold companion! Can&apos;t re-write character *now*.</string>
<string name="6740">Just in case something happen, though, Deekin thinks this be good time to says something to &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="6741">Deekin wants to... thank you for freeing him and taking him on great adventure. Deekin not feels like kobold stuck in cave anymore, and that all he ever wanted... to be more than just kobold.</string>
<string name="6742">Yup. Deekin done.</string>
<string name="6743">Ummm... Deekin knows that. Well, Deekin *hopes* that. But Deekin wanted to says it anyway.</string>
<string name="6744">Okay. Deekin warn you, though: you better not tries to reads it before he done! Deekin hate that.</string>
<string name="6745">You is so full of praises, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. That why Deekin like you so much.</string>
<string name="6746">Okay, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Let&apos;s go teach snake lady big lesson for turning peoples into statues!</string>
<string name="6747">Deekin thinks you be very scary. You reminds Deekin lots of Old Master... maybe that be why Deekin likes you?</string>
<string name="6748">Deekin is, ummm, very happy he comes with you. Deekin was right when he say you be great hero... and now Deekin be hero, too.</string>
<string name="6749">Ummm... that be good point.</string>
<string name="6750">Heh.  You always knows what to say to makes Deekin feel better.</string>
<string name="6751">Maybe. It not be quite so much fun, though.</string>
<string name="6752">Deekin hopes so. Is really good story. Bestseller even, maybe, though kind of roughs in parts... Deekin gots to fill those parts out later.</string>
<string name="6753">Oh, no no! How Deekin knows how epic tale ends if Deekin not there to see it? You talks silly, Deekin thinks.</string>
<string name="6754">Deekin not understands. How you collects wind? Wind not be something you touches. Smells, maybe, but not touches.</string>
<string name="6755">Oh, Deekin not so dumb. Deekin understands stuff pretty good. You be surprised at Deekin sometimes.</string>
<string name="6756">But... why there not be four winds? All story books that Old Master has always says there be four winds.</string>
<string name="6757">Ummm... okay. Deekin tries. Deekin gots just one more stupid question, maybe. We collects three winds to get into tower, right?</string>
<string name="6758">Deekin gots one more question. We gots to collect three winds to gets into tower, right?</string>
<string name="6759">You not listens closely, then, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. We needs three winds to gets into windy tower. That was Deekin understands.</string>
<string name="6760">But why we wants to get into tower?</string>
<string name="6761">Ohhh. Scary snake lady is in there? Suddenly Deekin not feel so anxious about findings any wind.</string>
<string name="6762">&quot;The final path for our heroes had suddenly become clear! They were to collect the wind itself (and not the stinky kind), in order to face their foe!&quot;</string>
<string name="6763">&quot;How could such a feat be accomplished? The faithful kobold could only wonder and be confident that &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; would figure out a way!&quot;</string>
<string name="6764">Sorry, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="6765">Any time, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="6766">Nope. When you lives with Old Master as long as Deekin did, you know good and well that there only one kind of *that* wind.</string>
<string name="6767">Oh. Deekin thinks &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; is probably right.</string>
<string name="6768">Why... why did ground moves like that? Deekin not feel ground moves except back when Old Master sleep badly after he eats too much fish.</string>
<string name="6769">Deekin used to tell Old Master, &quot;You should not eats so much fish!&quot; That only make Old Master mad, though, so he go eats even more fish.</string>
<string name="6770">Then he make ground shake in cave all night. Once Deekin falls in crack in ground and he stucks there for whole week...</string>
<string name="6771">Umm... sorry, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Do you knows why ground shakes?</string>
<string name="6772">Oh. Sorry, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Deekin stops now.</string>
<string name="6773">Snake lady make whole city shakes?</string>
<string name="6774">&quot;The evil plan of Heurodis was close to fruition. Our intrepid heroes could only hold their queasy stomachs as the city lurched to life around them.&quot;</string>
<string name="6775">&quot;How could they stop her? How much time did they have before Heurodis was able to raise the city into the sky and all would be lost?!&quot;</string>
<string name="6776">&quot;Our fearless kobold, faithful companion to &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, was reminded of...&quot;</string>
<string name="6777">Oh, ummm, sorry &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="6778">Is... is old dwarf wizard... does he really be dead?</string>
<string name="6779">But... when he sends us through magic portal... he knows he goings to die? Did dwarf wizard... sacrifice himself for Deekin?</string>
<string name="6780">It... it is just... Deekin not knows now how to writes this in epic story of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="6781">Then... then Deekin writes that he feels sorry for dwarf wizard and is sad that dwarf wizard dies.</string>
<string name="6782">And now we is someplace else? And we not be able to go back? Deekin thinks we be close, now, to end. He keeps pen ready, just in case...</string>
<string name="6783">Ummm... okay. Deekin write that, but only because &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; tells Deekin to. You sounds lots like Old Master. Deekin just hopes you not tries to eats him.</string>
<string name="6784">Okay. Deekin writes that. That sound good.</string>
<string name="6785">Oh. Deekin not... not think dwarf wizard be foolish. Maybe &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; is right...</string>
<string name="6786">Nobody ever does anything like that for Deekin before. You be very good to little Deekin, but dwarf wizard... he dead now.</string>
<string name="6787">Then Deekin very happy to be with &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, that for sure. Deekin not wants to die, after all.</string>
<string name="6788">So... wizard fellow says that little crystal inside broken tower statue very important, yes?</string>
<string name="6789">So somebody wants the little crystal very badly?</string>
<string name="6790">Deekin not tries to take little crystal, oh no. Deekin gots no ideas.</string>
<string name="6791">But... Deekin just wonders... will this someone comes and tries to kills us because we gots little crystal?</string>
<string name="6792">Deekin tries to be brave, he does. It be really hard, though...</string>
<string name="6793">Ummm... we is? You not be scareds at all?</string>
<string name="6794">Deekin only thinking maybe we shoulds give little crystal away, maybe? Like... gives back to dwarf wizard? It be his crystal, no?</string>
<string name="6795">So you gives little crystal to dwarf wizard, then?</string>
<string name="6796">Oh. Deekin not catches that part.</string>
<string name="6797">Maybe we just goes back to hills, then, and leaves desert. Maybe we not goes to scary place human wizard talks about? We not needs to go there, does we?</string>
<string name="6798">Ummm... no, Deekin guesses not.</string>
<string name="6799">Deekin always think writing epic story of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; be exciting and fun... but now it get scary. Deekin not expects that.</string>
<string name="6800">There be somebody with lots of power like Old Master out there... somebody who wants to hurts &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; or even Deekin. Is &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; not scared?</string>
<string name="6801">Ummm... okay. Deekin try not to be such a scaredy-cat, then. Deekin sorry.</string>
<string name="6802">Deekin is happy to hears that... though he wonders who protects &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;?</string>
<string name="6803">It is? That be good, then, because Deekin scared lots.</string>
<string name="6804">Oh. Deekin tries to be more like &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, then. Umm... more scaly version, though.</string>
<string name="6805">Deekin not thinks of that. Halflings not go back, huh?</string>
<string name="6806">Oh. Then Deekin gots no choice, really.</string>
<string name="6807">It coulds be? Is useful for what?</string>
<string name="6808">Oh, and you wants lots of power, Deekin guesses. Yes, Old Master used to talks like that, too.</string>
<string name="6809">Well... maybe we waits here until human wizard contacts him?</string>
<string name="6810">You not means we go to scary place human wizard talks about, does you? Maybe we just goes back to hills and leave desert?</string>
<string name="6811">Deekin not knows much. Deekin only knows that little crystal gots lots of power. He was scared to break it, too.</string>
<string name="6812">Ummm... Deekin just wonders if dwarf wizard be okays. You knows, since we kobolds...</string>
<string name="6813">Yes. Deekin not hurts him, but Deekin still feels guilty. Deekin goes on raid with other kobolds, after all.</string>
<string name="6814">Deekin never fits in with other kobolds. Old Master used to tells Deekin that Deekin too smart. But... kobold chieftain be smart, too, and Deekin not be like him either.</string>
<string name="6815">Deekin sorry. Deekin try not to whine again if &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; not likes it.</string>
<string name="6816">Deekin not sure. Other kobolds thinks of golds and hunting... Deekin always thinks of stories and magic and places he reads about. Other kobolds think Deekin strange.</string>
<string name="6817">Even when Deekin young he was not like other kobolds. He not vicious and fight... all older kobolds say that Deekin be weak and not amounts to much.</string>
<string name="6818">Old Master not thinks Deekin so strange, though. Old Master teach Deekin lots, instead, and make Deekin special. Deekin misses Old Master... a little.</string>
<string name="6819">Deekin not want Old Master dead. Deekin just want to be free.</string>
<string name="6820">Deekin not really got much choice at the time, even if &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; not likes it. Deekin free now, that what is important.</string>
<string name="6821">Though Deekin wonder if maybe he was not safer back with Old Master. Deekin thinks &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; live very dangerous life.</string>
<string name="6822">Ummm... Deekin knows that. Deekin try to be brave and not run.</string>
<string name="6823">Deekin wonder one last thing: was dwarf very mad at Deekin for breaking little tower statue?</string>
<string name="6824">Oh! Well... Deekin glad about that, then! Deekin not really want angry dwarf looking for him, you knows?</string>
<string name="6825">Well... Deekin not really want angry dwarf wizard come lookings for him one day. Not good for long kobold life, he thinking.</string>
<string name="6826">Oh. That not good.</string>
<string name="6827">Deekin wonder one last thing: he notice you gots dragon tooth. That be artifact of dwarf&apos;s, no? Why you still gots that?</string>
<string name="6828">That be tooth of great dragon lich Hephaestagon, yes? Deekin reads about that once.</string>
<string name="6829">Deekin could maybe make it into amulet that give power to one with draconic blood. But, ummm... it is your tooth.</string>
<string name="6830">Okay. Is up to you, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="6831">Ummm... Deekin thinks this place be creepy. Maybe we should go now, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;?</string>
<string name="6832">Ummm... okay. Here, it not takes long...</string>
<string name="6833">Okay, is done. Deekin put it on for now, since it do you no good.</string>
<string name="6834">Ummm... is pretty small. Deekin might makes it into knife that hurts undead, maybe. If you wants Deekin to.</string>
<string name="6835">Ummm... okay. Here, it not takes long...</string>
<string name="6836">Okay, is done. Here you go, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="6837">Not because Deekin tricks you or anything. Deekin just makes offer, that all.</string>
<string name="6838">Deekin do his best for you, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Deekin try to be brave.</string>
<string name="6839">You is right, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;, of course. Deekin feel much better.</string>
<string name="6840">Where else was Deekin supposed to go? Only you knows Deekin not like other kobolds... and Deekin know you go to see things he wants to see.</string>
<string name="6841">Heh heh... Deekin was hoping you not thinks about that too much. Deekin not really have choice at the time, after all. Deekin free now, and that what is important.</string>
<string name="6842">Yes. Deekin never see real desert before. He reads about it but never sees it. It makes Deekin want to sing, he is so happy!</string>
<string name="6843">You thinks Deekin gots imagination? That nice thing to say. Other kobolds not gots imagination... all they thinks about is stupid stuff. They says Deekin is weak and strange.</string>
<string name="6844">Deekin happy, then. Deekin not like what kobolds do. Old Master not tells us to make raid on human village, but kobolds make raid anyway despite what Deekin say.</string>
<string name="6845">Deekin would have helped dwarf if he coulds, but Deekin had to run when kobolds run. Nobody in human village would want to hears what Deekin say after.</string>
<string name="6846">But Deekin not knows you then. Deekin was scared you comes to hunt him, just like other kobolds, and that you thinks Deekin be just like rest.</string>
<string name="6847">Yes, Deekin does. Humans not wrong to think kobolds be all bad. Deekin not likes other kobolds, but that not make humans wrong.</string>
<string name="6848">Oh. Deekin still not like what kobolds did. Old Master not tells us to make raid on human village, but kobolds make raid anyway despite what Deekin say.</string>
<string name="6849">Oh. Deekin is sorry, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Deekin forget.</string>
<string name="6850">Okay, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Deekin is ready to adventure once more, he is! Huzzah!</string>
<string name="6851">Is okay. Deekin wants to catch up on story of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. Great, epic tale take lots of time to write... plus Deekin not great speller.</string>
<string name="6852">Deekin sorry! Deekin try really, really hard! Deekin be better, he promises! Please take Deekin back, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;!</string>
<string name="6853">Awww. Deekin guesses he try and catch up on writing epic tale of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. It take long time... plus Deekin not great speller.</string>
<string name="6854">Deekin try not to die first time... but things never goes so well as Deekin hopes. At least it make good entry in epic tale of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;!</string>
<string name="6855">You... you takes Deekin back again, right, &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;? Deekin promises to try better!</string>
<string name="6856">Big, booming voice sound just like &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;. &lt;He/She&gt; say, &quot;You gots to finish my story!&quot; So Deekin feel really bad and comes back.</string>
<string name="6857">But Deekin happy not to be dead any more. Deekin even happier to see &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; again! Does &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; want Deekin to travel with &lt;him/her&gt; again?</string>
<string name="6858">Big, booming voice sound like weird lady. She say, &quot;It&apos;s a good thing,&quot; and then she gives Deekin frilly doily and sends Deekin on his way.</string>
<string name="6859">Big, booming voice claim to be Kurtulmak, God of Kobolds. Then he burps and excuses himself lots and then Deekin gone.</string>
<string name="6860">Big, booming voice not very clear. It mumble something about &quot;reload&quot;, but Deekin not know what that means.</string>
<string name="6861">Big, booming voice sound lots like old Master. It say &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; still smell funny, but me not thinks &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt; smell funny, no.</string>
<string name="6862">Big, booming voice sound lots like old Master. It call Deekin runt and threatens to eats him! Deekin glad to be back.</string>
<string name="6863">Big, booming voice say, &quot;Deekin! You dies lots, you knows that?&quot; And Deekin agrees, of course. Why argue with big, booming voice?</string>
<string name="6864">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;Deekin is currently unconscious and will likely die if he is not given aid very soon.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="6865">No, stay here.</string>
<string name="6866">Yes, come with me.</string>
<string name="6867">No, never mind.</string>
<string name="6868">Yes, come with me.</string>
<string name="6869">Never mind.</string>
<string name="6870">I think we need to part ways.</string>
<string name="6871">Alright, fine. Stay with me, then.</string>
<string name="6872">Just stay here for the moment.</string>
<string name="6873">I&apos;d like you to level up.</string>
<string name="6874">I want to change your tactics.</string>
<string name="6875">I don&apos;t want to change anything else right now.</string>
<string name="6876">I want to move faster and not bother with stealth or searching.</string>
<string name="6877">I need you to be stealthy right now.</string>
<string name="6878">Don&apos;t help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.</string>
<string name="6879">Help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.</string>
<string name="6880">I want to change the distance you stay away from me.</string>
<string name="6881">Stay a long distance away from me.</string>
<string name="6882">Keep a medium distance.</string>
<string name="6883">Stay close.</string>
<string name="6884">Go ahead and attack as soon as you see enemies.</string>
<string name="6885">Defend me and don&apos;t attack until I do.</string>
<string name="6886">I want to adjust your equipment.</string>
<string name="6887">Can you identify my equipment?</string>
<string name="6888">I want you to use your Bard Song.</string>
<string name="6889">I need you to cast a spell.</string>

<string name="6920">What was it you wanted to say earlier?</string>
<string name="6921">Let&apos;s stop and talk for a moment.</string>
<string name="6922">We&apos;re done talking.</string>
<string name="6923">How is everything?</string>
<string name="6924">I want you to stop calling me &quot;&lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;&quot;.</string>
<string name="6925">I really don&apos;t care.</string>
<string name="6926">I don&apos;t know, but I&apos;ve got a few names for you.</string>
<string name="6927">You will call me &quot;miss&quot;, and that&apos;s all!</string>
<string name="6928">You will call me &quot;sir&quot;, and that&apos;s all!</string>
<string name="6929">You can address me as &quot;my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;&quot;.</string>
<string name="6930">Call me &quot;&lt;Master/Mistress&gt;&quot;!</string>
<string name="6931">&quot;The great &lt;FirstName&gt;&quot; will do, I suppose.</string>
<string name="6932">Call me by my name. &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="6933">I want to discuss your training.</string>
<string name="6934">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Deekin will gain levels in the Rogue class]&lt;/Start&gt; No, keep on working on your stealth for now.</string>
<string name="6935">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Deekin will gain levels in the Bard class]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes, go back to improving your bard talents.</string>
<string name="6936">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Deekin will gain levels in the Bard class]&lt;/Start&gt; No, keep on doing what you are now.</string>
<string name="6937">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Deekin will gain levels in the Rogue class]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes, try to focus more on your stealth and skills.</string>
<string name="6938">So what do you intend to do once this is all over?</string>
<string name="6939">The Dalelands?</string>
<string name="6940">The Dalelands is quite far away, you know.</string>
<string name="6941">So I gather.</string>
<string name="6942">Sounds like you&apos;ve thought about this a lot.</string>
<string name="6943">Out of the caves?</string>
<string name="6944">You&apos;re a fool, Deekin.</string>
<string name="6945">I think you forget what kobolds are like.</string>
<string name="6946">You bet!</string>
<string name="6947">So when do I get to see this &apos;epic story&apos;?</string>
<string name="6948">Not a chance, kobold.</string>
<string name="6949">You&apos;ll have to chase after your own dreams, Deekin.</string>
<string name="6950">Maybe. We&apos;ll have to see.</string>
<string name="6951">It sounds like a worthy goal.</string>
<string name="6952">I highly doubt that.</string>
<string name="6953">And what makes you think I&apos;ll let you go?</string>
<string name="6954">Your dreams are a little too big, kobold.</string>
<string name="6955">Oh? And what would you do if you met him?</string>
<string name="6956">You can&apos;t just visit Elminster!</string>
<string name="6957">Well, no, he wouldn&apos;t eat you, I&apos;m sure...</string>
<string name="6958">How about some entertainment?</string>
<string name="6959">Are you saying we&apos;re doomed?</string>
<string name="6960">So... do you know any good tales?</string>
<string name="6961">Hmmm. Maybe later.</string>
<string name="6962">Okay, tell me.</string>
<string name="6963">You don&apos;t say?</string>
<string name="6964">Count Fred?</string>
<string name="6965">Is there a point to this?</string>
<string name="6966">I&apos;m beginning to like this story.</string>
<string name="6967">Uh-oh...</string>
<string name="6968">I think you need to die for that, kobold.</string>
<string name="6969">I think part of my soul just died...</string>
<string name="6970">&lt;StartAction&gt;[laugh!]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s pretty funny, Deekin.</string>
<string name="6971">&lt;StartAction&gt;[groan...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="6972">This is very gruesome, Deekin.</string>
<string name="6973">What&apos;s it about?</string>
<string name="6974">Tell me why you wanted your freedom from Tymofarrar.</string>
<string name="6975">Didn&apos;t you feel you owed Tymofarrar something?</string>
<string name="6976">And what way was that?</string>
<string name="6977">I don&apos;t understand what you mean.</string>
<string name="6978">You? A dragon? Ha ha ha!!</string>
<string name="6979">So are you happy you left?</string>
<string name="6980">Tymofarrar told you that?</string>
<string name="6981">But you were so scared of Tymofarrar coming after you.</string>
<string name="6982">But didn&apos;t you enjoy working for Tymofarrar?</string>
<string name="6983">I want to know how you became a bard, initially.</string>
<string name="6984">But why did he select you and not another kobold?</string>
<string name="6985">Why would a dragon teach a kobold anything?</string>
<string name="6986">You were supposed to be the next chief?! Hah!</string>
<string name="6987">Did Tymofarrar train all the chiefs like that?</string>
<string name="6988">So what happened?</string>
<string name="6989">Serves you right for not studying.</string>
<string name="6990">You poor creature! That must have been hard to take.</string>
<string name="6991">It must have been difficult keeping Tymofarrar happy.</string>
<string name="6992">Not many, I&apos;d imagine.</string>
<string name="6993">Didn&apos;t you want to be chief?</string>
<string name="6994">Why not?</string>
<string name="6995">That couldn&apos;t have gone well.</string>
<string name="6996">But you didn&apos;t die, obviously.</string>
<string name="6997">It still seems like an odd choice for a kobold.</string>
<string name="6998">Yes, but why did he teach you to be a bard?</string>
<string name="6999">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Reprimand Deekin.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7000">Well, I hope you learned a lesson.</string>
<string name="7001">Good enough. You&apos;re forgiven... for now.</string>
<string name="7002">Forget it! I&apos;m through with you!</string>
<string name="7003">Not good enough! &lt;StartAction&gt;[Reprimand him some more.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7004">No, not just yet.</string>
<string name="7005">Yes, come with me.</string>
<string name="7006">Never mind that, just fall in line.</string>
<string name="7007">You&apos;re just lucky I was able to turn you back.</string>
<string name="7008">You&apos;re certainly welcome.</string>
<string name="7009">Are you okay, Deekin?</string>
<string name="7010">If I were him, I would have just eaten you.</string>
<string name="7011">Tymofarrar used to paralyze you? How horrible!</string>
<string name="7012">I&apos;ll have to remember that trick.</string>
<string name="7013">We kill her. Quickly.</string>
<string name="7014">Close our eyes, that&apos;s what.</string>
<string name="7015">I don&apos;t really know, Deekin.</string>
<string name="7016">I&apos;m not sure, either.</string>
<string name="7017">Good question.</string>
<string name="7018">No. Just stay here for now, out of trouble.</string>
<string name="7019">Of course...</string>
<string name="7020">It couldn&apos;t have been that long.</string>
<string name="7021">A couple of days at most.</string>
<string name="7022">Maybe we can find something to help us before then.</string>
<string name="7023">Of course I&apos;m happy. Now I get to finally kill you!</string>
<string name="7024">Just how is it that I haven&apos;t seen you this entire trip?</string>
<string name="7025">No, the great hero is not happy to see Deekin at *all*.</string>
<string name="7026">Deekin? What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="7027">Forget it. I want you off this caravan... now!</string>
<string name="7028">Fine, then cook. And leave me alone.</string>
<string name="7029">Being a cook isn&apos;t being an adventurer.</string>
<string name="7030">You want to be an adventurer?</string>
<string name="7031">No. Not interested.</string>
<string name="7032">Sorry, Deekin. You&apos;ll have to find your own adventure.</string>
<string name="7033">But I don&apos;t want some annoying kobold with me!</string>
<string name="7034">You want to write my story, do you?</string>
<string name="7035">Alright. Come with me, then.</string>
<string name="7036">You want to travel with me? Can you fight?</string>
<string name="7037">Can you cast spells?</string>
<string name="7038">Can you at least carry stuff?</string>
<string name="7039">Forget it.</string>
<string name="7040">Right. Okay, you&apos;re in.</string>
<string name="7041">Quiet, Deekin. This isn&apos;t a good time.</string>
<string name="7042">Yes, Deekin? What is it?</string>
<string name="7043">It seems that way.</string>
<string name="7044">Don&apos;t turn coward now, kobold!</string>
<string name="7045">Why? Are you going to try something you&apos;ll regret?</string>
<string name="7046">Are you quite through, yet?</string>
<string name="7047">We&apos;re not going to die, Deekin.</string>
<string name="7048">Just make sure I get a copy of that epic tale.</string>
<string name="7049">Yes, well, you haven&apos;t been the worst companion, I suppose.</string>
<string name="7050">Thank you, Deekin. It&apos;s been an honor.</string>
<string name="7051">Don&apos;t be stupid. You&apos;ll die long before I fall.</string>
<string name="7052">Oh, I&apos;m not going anywhere, Deekin.</string>
<string name="7053">I&apos;m sure you can finish the story without me.</string>
<string name="7054">You&apos;ll get a chance to finish it, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="7055">Do you want to stay out of this fight, Deekin?</string>
<string name="7056">Don&apos;t think about it. You couldn&apos;t possibly understand.</string>
<string name="7057">Don&apos;t ask such stupid questions.</string>
<string name="7058">This is probably something completely different.</string>
<string name="7059">I don&apos;t intend on collecting anything.</string>
<string name="7060">Maybe. You seem to have paid more attention than I did.</string>
<string name="7061">The Tower of the Winds, right.</string>
<string name="7062">That&apos;s where Heurodis is, I suppose.</string>
<string name="7063">Stop that!</string>
<string name="7064">Gee. Thanks, Deekin.</string>
<string name="7065">You&apos;re not talking about the kind you smell again, are you?</string>
<string name="7066">With Netherese magic, anything could be possible.</string>
<string name="7067">Three Winds might just be what these things are called.</string>
<string name="7068">Deekin...</string>
<string name="7069">Stop bothering me with your prattle!</string>
<string name="7070">It&apos;s something Heurodis is doing, obviously.</string>
<string name="7071">Deekin...</string>
<string name="7072">Heurodis said that Undrentide would fly again...</string>
<string name="7073">I don&apos;t want to talk about it.</string>
<string name="7074">Why are you asking this, Deekin?</string>
<string name="7075">I really don&apos;t care what you write, Deekin.</string>
<string name="7076">Write that Drogan was a sentimental idiot who wasted his chance at power.</string>
<string name="7077">Write that he died nobly and that we won&apos;t let his sacrifice be in vain.</string>
<string name="7078">Write that Drogan died as he lived: a hero. He won&apos;t soon be forgotten.</string>
<string name="7079">Drogan was an old fool, that&apos;s what he was.</string>
<string name="7080">He saved us both, Deekin. Why? Is that so surprising?</string>
<string name="7081">He sacrificed himself for me. You just happened to be with me.</string>
<string name="7082">I could not care less, really.</string>
<string name="7083">Yes, I think he is.</string>
<string name="7084">He called it a mythallar, yes.</string>
<string name="7085">Keep your hands to yourself and don&apos;t get any ideas.</string>
<string name="7086">Someone either wants it or wants us not to have it.</string>
<string name="7087">Let them come. And don&apos;t get cowardly, now.</string>
<string name="7088">Actually, we&apos;re going to them.</string>
<string name="7089">It hasn&apos;t happened so far.</string>
<string name="7090">You&apos;ve got a point, there... I don&apos;t really want to be in danger.</string>
<string name="7091">Garrick seems to think the mythallar might be the key to victory, here.</string>
<string name="7092">You aren&apos;t thinking of backing out now, are you?</string>
<string name="7093">Bah! This is foolish talk!</string>
<string name="7094">Don&apos;t worry so much. I&apos;ll protect you.</string>
<string name="7095">Maybe a little. It&apos;s okay to be scared, Deekin.</string>
<string name="7096">No, I&apos;m not scared at all. There&apos;s no reason to be.</string>
<string name="7097">I&apos;d love to go back to Hilltop, but how?</string>
<string name="7098">And give up the rewards that may be waiting for me? Never!</string>
<string name="7099">No. We&apos;ve got to do what we can on our own.</string>
<string name="7100">I&apos;m not going to give the mythallar away! It could be useful!</string>
<string name="7101">Never you mind about that.</string>
<string name="7102">It may hold the secret to great magical power.</string>
<string name="7103">But Drogan is far away, and I&apos;ve no way to contact him.</string>
<string name="7104">We&apos;ve got far more important things to do, Deekin.</string>
<string name="7105">No, we can&apos;t do that.</string>
<string name="7106">That could take a long time.</string>
<string name="7107">Probably.</string>
<string name="7108">Why? What do you know about it?</string>
<string name="7109">Poisoned him?</string>
<string name="7110">You feel guilty? I find that a little surprising.</string>
<string name="7111">I don&apos;t really need to hear any whining from you.</string>
<string name="7112">Why do you think you never fit in, then?</string>
<string name="7113">Are you really all that different from the other kobolds?</string>
<string name="7114">I thought you wanted Tymofarrar dead?</string>
<string name="7115">How convenient.</string>
<string name="7116">I&apos;m not here to protect you, kobold.</string>
<string name="7117">No. Actually, in a strange way it helped us out.</string>
<string name="7118">Why do you even care?</string>
<string name="7119">Oh, yes, he was furious.</string>
<string name="7120">Why are you so interested?</string>
<string name="7121">So you know what it does?</string>
<string name="7122">Forget it. I&apos;ll find another use for it.</string>
<string name="7123">Go ahead, then. Make it into an amulet.</string>
<string name="7124">Can&apos;t you make it into something that would help me?</string>
<string name="7125">Make it into a dagger, then.</string>
<string name="7126">So this amulet would benefit you, right?</string>
<string name="7127">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Drogan gave it to me. What&apos;s it to you?</string>
<string name="7128">Because I never gave it back to him, that&apos;s why.</string>
<string name="7129">Just don&apos;t run during a fight and I&apos;ll be happy.</string>
<string name="7130">Well, we&apos;re safer together, aren&apos;t we?</string>
<string name="7131">If you&apos;re so free, why did you follow me?</string>
<string name="7132">Yes, I remember you blackmailing me into arranging that.</string>
<string name="7133">Well, you&apos;re free now.</string>
<string name="7134">Perhaps it&apos;s your imagination which makes you different.</string>
<string name="7135">It&apos;s good that you&apos;re worried, but Drogan came through it okay.</string>
<string name="7136">Well, it turned out Drogan recovered just fine, no thanks to you.</string>
<string name="7137">You&apos;re probably right.</string>
<string name="7138">I would have listened to you, Deekin.</string>
<string name="7139">You don&apos;t know that for sure.</string>
<string name="7140">Don&apos;t feel guilty. I didn&apos;t care about Drogan one way or the other.</string>
<string name="7141">What did I tell you about calling me that?</string>
<string name="7142">Well, don&apos;t. Now be quiet.</string>
<string name="7143">What do you want, then?</string>
<string name="7144">Never mind that, let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="7145">Yes, I brought you back... but you should stay here.</string>
<string name="7146">Keep this up and I won&apos;t bring you back at all!</string>
<string name="7147">Forget it. You&apos;re staying here.</string>
<string name="7148">Fine, you can come along.</string>
<string name="7149">Just try not to die next time.</string>
<string name="7150">What did the voice say to you?</string>
<string name="7151">No, stay here for now.</string>
<string name="7152">Yes, come along.</string>
<string name="7153">This is the statue with the crystal that was so important, right? We should get it back to Ayala as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="7154">Glad as I am, this is the closest I ever want to get to a dragon&apos;s tooth.</string>
<string name="7155">We&apos;ve got Mask&apos;s mask... er, the mask of Mask. Um... whatever it is, we&apos;ve got it!</string>
<string name="7156">We&apos;ve got the hand! Ugly little thing, but we&apos;ve got it!</string>
<string name="7157">Oh, this is not good. Dragons... we aren&apos;t suppose to fight dragons, are we?</string>
<string name="7158">Be careful in here. It seems unnaturally cold. I don&apos;t like this one bit.</string>
<string name="7159">These kobolds aren&apos;t fighters. Most seem deathly afraid of us.</string>
<string name="7160">Take careful steps in here. Kobolds are at their sneaky worst in tight quarters.</string>
<string name="7161">Looks like there&apos;s some human slaves here. I wonder where they came from.</string>
<string name="7162">The gnolls have kobolds caged up in here. Minion against minion. Their masters must really hate each other.</string>
<string name="7163">Why&apos;s this building still standing? Must be something important inside if it was spared.</string>
<string name="7164">This place looks worse than Hilltop. Keep lookout for gnolls still around.</string>
<string name="7165">Forest as far as you can see... or would want to. There&apos;s nothing for a thief to do among the trees.</string>
<string name="7166">Ah, good solid stone all around. You can&apos;t go wrong with stone.</string>
<string name="7167">No offence to their living kin but elven ghosts are not my idea of good company.</string>
<string name="7168">Our kobold attackers ambushed by gnolls? Can&apos;t say I&apos;m sad, but I&apos;d like to know why it happened.</string>
<string name="7169">This area shouldn&apos;t be so bare. Where has everyone gone?</string>
<string name="7170">A caravan? What is it doing here this soon after an attack?</string>
<string name="7171">Just what the place needs, a doomsayer to keep people fired up and scared. Feh!</string>
<string name="7172">Well isn&apos;t that grand. Soused-up on ale while the town falls around him.</string>
<string name="7173">Looks like the locals are about to try and take back the building. Good luck to them, I says.</string>
<string name="7174">Drogan&apos;s lab is downstairs. If he kept the artifacts anywhere, it would have been there. It&apos;s well-guarded, however... I&apos;ve never been able to sneak into it, so I wonder how they could have.</string>
<string name="7175">Another one? The ground is supposed to be solid beneath your feet. That&apos;s the one thing you should be able to count on in life. </string>
<string name="7176">That was a big tremor. Feels like everything shifted. A move like that back home would have been devastating.</string>
<string name="7177">That was the last one, right? Whew. Glad that&apos;s over with.</string>
<string name="7178">Five more to go. It is only five more, right? I&apos;d hate to find out otherwise.</string>
<string name="7179">Well... nine more to go, I guess. Shouldn&apos;t take too long... right?</string>
<string name="7180">What else is coming? We&apos;ve got to finish this soon and get out of here. Let&apos;s get to it!</string>
<string name="7181">This isn&apos;t good! No way this is good! You see that thing? What is that?!</string>
<string name="7182">I don&apos;t trust any of this. Stone that floats? It&apos;s just unnatural. Where are the pillars? The crossbeams?</string>
<string name="7183">This... is really strange. Lead on, but be careful, all right?</string>
<string name="7184">Doors upon doors. Feh! What twisted mind fills their house with doors like this? How do you get anywhere?</string>
<string name="7185">I see signs of traps all over this place. Don&apos;t know if they are supposed to hurt us or just wake the dead.</string>
<string name="7186">I&apos;m am not going to end up dead in this place. Not here. We have to beat that undead thing. We have to.</string>
<string name="7187">Nothing feels right in here. Even the air feels... dead.</string>
<string name="7188">I&apos;ve gotten lost in a good book before but... I&apos;m sorry, I just can&apos;t finish the joke. This is simply too weird.</string>
<string name="7189">Look! These books... can you imagine what they hold? That&apos;s where we&apos;ll find riches... in these pages!</string>
<string name="7190">I don&apos;t think anyone from our time is meant to be down here. This place was never meant for my kind.</string>
<string name="7191">Nothing feels right down here. It&apos;s like walking back in time.</string>
<string name="7192">This stone... even the earth under my feet... it feels ancient. Whoever built this place is thousands of years gone... I&apos;d hope.</string>
<string name="7193">Well... looks to me like the dig isn&apos;t going that well. The ruins are in... ah... ruins.</string>
<string name="7194">The followers of Ao... not that he wants followers, from what I hear. He&apos;s above that... or something. Nobody&apos;s got an answer out of him yet.</string>
<string name="7195">This looks more like a proper oasis now. No more dust storms here, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
<string name="7196">Is that who we&apos;re after? This undead... thing... looks like big trouble to me.</string>
<string name="7197">That statue... that&apos;s an image of Jergal, isn&apos;t it? This is a human god who was the supreme lord of death during the time of Netheril, if I remember correctly.</string>
<string name="7198">Might have been a nice bridge at one time... good stonecraft went into it. Not that I trust it now.</string>
<string name="7199">Not much in the way of prayer will be happening here. This place is desecrated and... undead taint it even more.</string>
<string name="7200">Not much of an oasis, is it? Looks bone dry to me.</string>
<string name="7201">Well, let&apos;s get ready for it! Zidan&apos;s in some kind of trap and we&apos;d better act fast to get him out!</string>
<string name="7202">More caves? I don&apos;t want to go much deeper. I hope we find Zidan soon.</string>
<string name="7203">Perfectly good cave of earth and stone infested with filthy stingers. What a waste.</string>
<string name="7204">That&apos;s one of their holes, isn&apos;t it? Those stinger creatures? Be careful around it.</string>
<string name="7205">All right, I suppose I can just keep poking around on my own. There&apos;s got to be something valuable here somewhere.</string>
<string name="7206">Good, I&apos;m glad to be moving. Let&apos;s figure out what our next move should be and get to it.</string>
<string name="7207">Very well, but there really isn&apos;t much to interest me around here.</string>
<string name="7208">Good. I want to get on to whatever our next task is supposed to be.</string>
<string name="7209">All right, but don&apos;t leave me here long. There&apos;s nothing I can do here. I&apos;m much more useful out on the road.</string>
<string name="7210">Good. I want to make use of the training I&apos;ve had here. We&apos;ll save the day and maybe pad our pockets a bit as well.</string>
<string name="7211">Let me know if you need anything, then.</string>
<string name="7212">Hmm... I don&apos;t like the sound of this, but if it&apos;s what you want, I guess I have to go along with it.</string>
<string name="7213">Good. Too much has happened for me to just sit around playing with pebbles. We&apos;ve work to do.</string>
<string name="7214">I don&apos;t want to be stuck here for too long, so do what you must and then hurry back.</string>
<string name="7215">Then I&apos;ll try and make my way back to Master Drogan&apos;s and see how things are going there. Not sure how I&apos;ll be able to help, but I can try.</string>
<string name="7216">Very well. This should take but a moment.</string>
<string name="7217">I&apos;m listening. What did you have in mind?</string>
<string name="7218">Very well. I&apos;ll act just how you&apos;ve asked. Just let me know if you want to change anything down the road.</string>
<string name="7219">Fair enough, we&apos;ll walk bold as boulders right through anyone we meet.</string>
<string name="7220">Ah, I see, a little skullduggery in the shadows. I&apos;ll stay out of sight as well as I can.</string>
<string name="7221">If that&apos;s what you want, all right, but don&apos;t use that as an excuse to leave perfectly good treasure behind.</string>
<string name="7222">Sure, I&apos;ll give it a try. That&apos;s what I&apos;m good at.</string>
<string name="7223">Sure, I don&apos;t want to crowd you. How far is good?</string>
<string name="7224">You&apos;ve got it. Anything else?</string>
<string name="7225">I&apos;ll jump right in whever I see anyone. Just so long as you&apos;re right behind me, all right?</string>
<string name="7226">Fair enough. I&apos;ll watch your back until you decide it&apos;s time to fight.</string>
<string name="7227">All right then, take a look in my pack and let me know what you think I should be using.</string>
<string name="7228">It&apos;s not exactly my specialty, but I suppose I know a bit more about magical lore than you do. Allow me to look through your equipment... if I can identify something you have, I&apos;ll let you know.</string>
<string name="7229">I suppose I can accomodate you, though the grace of Vergadain - Which spell do you want me to cast?</string>
<string name="7230">Is there anything else you want before we continue on our journey?</string>
<string name="7231">Right then. Let&apos;s get back at it.</string>
<string name="7232">I have that spell ready. Do you want me to cast it now?</string>
<string name="7233">I can do that. Who should I cast it on?</string>
<string name="7234">All right then. It won&apos;t take long.</string>
<string name="7235">If that&apos;s what you want. I suppose we were too busy with our training to get to know each other at Master Drogan&apos;s.</string>
<string name="7236">I&apos;m just fine, and I hope to stay that way. Keep on your toes.</string>
<string name="7237">Is there anything else you want to talk about, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="7238">It&apos;s not like the old relaxed days training under Master Drogan, but I think I&apos;m well enough under the circumstances.</string>
<string name="7239">Fine and ready for anything. Well, almost anything.</string>
<string name="7240">Fit and fine, which is surprising considering what we have to do.</string>
<string name="7241">I&apos;m all right. I just worry about all the important things we have left to do.</string>
<string name="7242">Well, my pockets are a little light, but other than that, I&apos;m fine.</string>
<string name="7243">Not a thing bothering me. Ready to take on whatever you want.</string>
<string name="7244">How am I? I can&apos;t see! If you can do anything, please help. I don&apos;t like this at all.</string>
<string name="7245">I&apos;m not too bad off, but I could still use a rest. A few pains here and there.</string>
<string name="7246">Not great. I&apos;m pretty beat up. I don&apos;t know how much help I can be if I don&apos;t get some rest.</string>
<string name="7247">How am I? I&apos;m barely able to walk! I feel like another hit or two would completely finish me off!</string>
<string name="7248">I&apos;m not good. It&apos;s poison, I think.</string>
<string name="7249">I don&apos;t feel well at all. Some sort of sickness... I feel nauseous.</string>
<string name="7250">Right now I am only focusing on training as a rogue.</string>
<string name="7251">I am currently only focusing on training as a cleric of Vergadain</string>
<string name="7252">If that&apos;s what you want, I&apos;ll do it. I suppose a broad base of abilities will help the most.</string>
<string name="7253">Yes, there&apos;s nothing like real experience on the road to progress your training. I am currently progressing as both a cleric of Vergadain as well as a rogue... in equal measure, more or less.</string>
<string name="7254">If that&apos;s what you want. Just let me know if you want me to change my focus. Whatever you decide, I&apos;m sure our adventures will be profitable.</string>
<string name="7255">Very well. I&apos;m sure my skills will come in handy once I have had some practice time.</string>
<string name="7256">Vergadain will be pleased, though I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be happy whichever of the two paths I follow.</string>
<string name="7257">I have my ring on me, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re wondering. Master Drogan said we weren&apos;t required to wear it constantly in order for its power to work, you know. Why do you ask?</string>
<string name="7258">I keep both the ring and my stash of focus crystals in a very safe spot. It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t trust you, &lt;FirstName&gt;... but I&apos;d really rather not discuss this any further. No offense.</string>
<string name="7259">Drogan showed you how to make more crystals in the lab inside his bedroom, didn&apos;t he? If you&apos;re short on focus crystals to power your ring, maybe we should consider going there.</string>
<string name="7260">I never told you my sister&apos;s name... or my clan name. Did you wonder about that?</string>
<string name="7261">Oh. So, when would be the right time? When we&apos;re stone dead on the steps of those &quot;bigger things?&quot; Why ask if you don&apos;t care?</string>
<string name="7262">Don&apos;t be ignorant, &lt;FullName&gt;, not now. There&apos;s too much going on for your little tantrum to matter.</string>
<string name="7263">Let&apos;s just get back to work, then. My little thoughts can go unsaid. You&apos;ve got your own troubles anyway. Hmph!</string>
<string name="7264">Yes, I guess I have been fairly open about all of this. It&apos;s strange to have it out and said. Talking has made things a lot clearer.</string>
<string name="7265">I suppose not, but it wasn&apos;t really my business to dump it on you, either. Talking has made things a lot clearer, though.</string>
<string name="7266">I just felt... well, we dwarves put so much importance on names, I really wanted you to understand what brought me here before I shared them.</string>
<string name="7267">And by &quot;here&quot; I mean with you and at Drogan&apos;s and all of it, not just inside an ancient Netheril city.</string>
<string name="7268">All right, all right. I suppose this has been like digging gems in shale. Lots of loose rock keeps burying any progress.</string>
<string name="7269">Heh... so have I, in a way. I make a pretty wishy washy dwarf, hmm? Been out of the mines too long.</string>
<string name="7270">But all that matters now is that we&apos;re sitting in a seat of ancient power, knocking on the door of a medusa, and I&apos;m wasting time with old grudges.</string>
<string name="7271">Perspective changes it all, I guess. My sister, she chose her life. My clan, they follow their hearts. Me, I follow the Trickster and try not to worry.</string>
<string name="7272">Dorna Trapspringer... it&apos;s not a bad name, but maybe I&apos;ll add a little. Dorna Trapspringer of the Stoneshear.</string>
<string name="7273">My sister Kiirna would have liked it, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="7274">You see? That should have bothered me, but given what we&apos;ve seen along our journey, it&apos;s so far beneath my notice I can&apos;t even see it.</string>
<string name="7275">And knowing what we have yet to face, I think you&apos;ll come to appreciate anything that keeps me in good spirits.</string>
<string name="7276">Come on then, &lt;FullName&gt;, let&apos;s see what this place has hidden.</string>
<string name="7277">It does, and I will. Knowing what we have yet to face, anything that keeps me in good spirits will serve to help us both, I think.</string>
<string name="7278">I am too. Knowing what we have yet to face, anything that gives me good cheer will serve to help us both.</string>
<string name="7279">You mean leaving the clan after my sister&apos;s death and erasure? I did for a while, but being out here isn&apos;t so bad. I think Vergadain likes me going far and wide.</string>
<string name="7280">The Dwarffather Moradin might not approve, but even so, he would not want to see me come to harm. I at least have faith in that.</string>
<string name="7281">No, I more regret the way my home left me. I have met many a dwarf that agreed our kind could move a little faster and still be only half as flighty as the elves.</string>
<string name="7282">Ah, but you rest your trust in transient things, like forests and plants and... I don&apos;t know, other green stuff.</string>
<string name="7283">Look, I&apos;m no expert on all things elven-ish, but you know the differences between us. Stone does not move without great pressure behind it.</string>
<string name="7284">And the stone &quot;is what it is,&quot; and yet we still carve it. The ore we dig &quot;is what it is,&quot; and yet we forge all manner of armor and weapons from it.</string>
<string name="7285">Would it be so bad if things were to change? Maybe just enough so that we don&apos;t feel shame when someone goes against the norm?</string>
<string name="7286">Maybe it was just my clan. I have met dwarves from other lands that did not seem so trapped by presumptions.</string>
<string name="7287">I just can&apos;t help feeling that someone should have done something to make things right. Why was nothing done?</string>
<string name="7288">Why can&apos;t you? Why can&apos;t someone else come up with the answers for once? Why is it up to me to keep swinging at the wall?</string>
<string name="7289">That&apos;s not fair. I tried. I really did. I just... couldn&apos;t fail anymore. Why is it my job to hammer at the wall?</string>
<string name="7290">I can&apos;t run away from it completely, I guess. I&apos;m as guilty as the rest of my clan. I&apos;m starting to see that now.</string>
<string name="7291">The elders were afraid to change, so they ignored what happened. I was afraid to try to change them and fail, so I just left.</string>
<string name="7292">I was as weak as they were.</string>
<string name="7293">Everybody has their own way, hmm? I&apos;d agree, but everything affects everyone else too. I don&apos;t know how to do the least damage.</string>
<string name="7294">I&apos;ve tried to leave everyone alone... aside from swindling the odd coin. I just feel like I left some things undone. Maybe I&apos;ll go back one day.</string>
<string name="7295">I suppose I did, though I don&apos;t like boats much anyway. Too prone to sinking when they get loaded full of baggage.</string>
<string name="7296">I&apos;d like to think so, but I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s fair anymore. What right did I have to force others out of their comfortable ruts?</string>
<string name="7297">I mean, we&apos;re good diggers and those are some nice ruts. It takes years to craft those. Everybody has the right to be in the place they want, right?</string>
<string name="7298">I don&apos;t know, maybe I should head back that way someday... assuming I survive our current trouble.</string>
<string name="7299">I just feel like I&apos;ve left some things unfinished, you know?</string>
<string name="7300">Yes I was... and I have. There&apos;s no cleansing wind like the truth, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I might as well say what has troubled me for so long.</string>
<string name="7301">See, my sister was young... and though she put on a brave face after being banished, I knew she couldn&apos;t last on her own.</string>
<string name="7302">She tried to join a group of adventurers and found mercenaries instead. Even then she couldn&apos;t make it, and the lot of them almost starved.</string>
<string name="7303">There was much of her that was strong like that. Stubborn to the point of foolishness. The elders had counted on her being weak. They were wrong.</string>
<string name="7304">Proud and stubborn. the elders hadn&apos;t counted on that. They wanted her to weaken, but she surprised us all.</string>
<string name="7305">She was supposed to realize what she had lost. Instead, I think she started to resent the clan. She must have got tired of being hungry and just snapped. </string>
<string name="7306">She told the group about lightly-guarded clan storehouses. I don&apos;t think they meant to hurt anyone... but you know how these things go.</string>
<string name="7307">Not enough to hurt the clan. Well, not beyond its pride, anyway. We were in no real danger but it was an embarrassment.</string>
<string name="7308">A few guards. Good people that put their lives before clan property. Two of the raiders were killed too. It jaded both sides.</string>
<string name="7309">Not long. They didn&apos;t know enough to properly cover their tracks. There was an attempt at a peaceful surrender, but there were too many bruised egos.</string>
<string name="7310">Pretty much what you would think. She had built up a lot of hatred and wouldn&apos;t surrender. In truth, our guards weren&apos;t very interested in taking her alive.</string>
<string name="7311">She fell with the rest of the raiders. As a traitor her name was stricken from the clan roster. It was like she had never existed.</string>
<string name="7312">It was exactly how I used to feel; like I didn&apos;t matter and could be overlooked if enough people agreed it was okay to look away.</string>
<string name="7313">Should blame be assigned at all? She did what she did, but the clan failed her. She paid for their mistakes.</string>
<string name="7314">Exactly. Their attempts to pressure her failed and pushed her farther away. She was punished for their failure.</string>
<string name="7315">Did she? What did she do? She was treated like dirt and responded. She refused to be molded. Was she to be punished because the clan failed her?</string>
<string name="7316">And what about me? I set the example. I was the one that said not to listen to the elders, if not by words then by deeds.</string>
<string name="7317">When she was simply erased to avoid embarrassment, that&apos;s when I had to leave. They learned nothing... because they didn&apos;t want to.</string>
<string name="7318">So I left. My clan, my family, my name... all of it. And here I am, a little voice for Vergadain far away from her home.</string>
<string name="7319">I wasn&apos;t running from a fight, I was running from a place where I didn&apos;t seem to matter. Maybe I just wanted to see what my sister saw.</string>
<string name="7320">I didn&apos;t think so. At least, not soon enough that it would feel like I did it for my sister. We move slow under the mountains.</string>
<string name="7321">I wandered for a while, then went to Drogan and asked him to teach me. And now I&apos;m on this foolish task with you. I think I&apos;ve done well for myself.</string>
<string name="7322">Speaking of our task, we should get back to it. Maybe we can talk more later. I don&apos;t know what else there is to say, though.</string>
<string name="7323">Yes, yes I was saying something about that. I&apos;m not sure I really want to get into it, though. I&apos;m not used to such personal talk.</string>
<string name="7324">What about you, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Why did you come to Drogan&apos;s? What is your story?</string>
<string name="7325">And you&apos;re a master of the obvious. I shouldn&apos;t burden you with my failings. A depressed dwarf... how pathetic is that? Very against type.</string>
<string name="7326">So you were looking for excitement? I was too. I thought I was. Maybe I just wanted to get away. Ah, could I be any more foolish?</string>
<string name="7327">So you are just a wandering hand that needed a place to stay? Sounds like my sister. I miss her. Look at me, could I be more foolish?</string>
<string name="7328">Our kind, we dwarves, are very tough on the outside... and on the inside too. All this reflection on feelings and past mistakes... that&apos;s an elf&apos;s job.</string>
<string name="7329">It&apos;s silly, really. Everything would be fine if I didn&apos;t let any of it bother me. Just swing the pick and live through the stone.</string>
<string name="7330">Why wasn&apos;t I content with that, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Why did I want to be Dorna Trapspringer? Why not Kingmason or Stoneshear?</string>
<string name="7331">Maybe I am, but so what? Don&apos;t I have a right to take what I can? Our lives are not lived for other people. At least, I always believed that.</string>
<string name="7332">I&apos;m going to have to think about this... I need a little time. Let&apos;s get back to work for now. I don&apos;t wnat to overshadow what we have to do.</string>
<string name="7333">It led to bad things. Is there a difference if the outcome is the same? I don&apos;t know. I shouldn&apos;t have to feel this way.</string>
<string name="7334">Your questions make me remember, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I&apos;m not sure I like that. I&apos;ve gone a long time without confronting where I came from.</string>
<string name="7335">Give me a little time. I don&apos;t want to talk about this right now. I don&apos;t want it to overshadow what we have to do.</string>
<string name="7336">Maybe, but I know it all and I don&apos;t understand myself. Bah, why do I get so worked up about this? I lived my life... is that so bad?</string>
<string name="7337">Was I? I suppose I was. It might be good to talk about it. It was kind of my fault what happened. Kind of.</string>
<string name="7338">I was the upstart that made the clan elders all huffy, and she wanted to be like me. She thought all it took was going against what they said.</string>
<string name="7339">She never wanted to cause any harm... it all just got blown out of proportion.</string>
<string name="7340">Her name? I&apos;ll get to that. I have to say a few other things first to make it clear what happened. It was such a little thing.</string>
<string name="7341">It&apos;s hard to accept that she was punished over so little a thing. It seems so pointless... so sad.</string>
<string name="7342">I am. Just give me time. It&apos;s hard to accept that she was punished over so little a thing. It seems so pointless.</string>
<string name="7343">I followed the spiritual path. Trickery too, but spiritual. She was all blades and glory. She wanted to follow our father into the elite guard.</string>
<string name="7344">There was no obvious sign that this should be tolerated, not like in my case, so the elders forbade it. She sought training anyway.</string>
<string name="7345">When it was discovered that she had &quot;defied what was best for her,&quot; she was banished for a time to learn what she had lost.</string>
<string name="7346">Perhaps, but not at the time. She made a life as an adventurer but there were unforeseen consequences.</string>
<string name="7347">She would have said the same thing. She managed as an adventurer for a while, but there were unforeseen consequences.</string>
<string name="7348">Much more. She made a life as an adventurer but... there were unforeseen consequences.</string>
<string name="7349">Suffice it to say that all did not go well and in the end I decided I felt better away from certain... influences. I hope you understand.</string>
<string name="7350">Maybe you&apos;re right, but that doesn&apos;t mean I want to run at the mouth for an hour. This isn&apos;t the most pleasant of memories.</string>
<string name="7351">I shouldn&apos;t be telling you anything really. We dwarves are not used to sharing. Maybe I&apos;ve been on the surface too long.</string>
<string name="7352">In any case, I&apos;m done talking for now. Maybe later.</string>
<string name="7353">Ah, I just need some time to figure it all out. I&apos;ve been avoiding this subject for quite a while now. Just give me a little time.</string>
<string name="7354">We&apos;ll talk again, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="7355">I didn&apos;t give it up, I&apos;ve just chosen not to use it for now. It was a very personal decision. I&apos;m not sure I could make you understand.</string>
<string name="7356">You see, dwarven surnames are granted by the clan elders. You must honor it or be stripped of it and exiled.</string>
<string name="7357">I couldn&apos;t abide by some of the decisions of the elders, so I have chosen to not associate with them. It was... not an easy thing to do.</string>
<string name="7358">What would you know of it? I can try and explain, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll want to cover it all at once. It was not a good time in my life.</string>
<string name="7359">I&apos;d have to tell you a bit about myself to really explain. I don&apos;t think I want to go into everything all at once. It was not a good time in my life.</string>
<string name="7360">See, I follow Vergadain, the Short Father, God of Wealth and Luck. It wasn&apos;t that long ago that females weren&apos;t allowed to be clerics in his service.</string>
<string name="7361">1358 DR saw a reordering of the gods and Vergadain began accepting us. Clan elders didn&apos;t like it, but they certainly couldn&apos;t say a god was wrong.</string>
<string name="7362">Most of the elders came to accept it over time, though there are those that shunned me from time to time. Nothing official, but it was evident.</string>
<string name="7363">Oh, I really couldn&apos;t care less about being accepted by those old rock-pushers. No, there were other things that bothered me.</string>
<string name="7364">I didn&apos;t care about their opinion at all. There were... other things that caused me to walk away.</string>
<string name="7365">See, my family suffered for my forward thinking. I had a sister and she... had some trouble because of me.</string>
<string name="7366">She didn&apos;t fare as well as I did. She was younger, you see, and she... well... maybe I should take a while to dig up what I really need to say.</string>
<string name="7367">This is not easy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Look, if you want to hear this, give me a bit of time. If not, just don&apos;t ask again. It&apos;s that simple.</string>
<string name="7368">It is. Thank you for your patience, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="7369">Then I am even less interested in telling you in a timely manner. Talk to me when you want to continue. If you don&apos;t, just keep walking.</string>
<string name="7370">As you know, being a dwarf yourself, dwarven surnames are granted by the clan elders. You must honor it or be stripped of it and exiled.</string>
<string name="7371">Oh, that&apos;s nothing special. I had heard his reputation for training and that he was accepting students. You don&apos;t leave your clan without preparation, you know.</string>
<string name="7372">That&apos;s not it at all. I don&apos;t expect you to understand. There were just some things that I couldn&apos;t support anymore.</string>
<string name="7373">I would have preferred to stay but... there were things I just couldn&apos;t support anymore. It&apos;s not something you will be able to understand.</string>
<string name="7374">This dwarf would and did. I don&apos;t expect you to understand, even if we are the same race. There were things I couldn&apos;t support any more.</string>
<string name="7375">I haven&apos;t really said I don&apos;t want to be a part of the clan, there are just a few things that have to get resolved before I go back.</string>
<string name="7376">It&apos;s not like that. My parents were very supportive of me. There were a few policies that I just couldn&apos;t agree with.</string>
<string name="7377">I wouldn&apos;t call it simple, no, but it had to be done. I didn&apos;t fit in with the way things were.</string>
<string name="7378">No, I left on my own accord. It was... well, it was just a matter of disagreeing with a few fundamental clan policies.</string>
<string name="7379">It might seem a strong reaction... you&apos;ll notice that my chosen surname of Trapspringer isn&apos;t a traditional dwarven name. It was just something I had to do.</string>
<string name="7380">Not to a dwarf, it isn&apos;t. I&apos;m not sure I can make you understand why I did this. Let&apos;s just get back to our job. We&apos;ve important work to do.</string>
<string name="7381">That&apos;s... my own business. I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m ready to talk about it. Besides, we&apos;ve got important things to do.</string>
<string name="7382">I suppose you think I was exiled and stripped of it. Well, no I wasn&apos;t. As hard as it is for you to understand, this was my choice.</string>
<string name="7383">I really don&apos;t feel like continuing this conversation right now. Could we leave it for now? We&apos;ve important work to do.</string>
<string name="7384">Talk to me some other time. Maybe I&apos;ll feel more like it then.</string>
<string name="7385">Well, all right, but don&apos;t keep me waiting too long. I want to help in this. </string>
<string name="7386">I&apos;m right behind you. We&apos;ll have this wrapped up in no time. Relatively speaking, I mean. There&apos;s a lot to do.</string>
<string name="7387">I welcome being able to move again. A medusa... how do you fight that? Could you feel anything while turned to stone? I thought I felt cold... if I thought at all.</string>
<string name="7388">Does that seem right to you? It was so frightening. Wait... what is this collar you&apos;re wearing?</string>
<string name="7389">Blast! I wish Master Drogan was here!</string>
<string name="7390">I thought you always had a plan. Maybe you needed Master Drogan more than you are willing to admit.</string>
<string name="7391">Will it? I&apos;d rather have him here in person. He had the skills to teach us; our abilities are just hand-me-downs.</string>
<string name="7392">I am, and I think we would be better off with Master Drogan here. He gave his life so we could get trapped? I don&apos;t think so!</string>
<string name="7393">I&apos;m sorry. It&apos;s just... we&apos;re in the most amazing city I&apos;ve ever seen and all we&apos;ve managed to do is get enslaved by the Asabi.</string>
<string name="7394">I should be studying this place... scoping out what we can pocket. Instead I&apos;m worrying like I&apos;m still in my first pair of boots.</string>
<string name="7395">I... of course, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I apologize. I just... miss Master Drogan so. The pain is still so fresh. But we have much to do, don&apos;t we?</string>
<string name="7396">No, that wouldn&apos;t help. Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m not going to start bawling. I just wanted some time to mourn, but I guess it has to wait.</string>
<string name="7397">I know. I just want time to mourn Master Drogan, that&apos;s all. It shouldn&apos;t have to wait, but I guess it has to.</string>
<string name="7398">I&apos;m ready. Just tell me what to do. We&apos;ll make it... I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="7399">If you want to scout around, go ahead. I can wait here for a bit. It&apos;s not like there&apos;s a shortage of things to look at... or appraise.</string>
<string name="7400">I&apos;m right behind you. Keep on your toes... for danger and treasure both.</string>
<string name="7401">And... thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, for saving me. Truly, I appreciate it.</string>
<string name="7402">Just because I want to see the place doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;ll be distracted by it. Look, if you want me along, great. I don&apos;t really care one way or the other.</string>
<string name="7403">More like an interest in this particular period. The Netherese disappeared so completely and suddenly, and it&apos;s still a mystery as to why.</string>
<string name="7404">Make no mistake, however. It&apos;s a passing interest and nothing I&apos;ve dedicated myself to. This is human history we&apos;re talking about, after all.</string>
<string name="7405">Still, it might be useful if we travel together. Whatever you find out here in this desert is bound to be as dangerous as it is intriguing.</string>
<string name="7406">You too. Perhaps we should stick together... this seems a dangerous place.</string>
<string name="7407">As you will.  If you change your mind, I shouldn&apos;t be far off.</string>
<string name="7408">I agree.  Stay alert... I smell trouble ahead.</string>
<string name="7409">If you&apos;re here to help Master Drogan, you&apos;ll need to get underway as soon as possible. Do you need my help?</string>
<string name="7410">You&apos;re only one &lt;man/woman&gt;. Would it hurt to have someone to watch your back? Come on, take me. I want to use what I&apos;ve been taught.</string>
<string name="7411">Well, you know me... if you need sharp eyes to watch for ambushes, or a nasty trap dealt with, I&apos;m your girl.  What do you say?</string>
<string name="7412">Well, I&apos;ll be here once you&apos;ve made up your mind.</string>
<string name="7413">Great! We&apos;ll have Master Drogan&apos;s artifacts back in no time... and maybe pick up a coin or two for ourselves along the way. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="7414">There&apos;s no need to be like that. I&apos;ll just wait until you think you&apos;re ready. Yeesh.</string>
<string name="7415">I suppose it can, but we should talk about a few things when there is time.</string>
<string name="7416">The farm... it seems familiar. Maybe from overhearing Master Drogan and one of his visitors.</string>
<string name="7417">Of course, you know all about it now, having talked with that Nathan Hurst character. The less said about him, I think, the better.</string>
<string name="7418">Of course, what is one dwarf&apos;s opinion when a man has powerful friends? I don&apos;t care who he knows, Hurst is what he is and that&apos;s all I&apos;ll say.</string>
<string name="7419">Let&apos;s just get moving.</string>
<string name="7420">My tone and words both. I don&apos;t care who he knows, Hurst is what he is. Ah, I&apos;ve already given him too much attention.</string>
<string name="7421">Hurst! Nathan Hurst. That&apos;s who lives there. I heard him and Master Drogan discussing something... he described how to get here in good detail.</string>
<string name="7422">A dwarf knows how to interpret directions and the lay of the land. This has to be the place.</string>
<string name="7423">I remembered it because of what he is, not because of what he said. Duergar. A deep-dwelling duergar out of his proper place.</string>
<string name="7424">He is no dwarf. Duergar. A deep-dwelling duergar out of his proper place. Be careful near him.</string>
<string name="7425">They are the darker side of a history we would like to forget. Twisted by illithids they long ago became something evil... not to be trusted.</string>
<string name="7426">They live deep underground with the most foul of neighbors. Don&apos;t trust him, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you&apos;ll regret it.</string>
<string name="7427">Not as such, but it doesn&apos;t hurt to be on guard. His kind are naturally driven to evil. I didn&apos;t say to torch his farm, just that you should be careful.</string>
<string name="7428">It&apos;s just a matter of fact that his kind are driven to the darker things in life. I didn&apos;t say we should torch his farm, just that you should be careful.</string>
<string name="7429">I&apos;m glad. He&apos;s probably no threat, but we don&apos;t know what he&apos;s capable of. Just be careful, that&apos;s all I&apos;m saying.</string>
<string name="7430">He doesn&apos;t have to be *all* bad to hurt our mission. Just be careful, that&apos;s all I&apos;m saying.</string>
<string name="7431">Well, I was concerned a dragon wouldn&apos;t be enough trouble for us. Heh, it seems we are caught between some powerful players.</string>
<string name="7432">Both J&apos;Nah and Tymofarrar seem willing to go to any lengths to get Master Drogan&apos;s artifacts. I wish I knew what was really going on.</string>
<string name="7433">Oh, I&apos;m sure it all looks so neat and tidy when it&apos;s printed up in your journal. All the possible paths clearly laid out, hmm?</string>
<string name="7434">Well, lead on, then. I won&apos;t give a thought to the little things, like why such powerful creatures are interested in that whelp Deekin and his statue.</string>
<string name="7435">Just don&apos;t blame me if we run into more than we can handle. Dragons, artifacts, a dodgy sorceress... what&apos;s next?</string>
<string name="7436">Do we know who we are taking it from, or why? What do these powerful creatures want with that little Deekin fool and his statue?</string>
<string name="7437">Good. This J&apos;Nah wasn&apos;t telling us everything, that&apos;s for sure. I wonder why there&apos;s so much more interest in that Deekin creature&apos;s statue?</string>
<string name="7438">I don&apos;t like the thought that there&apos;s someone even further above us involved. Like that &quot;mistress&quot; we overheard J&apos;Nah speaking to.</string>
<string name="7439">Hey, I didn&apos;t say I was going anywhere. I just want to be careful. We have to find what we need and get home in one piece, right? Let&apos;s get going.</string>
<string name="7440">I&apos;ll follow, but the only thing that will stop me from worrying is finding what we need and getting back home.</string>
<string name="7441">It better serve a purpose or I&apos;m losing sleep for nothing. Let&apos;s just find what we need and try to get home in one piece.</string>
<string name="7442">I don&apos;t know that we can trust what this kobold said, no matter how smart or different he seems. His kind are usually pawns of greater evils.</string>
<string name="7443">Ah, so you view all your companions with equal suspicion, is that it? Does that apply to me as well? Do you trust me no further than this Deekin?</string>
<string name="7444">I suppose it doesn&apos;t really matter either way. I&apos;m just here to support you. Just remember that I&apos;ve an interest in the outcome of this little adventure as well.</string>
<string name="7445">Even if he was being honest, does he really understand what he&apos;s talking about? He could lead you into a trap without knowing the danger.</string>
<string name="7446">He talked of dragons as well. They don&apos;t give up their trinkets easily.</string>
<string name="7447">I don&apos;t know. I suppose we can follow his lead for a time, but don&apos;t let your guard down. He talked of dragons, and they don&apos;t give up their trinkets easily.</string>
<string name="7448">That&apos;s called intelligence, you fool. It&apos;s a *dragon*! What else is there to fear if you don&apos;t fear giant, toothy, manipulating lizards?</string>
<string name="7449">That&apos;s easy enough to guess. Anyone it couldn&apos;t buy it would simply threaten. Not a lot of people can say &quot;no&quot; to a giant lizard. Not and live, anyway.</string>
<string name="7450">Well... no, but I&apos;ve heard a few tales. I suppose my sources really aren&apos;t any more reliable than this creature. Still, this worries me.</string>
<string name="7451">Why would this thing even be interested in the artifacts? I don&apos;t suppose there&apos;s any way to verify what this Deekin said.</string>
<string name="7452">We&apos;ll have to move forward and trust we can handle what comes. I doubt Master Drogan thought we would be facing such creatures so early in our training.</string>
<string name="7453">The crypt... even just inside you can smell the death in the air. I suppose that&apos;s appropriate but I&apos;d still rather do without the memory of it.</string>
<string name="7454">Of course, if we get rich off the place, I&apos;ll still manage to sleep at night.</string>
<string name="7455">Whoa, slow down. I&apos;m not interested in gutting the place. I juts figure that any gold or gems are better off with me. It&apos;s an Elven crypt, after all.</string>
<string name="7456">What does it hurt? It won&apos;t slow us down that much. Besides, any gold or gems are better off with me. It&apos;s an Elven crypt, after all.</string>
<string name="7457">I wouldn&apos;t take everything, but if you are talking about gold and gems, I&apos;m sure they are better off with me. It&apos;s an Elven crypt, after all.</string>
<string name="7458">Not as such, and I&apos;ve no interest in whatever fanciful cloaks are draped over their dead, but mined valuables belong with dwarves.</string>
<string name="7459">Consider it my way of keeping the Elves consistent. Elves don&apos;t dig. They excavate, sure, but they don&apos;t dig.</string>
<string name="7460">It just seems to me that Elves shouldn&apos;t put these things back in the ground if they didn&apos;t take them out in the first place.</string>
<string name="7461">Now just a minute, I haven&apos;t done anything yet. I just think burying &quot;wealthy dead&quot; is a waste of good gold.</string>
<string name="7462">There are far worse things to do to a burial site than taking excess gold. I&apos;d hope the dead would understand that.</string>
<string name="7463">Come on, let&apos;s just get on with our task at hand.</string>
<string name="7464">I don&apos;t mean any offense. It just seems to me that Elves shouldn&apos;t put these things back in the ground if they didn&apos;t take them out in the first place.</string>
<string name="7465">I&apos;m not looking for trouble. I&apos;ll keep to myself and let you lead. It just seems like a waste to me.</string>
<string name="7466">Well, think about it. I don&apos;t care if they drape their dead in fanciful cloaks or wood-carved whatever, but mined valuables belong with dwarves.</string>
<string name="7467">I just had a flash of memory as we entered Hilltop... it&apos;s a lot different now, that&apos;s for sure. Kobolds everywhere. Must have been a big fight.</string>
<string name="7468">Fine, I&apos;ll shut up, but you should spend a little time looking around, &lt;FullName&gt;. It&apos;s important to remember things like this.</string>
<string name="7469">I like a good dust-up as much as anyone but this wasn&apos;t a fair fight, and neither was the one back at the school.</string>
<string name="7470">I don&apos;t think the people had much of a choice. They may have been on their home turf but I doubt they had Master Drogan&apos;s skill to draw on.</string>
<string name="7471">Nothing they could do but pick up a shovel and hope for the best. Looks like they did all right. Well... relatively. People still died.</string>
<string name="7472">That&apos;s a bit cold to say. I mean, you&apos;re right that they could have been better trained, but this really isn&apos;t the time to say it.</string>
<string name="7473">You won&apos;t make any friends if you lecture while people are down. It all rolls off of me, but I doubt others will be so understanding.</string>
<string name="7474">Good idea. With this many attacking there&apos;d have to be some hiding somewhere. We&apos;ll get our share, I don&apos;t doubt it.</string>
<string name="7475">Things aren&apos;t that grim yet. Master Drogan could still pull through if we get back the stolen artifacts. Get mad, sure, but stay on track too.</string>
<string name="7476">Let&apos;s scout around a bit more. We&apos;ll fight through a few stragglers and pick up a few coins, all while looking like heroes to the locals.</string>
<string name="7477">Come on, let&apos;s get moving. We&apos;ve a lot left to do.</string>
<string name="7478">Of course not, but padding my pocket while helping out doesn&apos;t hurt anyone in the least.</string>
<string name="7479">Well, it&apos;s just that this is a big thing. We&apos;re leaving everything behind to find these kobolds and artifacts we didn&apos;t even know about.</string>
<string name="7480">I don&apos;t even know where to start. All I can think about is Master Drogan... lying there.</string>
<string name="7481">You may be able to just shut everything out, but I can&apos;t. Where I&apos;m from, when someone is hurt you make the guilty pay for it.</string>
<string name="7482">So I&apos;ll shut up for now, but you just remember that Master Drogan needs us and we need him. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="7483">Sure, you&apos;ve progressed farther than all of us so you&apos;re not worried at all. I have a couple doubts, I guess, but I trained hard too.</string>
<string name="7484">That&apos;s what I was thinking, but I&apos;m not going to let it get me down if you don&apos;t. He trained us well. I can do things I never thought possible.</string>
<string name="7485">Master Drogan has always been a good teacher. I owe it to him to try my best to help him.</string>
<string name="7486">You know, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I was thinking a little about that myself. I&apos;m not above pocketing a few coins here and there. Just so long as we get the job done.</string>
<string name="7487">It will be interesting to see these things. I bet they are impressive. I won&apos;t let them distract me too much, though. I&apos;ll be looking for the odd coin, I think.</string>
<string name="7488">Well, don&apos;t forget that we&apos;ll be on our own soon and need to think about ourselves too. The odd coin here and there could fall our way.</string>
<string name="7489">That&apos;s the way of Vergadain. A little luck, a little skill, and a little bit of something for yourself in your pocket at the end of the day. </string>
<string name="7490">We&apos;ve talked enough, I think. The sooner we head out, the sooner Master Drogan is better and we can count up the spoils. Let&apos;s go!</string>
<string name="7491">So... this is it. Heurodis is just ahead.</string>
<string name="7492">Very. To come all this way... through all of this. She has to pay for everything. Coin for coin... everything. I&apos;ll see to it.</string>
<string name="7493">Is it? I hadn&apos;t noticed. It&apos;s seemed kind of muddy up until now. I guess I&apos;m ready. She&apos;s got a lot to answer for.</string>
<string name="7494">No, I&apos;m well past that. This creature has taken a lot from me. I think it&apos;s time I took something back.</string>
<string name="7495">I&apos;m right behind you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Just give me a fair shot at her. I want her last sight to be me rifling through her pockets.</string>
<string name="7496">It&apos;s so frustrating. This creature... Heurodis, we don&apos;t even know if we can survive fighting her but we have to jump through hoops to even try.</string>
<string name="7497">Find the Three Winds... it&apos;s always something, you know?</string>
<string name="7498">I never said I would either. Not that I wouldn&apos;t mind returing to some simpler concerns. Take some simple gold coins? Oh no, I have to defeat a medusa in an ancient floating city. Bah!</string>
<string name="7499">Is that so bad? I get tired of these big concerns being dumped on us all the time. Take some simple gold coins? Oh no, I have to defeat a medusa in an ancient floating city. Bah!</string>
<string name="7500">Where would I go? Besides, all I meant was that I miss having small concerns. Take some simple gold coins? Oh no, I have to defeat a medusa in an ancient floating city. Bah!</string>
<string name="7501">I guess Master Drogan trained us to look for this sort of trouble. His skills would be wasted on the petty thief I used to be.</string>
<string name="7502">Fine, fine, whatever you want. We have to find the Three Winds to enter Temple of the Winds and defeat Heurodis. That sums it up, all nice and neat.</string>
<string name="7503">I&apos;ll try to be all business, like you want.</string>
<string name="7504">He prepared us for it anyway, knowing or not. I never knew what he saw in any of us, really. I guess I was just scared of seeing it too.</string>
<string name="7505">And here we are... wherever that is. Are you ready to go on?</string>
<string name="7506">I think we always do. Me, I choose to keep going... and keep an eye out for valuables along the way.</string>
<string name="7507">Even this high up, it&apos;s important to stay grounded, you know.</string>
<string name="7508">Me too. We&apos;ll find what we need, and maybe a few valuables along the way as well, heh?</string>
<string name="7509">Anything is possible, though I&apos;d hope that if I could see the future, I&apos;d do a better job of avoiding my own death. I don&apos;t think he knew.</string>
<string name="7510">That tremor... there&apos;s no fooling a dwarf, the whole place is moving. There&apos;s not a calm spot in this whole city.</string>
<string name="7511">It&apos;s weird, though. Is it on the verge of collapsing or... something else? It seems impossible... doesn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="7512">We may be moving, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Heurodis is tapping the ancient Netheril magic that once floated whole cities. What if she is trying to raise this one out of the ground? What if this city is trying to fly again?</string>
<string name="7513">This is scaring me. I can&apos;t even imagine the forces needed to move a city. It should shake itself apart. It still could.</string>
<string name="7514">We have to find out what is going on. We may already be too late.</string>
<string name="7515">Master Drogan is... really gone. There&apos;s no way he could have... no way. &lt;FirstName&gt;, I... don&apos;t know if I want to do this anymore.</string>
<string name="7516">It wasn&apos;t long ago I was just a student. Now we&apos;re trapped here... and the only real teacher I ever had is dead.</string>
<string name="7517">&quot;Move on?&quot; That&apos;s your answer? Just pick up and walk away from the death of the most important figure in my life? And here I thought he might mean something to you, as well.</string>
<string name="7518">Nice. Real nice. I hope I never get as cold as you. I won&apos;t let this affect me like that. I won&apos;t let it.</string>
<string name="7519">Let&apos;s get going, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Master Drogan gave us a chance to do something. Don&apos;t waste it.</string>
<string name="7520">And who decides that? Who has the right to say that his time had come? It&apos;s not right, I tell you, it&apos;s not right!</string>
<string name="7521">I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It upsets me... more than perhaps it should. In this my faith fails me.</string>
<string name="7522">He wouldn&apos;t want to be dead, either. We don&apos;t always get what we want, I guess.</string>
<string name="7523">He was more skilled than either of us, &lt;FirstName&gt;. What hope have we got without him? His direction got us this far.</string>
<string name="7524">I suppose he did, and I wouldn&apos;t want to disappoint him. I suppose you think he would want us to continue in his memory?</string>
<string name="7525">Vergadain is the Laughing Dwarf, the Short Father. His teachings are about the joy of negotiation and trickery. Of luck in the face of great odds.</string>
<string name="7526">I don&apos;t think even he would have liked our chances. Master Drogan isn&apos;t with him. Master Drogan will be with Dumathoin, the Silent Keeper, the guardian of the dead.</string>
<string name="7527">That is little comfort to me. I don&apos;t much care for honoring the dead. I would rather honor people while they live.</string>
<string name="7528">I suppose. There is nothing to gain by sitting down to die. Vergadain would hardly approve of that.</string>
<string name="7529">Very well, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I will follow as I always do... and try to find some meaning in this.</string>
<string name="7530">As for you, Master Drogan... you were more than a mere teacher to me. You were a mentor and a father. I am grateful for your sacrifice and shall mourn your passing always.</string>
<string name="7531">Now you are return to the old stones once again. Go in peace, Drogan. Your duty is done. We shall fight on for you. Amen.</string>
<string name="7532">Yes, I&apos;m finished. For now.</string>
<string name="7533">Let&apos;s go, then, and finish this. May the gods watch over Drogan and all of us who yet live.</string>
<string name="7534">Who&apos;d have thought that this little crystal would be such a big deal? And that little Deekin creature had it for so long.</string>
<string name="7535">Can you imagine anything more dangerous? From what Garrick said, this thing could kill hundreds.</string>
<string name="7536">I&apos;m not sure whose hands could handle it. The only use it has right now is killing whoever uses it to destroy J&apos;Nah&apos;s mistress..</string>
<string name="7537">Other than sacrificing someone while delivering it, you mean? I hope so. It has to have a better use than that.</string>
<string name="7538">You mean J&apos;Nah&apos;s mistress and whoever is foolish enough to deliver the surprise. I hope it doesn&apos;t come to that.</string>
<string name="7539">We have to find out what it&apos;s actually good for. Heck, we&apos;ve got to find out who we&apos;re really supposed to use it against. We barely know who our enemy is.</string>
<string name="7540">Given the age of the ancient ruin... what else is waiting for us?</string>
<string name="7541">Oh ha ha, make a game of it. Look, I don&apos;t think I&apos;m being ureasonable. I just want to know that we have a chance of coming out of this alive.</string>
<string name="7542">There&apos;s nothing wrong with turning a situation to profit, but I&apos;m starting to think I&apos;ll be glad just getting out of this with my life.</string>
<string name="7543">Well, we&apos;ve got a lot of baggage to carry around now. Let&apos;s try and get done what needs to be done.</string>
<string name="7544">It just seems so strange that Master Drogan asked us to do this for him, to find out what this crystal is. He is doing much better, after all.</string>
<string name="7545">Or perhaps I&apos;m just having trouble adjusting to this confidence he&apos;s showing. I&apos;m used to being a student.</string>
<string name="7546">I guess not. It&apos;s just weird moving from one role to another. I always thought I&apos;d spend my first days away from Master Drogan tricking the locals out of their gold.</string>
<string name="7547">Nothing too devastating, of course, just a little misdirection for a coin or two, but it seemed like such a big deal at the time. Now... look at us.</string>
<string name="7548">I suppose, but with everything happening so fast, I guess he didn&apos;t get to the part where he tells me that instead of just you. Ah, I&apos;m just kidding.</string>
<string name="7549">Let&apos;s get back at it, I guess. We&apos;ve got a lot to do yet.</string>
<string name="7550">Heh, I suppose we do. All right then, let&apos;s get back to work. Master Drogan wouldn&apos;t want us laying about.</string>
<string name="7551">All right, I&apos;ll be quiet. Maybe that&apos;s best. I was getting positively elvish there for a second.</string>
<string name="7552">It is exhilarating, I&apos;ll give it that. Definitely not the career I was planning... if I ever had a plan beyond tricking the locals out of their gold.</string>
<string name="7553">Oh, I&apos;m capable. I wouldn&apos;t have lived this long if I wasn&apos;t, but if empty bravado is all you want, maybe you should have brought Xanos. </string>
<string name="7554">Come on, let&apos;s get going. We&apos;ve got to find out what this crystal can do.</string>
<string name="7555">You don&apos;t need to be so harsh, but I suppose I should spend some time going over what happened. I&apos;ll wait here until you&apos;re ready to have me back.</string>
<string name="7556">That is probably best. I don&apos;t want to rush back out or I&apos;ll be just end up chewing the dirt again.</string>
<string name="7557">I&apos;ll come, but you don&apos;t need to be like that. I ended up here because I was following you, remember.</string>
<string name="7558">Well, let&apos;s not worry about whose fault it was. I&apos;ll just be careful not to make a habit of doing it. It&apos;s... unsettling.</string>
<string name="7559">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;Dorna is currently unconscious and will likely die if he is not given aid very soon.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7560">This is not a good time to speak.</string>
<string name="7561">No, stay here for now.</string>
<string name="7562">Yes, come with me.</string>
<string name="7563">Just wait here a while longer.</string>
<string name="7564">Yes, come with me.</string>
<string name="7565">No, never mind.</string>
<string name="7566">Yes, come with me.</string>
<string name="7567">Never mind.</string>
<string name="7568">I think we need to part ways.</string>
<string name="7569">All right, stay with me, then.</string>
<string name="7570">Just stay here for the moment.</string>
<string name="7571">Yes, you should go for now.</string>
<string name="7572">I&apos;d like you to level up.</string>
<string name="7573">I want to change your tactics.</string>
<string name="7574">I don&apos;t want to change anything else right now.</string>
<string name="7575">I want to move faster and not bother with stealth or searching.</string>
<string name="7576">I need you to be stealthy right now.</string>
<string name="7577">Don&apos;t help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.</string>
<string name="7578">Help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.</string>
<string name="7579">I want to change the distance you stay away from me.</string>
<string name="7580">Stay a long distance away from me.</string>
<string name="7581">Keep a medium distance.</string>
<string name="7582">Stay close.</string>
<string name="7583">Go ahead and attack as soon as you see enemies.</string>
<string name="7584">Defend me and don&apos;t attack until I do.</string>
<string name="7585">I want to adjust your equipment.</string>
<string name="7586">Can you identify my equipment?</string>
<string name="7587">I need you to cast a spell.</string>

<string name="7642">Create Greater Undead.</string>
<string name="7643">Continual Flame.</string>
<string name="7644">Clarity.</string>
<string name="7645">Cat&apos;s Grace.</string>
<string name="7646">Bull&apos;s Strength.</string>
<string name="7647">I&apos;ve changed my mind.</string>
<string name="7648">Cast it on my animal companion.</string>
<string name="7649">Cast it on my familiar.</string>
<string name="7650">Cast it on me.</string>
<string name="7651">Cast it on yourself.</string>
<string name="7652">Bless.</string>
<string name="7653">Animate Dead.</string>
<string name="7654">Aid.</string>
<string name="7655">What was it you wanted to say earlier?</string>
<string name="7656">Let&apos;s stop and talk for a moment.</string>
<string name="7657">I think that&apos;s enough talking for now.</string>
<string name="7658">How are you right now?</string>
<string name="7659">I want to discuss your training.</string>
<string name="7660">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Dorna will gain levels as both a cleric and a rogue.]&lt;/Start&gt; Split your training between cleric and rogue. </string>
<string name="7661">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Dorna will gain levels as both a cleric and a rogue.]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s fine, continue as you are. </string>
<string name="7662">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Dorna will only gain levels as a rogue.]&lt;/Start&gt; Concentrate on rogue training only. </string>
<string name="7663">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Dorna will only gain levels as a cleric.]&lt;/Start&gt; I want to you concentrate on your cleric training only. </string>
<string name="7664">Where is your ring? The one Drogan gave us?</string>
<string name="7665">And where do you keep it?</string>
<string name="7666">There&apos;s no need to be suspicious of me.</string>
<string name="7667">You look troubled. Not that the situation doesn&apos;t call for it.</string>
<string name="7668">I don&apos;t care. There&apos;s far bigger things to worry about.</string>
<string name="7669">I figured you would offer eventually.</string>
<string name="7670">It wasn&apos;t my business to press the subject.</string>
<string name="7671">Then get on with what you need to say.</string>
<string name="7672">I have tried to see your side of things.</string>
<string name="7673">Seems like pointless dramatics to me. You&apos;re good at that.</string>
<string name="7674">A small change, but if it makes you happy, go ahead. </string>
<string name="7675">It sounds fine. I&apos;m glad you found peace with it.</string>
<string name="7676">Do you regret the way you left your home?</string>
<string name="7677">Ah, you just want too much.</string>
<string name="7678">It is too bad you couldn&apos;t find what you wanted there.</string>
<string name="7679">We are flighty? We outlive you.</string>
<string name="7680">I wouldn&apos;t go too far. We are who we are.</string>
<string name="7681">I don&apos;t think I can answer that for you.</string>
<string name="7682">Ask yourself, you&apos;re the one that ran away.</string>
<string name="7683">You left for your own well being. No harm in that.</string>
<string name="7684">You paid the price for rocking the boat.</string>
<string name="7685">They were the worse offenders.</string>
<string name="7686">You were deciding what to say about your sister.</string>
<string name="7687">I&apos;d starve too rather than come crawling back.</string>
<string name="7688">And she was too proud to ask for help?</string>
<string name="7689">How much did they get away with?</string>
<string name="7690">Who got hurt?</string>
<string name="7691">How long before they were caught?</string>
<string name="7692">What happened to your sister?</string>
<string name="7693">So who was responsible for this?</string>
<string name="7694">Hardly a victory for the clan.</string>
<string name="7695">She got what she deserved.</string>
<string name="7696">You just ran away like a coward?</string>
<string name="7697">There was nothing else you could do?</string>
<string name="7698">You were saying that your sister became an adventurer.</string>
<string name="7699">You&apos;re dodging the question.</string>
<string name="7700">I wanted adventure.</string>
<string name="7701">Nowhere else to go, really.</string>
<string name="7702">You&apos;re too needy. Always wanting more.</string>
<string name="7703">Was what you wanted all that bad?</string>
<string name="7704">Maybe if you finished your story I would understand better.</string>
<string name="7705">You were about to tell me about your sister.</string>
<string name="7706">What was her name?</string>
<string name="7707">I&apos;m listening.</string>
<string name="7708">Get to the point.</string>
<string name="7709">This is little different than you training with Drogan.</string>
<string name="7710">So she was kicked out. So what?</string>
<string name="7711">I assume there is more to it than that?</string>
<string name="7712">You wouldn&apos;t have said anything if you didn&apos;t want to talk.</string>
<string name="7713">If that&apos;s all you want to say, that&apos;s your choice.</string>
<string name="7714">You said you gave up your name. Why?</string>
<string name="7715">Some piddling overblown disagreement, probably.</string>
<string name="7716">What happened to cause you to do this?</string>
<string name="7717">I understand your anger at not being accepted.</string>
<string name="7718">Is that it? They lost; why let their opinion bother you?</string>
<string name="7719">Bah! A waste of my time.</string>
<string name="7720">If that is what you want.</string>
<string name="7721">Take your time. I&apos;m only mildly interested anyway.</string>
<string name="7722">Tell me about yourself. What led you to Drogan?</string>
<string name="7723">So the spoiled little dwarf was looking for adventure. How novel.</string>
<string name="7724">Bored with the traditional life, hmm?</string>
<string name="7725">You left your clan? A dwarf wouldn&apos;t do that.</string>
<string name="7726">Ran away from your oppressive parents, hmm?</string>
<string name="7727">So you simply left? </string>
<string name="7728">Sounds like you&apos;re a criminal on the run.</string>
<string name="7729">Still sounds like a token gesture.</string>
<string name="7730">What happened that made you feel this way?</string>
<string name="7731">No dwarf willfully gives up her name.</string>
<string name="7732">No, not just yet.</string>
<string name="7733">Yes, come with me.</string>
<string name="7734">It&apos;s a slave collar. A &quot;gift&quot; from the Asabi that rescued us.</string>
<string name="7735">Quit whining. We need to figure out what to do.</string>
<string name="7736">I do too, but his training will help us in his place.</string>
<string name="7737">We have to think of ourselves!</string>
<string name="7738">You&apos;d think you&apos;d be a bit more grateful I restored you to flesh.</string>
<string name="7739">If that&apos;s all you can offer maybe you should just stay here.</string>
<string name="7740">It&apos;s overwhelming, but what else can we do? We go on.</string>
<string name="7741">I want you to stay here for now.</string>
<string name="7742">Come with me. We need to get moving.</string>
<string name="7743">Can you be useful if you are sightseeing like a fool?</string>
<string name="7744">Come on, then. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="7745">You have an interest in history?</string>
<string name="7746">It&apos;s good to see you.</string>
<string name="7747">I want to look around on my own for a bit.</string>
<string name="7748">Yes, I think that would be wise.</string>
<string name="7749">Drogan said I should take someone. Sounds like baggage to me.</string>
<string name="7750">Bringing an extra pair of hands would be a good idea.</string>
<string name="7751">I&apos;m not sure... perhaps I should check with Xanos.</string>
<string name="7752">I think that would be a good idea.</string>
<string name="7753">Not now Dorna! I&apos;ll let you know when I want to talk.</string>
<string name="7754">I&apos;m sorry, this isn&apos;t a good time. Can it wait?</string>
<string name="7755">I suppose I have the time right now. What is it?</string>
<string name="7756">Keep your opinion to yourself.</string>
<string name="7757">Your tone says you don&apos;t like him.</string>
<string name="7758">You know it from one overheard conversation?</string>
<string name="7759">Is he a dwarf as well?</string>
<string name="7760">Duergar? Explain what that is.</string>
<string name="7761">Do you have any evidence that he has done something wrong?</string>
<string name="7762">You surpise me with your intolerance.</string>
<string name="7763">Warning noted. I&apos;ll be extra careful.</string>
<string name="7764">If Drogan knew him, he can&apos;t be all bad.</string>
<string name="7765">Pointless speculation. Let&apos;s just do what we have to.</string>
<string name="7766">Wishing doesn&apos;t help. We have to take what we need.</string>
<string name="7767">As do I. We&apos;ll proceed carefully.</string>
<string name="7768">Leave if you want. My task is clear.</string>
<string name="7769">Don&apos;t bother worrying. Just follow my lead.</string>
<string name="7770">Your caution will serve us well, I think.</string>
<string name="7771">Bah. I&apos;ll use him like anyone else.</string>
<string name="7772">You aren&apos;t curious at all? He seemed sincere.</string>
<string name="7773">I agree, but what choice do we have for now?</string>
<string name="7774">Is that fear in your voice?</string>
<string name="7775">I&apos;m more worried how the dragon got his information.</string>
<string name="7776">Have you had any experience with dragons?</string>
<string name="7777">That&apos;s the spirit. We&apos;ll strip the place bare.</string>
<string name="7778">We&apos;re not here to loot. Keep focused.</string>
<string name="7779">You have no trouble looting the dead?</string>
<string name="7780">Do you harbor some kind of grudge against elves?</string>
<string name="7781">You&apos;ll make any excuse to cover your greed!</string>
<string name="7782">And if you happen to profit, all the better.</string>
<string name="7783">You make too many assumptions. I&apos;ll be watching you.</string>
<string name="7784">What&apos;s that got to do with it?</string>
<string name="7785">Thank you for the insight. Be quiet now.</string>
<string name="7786">And we missed it. Just like at Drogan&apos;s.</string>
<string name="7787">I&apos;d have fought hard too.</string>
<string name="7788">They should have fought harder. Weaklings.</string>
<string name="7789">Maybe there&apos;s a few kobolds left we can help mop-up.</string>
<string name="7790">Just like at the school. I&apos;ll make these kobolds pay.</string>
<string name="7791">I like the way you think.</string>
<string name="7792">You&apos;re not just in this for the gold, are you?</string>
<string name="7793">Suck it up and keep moving. Whining won&apos;t help.</string>
<string name="7794">He&apos;ll be fine. We&apos;ll make sure of it.</string>
<string name="7795">I don&apos;t know if he&apos;ll survive. There&apos;s a lot to do.</string>
<string name="7796">And if we make a little gold along the way, all the better.</string>
<string name="7797">I also want to see these artifacts he kept hidden.</string>
<string name="7798">That&apos;s all I care about. We&apos;ll help him.</string>
<string name="7799">I guess so. It&apos;s a strange feeling, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="7800">Yes. Our purpose is clear.</string>
<string name="7801">What, are you going to whine about that too?</string>
<string name="7802">I can&apos;t walk away from it. Not now.</string>
<string name="7803">If it was easy, we wouldn&apos;t need heroes.</string>
<string name="7804">If you have a problem with saving everyone, take a walk.</string>
<string name="7805">Yes, yes, we&apos;ve both grown. Could we get on with it?</string>
<string name="7806">I don&apos;t think anyone planned for this.</string>
<string name="7807">Like I have a choice.</string>
<string name="7808">I am.</string>
<string name="7809">He was a wise man. Could he have known?</string>
<string name="7810">Get to the point, Dorna.</string>
<string name="7811">Considering where we are, I&apos;d believe anything.</string>
<string name="7812">I can feel it, too. It&apos;s not like an earthquake.</string>
<string name="7813">Move on. We&apos;re still in danger.</string>
<string name="7814">It was his time.</string>
<string name="7815">Well you don&apos;t have to yell at me about it.</string>
<string name="7816">Drogan would not want us to despair.</string>
<string name="7817">He gave us a chance. We need to use it as best we can.</string>
<string name="7818">Look, you&apos;re going to have to move on.</string>
<string name="7819">Our skill saved him once. He knew we were worthy.</string>
<string name="7820">You don&apos;t have any answers as a cleric?</string>
<string name="7821">Just so long as you move on. We have to go.</string>
<string name="7822">Honor him while *you* live. That&apos;s all anyone can do.</string>
<string name="7823">Are you finished yet?</string>
<string name="7824">Let&apos;s go. We can&apos;t delay any longer.</string>
<string name="7825">Amen.</string>
<string name="7826">I won&apos;t let it fall into the wrong hands.</string>
<string name="7827">There&apos;s got to be a way to use this to our benefit.</string>
<string name="7828">Or just two.</string>
<string name="7829">Where&apos;s the fun in knowing all the answers?</string>
<string name="7830">Is your greed turning to fear?</string>
<string name="7831">Do you think his trust is misplaced?</string>
<string name="7832">We&apos;ll do okay. Drogan knows it. </string>
<string name="7833">What, we look almost professional.</string>
<string name="7834">Yes, wasting time. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="7835">It&apos;s strange, but I like it.</string>
<string name="7836">Step up and prove yourself or go home.</string>
<string name="7837">So am I. Stay here for now.</string>
<string name="7838">No apology needed, but stay here a while to recover.</string>
<string name="7839">Be more careful or it&apos;ll happen again. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="7840">No, I apologize for letting you fall. Welcome back.</string>
<string name="7841">This crystal... it is like none I have seen before. Perhaps it was worth the destruction of the artifact to discover it.</string>
<string name="7842">I wonder how Drogan... anyone, was able to obtain a tooth like this...</string>
<string name="7843">A mask imbued with the power of a god. This could get us much if we chose to use it...</string>
<string name="7844">The pieces of the ancient dead have long been known to harbor power after their... dismemberment.</string>
<string name="7845">That... that creature is huge! How can we hope to face it directly, should it attack? May... maybe retreat would be a good decision...</string>
<string name="7846">This place does not look good. We should be wary while here...</string>
<string name="7847">The kobolds flee before us! Flee before Xanos!</string>
<string name="7848">Kobolds may not be bright, but they can be tricky... We should be wary of traps.</string>
<string name="7849">The gnolls captured all these people? Maybe from Blumberg... or maybe they have ranged farther still...</string>
<string name="7850">There are kobolds in these cages as well... The gnolls seem to have captured them.</string>
<string name="7851">Why would this building be still standing? It is strange...</string>
<string name="7852">This town, too, has been razed... Look! Gnolls!</string>
<string name="7853">Bah! All this green makes me queasy... The hills were better...</string>
<string name="7854">These mountains are not known to be kind to travelers...</string>
<string name="7855">This is a place of great magic. A powerful force resides here...</string>
<string name="7856">Many of the creatures died in this battle... but I cannot tell the way it ended, nor what became of the survivors.</string>
<string name="7857">The people here, too, seem to have fled the kobolds... or been killed.</string>
<string name="7858">A caravan has arrived? One has to wonder about their timing...</string>
<string name="7859">Xanos has no need of prophecies of doom and destruction. As long as Xanos has Xanos, there is nothing to fear!</string>
<string name="7860">Bah! I could lead this town better than that drunkard...</string>
<string name="7861">Hmph. The locals try to fight the kobolds themselves, but they do not have the power of Xanos!</string>
<string name="7862">The dwarf&apos;s laboratory is downstairs. I wonder how the kobolds were able to breach its defenses?</string>
<string name="7863">The tremors do not stop... Xanos fears that bad things will soon happen...</string>
<string name="7864">The world shakes with wrath... This does not bode well for us...</string>
<string name="7865">All have fallen to Xanos! Rejoice!</string>
<string name="7866">Half of these golems have been destroyed under the iron fist of Xanos!</string>
<string name="7867">Another has felt the true might of Xanos!</string>
<string name="7868">Xanos is not afraid! Xanos will conquer all! Let us face what comes ahead and vanquish it!</string>
<string name="7869">The... the creature is huge! Xanos does not think he can handle this alone...</string>
<string name="7870">This is a room of great magic... Maybe more magic than Xanos himself can wield... Be wary.</string>
<string name="7871">The winds of death flow here... Xanos does like this...</string>
<string name="7872">I know where this is going... and it makes Xanos&apos; brain hurt. I hate mazes...</string>
<string name="7873">This area is dangerous... The floor looks disturbed, and who knows what manner of creature may lurk in the dark.</string>
<string name="7874">The stench of death and magic is upon this place...</string>
<string name="7875">This place is strange to Xanos. I trust nothing I cannot understand...</string>
<string name="7876">The power of these tomes is beyond my ken... If I, too, could possess such power...</string>
<string name="7877">Ah hah! The treasures of the Netherese! These ancient tomes are just the sort of treasures I seek!</string>
<string name="7878">Insects will be squashed beneath Xanos&apos; great heel!</string>
<string name="7879">With all the power the Netheril had, something could turn all their works to dust... Hope that it does not find us as well.</string>
<string name="7880">These halls they&apos;ve dug up... they&apos;re ancient. The knowledge of the Netherese could lie within, demons or not.</string>
<string name="7881">Xanos thinks that these archeologists may have dug up something more than what they expected...</string>
<string name="7882">Why worship a god if he never listens? These followers of Ao are only deluding themselves...</string>
<string name="7883">The water in the oasis flows once more! Now I can finally get a damn drink...</string>
<string name="7884">The ancient dead are powerful indeed... but none so powerful as Xanos!</string>
<string name="7885">That statue... I recognize its like. It is of Jergal... There is evil at work here.</string>
<string name="7886">Dry oasis... old bridge... older tombs... This place is ancient and dead.</string>
<string name="7887">This temple is no longer a sacred place, and the dead lie restless. But much power could reside in a place like this...</string>
<string name="7888">This oasis is useless! There is no water here!</string>
<string name="7889">A foul sacrifice in progress... a helpless person in need... Xanos thinks that heroes are made in times like these!</string>
<string name="7890">These caves seem endless... Who knows how far down they go? But the farther they go, the more we might find within.</string>
<string name="7891">These holes must lead into their lair. Who knows what may lurk within... but it is the guide we need.</string>
<string name="7892">This is one of the holes those scorpion creatures might have come from. We should be on our guard.</string>
<string name="7893">Bah! Then I shall remain here until I find something useful to do.</string>
<string name="7894">Good! You see the merit in having someone competent accompany you.</string>
<string name="7895">Grrr... These small creatures will not last long should Xanos get angry...</string>
<string name="7896">Finally! Now I can be rid of them and have something useful to do!</string>
<string name="7897">So have you come to your senses? You need Xanos&apos; skills, now, yes?</string>
<string name="7898">Bah! Go to your doom alone if you wish! I will be here if your senses return.</string>
<string name="7899">Very well, then. I shall accompany you.</string>
<string name="7900">What?! You would turn Xanos aside and make your way without him?</string>
<string name="7901">Ah, so you have not lost your mind completely. Only with Xanos can you hope to succeed.</string>
<string name="7902">*grumble* Very well, I shall remain here. We shall join again when you return.</string>
<string name="7903">Bah! Leave if you will, but you shall not get far without me! I will return to Drogan&apos;s and wait there.</string>
<string name="7904">Xanos will increase his skills and powers as he sees fit.</string>
<string name="7905">*You* would advise *me* on tactics?</string>
<string name="7906">If that is all you wish...</string>
<string name="7907">Very well. Caution and observation shall be sacrificed to speed.</string>
<string name="7908">Only those who Xanos wishes to see him, will.</string>
<string name="7909">You can attempt them on your own then.</string>
<string name="7910">Indeed. Where you have failed, Xanos shall succeed!</string>
<string name="7911">How far apart should we remain, then?</string>
<string name="7912">It shall be as you wish.</string>
<string name="7913">None will stand against Xanos!</string>
<string name="7914">Very well, then.</string>
<string name="7915">*sigh* Very well, then. Here is my equipment.</string>
<string name="7916">Eh. Maybe. Allow Xanos to rummage through your things. If something is found that is identifiable, Xanos will tell you. Good enough?</string>
<string name="7917">Now witness the fury of Xanos!</string>
<string name="7918">A spell then? What is it you wish me to cast?</string>
<string name="7919">What do you really want, then?</string>
<string name="7920">This is what you want me to cast?</string>
<string name="7921">Who do you want me to cast this on?</string>
<string name="7922">Xanos will do this...</string>
<string name="7923">You wish to mine my wisdom? The wisdom of Xanos is not something to be taken lightly!</string>
<string name="7924">Xanos will survive. Indeed, I shall survive better than all those who have fallen before!</string>
<string name="7925">What else is there you wish to speak of?</string>
<string name="7926">An adventurer does not speak of the hardships he endures, but... I am fine.</string>
<string name="7927">Everything is the same as it always has been. It is a cloth that my name shall be writ large across.</string>
<string name="7928">In time I shall be even stronger, and then our current problems will seem as nothing.</string>
<string name="7929">I am as well as may be expected given our current situation.</string>
<string name="7930">There is a foreboding feeling in the air... As if destiny moved against us...</string>
<string name="7931">It would be wiser for you to attend to your own affairs than mine, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="7932">Xanos may not be able to see, but he can hear! All shall fall before me! As soon as I can find them...</string>
<string name="7933">I am injured, true, but more than competent enough to solve any problems which you seem incapable of handling.</string>
<string name="7934">Xanos has been injured. It may not be advisable for me to stay in harm&apos;s way much longer...</string>
<string name="7935">I am close to death and need healing soon... My journey cannot end this way!</string>
<string name="7936">Cool, clammy skin... Pale complexion... Fever... It would seem that Xanos has been poisoned... *cough* Ohhh...</string>
<string name="7937">Xanos is strong! Xanos is healthy! Xanos... has a strange itching sensation... Xanos maybe is not so well...</string>
<string name="7938">I am currently only pursuing my magical studies.</string>
<string name="7939">I am currently only pursuing my martial studies.</string>
<string name="7940">Hmm... perhaps I shall study as you have suggested... Yes, that would be wise.</string>
<string name="7941">I am currently pursuing both martial and magical studies.</string>
<string name="7942">Hmm... perhaps I shall study as you have suggested... Yes, that would be wise.</string>
<string name="7943">Hmm... perhaps I shall study as you have suggested... Yes, that would be wise.</string>
<string name="7944">Hmm... perhaps I shall study as you have suggested... Yes, that would be wise.</string>
<string name="7945">Hah! When your own ring runs low on focus crystals, you ask me for mine? Do not worry, little &lt;Race&gt;. Xanos keeps his safe.</string>
<string name="7946">Xanos knows of your intentions... The ring and the crystals that power it are kept close and safe... for Xanos alone!</string>
<string name="7947">Did Drogan not show you how focus crystals are made? Remember the little machine in the lab inside his bedroom? If it is more crystals you are sniffing about for, look for them there, instead.</string>
<string name="7948">Ah, well... I do not know. The future seems so far away at times like this.</string>
<string name="7949">Bah! I don&apos;t know anymore... Things used to be so clear... so certain.</string>
<string name="7950">The world was in order and my destiny was secure. But now... but now things have gone far, far beyond what I had thought.</string>
<string name="7951">I... I don&apos;t think I was ready for this... for any of this. It is only now that I have had time to think that I can... fully appreciate this.</string>
<string name="7952">Reality has always been there. It has shaped the ways I have gone, and the opportunities I have had... all for myself.</string>
<string name="7953">I know. I will not. But... but maybe things have changed... Maybe the world has... Maybe it is me...</string>
<string name="7954">No, it will not. I do not complain of the fate this life has given me... but maybe it has changed... Maybe I have...</string>
<string name="7955">I have, maybe. The world has, perhaps. I don&apos;t even know anymore.</string>
<string name="7956">You once told me that no one can be an island unto themselves... Or was that master Drogan? Maybe it was him... but I remember that lesson well.</string>
<string name="7957">You could not tell to look at me, or to listen to the way I speak, but I remember it every day, and every day it strikes home more and more to me.</string>
<string name="7958">Hah! Like it or not, you will! This is my time, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I will spend it as I can! It is the least you can offer me!</string>
<string name="7959">*sigh* But it doesn&apos;t matter now I guess... I don&apos;t know what&apos;s come over me...</string>
<string name="7960">Maybe... maybe it was the time I spent encased in stone. It was... indescribable. Maybe it affected me.</string>
<string name="7961">Bah! You&apos;re always so intransigent! It&apos;s always the same with you!</string>
<string name="7962">But.. maybe that is a good thing. To have an island of stability when everything else seems so far...</string>
<string name="7963">I think... I think I will put my destiny... my plans on hold for a while.</string>
<string name="7964">Bah! It is not failure I worry about. I... I just need a little time maybe. To get accustomed to the way things seem now.</string>
<string name="7965">I think... I would stay in your company if you would let me. I do not think there is any place that I would rather be, right now.</string>
<string name="7966">We have spent much time together, you and I, and in spite of all that has happened to us, I still know you... Who you are.</string>
<string name="7967">I will stay with you for as long as I need, or for as long as you&apos;ll have me. Together we shall find a way to end this task... and maybe, I will find a way to go to my future as well.</string>
<string name="7968">Come. We should speak no more of this. Let us continue on our way.</string>
<string name="7969">But... I am glad that you have been here, whatever your intentions may have been.</string>
<string name="7970">I... I just need a little time maybe. To get accustomed to the way things seem now.</string>
<string name="7971">Yes, it has affected me. Unlike you, it seems. Nothing seems to have fazed you... not really, at any rate.</string>
<string name="7972">I don&apos;t know... I don&apos;t know what to think anymore. I just... it...</string>
<string name="7973">Hah! Xanos is as strong as ever! Only... I just...</string>
<string name="7974">Hah! &apos;Gentle King Xanos&apos;! I like that one!</string>
<string name="7975">You always were the funny one... even when you weren&apos;t trying to be! Hah! But you always spoke your mind; that is true.</string>
<string name="7976">I had read a great many books before we left master Drogan&apos;s. Both books on politics and kingdoms, and on the sorcerer-kings of old, who had carved their kingdoms from the land as I will.</string>
<string name="7977">I have had much time to think of the society I would make when I ruled with absolute power. It is a surprisingly difficult task to balance all that would need to be balanced in harmony.</string>
<string name="7978">Hah! Neither would Xanos not that long ago, but a happy kingdom is one that can achieve much more than an unhappy one.</string>
<string name="7979">It is far better to be loved by the subjects than to be hated by them. You never know when a dissatisfied subject will turn on you, or who may aid him in his cause, but happy subjects... you can tell their intentions in their eyes.</string>
<string name="7980">Do not think that I am being overly sentimental by seeking their happiness. No, it is very much self-preservation that causes me to seek this.</string>
<string name="7981">You... you&apos;re joking, right? Happiness is not an end in and of itself. One who is happy will be complacent, and do nothing more than... than exist!</string>
<string name="7982">As much as people may complain and moan about the hardships in their life, it is by such struggles that their own worth is defined.</string>
<string name="7983">After all, look at Xanos! I have led a troubled life, and for that, I am destined for greatness! Hah!</string>
<string name="7984">Bah! Compared to some, perhaps not. It is not only the troubles one faces that define you, but also your reactions to them. Will you face the pressure, or cave under it?</string>
<string name="7985">Some may have been crushed by the life they lead, but Xanos... Xanos will prevail above all! Xanos will never be tread on the ground like so much dirt!</string>
<string name="7986">It is you, above all others who should realize this by now. It is by my own indomitable spirit that I will prevail! I will drag myself to the very heights of power by my teeth if I have to!</string>
<string name="7987">*sigh* But such things can be wearying of the soul sometimes. Sometimes it is so much easier to want to stop... to rest.</string>
<string name="7988">I do not give up on my goal, though. I will prevail! Destiny will be mine!</string>
<string name="7989">Hah! You think that I give up on my great goal? Never!</string>
<string name="7990">Everyone does need rest, though. Perhaps a little sleep... to regain my strength. At times it feels as though I have been wandering for years through lands I have never expected to see...</string>
<string name="7991">Bah! I grow melancholy and thoughtful in my old age... Enough of this! Let us continue on our way, then.</string>
<string name="7992">I know not what your destiny is, little &lt;Race&gt;, nor how you will react to the pressures this journey puts upon you. Whatever path you choose, Xanos will prevail!</string>
<string name="7993">Bah! Compared to some, perhaps my troubles are not so harsh. It is not only the troubles one faces that define you, but also your reactions to them. Will you face the pressure, or cave under it.</string>
<string name="7994">Indeed it is not! I never claimed to be out for anyone but Xanos!</string>
<string name="7995">By keeping my subjects happy, I can avoid raising their ire. This has been the downfall of all oppressive tyrants in the past. But I cannot keep them too happy...</string>
<string name="7996">I do not follow in their footsteps. No, no, Xanos is not that simple. Rather, I build upon their mistakes. I correct them.</string>
<string name="7997">Ah... Now that is a good question, my friend. One that I cannot find an easy answer to.</string>
<string name="7998">I do not think that I would like to stay here in the north. It is too cold. Too uninhabited.</string>
<string name="7999">No, I am very much a people person. I think I will go south to more populous lands. It is there that I can seek my fortune and destiny on my own.</string>
<string name="8000">Hah! I am not gone yet! We still have time together, you and I, and I am thinking that our greatest challenges may yet lie ahead.</string>
<string name="8001">But it is nice to dream sometimes. Dream of what will happen when I finally am strong enough to make my wishes a reality.</string>
<string name="8002">I will go south, to warmer lands. I will find a nice city or two. Ones dealing with a little bit of instability, or suffering under harsh rulership.</string>
<string name="8003">It is then that Xanos will step in and assist the locals, taking charge of their efforts, and bringing my own name forward. In such a fashion I will gain my place in the world.</string>
<string name="8004">Barbaric?? Hardly! It is a well-used and time-honored tradition. It is as much a part of politics as... as... rebellion...</string>
<string name="8005">I suppose that is not a good example, but it is not that unnatural a thing to happen! And it is not as if I would be a bad ruler. I, Xanos, would be the greatest ruler! Hahahah!</string>
<string name="8006">Indeed, for it is the beginning only. Soon all will see the virtue in Xanos&apos; rule, and others will come flocking to my banner. It will be only a matter of time before my empire expands.</string>
<string name="8007">Then all the world shall know of Xanos. They shall tremble at his wrath, weep for his sadness, and cry out in joy for his happiness!</string>
<string name="8008">But that is far in the future from now. In the present, there is still much we can do that should be done. Let us continue on our way, my friend.</string>
<string name="8009">Hah! If that day should come, many years from now, I will not forget our friendship and travels together, little &lt;race&gt;. Do not fear, I will try to be gentle with you.</string>
<string name="8010">Hah! If you prove yourself competent in our travels together, little &lt;Race&gt;, perhaps you will have a place at my side one day. An advisor to the great king Xanos!</string>
<string name="8011">Bah! It is not nonsense! It is a vision of the future! I, Xanos, have been blessed with this sight... with this knowledge, and I will see it through until the end!</string>
<string name="8012">I do not like the tone in your voice... You disapprove, I think. My methods are a well-used and time-honored tradition. They are as much a part of politics as... as... rebellion...</string>
<string name="8013">Of course! It is a well-used and time-honored tradition. It is as much a part of politics as... as... rebellion...</string>
<string name="8014">Hah! Indeed! I know this as well as you. We still have time together, you and I, and I am thinking that our greatest challenges may yet lie ahead.</string>
<string name="8015">Bah! You do not know charisma if it stares you in the face... as it is doing right now! But I still have much to do before those days come. Our journeys will not end so quickly I am thinking now.</string>
<string name="8016">Hah! I did say that we would talk eventually, didn&apos;t I? Very well. What is it you wish to know?</string>
<string name="8017">Hahah! You are always in good humor, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I doubt that our paths will cross much after we have finished our task.</string>
<string name="8018">No, when I have finished my training, I shall go far from here... Far away to virgin, untouched lands and minds, who will then cower and fall before Xanos!</string>
<string name="8019">I know, I know. You disapprove. It is not so uncommon as that. Master Drogan too, thinks that I have the potential to cause much harm, but that is not my intent.</string>
<string name="8020">But none of you seem to understand that what I do, I do for the good of others as much as myself. The lands of the Realms need the firm hand of government to guide them.</string>
<string name="8021">The broken, lawless lands that cover too much of the earth would benefit much from Xanos&apos; rule.</string>
<string name="8022">You mean like the Thayans? The Zhentarim? Fools, all of them... They have not learned enough from history.</string>
<string name="8023">&quot;Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as to carry on great enterprises and to give rare examples of himself.&quot;</string>
<string name="8024">To be a great leader, to create a lasting kingdom, one must not only be able to conquer or subject his people, one must also be able to win their hearts.</string>
<string name="8025">It is through the esteem of one&apos;s subjects that one has true power over them.</string>
<string name="8026">Hah! A simplistic method, and one that always fails in time. No one who treats all as enemies has ever held power for long.</string>
<string name="8027">It is not in the best interest of a ruler to lie to his subjects. Lies are always revealed in the end, to the detriment of those who have harmed others by them.</string>
<string name="8028">No, a great ruler, as I will be, must divide the world into two camps: those who are against me, and those who are subject to me.</string>
<string name="8029">&quot;A prince is also esteemed when he is a true friend and a true enemy.&quot; A true friend to my people, and a true enemy to those who stand against. I shall treat my subjects as if my own children, and my enemies as mortal ones.</string>
<string name="8030">It is through such kind acts as these that the subjects will grow to love what I give them, and my enemies fear what may occur if they resist. This breeds a fanatical devotion to the ruler in his subjects, enhancing his power.</string>
<string name="8031">Hah! But I see that my philosophy is, perhaps, a bit beyond you. Do not fear, it is understandable.</string>
<string name="8032">Bah! A genius like Xanos also learns from the masters of the past. I give only truths gleaned from the work of others!</string>
<string name="8033">You seek to insult me with it?! Bah! Let us go, then, and do something more meaningful than your chiding.</string>
<string name="8034">Hah! Time will tell what future Xanos will hold. And I know that it is a great one!</string>
<string name="8035">Come, let us leave, my friend, and continue with our task.</string>
<string name="8036">Why question the wind, the rain, or the ground underneath your feet? It is the fundamentals, my friend. It is the desire that drives me.</string>
<string name="8037">My life? What is my life... It is nothing without a purpose!</string>
<string name="8038">To exist... to sit around all day doing nothing? Being &apos;nice&apos;? Serving others?? That is no way for one such as Xanos to live!</string>
<string name="8039">No, for me, the only place to be is the top. A place above reproach where none can stand beside me!</string>
<string name="8040">Hah! Those with the will to gain power shall see it come in their lifetime. Such destiny is mine, of course.</string>
<string name="8041">But you think me to become an evil dictator? A tyrant? You compare me to the Thayans, perhaps?</string>
<string name="8042">No, this is not the way for Xanos. Xanos is no monster. Xanos is smarter than that.</string>
<string name="8043">Hah! You think me weak-minded? You think me simple? Power drives me, yes, but it does not consume me.</string>
<string name="8044">This thing... this thing which drives me, it is power. But power is fleeting, as we have already seen in our journey.</string>
<string name="8045">Xanos will not stand by as what I worked all my life to achieve is stripped from me. Not again!</string>
<string name="8046">Hah! Spoken truly as one who does not understand... and fears because of it.</string>
<string name="8047">I will not have my life taken from me by ignorance. Not in me, nor in my subjects.</string>
<string name="8048">History, my friend, teaches us many things. It teaches us the lessons that others have learned at their expense. A good ruler, as I shall be, learns from the mistakes of those who have failed.</string>
<string name="8049">But what mistakes have they made? What have I learned?</string>
<string name="8050">Hah! Xanos will not be so easily drawn into your little trap! I will not sell my knowledge so cheaply as that!</string>
<string name="8051">Let us journey on further, and then, perhaps, I will let you have a better glimpse at the genius of Xanos!</string>
<string name="8052">Hah! You overestimate yourself, little &lt;Race&gt;! Xanos has a destiny, forged in his past, which will not be denied!</string>
<string name="8053">My life is nothing without purpose, and that purpose is power! No other kind of life can be bared.</string>
<string name="8054">Hahah! I forgot about that... You had asked, hadn&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="8055">I guess I got a little carried away and never got around to telling you.</string>
<string name="8056">I have only myself to rely upon. Not you, not Drogan... especially not Dorna... I have become capable in and of myself to achieve my goals.</string>
<string name="8057">Yes, yes. I avoid, I know. Fine. I will tell you now.</string>
<string name="8058">When I was younger I did not have the... self-control I have now. I was a brash young lad, full of himself and his abilities.</string>
<string name="8059">You would not understand the follies of youth then? Are you perfect as master Drogan seems to think?</string>
<string name="8060">Bah! I act as I do now because I am capable of it. I know what I can and cannot do, now. I was more... foolish then.</string>
<string name="8061">I had placed too much importance on the acceptance of others... on their goodwill. I was a stupid, stupid youth.</string>
<string name="8062">Bah! I can be as critical of myself as you can. I push myself always so that I do not repeat the mistakes of the past.</string>
<string name="8063">I am not some simple-minded half-orc to not realize these things. I can and will stand on my own!</string>
<string name="8064">Hah! You seek to insult me? You think that Xanos would not notice your jokes at his expense?</string>
<string name="8065">I am not some stupid half-orc for you to play mind-games with! I can and will stand on my own!</string>
<string name="8066">Ever since the simple-minded bigots of my home drove me out, fearing my strength and my sorcery, I have vowed that I will cow to no one! Submit to no one!</string>
<string name="8067">I am Xanos, and my will shall not be denied!</string>
<string name="8068">Bah! You are as heartless as always. I do not know why I let myself tell you these things, knowing you will only mock me in response.</string>
<string name="8069">They cast me out and I wandered the wilderness for months... never knowing where my next meal would come from, or even if I would survive the night.</string>
<string name="8070">Until at last I found my way here to Hilltop... and master Drogan.</string>
<string name="8071">He alone accepted me for what I am, and let me harness the powers I was wielding. Powers I have now forged into the true might of Xanos!</string>
<string name="8072">Heh. In time, in time. All shall feel the power of Xanos, and all will bow before me!</string>
<string name="8073">But not right now. We have things to do, you understand, so let us be doing them.</string>
<string name="8074">Yes. Yes, I believe we shall.</string>
<string name="8075">Bah! Talking to you is as if speaking to a brick wall! Let us stop this nonsense and continue with our journey.</string>
<string name="8076">Bah! We have been over this story before, you and I. Why would you wish to hear it again?</string>
<string name="8077">Not interesting?! The greatest story ever told?! It is a story you will tell to your children!</string>
<string name="8078">Someday, far in the future, you will look back on the days you have known me and rejoice that you were close to someone who was so destined for greatness!</string>
<string name="8079">It is my destiny to achieve greatness. None will deny the will of Xanos!</string>
<string name="8080">I know you may doubt me. You... Mischa... Drogan... Dorna... All do not believe that this destiny will be mine... but I will show them!</string>
<string name="8081">I will work as hard as it takes, do whatever it may take, to achieve this goal.</string>
<string name="8082">Fear not, little &lt;Race&gt;, I am in full control of myself.</string>
<string name="8083">But I shall not be denied on my path to power. If anything in my life has shown this, it is that my will cannot be denied!</string>
<string name="8084">Bah! You are too impatient, &lt;FirstName&gt;. In time you will see the truth of what I say... You may even agree with it.</string>
<string name="8085">Rest assured that greatness is what I seek. The path of power and the voice within. It is my destiny.</string>
<string name="8086">And that is all we shall speak of for now... We have more pressing concerns.</string>
<string name="8087">My life of hardship and regret... the times I have... Bah! Xanos is not weak like the others. Though I may not speak of it, I have my own troubles. These are none of your concern.</string>
<string name="8088">The only thing that shall change the past and make the future great. It is my call to power.</string>
<string name="8089">But it drives me onward...  If anything in my life has shown this, it is that my will cannot be denied!</string>
<string name="8090">Hah! You sound like Xanos! We shall be good company for one another!</string>
<string name="8091">But I shall not be denied on my path to power... by you or anyone. If anything in my life has shown this, it is that my will cannot be denied!</string>
<string name="8092">Hah! Fear not, little &lt;Race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;, I know my own limits.</string>
<string name="8093">Bah! Unlikely. You have always been too focused on your studies by far. But... I will humor you this once.</string>
<string name="8094">Bah! Very well. I shall tell you once more if you wish.</string>
<string name="8095">Bah! Then I will remain here until you come to your senses.</string>
<string name="8096">Hah! Then we shall face our perils together!</string>
<string name="8097">That... that is something I never wish to repeat again... Being entombed in stone is no way to exist.</string>
<string name="8098">Hah! Well I know this. But I also think we shall see more of her... and we must not repeat our folly.</string>
<string name="8099">Facing a medusa... and now one in possession of the mythallar will not be easy. Even harder now that this lizard thinks we are his slaves, if what I hear is correct.</string>
<string name="8100">Hah! I don&apos;t doubt that. We shall both take her down... we must obey the lizard for now...</string>
<string name="8101">There seems little else we can do, except what this lizard wants... but in time...</string>
<string name="8102">In time we shall free ourselves. Perhaps with the strength of the mythallar, I could... hmm...</string>
<string name="8103">But no, that is not our concern, is it? For now we must try to find this Heurodis. I know she is here somewhere... ehhh... where is this, again, exactly?</string>
<string name="8104">What? Then why did you free me? You need Xanos!</string>
<string name="8105">Yes, yes, yes. You are beginning to sound like Drogan.</string>
<string name="8106">Bah! Fine! But you shall come back to Xanos soon enough. You will see.</string>
<string name="8107">Indeed. I think we could aid each other greatly.</string>
<string name="8108">What? Me? Never! Do not be silly.</string>
<string name="8109">It doesn&apos;t seem to matter what we wish to believe, it is what *he* believes that is what matters...</string>
<string name="8110">Hmph. You have need of Xanos&apos; skill in this place or you would not have freed me. I truly doubt you would have saved me out of pure sentimentality, eh?</string>
<string name="8111">Alright. It sounds like a good plan to Xanos, so long as you follow your own advice, eh?</string>
<string name="8112">And neither will I. But I also think we shall see more of her... and we must not repeat our folly.</string>
<string name="8113">Bah! What is good about it? The dangers of this place are evident... Perhaps we should help each other to stay alive.</string>
<string name="8114">Well then, we shall see how well you do without Xanos to aid you.</string>
<string name="8115">Of course... I thought of it! Let us go together, then.</string>
<string name="8116">And you think *I* should accompany you?  You think that *I* want to retrieve these artifacts for master Drogan?</string>
<string name="8117">Xanos would not be so callous as to reject a call for help, once given. If you wish my aid, I shall be here to ask.</string>
<string name="8118">Very well, then. Xanos shall accompany you in this task. Drogan will likely reward us well when we succeed.</string>
<string name="8119">This was not funny the first time you said it. Xanos is not impressed.</string>
<string name="8120">I do not wish to be mocked!</string>
<string name="8121">Oh, ho ho. I see. Now it is all a big joke, eh? Xanos must suffer the blunt end of your juvenile wit.</string>
<string name="8122">Xanos will feel sorry for &lt;FirstName&gt;, shortly.</string>
<string name="8123">Do you wish to hear what I have to say or not, imbecile?!</string>
<string name="8124">Very well. Then Xanos shall hold his own counsel.</string>
<string name="8125">This place... it holds great power.</string>
<string name="8126">Hah! It is not that I criticize your ferret-like instincts, but rather that I, too, am eager to find the source of this power.</string>
<string name="8127">There was great magic worked here at one time... magic whose origins I do not recognize. It is ancient indeed, though.</string>
<string name="8128">If I am correct... If my intuition tells me true...</string>
<string name="8129">Well it is most definitely not the work of the gnolls...</string>
<string name="8130">Yes, yes, I have already said that. You do not need to mindlessly repeat every word I say.</string>
<string name="8131">It is not elven. Not dwarven. Almost... human? We are near the Nether mountains... If it is that old, then, perhaps...</string>
<string name="8132">Oh but I am. I think this may be the work of the ancient Netherese. If that is true, then what we may find here could have power beyond our wildest dreams... or enough power to reduce us all to dust in an instant.</string>
<string name="8133">Yes... Netherese. If that is true, then what we may find here could have power beyond our wildest dreams... or enough power to reduce us all to dust in an instant.</string>
<string name="8134">Netherese? If that is true, then what we may find here could have power beyond our wildest dreams... or enough power to reduce us all to dust in an instant.</string>
<string name="8135">We should be wary here, I know, but the potential power... it is limitless.</string>
<string name="8136">What is this mistress that spoke to J&apos;Nah? This situation is getting more complex by the moment.</string>
<string name="8137">A feud between a dragon and a sorceress... and a secret master powerful enough to use both to further his, or maybe her, concerns.</string>
<string name="8138">I worry that what we may have stepped into may soon outstrip us both.</string>
<string name="8139">Indeed we do, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I worry about the dangers... The danger to Xanos.</string>
<string name="8140">Hah! Xanos will not be leaving one such as you to be our only hope! That would be no hope at all. But there are dangers...</string>
<string name="8141">Hah! It is not your health I care about, &lt;Race&gt;! It is Xanos&apos; health that may suffer!</string>
<string name="8142">It would not do to have a glorious life such as mine cut short in its prime.</string>
<string name="8143">But we would seem to have little choice in the matter. Let us continue then, and bring the retrieved artifacts back to master Drogan.</string>
<string name="8144">Hah! Xanos can handle anything! But...</string>
<string name="8145">Do you not find it disturbing that a dragon, such as this Tymofarrar, seeks the artifacts that were entrusted to master Drogan?</string>
<string name="8146">Perhaps the artifacts hold a much greater import than we were led to believe...</string>
<string name="8147">Indeed... It is as you say...</string>
<string name="8148">The enemies we face must go beyond the simple kobolds we have encountered already.</string>
<string name="8149">That was not my original meaning, but... the powers they may hold would surely help Xanos in his quest...</string>
<string name="8150">Bah! That is not what I was talking about! I was only suggesting that perhaps the enemies we face go beyond the simple kobolds we have encountered already.</string>
<string name="8151">First kobolds, then a dragon; who knows what other powers may be lurking behind the scenes and are arrayed against us?</string>
<string name="8152">But he cannot. We are left to our own devices for now, and we must take all due caution as we continue.</string>
<string name="8153">We must not allow Xanos&apos; glorious life to be snuffed out so meaninglessly.</string>
<string name="8154">Indeed. We are left to our own devices for now, and we must take all due caution as we continue.</string>
<string name="8155">Indeed. But we are left to our own devices for now, and we should take all due caution as we continue.</string>
<string name="8156">This... this place has a feeling of life about it... and of death.</string>
<string name="8157">Hah! Xanos does not fear the kobolds that fled here! But... there may be other things... older things...</string>
<string name="8158">I will speak candidly with you now, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Xanos does not scare easily, but I question the wisdom of disturbing a tomb such as this.</string>
<string name="8159">There is no love between my ancestors and the elves, but I rise above that. I do not discriminate as they do. But these places were not meant to be disturbed.</string>
<string name="8160">I only think that, maybe, if we continue, something may awaken that was not meant to. We should not disturb the bones of the dead.</string>
<string name="8161">Bah! I sound like a coward to you now, but my words stand true. I do not wish to die in a place like this.</string>
<string name="8162">Bah! Talking to you is like talking to a brick wall, sometimes! Very well, I will follow your lead, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I have voiced my concerns.</string>
<string name="8163">Hah! If I could believe that, I might have some respect for your abilities, but I know well your limitations, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8164">If you choose to go on, I shall remain with you. Xanos will protect you! Hah!</string>
<string name="8165">Xanos will not die, of course. I was more concerned for your safety, is all.</string>
<string name="8166">The kobolds have not left this town peacefully... I will have my revenge for what they have done here!</string>
<string name="8167">Bah! Selfish to the end, you are. But Xanos at least admits to his failings, as few as they might be. Though both you and Drogan liked to point mine out for me.</string>
<string name="8168">Yes... Drogan. It seems we all owe a lot to master Drogan. I can hardly count the number of scars he left on my body. Still, the crotchety old dwarf had some redeeming features.</string>
<string name="8169">When I first came to this town, I was shunned by the people because of my heritage... my orcish half was all they could see... except Drogan.</string>
<string name="8170">What? Here?? The people here are country folk and woodsmen... They have a harsh acceptance of the realities around them, and are very cynical of the good intentions of others.</string>
<string name="8171">But I suppose I do not hold it against them any longer... In the years I have been here they have grown on me, I guess.</string>
<string name="8172">Indeed. We must find those kobolds... and retrieve the artifacts they have stolen.</string>
<string name="8173">Bah! You are as inflexible as always.</string>
<string name="8174">The hallmark of those destined for greatness is flexibility. Like me for example.</string>
<string name="8175">But we should delay no longer. We must pursue those kobolds and retrieve the artifacts they have stolen.</string>
<string name="8176">Yes... Yes, I will. And we should not waste more time here talking. Action calls.</string>
<string name="8177">Bah! You are too cynical by far! You think only of yourself! You are almost as bad as the townsfolk were when I had first arrived.</string>
<string name="8178">Bah! I knew I could not expect understanding from you. *You* have always had it easy... being Drogan&apos;s pet student. Some of us actually had to work for ourselves.</string>
<string name="8179">I am not bitter! Not anymore at least... I do not hold it against them any longer. They have grown on me, I guess.</string>
<string name="8180">Even silly Mischa could tell Drogan favored you, and I would not call her observant. She worships Drogan as much as these townsfolk do. That respect is their one redeeming feature. It almost makes me like them.</string>
<string name="8181">Then show it! You act so tough and independent, but Xanos acts this way too. Perhaps if you can find some maturity, then we can speak as equals and avoid some of the verbal abuse.</string>
<string name="8182">The townsfolk do not even mistreat me anymore. I could almost like them now.</string>
<string name="8183">The kobolds would have to have come through the village, I think... Though they hold no challenge for Xanos, the villagers may have fared poorly.</string>
<string name="8184">Hah! It is as I thought it would be: At the first sign of hardship, you turn and run back to Drogan&apos;s skirt!</string>
<string name="8185">The kobolds have only just left. If we pursue now, we may yet have a chance to catch them before they leave the town.</string>
<string name="8186">But we must have a plan to find and capture them. I, Xanos, shall take the lead, of course.</string>
<string name="8187">Hah! I know, I know. You think me overconfident, but I shall be gracious.</string>
<string name="8188">I know that master Drogan favors you above the rest of us. You are his oldest student, after all. Therefore I shall treat you as an equal in this endeavor.</string>
<string name="8189">We shall find and defeat the kobolds together, in our own way. But be wary... They may have expected us to follow them.</string>
<string name="8190">Let us go. We must not let them get too far ahead of us.</string>
<string name="8191">I agree. That is a surprisingly good insight for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;; one worthy of Xanos himself.</string>
<string name="8192">Quick action is decisive, but rash ones are the sign of a small intellect.</string>
<string name="8193">This is it, I think... We shall meet Heurodis again very soon... and there must not be things left unsaid between us, as there was between master Drogan and myself.</string>
<string name="8194">Bah! That is always the way with you. Always like this, in the end.</string>
<string name="8195">But you and master Drogan... you have changed me from the way I once was. You have made a new man of me.</string>
<string name="8196">Once this Heurodis has been dealt with, perhaps we shall see what the future will hold in store for us.</string>
<string name="8197">Perhaps... perhaps not. I am not at all certain that we will survive this, but... I must speak my piece now.</string>
<string name="8198">In spite of all that has been between us, both good and bad, I... I count you as a true friend &lt;FirstName&gt;. I mean that.</string>
<string name="8199">You may not agree, you may not feel it is appropriate, but that is the way things stand.</string>
<string name="8200">You are my friend, and as such, I will stand by you in the final battle, even though it may cost me my life.</string>
<string name="8201">Indeed... well, still I shall be there. Let us go now, and meet our fate, then.</string>
<string name="8202">Let us go now, and meet our fate, then.</string>
<string name="8203">You and master Drogan... you have changed me from the way I once was. You have made a new man of me.</string>
<string name="8204">These three Winds must be the key to the mythallar and Heurodis... If we hope to defeat her, we must find them, then.</string>
<string name="8205">I can only hope that all of them have survived the millennia trapped inside this ruin...</string>
<string name="8206">Yes... I know... But we need to find all three first.</string>
<string name="8207">They&apos;re supposed to be scattered around, with each one in a different place. But surely they would not have left them unguarded...</string>
<string name="8208">I think it&apos;s likely they put each one in its own fortress of sorts... something to protect it from casual outsiders and thieves.</string>
<string name="8209">Hah! Them? Those thieves. No, I don&apos;t think they&apos;d know anything about this city. They&apos;re just common thieves and slavers.</string>
<string name="8210">Indeed. We will likely have to face whatever guardians the ancient Netherese put in place... plus whatever Heurodis has done to reinforce them.</string>
<string name="8211">I do not know...</string>
<string name="8212">Perhaps as this city is divided into sections, maybe they placed the Winds in those as well...</string>
<string name="8213">We must search them at any rate, but we must stay on our guard. We cannot allow Heurodis or whatever lurks here to stop us in our task.</string>
<string name="8214">Hah! Don&apos;t let overconfidence blind you to the truth! We need those Winds.</string>
<string name="8215">This place seems to be shaking itself apart! It is only a matter of time before all this collapses around us.</string>
<string name="8216">Heurodis might be trying to reactivate this city... to make it fly again... but I don&apos;t think it would work.</string>
<string name="8217">Indeed... and that is why we must make certain to stop her.</string>
<string name="8218">She might get the city to fly; she might harness its powers. But when it finally comes crashing down around her, who knows what destruction it will cause...</string>
<string name="8219">No, it&apos;s vital we stop her... we cannot afford to fail.</string>
<string name="8220">Hah! Yes, I had almost forgotten... I suppose that says something about me... about us.</string>
<string name="8221">Hah! I had thoughts of that, too, at one point. But the powers here, old though they are, are too strong for any of us to wield.</string>
<string name="8222">But... a thought occurs: we may not be able to harness the city, but surely some of the items within it must hold incredible magical power.</string>
<string name="8223">Any that we could take with us... Just think of it! The power!</string>
<string name="8224">Yes. Let&apos;s go quickly.</string>
<string name="8225">Hah! Not if I find it first! Let us hurry, then.</string>
<string name="8226">Perhaps... Let us hurry in any case.</string>
<string name="8227">Yes. Speed and time are of the essence.</string>
<string name="8228">It is too old... I can sense the magic failing in the enchantments... The decay...</string>
<string name="8229">Drogan... he is dead now. I am having... difficulty with this.</string>
<string name="8230">Bah! Xanos is not weak! Xanos is strong! Stronger than you it would seem...</string>
<string name="8231">It is not weakness to admit your feelings... You can draw much strength from it.</string>
<string name="8232">Drogan... As much as I hate to say it, he was like family to me.</string>
<string name="8233">Xanos never relied on anyone save Xanos... until he came along. He was a mentor to me... almost a father.</string>
<string name="8234">He took me in when none would and in the end, he gave his life for me as well...</string>
<string name="8235">Bah! Cynicism and mockery are your trademarks, as always. I try to be serious and that is the response you give me...</string>
<string name="8236">I do not disagree, but did you hear the things he had to say to Xanos? He was a gruff old dwarf, and I was a troublesome student.</string>
<string name="8237">I thought... I believed that he saw something more in Xanos, but the words never came from his mouth before. Why... why did those words have to come only when he was dying?</string>
<string name="8238">Why could Xanos never let go of his pride and confide in his mentor. So many things I should have said... now it is too late.</string>
<string name="8239">Curse your miserable heart, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If it were not for the example set by Master Drogan I would destroy you here and now for your foul words.</string>
<string name="8240">Indeed. There is much that needs to be finished. We will not let his sacrifice be in vain. </string>
<string name="8241">Drogan gave everything to stop Heurodis from gaining the mythallar and using it for her foul purposes. We must not fail in this.</string>
<string name="8242">When we find Heurodis... I will tear her heart from her chest!</string>
<string name="8243">The power of this crystal, this... mythallar. Are you sure that you can handle it? Should not Xanos keep it safe?</string>
<string name="8244">Bah! You laugh at Xanos! I do not know why I put up with you sometimes.</string>
<string name="8245">Bah! You mock Xanos and seek to belittle him? I do not know why I put up with you sometimes. Who leads whom here? You should ask yourself this sometime.</string>
<string name="8246">Perhaps... perhaps not. I suppose we have little choice.</string>
<string name="8247">The power that Garrick has said is within this crystal, though... It is awesome. If this master of J&apos;Nah&apos;s could lay hands on it...</string>
<string name="8248">Hah! You are awfully confident for someone who has had such troubles so far.</string>
<string name="8249">Indeed, it is only because of Xanos that you have come as far as you have! Hah!</string>
<string name="8250">But... it may be better if you keep the mythallar in your care... so long as you recognize what it is you carry.</string>
<string name="8251">I suppose it is better that you keep it in your care... so long as you recognize what it is you carry.</string>
<string name="8252">Indeed we cannot. I suppose it is better then, that you keep it in your care... so long as you recognize what it is you carry.</string>
<string name="8253">That one crystal, if used improperly, could destroy us all... and the rocks and sand for miles around. It is dangerous... yet therein lies its allure.</string>
<string name="8254">If you could just let me hold it and try to... no! I... I do not think I should be trusted to handle it... It is, perhaps, too tempting.</string>
<string name="8255">Keep it... Keep the crystal... Keep it safe and we shall see what utility it may prove to be later.</string>
<string name="8256">Xanos wishes to make a complaint. This desert is a hellish and inhospitable place! Our traveling accomodations are dreadful and the food since we left Hilltop has been nothing short of dreadful!</string>
<string name="8257">So you are in the same position as Xanos. Neither of us asked to be here, and yet here we are!</string>
<string name="8258">Nothing, obviously. You are in no better a position than Xanos. Neither of us was given a choice as to whether or not we wished to come here!</string>
<string name="8259">Was Xanos given a choice? Were you? I did not ask to be sent into the desert to risk my life, as I recall.</string>
<string name="8260">Bah! I believe that I am entitled to some &quot;whining&quot;, as you put it. Xanos did not ask to be here!</string>
<string name="8261">No sooner was one dangerous task completed, then we were ordered to rush headlong into another! And for what?! To identify this little crystal?!</string>
<string name="8262">And yet here we both are, performing Drogan&apos;s little task like dutiful children. We risk our lives for nothing!</string>
<string name="8263">I would rather we not have left Hilltop at all! What relevance does this task have to our lives, eh?</string>
<string name="8264">Obviously it is not important enough a task for Drogan to take it on, himself, is it? No, it is for us to risk our lives for nothing!</string>
<string name="8265">So what if we have this crystal identified? Then what? We should be looking for the culprit behind that J&apos;Nah woman and taking the battle to her!</string>
<string name="8266">Or better yet, give all the artifacts back to the Harpers and tell them to think of a better place to hide them. If we do not have what this woman wants, she need not bother with us!</string>
<string name="8267">What does it matter? This is Harper business, not ours! By carrying this crystal, we put ourselves in danger!</string>
<string name="8268">Of course Xanos makes sense! Why are we even involved in this madness?! This is Harper business, not ours! By carrying this crystal, we put ourselves in danger!</string>
<string name="8269">Yes, and that is what Xanos finds so very irritating. Moreso than having my britches full of sand, even. I do not know why I put up with it.</string>
<string name="8270">Hmmm. Perhaps you are right. Still, Xanos would prefer to choose when he risks his hide, regardless of the possible rewards. Unless they are very, very big rewards. Hmmm.</string>
<string name="8271">Do not be ridiculous! Xanos laughs in the face of danger! Ha ha ha!</string>
<string name="8272">What?! Where?! Kill it! Kill it quickly, I... oh, I see. You are joking with Xanos. How very droll you can be, &lt;FirstName&gt;, ha ha.</string>
<string name="8273">Yes, and notice how greatly he is helping us in return, eh? Our rings no longer protect us, and yet he gives us nothing to replace them.</string>
<string name="8274">Tell me seriously, however... why did you come? Xanos may have little choice but to follow you about, but you could have refused if anyone could have.</string>
<string name="8275">Too late, eh? Xanos is beginning to think that you enjoy all of this more than you say. Perhaps you are right to do so... or perhaps you are crazy.</string>
<string name="8276">You believe so? Perhaps you are right. Perhaps Xanos thinks too much of his comfort and not the power this little crystal could bring. You make a good point.</string>
<string name="8277">I see. Xanos swears... if you begin to run around waving your weapon and crying, &quot;Wheeee!&quot;, I shall vomit.</string>
<string name="8278">Pfah! One day I hope you will grow a spine, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is revolting to see you grovel before Drogan as he throws you a bone.</string>
<string name="8279">Yes, revenge is good. Whoever is behind this attacked Xanos as much as she attacked the dwarf, eh? That is true.</string>
<string name="8280">Bah. Xanos will come along, then, and do as he must. But he will still complain! Never shall he relent!</string>
<string name="8281">Yes, it is very good, is it not? What a pair we shall make!</string>
<string name="8282">And why not? It is better than listening to other people speak. Try long enough and others become a distant buzzing, in fact.</string>
<string name="8283">Eh? What was that?</string>
<string name="8284">Now you sound like Xanos&apos;s mother. I am beginning to feel very nostalgic.</string>
<string name="8285">Xanos shall mouth his complaints in your direction, then. And use hand gestures, of course.</string>
<string name="8286">But enough with our dawdling. If we are to find treasure and power, we will not do so standing about. Lead on, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8287">Very well. I will come.</string>
<string name="8288">I shall stay then. Leave if you will.</string>
<string name="8289">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;Xanos is currently unconscious and will likely die if he is not given aid very soon.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="8290">This is not a good time to speak.</string>
<string name="8291">No, stay here.</string>
<string name="8292">Fine, come with me.</string>
<string name="8293">No, stay here.</string>
<string name="8294">Yeah, you can come with me.</string>
<string name="8295">No, never mind.</string>
<string name="8296">Yes, come with me.</string>
<string name="8297">Never mind.</string>
<string name="8298">I think we need to part ways.</string>
<string name="8299">Alright, fine. Stay with me, then.</string>
<string name="8300">Wait here until I return.</string>
<string name="8301">Leave me. Now.</string>
<string name="8302">I&apos;d like you to level up.</string>
<string name="8303">I want to change your tactics.</string>
<string name="8304">I don&apos;t want to change anything else right now.</string>
<string name="8305">I want to move faster and not bother with stealth or searching.</string>
<string name="8306">I need you to be stealthy right now.</string>
<string name="8307">Don&apos;t help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.</string>
<string name="8308">Help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.</string>
<string name="8309">I want to change the distance you stay away from me.</string>
<string name="8310">Stay a long distance away from me.</string>
<string name="8311">Keep a medium distance.</string>
<string name="8312">Stay close.</string>
<string name="8313">Go ahead and attack as soon as you see enemies.</string>
<string name="8314">Defend me and don&apos;t attack until I do.</string>
<string name="8315">I want to adjust your equipment.</string>
<string name="8316">Can you identify my equipment?</string>
<string name="8317">I want you to use your Barbarian Rage.</string>

<string name="8376">What was it you wanted to say earlier?</string>
<string name="8377">Let&apos;s stop and talk for a moment.</string>
<string name="8378">We&apos;re done talking.</string>
<string name="8379">How is everything?</string>
<string name="8380">I want to discuss your training.</string>
<string name="8381">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Xanos will take 1 barbarian level for every 4 sorcerer levels.]&lt;/Start&gt; Concentrate on both martial and magical studies.</string>
<string name="8382">&lt;StartAction&gt;[No leveling change.]&lt;/Start&gt; Keep studying as you are.</string>
<string name="8383">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Xanos will level up as sorcerer only.]&lt;/Start&gt; Concentrate on magical studies.</string>
<string name="8384">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Xanos will level up as barbarian only.]&lt;/Start&gt; Concentrate on your martial studies.</string>
<string name="8385">Where is your ring? The one Drogan gave us?</string>
<string name="8386">And where do you keep it?</string>
<string name="8387">I wasn&apos;t trying to take it from you...</string>
<string name="8388">Have you thought about your future more since we last talked?</string>
<string name="8389">Don&apos;t get all sentimental on me.</string>
<string name="8390">Yeah, tell me about it...</string>
<string name="8391">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="8392">Reality always tends to kick in eventually.</string>
<string name="8393">Remember your future, Xanos. Don&apos;t give up on it!</string>
<string name="8394">I don&apos;t think whining about it will do you any good.</string>
<string name="8395">What has changed?</string>
<string name="8396">I don&apos;t want to hear this.</string>
<string name="8397">I think you&apos;re making excuses. Shape up!</string>
<string name="8398">Better to stop before you fail.</string>
<string name="8399">Why?</string>
<string name="8400">You will?</string>
<string name="8401">It didn&apos;t affect me.</string>
<string name="8402">Affected you?</string>
<string name="8403">So what can be done?</string>
<string name="8404">Why are you telling me this?</string>
<string name="8405">You&apos;re getting weak, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8406">So tell me of the kingdom &apos;Gentle King Xanos&apos; will rule.</string>
<string name="8407">You seek a harmonious kingdom? I wouldn&apos;t have thought...</string>
<string name="8408">You should create happiness for its own sake.</string>
<string name="8409">You weren&apos;t *that* troubled.</string>
<string name="8410">What are you saying?</string>
<string name="8411">Good. You were never really destined for greatness.</string>
<string name="8412">Are you giving up now?</string>
<string name="8413">Then what am I destined for?</string>
<string name="8414">Indeed...</string>
<string name="8415">That doesn&apos;t sound very selfless...</string>
<string name="8416">Self-preservation?</string>
<string name="8417">If those sorcerer-kings are all gone... do you think it&apos;s a good idea to follow them?</string>
<string name="8418">You&apos;re building your base on the tyrants of old?</string>
<string name="8419">How so?</string>
<string name="8420">Where will you go after you have finished learning? What will you do?</string>
<string name="8421">I wish you luck in your journey.</string>
<string name="8422">How barbaric!</string>
<string name="8423">A modest beginning.</string>
<string name="8424">Your empire and mine will clash eventually, you realize.</string>
<string name="8425">Maybe I&apos;ll come and visit you someday.</string>
<string name="8426">I don&apos;t want to hear any more of this nonsense.</string>
<string name="8427">Good luck with that, then.</string>
<string name="8428">You&apos;ll try to conquer a city?</string>
<string name="8429">I think you&apos;ll need to work a bit more on it...</string>
<string name="8430">A people person? Don&apos;t make me laugh.</string>
<string name="8431">You want to rant a bit more about yourself? Your path to power?</string>
<string name="8432">You realize that eventually I&apos;d have to kill you...</string>
<string name="8433">I&apos;ve had just about enough with your egotism.</string>
<string name="8434">Seeking power for its own sake is not a good goal.</string>
<string name="8435">How would you be better than any of the others?</string>
<string name="8436">The only way to real power is to crush all who oppose you beneath your heel!</string>
<string name="8437">You&apos;d actually be a decent person, then?</string>
<string name="8438">So you&apos;d lie to them to keep them happy?</string>
<string name="8439">Perhaps you will do something useful.</string>
<string name="8440">It&apos;s a wonder an incompetent like you could think up something like that.</string>
<string name="8441">A simplistic theory.</string>
<string name="8442">You overestimate yourself, yet again, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8443">Basically, you just want to be king.</string>
<string name="8444">How can you possibly think you&apos;d become so powerful?</string>
<string name="8445">Why such a craving for power, Xanos?</string>
<string name="8446">Is there nothing else in your life?</string>
<string name="8447">It&apos;s always good to have a goal... if, perhaps, an inappropriate one.</string>
<string name="8448">You&apos;re pretty mouthy for a henchman.</string>
<string name="8449">A budding tyrant...</string>
<string name="8450">Absolute power corrupts absolutely.</string>
<string name="8451">I never said you were a monster!</string>
<string name="8452">Smarter? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="8453">You&apos;re pathetic.</string>
<string name="8454">Again?</string>
<string name="8455">How do you plan to keep it then?</string>
<string name="8456">You will never have more power than me!</string>
<string name="8457">Sounds kind of obsessive to me...</string>
<string name="8458">So you were picked on as a kid... so what?</string>
<string name="8459">Are you going to tell me how you ended up at Drogan&apos;s now?</string>
<string name="8460">You could try explaining, you know.</string>
<string name="8461">You tend to get wrapped up in yourself a lot...</string>
<string name="8462">So... ?</string>
<string name="8463">Just get on with it.</string>
<string name="8464">Some people never change.</string>
<string name="8465">Unlike now...</string>
<string name="8466">Don&apos;t be so hard on yourself.</string>
<string name="8467">Everyone has things they regret doing.</string>
<string name="8468">Some people never change...</string>
<string name="8469">Cry me a river.</string>
<string name="8470">So they drove you out, did they?</string>
<string name="8471">Let&apos;s see this &apos;true might&apos; then.</string>
<string name="8472">Well, &apos;mighty Xanos&apos;, shall we continue?</string>
<string name="8473">I am not impressed.</string>
<string name="8474">You&apos;re kind of funny in a plotting-to-take-over-the-world kind of way.</string>
<string name="8475">So how did you end up coming to Drogan in the first place?</string>
<string name="8476">You&apos;re right... It isn&apos;t very interesting, I guess.</string>
<string name="8477">You know, this attitude is really getting old.</string>
<string name="8478">More likely you&apos;ll be remembering *me*!</string>
<string name="8479">You sure think a lot of yourself, don&apos;t you...</string>
<string name="8480">Do not let your obsessions consume you.</string>
<string name="8481">I&apos;ve heard enough of your monomaniacal ranting!</string>
<string name="8482">You&apos;re set on this path?</string>
<string name="8483">What has shown this?</string>
<string name="8484">And what is this destiny?</string>
<string name="8485">What about the past? It is gone.</string>
<string name="8486">The power shall be mine alone!</string>
<string name="8487">You should learn not to abuse power...</string>
<string name="8488">Whatever it takes? Anything?</string>
<string name="8489">Would you believe I&apos;m interested?</string>
<string name="8490">Just humor me.</string>
<string name="8491">No, not just yet.</string>
<string name="8492">Yes, come with me.</string>
<string name="8493">It wasn&apos;t exactly intentional.</string>
<string name="8494">Heurodis will die, plain and simple.</string>
<string name="8495">We should bide our time.</string>
<string name="8496">Heurodis called it Undrentide.</string>
<string name="8497">Maybe it&apos;s better if you remained behind.</string>
<string name="8498">Fine. But remember what we&apos;re here to do.</string>
<string name="8499">No. You definitely need to stay here.</string>
<string name="8500">Come with me, then. We&apos;ve much to do.</string>
<string name="8501">Maybe so. Don&apos;t get any big ideas, however.</string>
<string name="8502">I am not a slave, no matter what Ashtara thinks.</string>
<string name="8503">A &apos;thank you&apos; would not be out of the question.</string>
<string name="8504">Try not to look her in the eyes again, then.</string>
<string name="8505">I won&apos;t let it happen to me again.</string>
<string name="8506">It&apos;s good to see you, too...</string>
<string name="8507">I think I can do just fine on my own right now.</string>
<string name="8508">That would be a good idea.</string>
<string name="8509">I&apos;m going to head out and look for master Drogan&apos;s stolen artifacts, but he suggested I take someone with me.</string>
<string name="8510">If you really have a problem with it, I&apos;ll check with the others.</string>
<string name="8511">Yeah, I think you do.</string>
<string name="8512">If you see him, tell him to go ahead and talk.</string>
<string name="8513">What is it you want, exactly?</string>
<string name="8514">You seem to talk on behalf of this Xanos quite a bit.</string>
<string name="8515">You? Or Xanos? I get confused.</string>
<string name="8516">Yes, poor Xanos.</string>
<string name="8517">I&apos;ll have to remember to thank him for the sympathy, then.</string>
<string name="8518">I don&apos;t have time to listen to you now...</string>
<string name="8519">And what does Xanos wish to say?</string>
<string name="8520">I will find anything valuable, don&apos;t worry.</string>
<string name="8521">And why are you so interested by who made it?</string>
<string name="8522">Who could have made this?</string>
<string name="8523">Ancient magic?</string>
<string name="8524">You can&apos;t be so sure.</string>
<string name="8525">You mean...</string>
<string name="8526">Perhaps what?</string>
<string name="8527">So?</string>
<string name="8528">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="8529">What&apos;s the problem?</string>
<string name="8530">We do what we must.</string>
<string name="8531">If you want to be a coward, feel free.</string>
<string name="8532">Don&apos;t worry; I&apos;ll be fine.</string>
<string name="8533">If you don&apos;t think you can handle it...</string>
<string name="8534">I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="8535">Then we must retrieve them no matter what!</string>
<string name="8536">If I could harness that power...</string>
<string name="8537">If only master Drogan could tell us more...</string>
<string name="8538">We will proceed with caution then.</string>
<string name="8539">It doesn&apos;t matter. We must get those artifacts!</string>
<string name="8540">What are you suggesting?</string>
<string name="8541">I&apos;m not afraid of the kobolds!</string>
<string name="8542">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="8543">Getting cold feet, Xanos?</string>
<string name="8544">You&apos;re concerned about elven tombs?</string>
<string name="8545">Stop being such a wimp and let&apos;s get going.</string>
<string name="8546">I&apos;ll protect you, don&apos;t worry.</string>
<string name="8547">We won&apos;t die, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8548">You think I care what you want?</string>
<string name="8549">Why so vehement, Xanos?</string>
<string name="8550">We&apos;ll all have revenge for what they did to master Drogan.</string>
<string name="8551">I would think that people here would be more enlightened.</string>
<string name="8552">Then we shouldn&apos;t waste any more time here.</string>
<string name="8553">Don&apos;t get all sentimental.</string>
<string name="8554">So you will protect them?</string>
<string name="8555">He was always a kindly old man... the fool.</string>
<string name="8556">Not everyone only sees what&apos;s on the outside.</string>
<string name="8557">Well you have to admit: you are a brute.</string>
<string name="8558">Don&apos;t be so bitter, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8559">I was never a pet student!</string>
<string name="8560">I&apos;ve worked harder than any of you!</string>
<string name="8561">Maybe we should return to master Drogan...</string>
<string name="8562">Whatever you say, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8563">We shall find them together.</string>
<string name="8564">You always were an egotist Xanos. Don&apos;t overestimate yourself.</string>
<string name="8565">We should have a plan before getting in over our heads.</string>
<string name="8566">Then we should get going!</string>
<string name="8567">We may not get another chance...</string>
<string name="8568">I don&apos;t really care what you have to say.</string>
<string name="8569">Death is always a possibility.</string>
<string name="8570">Our victory is assured, don&apos;t worry.</string>
<string name="8571">You will be welcome to travel by my side.</string>
<string name="8572">I don&apos;t need you to beat Heurodis.</string>
<string name="8573">As you should.</string>
<string name="8574">Thank you, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8575">What is it?</string>
<string name="8576">If they haven&apos;t, we&apos;re lost.</string>
<string name="8577">Would the Asabi know?</string>
<string name="8578">We&apos;d better be on our guard then.</string>
<string name="8579">Where would they be in the city then?</string>
<string name="8580">I don&apos;t need any Winds to defeat Heurodis!</string>
<string name="8581">Of course they did.</string>
<string name="8582">It doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;ll work or not... she&apos;s going to try.</string>
<string name="8583">We won&apos;t fail. Remember destiny.</string>
<string name="8584">Maybe where she fails, I can succeed.</string>
<string name="8585">Let&apos;s hurry up then.</string>
<string name="8586">It will all be mine!</string>
<string name="8587">Our task is more important than that!</string>
<string name="8588">Then let&apos;s get to it.</string>
<string name="8589">You&apos;re right. It&apos;s too old.</string>
<string name="8590">Why not?</string>
<string name="8591">Don&apos;t be such a weakling.</string>
<string name="8592">It&apos;s hard on me too.</string>
<string name="8593">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="8594">You would think he would have sacrificed you instead.</string>
<string name="8595">There is nothing that can be done now.</string>
<string name="8596">He gave his life for everyone.</string>
<string name="8597">Maybe he just lied to make you feel better.</string>
<string name="8598">We must honor his memory with our deeds. </string>
<string name="8599">His spirit is watching over us, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8600">HAHAHAHAHA!</string>
<string name="8601">You&apos;re a henchman. Shut up and hench.</string>
<string name="8602">I am more than capable, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8603">Then we have to kill the master.</string>
<string name="8604">The mythallar will be safe with me.</string>
<string name="8605">We can&apos;t allow that to happen.</string>
<string name="8606">I don&apos;t like it either, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8607">And what am I supposed to do about it?</string>
<string name="8608">So why did you come, then?</string>
<string name="8609">Quit your whining, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8610">I&apos;ve wondered about that, myself.</string>
<string name="8611">What would you rather we be doing?</string>
<string name="8612">You don&apos;t think that&apos;s important?</string>
<string name="8613">If we know why she wants the crystal, we might know how to defeat her.</string>
<string name="8614">And just where would we look for her?</string>
<string name="8615">You make a lot of sense.</string>
<string name="8616">Well, we don&apos;t seem to have a choice, as you said.</string>
<string name="8617">We also stand to gain significant rewards.</string>
<string name="8618">What? Are you afraid of a little danger?</string>
<string name="8619">There&apos;s a stinger behind you.</string>
<string name="8620">Master Drogan is a Harper, and we are helping him.</string>
<string name="8621">Perhaps I could have refused. Too late now.</string>
<string name="8622">I think you underestimate the possibilities here.</string>
<string name="8623">Are you kidding? This is an adventure!</string>
<string name="8624">I owe Master Drogan a lot. This is the least I can do.</string>
<string name="8625">I want revenge, plain and simple.</string>
<string name="8626">Oh, joy.</string>
<string name="8627">You like hearing yourself talk, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="8628">Is that so?</string>
<string name="8629">Don&apos;t force me to kill you, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8630">Complain silently, then, if you must.</string>
<string name="8631">Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="8632">Stay here.</string>
<string name="8633">This is some sort of lens that one could use, but what it is supposed to reveal is a mystery.</string>
<string name="8634">Snowy Pine Tree</string>

This module was designed for 1-4 players of levels 1-7.


</string>
<string name="8636">Xanos could use some of that kind of encouragement too.</string>
<string name="8637">After the way you treated me when I first came to town? I do not think so, half-orc.</string>
<string name="8638">There is an image that will take me years to wash from my mind. Disgusting.</string>
<string name="8639">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Blushes]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh dear, I did not mean for you to overhear that.</string>
<string name="8640">They have a bad reputation, but this one does raise some interesting prospects. It&apos;s not as if the village couldn&apos;t use a little more tax revenue.</string>
<string name="8641">If this fool could become the mayor of a village, just think how much more Xanos will accomplish!</string>
<string name="8642">Ah, violence should always be a last resort, but sometimes it is necessary. As you seem to be good at problem solving, I think we shall become fast friends.</string>
<string name="8643">Discount?! Now there is a word I like to hear!</string>
<string name="8644">The Red Wizards have some powerful magic items, this is most fortunate for us, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8645">I always knew Veraunt was a fool. This could help Hilltop grow into a powerful center for trade. </string>
<string name="8646">I see your friend has a quick mind. She is correct, and I told the Mayor as much.</string>
<string name="8647">Hah! Spoken with a sharp wit! I have great respect for those who know how to wield power. It is unfortunate that your people&apos;s reputation for evil is so well known. Xanos will not make such mistakes.</string>
<string name="8648">Those of my generation are working hard to overcome the reputation of our past. I am glad to know that some of you paid attention in your classes.</string>
<string name="8649">Xanos always pays attention to important details.</string>
<string name="8650">Hmph. Tell me when you are finished fraternizing with tiny little men, &lt;FirstName&gt;, so we can get on with the business at hand.</string>
<string name="8651">Fraternizing, eh? Is the big lug jealous?</string>
<string name="8652">Jealous? Of you? Ha ha ha ha! How utterly amusing!</string>
<string name="8653">Yep. Jealous, just like I thought. Sad, sad thing.</string>
<string name="8654">You&apos;re a bit of a cheeky halfling, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="8655">Hah! Maybe just a little bit, my good lady dwarf! Perhaps you&apos;d care to join me, yourself, in the enjoyment of some fine wine, hmm?</string>
<string name="8656">Sorry. I make it a policy never to date men whom I could crush accidentally.</string>
<string name="8657">Oh? It&apos;d be a pleasant enough way to go.</string>
<string name="8658">Flatterer. You say that now. But enough... we&apos;ve business to speak of.</string>
<string name="8659">Oh. Well, then, have fun!</string>
<string name="8660">Have fun!</string>
<string name="8661">Hmph. Why do you waste time speaking to such insignificant fools, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="8662">Insignificant, eh? You just call Torias that because you can&apos;t attract a woman to save your life, I suppose?</string>
<string name="8663">Don&apos;t be ridiculous!</string>
<string name="8664">Yep. Just like I thought. Sad thing, that.</string>
<string name="8665">All of them. But I am sure &lt;FirstName&gt; wishes more than a simple kiss, foolish girl. Ha ha ha!</string>
<string name="8666">All of them. Trust me.</string>
<string name="8667">Ha ha ha haaa! Whatever you had planned, &lt;FirstName&gt;, Xanos is sure it is not going to happen now!</string>
<string name="8668">Mmm. Just wait... he gets more suave as the day progresses.</string>
<string name="8669">Xanos!</string>
<string name="8670">Hey!</string>
<string name="8671">A deal is a deal. I can respect that.</string>
<string name="8672">You are letting them go, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Pfah. Foolishness.</string>
<string name="8673">Hmph. You would think one might be grateful to be saved from kobolds...</string>
<string name="8674">Ah, well. It was a nice try, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8675">Hmm. You wield that hammer like a dwarf. It&apos;s no wonder they ran off.</string>
<string name="8676">Now that&apos;s a compliment if I ever heard one. Thank you, Dorna.</string>
<string name="8677">Perhaps the others thought that you might smother them in your over ample bosum and ran away?</string>
<string name="8678">It&apos;s a possibility. Or is that just you wishing out loud, Xanos? Ha ha ha!!</string>
<string name="8679">I... &lt;StartAction&gt;[shudder]&lt;/Start&gt;...</string>
<string name="8680">You are a rather strange woman, Fiona. I guess that&apos;s why I always enjoyed your company.</string>
<string name="8681">And I enjoyed yours, little thief. I have even forgiven you for that short sword you borrowed.</string>
<string name="8682">You knew... oh... sorry.</string>
<string name="8683">Xanos finds you to be an odd, yet exciting woman; so large and strong.</string>
<string name="8684">You are also a powerful personality, Xanos. You are one of the only half-orcs I have ever met and liked.</string>
<string name="8685">Actually, I would have to agree with Fiona here, I would never pay so much for Xanos. I might pay that much to see him locked in a cell, however. Hmmmm...</string>
<string name="8686">I take exception to that! Xanos is worth far more than a mere 2000 gold!</string>
<string name="8687">This is pointless, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Why do you bother? Gah.</string>
<string name="8688">We still can, dear woman. You say he is here, somewhere?</string>
<string name="8689">Your mother escaped from slavery, then?</string>
<string name="8690">Yes, but not for long. She died of disease years later, and both Glendir and I were raised by an aunt. She did not... approve of Glendir.</string>
<string name="8691">Hmph. I suppose your mother was rewarded to him, as well?</string>
<string name="8692">Better than the fool who had to be blindfolded and drugged to spend the evening with your mother, Xanos.</string>
<string name="8693">Heh. Xanos likes this woman, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8694">Pff. Leave it to the elves to build something only to forget it.</string>
<string name="8695">I&apos;ve heard tell of Ascalhorn. That&apos;s an ancient place, long ago destroyed. I knew it was in this region, but I had no idea it was near here.</string>
<string name="8696">Hmph. Do you elven types not simply intervene in the business of others out of force of habit?</string>
<string name="8697">Perhaps so, but now we&apos;ve two trails to follow instead of just one. Ah, well.</string>
<string name="8698">So did the gnolls kill them all or what? Tell Xanos!</string>
<string name="8699">No doubt. That could not have gone well for the kobolds. Gnolls are large and fearsome creatures.</string>
<string name="8700">Hmph. If the elves have abandoned this place, perhaps they will not mind if we help ourselves to its treasures, eh? We can deal with any... protections.</string>
<string name="8701">So Ascalhorn was near here. That&apos;s an old tale even by elven standards, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8702">Very smooth, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Nicely played.</string>
<string name="8703">This one is hardly worth arguing with, &lt;FirstName&gt;. He is more dense than you, hah!</string>
<string name="8704">I am a dwarf too, giant. I am as big as I will ever get.</string>
<string name="8705">Maybe me lock you in cage with wifey. Then we watch you grow with her.</string>
<string name="8706">Alright... shutting up now.</string>
<string name="8707">Bah! What a horrid noise this creature makes. Xanos can carry a tune better than him, and singing is not my forte.</string>
<string name="8708">He is... really big. Let&apos;s play this carefully, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8709">I would call him the god of pathetic fools. I notice you never heal adventurers for free. I guess your generosity only extends so far.</string>
<string name="8710">In other words, you got lazy and complacent, so now you are suffering for not spending more time helping the suffering. I love irony.</string>
<string name="8711">I don&apos;t see us ever finding much common ground, follower of Vergadain.</string>
<string name="8712">Last month this prophet told me that my future was carved in stone and even a hard heart could not prepare me. Let us not linger near him long.</string>
<string name="8713">Last month he was predicting that I would be eaten by a white dragon. What a fool.</string>
<string name="8714">Impure thoughts? That&apos;s not what the tavern gossip says.</string>
<string name="8715">Impure thoughts? That&apos;s not what the tavern gossip says.</string>
<string name="8716">That would be the ones that came from Drogan&apos;s, without question. So they left by the gate, eh? Good. We can follow them there.</string>
<string name="8717">They left by the gate? It somehow seems wrong that they would savage the town and then leave politely by the front door.</string>
<string name="8718">&lt;FirstName&gt; is full of all kinds of bravado, never worry.</string>
<string name="8719">What do you know about anything, fool? Hmph.</string>
<string name="8720">Hmm. Are you a true fortune-teller, then? Or a fake? Because if you&apos;re a fake I&apos;ll be quite disappointed.</string>
<string name="8721">No matter what I say, good dwarf, you shall decide for yourself anyhow.</string>
<string name="8722">That&apos;s what they all say. I hate that.</string>
<string name="8723">Be careful, &lt;FirstName&gt;. This one&apos;s as batty as they come. Xanos can tell.</string>
<string name="8724">Ah. And you are without a doubt the selfish half-orc. I am pleased to meet you, tall one.</string>
<string name="8725">Yes, yes. How very perceptive of you, teeny woman.</string>
<string name="8726">Be careful, friend. You will regret your selfish desires in the end. Mark my words, if you dare.</string>
<string name="8727">Are you positive it wasn&apos;t the townsfolk who tried to throw a bunch of ragamuffin Vistani out of the village?</string>
<string name="8728">Not at all. I&apos;m very certain it was the kobolds. I&apos;m not so certain how the locals feel about rude half-orcs, however.</string>
<string name="8729">Better that than trying to kill you.</string>
<string name="8730">Well, truth be told they made a fair attempt at that, as well.</string>
<string name="8731">Hmmm. Xanos seems to recall Master Drogan mentioning these little merchants. They have been coming through this town for many years.</string>
<string name="8732">For generations, actually. It&apos;s something like a family trading route we follow.</string>
<string name="8733">I&apos;ve heard mention of this caravan. Master Drogan said these halflings come through here on a regular basis and have for many years.</string>
<string name="8734">I wonder if there&apos;s a reward in it for us? What do you think, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="8735">Make sure you ask her for a reward up front, &lt;FirstName&gt;. These halflings will rob you blind if you give them half the chance.</string>
<string name="8736">It would take someone with more arcane knowledge than I possess to tell you the exact value and properties of this item.</string>
<string name="8737">That is a lot of gold, but should we really do this, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="8738">I only ask because we might have need of the powers of the hand later. It is a large sum of money though, so I don&apos;t blame you if you do sell it.</string>
<string name="8739">Are you sure we should be doing this, &lt;FirstName&gt;? </string>
<string name="8740">I only ask because we might have need of the powers of the hand later. It is up to you though. Muddle through things however you like.</string>
<string name="8741">Why shouldn&apos;t I?</string>
<string name="8742">Afraid of what Drogan might say?</string>
<string name="8743">Why shouldn&apos;t I?</string>
<string name="8744">Afraid of what Drogan might say?</string>
<string name="8745">That was a great sacrifice. I well know how one comes to the point where a principle is more important than loyalty.</string>
<string name="8746">Xanos shall have such power and more, but he shall not make the same mistakes. Xanos knows how to learn from the past.</string>
<string name="8747">Giant spiders? There had better be a great reward for fighting them.</string>
<string name="8748">Poisonous creatures, just what Xanos needs! How I wish my constitution were more suited to fighting off such things. The reward had better be worth the effort.</string>
<string name="8749">I will help you.</string>
<string name="8750">Yip, yip, grrr! Why you comes here? Who be you who so tough that you comes past barricade?</string>
<string name="8751">Hah! Now is our chance. Choose your words carefully, &lt;FirstName&gt;</string>
<string name="8752">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Whispers to you.]&lt;/Start&gt; Choose your words carefully and we could walk out of here without a fight.</string>
<string name="8753">Their eyes gleam with intelligence, but their mouths prove the eyes wrong.</string>
<string name="8754">I always heard that kobolds were clever. Obviously there is a difference between clever and smart.</string>
<string name="8755">Then... then we must make the trek westward towards Silverymoon. I can only hope we will all survive to see it.</string>
<string name="8756"> Fare you well, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="8757">No... no, I can&apos;t let you do this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Hilltop is fine, all of you... go there and they will surely give you safe haven. &lt;FirstName&gt; is... mistaken.</string>
<string name="8758">I see. We thank you both, then. I hope you are right... we shall try to make it to Hilltop now.</string>
<string name="8759">Hee hee hee... &lt;StartAction&gt;[snicker!]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="8760">Then we must chance that Hilltop still stands. I can only pray it is so.</string>
<string name="8761">Hmph. These folk come from Blumberg, eh? Well maybe they should have defended their village better.</string>
<string name="8762">So these are the last survivors of Blumberg. How very sad.</string>
<string name="8763">This is pointless, &lt;FirstName&gt;. They cannot even reward us! Look at them! Let us move on.</string>
<string name="8764">Oh, come now, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Surely we can let these poor people free, at least.</string>
<string name="8765">Well, that&apos;s new, at least. I wonder if we can negotiate with him?</string>
<string name="8766">Pfaugh! If only it could learn to do so without spitting quite so much!</string>
<string name="8767">Be silent, mongrel!</string>
<string name="8768">May we kill him now? Xanos grows weary of these stupid gnolls.</string>
<string name="8769">Oh, let&apos;s kill him, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Please.</string>
<string name="8770">What is this J&apos;Nah? Xanos has never heard of female gnolls ruling a tribe before, power or no.</string>
<string name="8771">This J&apos;Nah... she is a gnoll? That doesn&apos;t sound like a very gnoll-ish name.</string>
<string name="8772">There are ruins beneath these caves? How interesting. Perhaps this J&apos;Nah came here for the ruins and these gnolls were just incidental to her plan?</string>
<string name="8773">So there be ruins underneath the caves. That makes more sense. No self-respecting sorcerer would live in such dirty caves willingly.</string>
<string name="8774">Bah. She wants the same thing from the artifacts as she does from the ruins. Power, of course. They say she is a sorceress, after all.</string>
<string name="8775">Smells like an elf but isn&apos;t one? A drow, perhaps? One would think even a gnoll could recognize a drow, however. How odd.</string>
<string name="8776">So this J&apos;Nah has one of the artifacts for certain. That is good to know.</string>
<string name="8777">Only one of the artifacts, eh? It figures.</string>
<string name="8778">I hope you didn&apos;t actually think you were fooling anyone.</string>
<string name="8779">Hah! Here it comes.</string>
<string name="8780">But we&apos;re not the gnolls, obviously. Why lie to us?</string>
<string name="8781">Well... you *could* have been with the gnolls. How was I supposed to know?</string>
<string name="8782">You thought we were with the gnolls? Now that&apos;s just rich.</string>
<string name="8783">Maybe not. But we could still kill you. That would be better than listening to any more of this prattle.</string>
<string name="8784">So... you want them to help us fight the chieftain, &lt;FirstName&gt;? And that&apos;s supposed to be helpful? Well, I suppose we&apos;ll see.</string>
<string name="8785">Bah. I am so sick of kobolds. Could we not just kill them and be done with it?</string>
<string name="8786">Hah! Now that would be an interesting match; you should go for it!</string>
<string name="8787">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Snicker]&lt;/Start&gt; Now there&apos;s an interesting proposal!</string>
<string name="8788">Ah, this explains so much. You must be &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;race&gt; student of Drogan&apos;s. You see? I have done my research.</string>
<string name="8789">What power that would be! If only one could find a way to harness such power for more than a single use!</string>
<string name="8790">Now we are fighting dragons? What do you think you are getting me into, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Of course, if we can survive... just think of the rewards.</string>
<string name="8791">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Whispers to you.]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I have a bad feeling about this. Watch her eyes; she has the fire of a demon burning in them, indeed.</string>
<string name="8792">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Whispers to you.]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I have a bad feeling about this. Watch her eyes; she has the fire of a demon burning in them, indeed.</string>
<string name="8793">Now this is a sight I just have to see. We have got to help this little fellow. </string>
<string name="8794">&lt;FirstName&gt;, I am getting rather tired of kobolds. I just wish they were a touch smarter; more like me than you, hah!</string>
<string name="8795">This is going to be good!</string>
<string name="8796">This Xanos must witness. Maybe there is a practical use for kobolds.</string>
<string name="8797">That&apos;s rather noble of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If this creature keeps its word, Hilltop could be safe for a very long time.</string>
<string name="8798">Hmph. That is a waste of rewards, if you ask Xanos.</string>
<string name="8799">Oooo... Xanos is suddenly filled with excitement!</string>
<string name="8800">Bargaining with a dragon, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Your call.</string>
<string name="8801">An interesting justification. Xanos could hardly do better.</string>
<string name="8802">It is not a justification, half-orc. I do not need one to act as I wish.</string>
<string name="8803">Indeed. Xanos could only hope for such power one day.</string>
<string name="8804">Do not hold your breath. Now... where was I? Ah, yes, speaking to the &lt;race&gt; one.</string>
<string name="8805">A rather interesting justification for your betrayal, dragon. Not that I object. Indeed, it&apos;s only too bad the two of you haven&apos;t killed each other already.</string>
<string name="8806">Are you still speaking, little dwarf? I find your &lt;master/mistress&gt; to be much more entertaining, so be silent.</string>
<string name="8807">&lt;He/She&gt; is not my &lt;master/mistress&gt;, dragon. We are comrades, and I&apos;ll speak as often as I wish.</string>
<string name="8808">Such bravado. You would almost think I couldn&apos;t hear your dwarven heart beating like a cornered rabbit&apos;s. No, I will speak to your &lt;master/mistress&gt; now.</string>
<string name="8809">Hmph. Perhaps you should have tried a student with a few more wits, dragon.</string>
<string name="8810">And would that be you, little orc? Are you casting about for a new master?</string>
<string name="8811">Xanos can think of worse things than to learn of his power from the greatest of Faerun&apos;s races.</string>
<string name="8812">My my, quite a sly tongue you have there. Almost as quick as Deekin&apos;s. Too bad the boy was such a slow learner.</string>
<string name="8813">Not much has changed, as far as I can see.</string>
<string name="8814">Oh? How about I twitch a little in your direction and see how the famous dwarven stamina holds up, hmm?</string>
<string name="8815">If you wish. I refuse to be intimidated by you, lizard.</string>
<string name="8816">Yes, yes, how very droll. How the other races must be thankful your kind bury yourselves underground. Now... where was I? Ah, yes, Deekin. He was a slow learner, indeed.</string>
<string name="8817">The machine has been fixed and has been used to raise the boulder blocking the passage leading to Tymofarrar.</string>
<string name="8818">Hmph. He has good point, maybe.</string>
<string name="8819">He&apos;s got you there, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8820">That&apos;s probably an understatement.</string>
<string name="8821">Pfeh. You would nead a lot of anything to really hurts him. Err... I mean... to really hurt him. (Bloody kobold.)</string>
<string name="8822">At least until you get there.</string>
<string name="8823">Yes. Nice places. Now leave them alone like a good doggie.</string>
<string name="8824">You&apos;re lying. Pfah! &lt;FirstName&gt;, this creature knows nothing!</string>
<string name="8825">That conjures a really strange image. I don&apos;t know why.</string>
<string name="8826">I certainly hope you weren&apos;t thinking of giving up Xanos to travel with vermin, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That would be insulting.</string>
<string name="8827">Hey! Standing right here. We don&apos;t need his help, you know.</string>
<string name="8828">Hmph. Perhaps you should have tried another spell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Such as Lightning Bolt.</string>
<string name="8829">Damn. I was hoping that would be a quick way out for us, here.</string>
<string name="8830">Bah! We are not going to negotiate with this creature, are we? Kill it, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Kill it before it irritates me further!</string>
<string name="8831">Well, you have to give him credit where it&apos;s due. He&apos;s not as dumb as most kobolds.</string>
<string name="8832">Oh. That is *all* you wish from us, vermin?</string>
<string name="8833">I think the little reptile is actually blackmailing us, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8834">You broke the statue? Is that even possible? Will you give it to us?</string>
<string name="8835">You have the tower statue? Hand it over now, you little vermin, before we kill you!</string>
<string name="8836">Ahhh! No hurts Deekin! Deekin just tries to talk peaceful!</string>
<string name="8837">Hmph. It would be much like having a mouse show up on your doorstep and claim to be a relative, Xanos thinks.</string>
<string name="8838">Well, he has a point there. I&apos;ve always thought kobolds were more dog-like, myself. All that yapping and so forth.</string>
<string name="8839">Dragons enjoy power, like any intelligent being. Even Xanos knows that.</string>
<string name="8840">Dragons are greedy. I would still like to know how he even found out about them.</string>
<string name="8841">I&apos;m not so certain your master would listen as &lt;FirstName&gt; tells him a two-day lullaby, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
<string name="8842">You hear that, &lt;FirstName&gt;? You only need to speak of the mating habit of orcs to defeat it. Ha ha haa!</string>
<string name="8843">So? Why aren&apos;t you off writing your story, little vermin?</string>
<string name="8844">So you are some kind of jester kobold? How interesting. That doesn&apos;t explain why you&apos;re here.</string>
<string name="8845">Eh? What&apos;s this? Another kobold? Shall we kill it now, you think?</string>
<string name="8846">By the gods! It&apos;s... a kobold. And it apparently wants to talk to us.</string>
<string name="8847">Hmph. It is likely story. As in not likely at all.</string>
<string name="8848">And you didn&apos;t give the gnolls any help here, I suppose?</string>
<string name="8849">Xanos cannot begin to guess. You seem very stringy and unwholesomely annoying.</string>
<string name="8850">If it was the only way to keep you quiet, even I might be willing to give it a try.</string>
<string name="8851">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Tymofarrar is dead.</string>
<string name="8852">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, I talked to Tymofarrar...</string>
<string name="8853">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Charm Person]&lt;/Start&gt; I think you want to give me that statue now.</string>
<string name="8854">Take care what you say, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I sense great power within this unassuming hermit.</string>
<string name="8855">It did seem rather powerful. I probably should have bought it, but for some reason I can&apos;t remember I decided against it.  Hmmm, seems strange to me now.</string>
<string name="8856">A hermit in the middle of nowhere, selling powerful magic items? This seems more than a little strange.</string>
<string name="8857">Not so much more strange than a dwarf with sticky fingers traveling with a &lt;race&gt; &lt;class&gt;. </string>
<string name="8858">Not so much more strange than a dwarf with sticky fingers traveling with an &lt;race&gt; &lt;class&gt;. </string>
<string name="8859">Well, I suppose that might be true.</string>
<string name="8860">Nevermind. I&apos;ll walk.</string>
<string name="8861">Goblin Note</string>
<string name="8862">Master mean to send us down here. He says look for magic stuff. No find nothing! Days and days go by. Mung and Jer all gone now. Me no go back now, master be angry. Me starve, less painful than master&apos;s anger. Lever makes pretty light...me thinks pathways with same pretty light safe. Mung and Jer no believe me and now they dead -- they went down the wrong path and burned all up. Me right, but me no fight flying imps by self. Me eat boots now and hope for best...</string>

<string name="8864">Chapter 1</string>
<string name="8865">&lt;FirstName&gt; is one of a select few students to Master Drogan, a famous dwarven adventurer who has retired to the remote village of Hilltop in the region of Faerun known as the Silver Marches to live out the remainder of his years in relative quiet as he passes on his knowledge to the next generation. 

Much of &lt;FirstName&gt;&apos;s personal belongings can be found in the footlocker next to &lt;his/her&gt; bed, including the magical Ring of Mystra which Drogan has forged for each of his students. Its range is limited to a mere mile or so, but the ring allows its bearer to teleport to Drogan&apos;s side at will... or, when badly injured, it does so automatically. A useful device for training young students, even though the ring has its limitations: the main one being that it requires special &quot;focus crystals&quot; to power each use, voluntary or no. Drogan once showed &lt;FirstName&gt; how to make more focus crystals using a collection of gemstones and a special machine within his personal laboratory upstairs.

&lt;FirstName&gt; has been Drogan&apos;s student the longest and is the nearest to graduation... and once that day comes the Ring of Mystra will no longer protect &lt;him/her&gt; from the dangers and adventures &lt;he/she&gt; will face. Who knows? Perhaps that day will come sooner than anyone suspects...</string>

<string name="8899">If you seek the one who once suffered here, he is gone. My sisters have taken him on high and console him there, even now.</string>
<string name="8900">Goodbye to you, Seeker.</string>
<string name="8901">And he with you. It is why I stayed here, awaiting your return. He says to thank you for all that you have taught him by your forgiveness. If you seek the Wise Wind, he said he&apos;d be there when you found it.</string>

<string name="8903">We have found ourselves an ally, it would seem. A wise choice, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="8904">Through a noble act, your forgiveness, you will have assistance from the one who suffered.</string>
<string name="8905">My sisters? They have taken him to his redemption. New laws have been written, the old ones cast away. With proper penitence and sorrow, the sins of mortal life are now forgiven in the eternal.</string>
<string name="8906">My sisters? They have taken him to his redemption. New laws have been written, the old ones cast away. With proper penitence and sorrow, the sins of mortal life are now forgiven in the eternal.</string>

<string name="8909">Deekin could writes new law... um... everyone listens to Deekin, or... um... gets poked in eye with pointy stick...</string>
<string name="8910">Making laws like that could lead you to burning in the pits, little one.</string>
<string name="8911">His name was Karsus, Archwizard of Netheril. Perhaps you did not know him. He saw the soul of the world, a crime for which the demons held him here, tormenting him for many an age.</string>
<string name="8912">Thank you and goodbye.</string>
<string name="8913">I had hoped to speak with him.</string>
<string name="8914">Why have your sisters taken him?</string>
<string name="8915">Who was here?</string>
<string name="8916">You understand what I say, do you not? Besides, my slave, perhaps you will find some other way out of here when my foolish thralls cannot. You see why I must keep you under my thumb?</string>
<string name="8917">If I ever free myself from this collar, I shall make no small effort in hunting you down and staking you out in the middle of the desert.</string>
<string name="8918">You are welcome to try, but I doubt it would do you any good. If you get free of the collar, do not waste your life on petty revenge.</string>
<string name="8919">Xanos is outraged that you would keep me in this collar. I suppose that is why you do it, but I am outraged none-the-less!</string>
<string name="8920">The collar will not kill you, but it will keep me safe. Your outrage is not my concern.</string>
<string name="8921">Oooo! Does Deekin gets free, too?</string>
<string name="8922">Naturally. I assume your &lt;master/mistress&gt; will have need of you, though I can hardly imagine for what.</string>
<string name="8923">That be good. Deekin need to stay with boss if he goings to finish epic story.</string>
<string name="8924">Mmm. Well, if I ever hear some badly-worded mish-mash of a tale about a ragtag &lt;race&gt; hero and &lt;his/her&gt; kobold companion, I&apos;ll know where it came from.</string>
<string name="8925">See, boss? Deekin makes you famous!</string>
<string name="8926">Yes? Speak then, for your master listens.</string>
<string name="8927">Perhaps you would like to barter a little? Business keeps one&apos;s mind active and one&apos;s pockets full...</string>
<string name="8928">The same way you speak the language of the Asabi as if you were born to it... It is the magic of the mythal that does it. Either it is still active after all these years or its magic has been launched anew.</string>
<string name="8929">Until my thralls have cleared the passageway, I have no business but with you. Ask, my slave, and I will answer as I am able.</string>
<string name="8930">It is said to be the breath of life, the wisdom of ages, the sands of time. It is the magic that gave immortality to those who mastered it and allowed entire cities such as this to float on air.</string>
<string name="8931">You need only look at the word to know my answer. The powers of the mythal are a myth, a mirage. If those who wielded it were so great, why do these cities now lie buried and forgotten? I seek no power but what gold itself can give.</string>
<string name="8932">Perhaps you do, perhaps you don&apos;t. The mythal&apos;s magic is said to exist outside the very bounds of time itself. I understand as little of it as you.</string>
<string name="8933">Let it never be so, for to live in such a world is not to live at all.</string>
<string name="8934">That is true but Asabi is what I hear all the same, for it is what I know. When Undrentide still flew, people from a thousand lands flocked to it. Through the mythal&apos;s magic all could share their wisdom without hindrance... Slaves and masters, too.</string>
<string name="8935">Stories of the fabled flying cities of Netheril have long been told amongst the Asabi. Some have even been found and empires have been fashioned from their riches. I would build such an empire, my slave, and make all the desert fear me.</string>
<string name="8936">Three moons ago, I gambled in a tent with a rival merchant friend, the two of us drunk on the wine of the cactus. He confessed to me that in the shifting sands, he had found the uppermost spires of the Lost City of Undrentide.</string>
<string name="8937">I did what Merchant Princes do. I let him win at gambling, then tracked him here with a plan to kill him and steal his glory as my own... Someone, perhaps it was you, saved me the trouble.</string>
<string name="8938">You sounds much like Old Master. He says he wants power over everything too, but Deekin is now free!</string>
<string name="8939">Take a handful of sand and squeeze it tightly and you shall see what comes to tyrants in the desert. When you relax your fist to view what you hold, there will be nothing left but a speck of dust.</string>
<string name="8940">What would you know of such things, my little slave? Leave the bothers of politics to your superiors.</string>
<string name="8941">Xanos knows what it is to desire such power. Why then do I find the thought growing less appealing? Forgive me... I am not quite myself right now.</string>
<string name="8942">These clothes you wear, they mark you as being not of the desert. You would weaken and die quickly. I would get the best price in the gladiator pits of Ammar where you could live out a short and glorious life before you die.</string>
<string name="8943">The Asabi? We are the desert kin, the dune walkers... We were here long before your kind and will still be here long after you have gone. I don&apos;t know how else to answer you.</string>
<string name="8944">You might as well ask the wind of its beginning or insist a grain of sand tell how it got its shape. I am a child of the desert sea and the sunbaked sand. The dune where my egg hatched has long since become another.</string>
<string name="8945">Heurodis, is it? Do all your enemies have such pretty names? Come, you must tell me of her.</string>
<string name="8946">Very well, but you had best be careful, slave, or your master will come to think the same of you.</string>
<string name="8947">The desert brings madness to many and the sands, as you can see, hide their secrets long and well... Alas, you have the misfortune of being slave to a merchant, not a warrior. I will aid you as only a merchant can but, beyond that, I cannot help.</string>
<string name="8948">Ah, that would explain the tremors that have collapsed the tunnel and trapped us here... Alas, you have the misfortune of being slave to a merchant, not a warrior. I will aid you as only a merchant can but, beyond that, I cannot help.</string>
<string name="8949">If it comes as any consolation, we do not seem to be free of these sands yet. This Heurodis of yours fights against the weight of centuries. Time is her enemy as much as it is yours.</string>
<string name="8950">We will need no more assistance than access to supplies. This time she shall not take us by surprise.</string>
<string name="8951">Ah, that would explain the predicament I found you in, wouldn&apos;t it... Alas, you have the misfortune of being slave to a merchant, not a warrior. </string>
<string name="8952">I will aid you as only a merchant can but, beyond that, I cannot help.</string>
<string name="8953">Xanos has endured the humbling experience of petrification, but do not expect me to take the humiliation of slavery well!</string>
<string name="8954">I expect you will do as you are told, or you will never achieve freedom.</string>
<string name="8955">Ha! The stone has not numbed your wit, I see. We found some rival Asabi near you, some cut by blade and burnt by spell but others frozen into stone.</string>
<string name="8956">I don&apos;t know your beautiful Heurodis, slave, but I am wise enough to know I never want to.</string>
<string name="8957">&lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;&apos;s wit never dulls and Deekin writes quickly to keeps up with all &lt;his/her&gt; deeds.</string>
<string name="8958">Ten guardians, built of magic and metal, protect the riches of this place. Destroy them all, my slave, and you will have made a friend of your master.</string>
<string name="8959">My only promise was that we&apos;d discuss it. Consider that promise fulfilled... In truth I had hoped the passageway would be clear by now and I could free you without concern for my safety but alas, it is not so.</string>
<string name="8960">Regardless, you have earned some portion of my trust. Go where you will, explore the various towers, I will not trouble you. And until my thralls have cleared that passage, I will remain here, happy to trade wares with you.</string>
<string name="8961">Sadly, a wise decision, for if I were free right now, I think I would throttle you with my own bare hands!</string>
<string name="8962">Can you not hear? ...Ah, see how I have already begun to think of you as kin? We Asabi have no ears in the way you know them. Instead we listen with the very surface of our skin.</string>
<string name="8963">Once my thralls told me what to listen for, I have heard them waiting there like ghosts. Their whisper still remains upon my skin and that is how I know your task is not yet done.</string>
<string name="8964">Once my thralls told me what to listen for, I could always hear them waiting there like ghosts. Now their whisper has faded from my skin and that is how I know you have succeeded in your task.</string>
<string name="8965">You mean everybody not hears like that? What you think boss hears with? Big, fleshy bits on side of head?</string>
<string name="8966">There is no room for you to lend a hand within the passageway. Let my poor thralls bash themselves silly against the fallen rock. For you, I have grander plans...</string>
<string name="8967">We had only begun our explorations when the tremors sealed us in. There are riches untold out there and if I leave this place without them, my rivals will claim them in my stead.</string>
<string name="8968">Don&apos;t be a fool. Would I bother to summon you from your life of stone for a simple fetch and carry? I have thralls enough for that. I need you to do what they cannot.</string>
<string name="8969">Nor do I ask you to be! Hear me out before you speak your disrespect. I have thralls enough to fetch my treasure but I already lost two to the guardians who watch over it.</string>
<string name="8970">Some golem-maker long ago did fine business here, it seems. As they explored, my thralls reported ten golems standing guard. I want this place to be cleared of every single one of them.</string>
<string name="8971">Then take this key. It will allow you to leave this camp in safety. Should you ever need supplies, I will gladly trade what I have for what you find. See? Kind is the master who does not ask too much.</string>
<string name="8972">Ah, now that is a loving whisper to my heart. Before I forget, however, take this key. It will allow you to leave this camp in safety.</string>
<string name="8973">Will you have earned your freedom? Is that what you seek, my slave? Return to me when the task is complete and we shall discuss it. I promise nothing more.</string>
<string name="8974">And do these plans include me?</string>
<string name="8975">I should like to put you to use clearing the tunnel, since digging in the earth is what your race seems to like best...</string>
<string name="8976">Not all dwarves are miners! That would be like me saying that all lizards lay around in the sun all day.</string>
<string name="8977">I shall forgive you this once for calling me a lizard. Do so again and I shall cut out your tongue. Had you let me finish, I was going to say that you will be most useful assisting your &lt;race&gt; friend here.</string>
<string name="8978">And what of the mighty Xanos? Have you plans for him as well?</string>
<string name="8979">You made an overly large paperweight, and were far too ugly as a statue. The only purpose I can see for you is to serve your friend here.</string>
<string name="8980">Xanos is too weary to argue about who should be serving whom. I will do as you say.</string>
<string name="8981">As if you had any choice, my large, monstrous slave. I do like your accent though. Now, where was I? Oh, yes.</string>
<string name="8982">You gots plans for Deekin, too?</string>
<string name="8983">Hardly. As a primitive thing, you should be pleased that I released you to serve your &lt;master/mistress&gt;. That is what I assume you are for.</string>
<string name="8984">Deeken serves boss, yup. Deekin also writer of great, epic tale!</string>
<string name="8985">Yes, well. Be that as it may, your place is best kept at the side of your &lt;race&gt; friend, here. Now... where was I? Oh, yes.</string>
<string name="8986">The same way you speak the language of the Asabi as if you were born to it... It is the magic of the mythal that does it. Either it is still active after all these years or its magic has been launched anew.</string>
<string name="8987">Until my thralls have cleared the passageway, I have no business but with you. Ask, my slave, and I will answer as I am able.</string>
<string name="8988">It is said to be the breath of life, the wisdom of ages, the sands of time. It is the magic that gave immortality to those who mastered it and allowed entire cities such as this to float on air.</string>
<string name="8989">You need only look at the word to know my answer. The powers of the mythal are a myth, a mirage. If those who wielded it were so great, why do these cities now lie buried and forgotten? I seek no power but what gold itself can give.</string>
<string name="8990">Perhaps you do, perhaps you don&apos;t. The mythal&apos;s magic is said to exist outside the very bounds of time itself. I understand as little of it as you.</string>
<string name="8991">Let it never be so, for to live in such a world is not to live at all.</string>
<string name="8992">That is true but Asabi is what I hear all the same, for it is what I know. When Undrentide still flew, people from a thousand lands flocked to it. Through the mythal&apos;s magic all could share their wisdom without hindrance... Slaves and masters, too.</string>
<string name="8993">That is good, for I am no man. I am Ashtara, Merchant Prince of the Asabi tribes. We are a little more cold-blooded in our dealings, you might say, and you remain my slave all the same.</string>
<string name="8994">I should not have told you my name. Already you use it far too freely. I may be a kind master but I am your master all the same. What is it you would ask of me?</string>
<string name="8995">Stories of the fabled flying cities of Netheril have long been told amongst the Asabi. Some have even been found and empires have been fashioned from their riches. I would build such an empire, my slave, and make all the desert fear me.</string>
<string name="8996">Three moons ago, I gambled in a tent with a rival merchant friend, the two of us drunk on the wine of the cactus. He confessed to me that in the shifting sands, he had found the uppermost spires of the Lost City of Undrentide.</string>
<string name="8997">I did what Merchant Princes do. I let him win at gambling, then tracked him here with a plan to kill him and steal his glory as my own... Someone, perhaps it was you, saved me the trouble.</string>
<string name="8998">You sounds much like Old Master. He says he wants power over everything too, but Deekin is now free!</string>
<string name="8999">Take a handful of sand and squeeze it tightly and you shall see what comes to tyrants in the desert. When you relax your fist to view what you hold, there will be nothing left but a speck of dust.</string>
<string name="9000">What would you know of such things, my little slave? Leave the bothers of politics to your superiors.</string>
<string name="9001">Xanos knows what it is to desire such power. Why then do I find the thought growing less appealing? Forgive me... I am not quite myself right now.</string>

<string name="9005">Yes, you probably should. In time, however, you will come to thank me for placing that collar around your neck. As long as you wear it, I am safe from your vengeance and you from your own folly.</string>
<string name="9006">I freed you from your stone prison because I have need of you. But need is a blade that cuts both ways. You will find that I am not that harsh a master.</string>
<string name="9007">Heurodis, is it? Do all your enemies have such pretty names? Come, you must tell me of her.</string>
<string name="9008">Very well, but you had best be careful, slave, or your master will come to think the same of you.</string>
<string name="9009">The desert brings madness to many and the sands, as you can see, hide their secrets long and well... Alas, you have the misfortune of being slave to a merchant, not a warrior. I will aid you as only a merchant can but, beyond that, I cannot help.</string>

<string name="9019">&lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;&apos;s wit never dulls and Deekin writes quickly to keeps up with all &lt;his/her&gt; deeds.</string>
<string name="9020">Is it not enough for me to save you from an eternity in stone? You drive a hard bargain, my slave, and it is a good thing your master is a merchant born. You will need supplies and I will need the trinkets of this city to sell in distant lands.</string>
<string name="9021">Do not make this hard on yourself. Your life is mine and your body, too - the collar makes it so. Work with me and perhaps I shall set you free when we no longer have need of each other...</string>
<string name="9022">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9023">There are other things we must discuss.</string>
<string name="9024">Enough questions. I grow weary of them.</string>
<string name="9025">How is it that you speak the Common tongue?</string>
<string name="9026">Fine, but I still have other questions.</string>
<string name="9027">The mythal? What is that?</string>
<string name="9028">Do you seek the power of this mythal?</string>
<string name="9029">Then I don&apos;t have much time.</string>
<string name="9030">And if it falls into the wrong hands?</string>
<string name="9031">I&apos;m not speaking in Asabi.</string>
<string name="9032">What brought you here to Undrentide?</string>
<string name="9033">What did you do then?</string>
<string name="9034">If slaves are your trade, who were you planning to sell me to?</string>
<string name="9035">Who are these Asabi you speak of?</string>
<string name="9036">Where are you from, Ashtara?</string>
<string name="9037">I need your help. Heurodis must be stopped.</string>
<string name="9038">Never mind. You are of no use to me.</string>
<string name="9039">She is a madwoman, a vile murderess who I have tracked here.</string>
<string name="9040">She intends to raise Undrentide from the sands.</string>
<string name="9041">She is an evil medusa, crazed with power.</string>
<string name="9042">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; She is beautiful. You should look upon her face sometime.</string>
<string name="9043">What task did you want me to perform again?</string>
<string name="9044">I had expected a little more gratitude for my efforts...</string>
<string name="9045">How do you know whether I&apos;ve accomplished the task or not?</string>
<string name="9046">I need supplies.</string>
<string name="9047">Very well. If I am your slave, what do you command of me?</string>
<string name="9048">Very well, master. The treasures of Undrentide shall be yours.</string>
<string name="9049">That&apos;s all? You want me to fetch your trinkets and baubles?</string>
<string name="9050">I am not a raider of tombs!</string>
<string name="9051">Ten guardians? Fine, I shall destroy them as you ask.</string>
<string name="9052">Very well, but I&apos;m going to need supplies.</string>
<string name="9053">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9054">&lt;StartAction&gt;View Store.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9055">And if I succeed in that?</string>
<string name="9056">How is it that you speak the Common tongue?</string>
<string name="9057">Fine, but I still have other questions.</string>
<string name="9058">The mythal? What is that?</string>
<string name="9059">Do you seek the power of this mythal?</string>
<string name="9060">Then I don&apos;t have much time.</string>
<string name="9061">And if it falls into the wrong hands?</string>
<string name="9062">I&apos;m not speaking in Asabi.</string>
<string name="9063">I am no man&apos;s slave...</string>
<string name="9064">I have other questions for you, Ashtara.</string>
<string name="9065">What brought you here to Undrentide?</string>

<string name="9132">I&apos;m awake! I&apos;m awake! Man the hatches, we&apos;re diving to three hundred feet!!!</string>
<string name="9133">Nope, I never do, never do... That ought to teach you to let a sleeping rat lie.</string>
<string name="9134">Really? Well you&apos;ve found the wrong rodent! Aren&apos;t there space hamsters who do these things? I tried to help once, you hear? A thousand feet, I told them! But did they listen? Oh no!</string>
<string name="9135">Cry me a river! We&apos;ve all got our problems, understand? Now about that thousand-foot minimum: It&apos;s a safety precaution in case something goes horribly, dreadfully wrong, you see? The Shadovar kept to a proper minimum...</string>
<string name="9136">Old Fireshorts? Don&apos;t mind him, his brain boiled off long ago. But he casts a fair bit of light to keep the Shadovar at bay. Besides, he&apos;s handy to have around when I need someone to talk at...</string>
<string name="9137">Yes, and with an IQ triple your own, I wager, and more gray hairs than you can shake a wig at! Now leave me alone and go play with the Shadovar or something.</string>
<string name="9138">Hehe. I bet you thought I was crazy for a minute there, didn&apos;t you? Three hundred feet! Ha! That&apos;s the kind of tom fool protocol that got us into this mess in the first place. A thousand feet, I told them! But did they listen?</string>
<string name="9139">Absolutely! A thousand-foot minimum! Two thousand if you can! It&apos;s a safety precaution in case something goes horribly, dreadfully wrong, you see. The Shadovar, they kept a thousand-foot minimum...</string>
<string name="9140">Yes, back when my master, High Arcanist whosamacallit, was still alive, one of his students broke off and formed a rival city. The student could have taught my master a few things about safety regulations, might I add...</string>
<string name="9141">When all the floating cities of Netheril tumbled out of the sky, this student&apos;s city was flying at a safe altitude of a thousand-plus feet, you see: He had time to jump the entire city into the Plane of Shadow.</string>
<string name="9142">Oh, goodness knows. He always was a bright lad. At any rate, the shift was permanent and they&apos;ve stayed there ever since, with the exception of the occasional trip into Undrentide. Call themselves Shadovar, now.</string>
<string name="9143">Look, just because I have a ridiculously high IQ doesn&apos;t mean I have all the answers, okay? We were rival cities, full of spies and industrial espionage and the like. There&apos;s always a back door somewhere.</string>
<string name="9144">Regardless, after the crash they pretty much took up residence here in the tower. Now that someone&apos;s reactivated the mythal, though, they&apos;re getting jumpy. Nobody wants a fall, right? So they&apos;re stealing stuff...</string>
<string name="9145">Oh, any of my master&apos;s magic, I&apos;m sure, and the Dark Wind especially. But, to be honest, they&apos;re tearing the entire place apart, bricks, mortar, everything. I guess they mean to rebuild it back at home.</string>
<string name="9146">I&apos;m a rat! A smart rat, a talking rat but still a rat! Smart enough to know better than to mess with Shadovar, that&apos;s for sure. If the bricks are so important, you go fight them for it!</string>
<string name="9147">While you&apos;re at it, why don&apos;t you just hop one of their handy shadow portals and take the battle to their bloody homeland? What do I care!? Undrentide is dead and gone: that&apos;s what you get for bad safety regulations...</string>
<string name="9148">I say we kill the medusa, grab as much loot as we can and get out of this city before we are killed!</string>
<string name="9149">You make it sound so easy. The problem is, if she gets this thing in the air and flies it close to the ground, it&apos;ll tear us all apart. You might want to think on that for a bit.</string>
<string name="9150">Xanos would like to see us flying over the ground, rising above all others. It would lift his spirits as much as his body. But only if we control the flying city.</string>
<string name="9151">And just how high would you fly the city?</string>
<string name="9152">Um... 1000 feet minimum?</string>
<string name="9153">At least you seem able to learn. I don&apos;t suppose this one who woke the city would be so smart. Maybe you aren&apos;t too bad, but I don&apos;t trust your &lt;race&gt; friend here.</string>
<string name="9154">And besides, this city be all way under ground. Shady peoples just salvages the place.</string>
<string name="9155">Well *I* happen to still live here and I ain&apos;t the only one! Still, none of us have as many objections as the &lt;race&gt; smarty-pants, here.</string>
<string name="9156">Well, you could fall out of the sky, for starters. Then the High Arcanist to whom you&apos;re bonded body and soul could die a horrible crushing death beneath a pile of rubble while shopping for your morning vegetables...</string>
<string name="9157">After that, you linger, haunted by guilt for untold years, an insipid fire elemental for warmth and company, while Shadovar from a rival (and much smarter) city slowly occupy the school said High Arcanist headmastered...</string>
<string name="9158">Then, just when you think you&apos;ve settled into a morosely pleasant existence, someone comes along and fires up the old mythallar again, no doubt hoping to buzz around the landscape at three hundred feet all over again...</string>
<string name="9159">Frightened by the sudden activity, said Shadovar begin to steal everything (bricks, mortar, and the Dark Wind notwithstanding) back to their namby-pamby &quot;Plane of Shadows.&quot; And then...</string>
<string name="9160">And then, just when you think things couldn&apos;t get any worse (what with the Shadovar and all), I find myself rudely awoken and asked ridiculously banal questions by the likes of you!!!</string>
<string name="9161">Fine, fine! Commandeer the conversation just when I was getting someplace interesting! That&apos;s bloody typical, you know... Something, somewhere always seems to go wrong.</string>
<string name="9162">The little magical thingamawhatsits that makes this place tick, as it were. Whoever has it is up atop the Temple of the Winds, if you&apos;re interested, though no doubt it&apos;s sealed off now that someone&apos;s got the thing running again.</string>
<string name="9163">Back when I still had any sense of ambition, I poked around up there and tried to put all the mythallar back together. Never could find all of the pieces but it does seem that someone&apos;s finally finished what I&apos;d started.</string>
<string name="9164">There&apos;s a little part of me that knows I&apos;m going to regret telling you this but, as I said, it&apos;s little and not particularly bright, either. You see, it&apos;s a safety regulation...</string>
<string name="9165">When someone&apos;s controlling the mythal, it&apos;s a pretty big deal and you want to keep them safe from distractions, right? So you seal off the temple... But what if something goes horribly, dreadfully wrong?</string>
<string name="9166">You name it, really. A sudden heart attack, interplanar invasion, a fishbone stuck in the throat, spontaneous human combustion (quite common among arcanists, natch), a burning desire to dive to 300 feet...</string>
<string name="9167">In situations like that, you need a back door as it were. Hence the Ark of the Three Winds that sits outside of the temple and the three said Winds being dispersed throughout the city in case of emergency.</string>
<string name="9168">Well, the Dead Wind is with the... the Cryptologists? Oh, I don&apos;t know, the folks in the Crypt Tower at any rate. And the Wise Wind&apos;s tucked away in the Library somewhere...</string>
<string name="9169">As for the Dark Wind, well that used to be in the possession of my master, High Arcanist what&apos;s-his-pickle, but who&apos;s to say now. It&apos;s all on account of those Shadovar, you see...</string>
<string name="9170">If you need to be able to get into a room quickly, you don&apos;t keep the keys spread across a city. That seems awfully foolish for such a powerful society.</string>
<string name="9171">Hah! You aren&apos;t as dumb as you look. Let&apos;s just say that hoofing it was not really the preferred mode of transportation in a magical society where teleportation was as common as copper.</string>
<string name="9172">Well, that would make getting around a lot easier. Just imagine the things you could steal if you could just sneak in, then teleport out once you had the goods. You are saying they could do things like that?</string>
<string name="9173">One would think it was foolish to keep the winds spread around the city, if one might need to get into the tower in a hurry.</string>
<string name="9174">Hah! You aren&apos;t as dumb as you look. Let&apos;s just say that hoofing it was not really the preferred mode of transportation in a magical society where teleportation was as common as copper.</string>
<string name="9175">They must have had awesome powers. To bad they were not wise enough to survive. That would save a lot of time, to just be able to teleport wherever you wanted to go.</string>
<string name="9176">But... why they spreads winds out all over city? If there be emergency you gots to get into tower quick, no?</string>
<string name="9177">Hah! You aren&apos;t as dumb as you look. Let&apos;s just say that hoofing it was not really the preferred mode of transportation in a magical society where teleportation was as common as copper.</string>
<string name="9178">People just blinks about all the time?</string>
<string name="9179">If memory serves, yes indeed. That doesn&apos;t make things easy, but after a city crashes into the ground one would assume a mythallar emergency to be the last thing on anyone&apos;s mind.</string>
<string name="9180">You mean that snaky bitch?</string>
<string name="9181">You mean Heurodis?</string>
<string name="9182">You mean scary snake lady?</string>
<string name="9183">You&apos;re asking me? What do I look like, a Netherese herald?</string>
<string name="9184">What, were you raised in a barn? Are you so unfamiliar with the concept of a school? It&apos;s called the Arcanists&apos; Tower. S apostrophe: plural possessive. As in many arcanists, all claiming partial ownership of the same tower.</string>
<string name="9185">In short, it used to be a boring old place where they teach you how to blow things up. This is the first floor right here, not much to see. As for the upper floors, they&apos;re shadows of their former selves, I must say!</string>
<string name="9186">We know plenty about schools, it is where we have just spent a good portion of our lives.</string>
<string name="9187">Really? Tell me all about it? I have this deep, abiding interest in hearing all about your youthful mishaps.</string>
<string name="9188">You don&apos;t have to be sarcastic and rude.</string>
<string name="9189">Yes, actually, I do. It is one of my few satisfactions in life. Now, back to my discussion with your &lt;race&gt; leader.</string>
<string name="9190">Xanos does not know why, but I always thought rats would be more jovial, less cynical and hostile in attitude.</string>
<string name="9191">I&apos;m old and tired. You rolled me off the wrong side of the bed today. Come back tomorrow and I&apos;ll be as sweet as a nymph.</string>
<string name="9192">Really?</string>
<string name="9193">No. Now shut your yap and let me get back to the thread of my conversation with the &lt;race&gt; prime.</string>
<string name="9194">Oooo. Did it breaks and you finds little crystal inside?</string>
<string name="9195">Keep up with me, boy, or leave me to talk to the &lt;race&gt; prime here, alright?</string>
<string name="9196">Yes, old what&apos;s-his-name... What, it&apos;s been a while, alright! I mean, they have all manner of rules and whatnots in place for what should happen to a wizard when his familiar dies but the reverse? Nothing! Zero! Zilch!</string>
<string name="9197">You mean that snaky bitch, Heurodis?</string>
<string name="9198">Do I know her name? Was I supposed to have gazed into a crystal ball or found her name etched in the starry sky? How would I know who she is?</string>
<string name="9199">How would you like me to cut off your tail?</string>
<string name="9200">How would you like me to bite you and infect you with some deadly disease. I am trying to tell you about the repercussions of this! Big repercussions! Are you listening to me?</string>
<string name="9201">You mean Heurodis?</string>
<string name="9202">Do I know her name? Was I supposed to have gazed into a crystal ball or found her name etched in the starry sky? How would I know who she is?</string>
<string name="9203">You are just a rat. I could step on you.</string>
<string name="9204">But not before I bit you and infected you with some deadly disease. I am trying to tell you about the repercussions of this! Big repercussions! Are you listening to me?</string>
<string name="9205">Rat person talks about scary snake lady, maybe?</string>
<string name="9206">You&apos;re sharp for a lizard, aren&apos;t you? Unfortunately all this shaking has repercussions. Big repercussions! Are you listening to me?</string>
<string name="9207">Ummm... yup, Deekin writes it all down...</string>
<string name="9208">I&apos;ll bet that hurt.</string>
<string name="9209">You have no idea.</string>
<string name="9210">Now Xanos is glad he never found a familiar he liked.</string>
<string name="9211">What kind of inbred animal would want to live with someone like you? I mean, except the &lt;race&gt; kind.</string>
<string name="9212">There was this little toad once... alas poor Hoppy, I squashed him well.</string>
<string name="9213">That not sound good.</string>
<string name="9214">It really isn&apos;t, let me assure you, my big scaly friend.</string>
<string name="9215">Never mind.</string>
<string name="9216">Excuse me, I need your help...</string>
<string name="9217">I hunt a medusa named Heurodis.</string>
<string name="9218">If you don&apos;t mind me asking, what&apos;s with the fire elemental?</string>
<string name="9219">A talking rat, are you?</string>
<string name="9220">What?</string>
<string name="9221">And what mess are we in, precisely?</string>
<string name="9222">A thousand feet?</string>
<string name="9223">Shadovar?</string>
<string name="9224">The Plane of Shadow? How did he do that?</string>
<string name="9225">If they&apos;re trapped in the Shadow Plane, how do they get here?</string>
<string name="9226">What are they stealing?</string>
<string name="9227">And you&apos;re just lying here, doing nothing?</string>
<string name="9228">Uh... What could possibly go wrong?</string>
<string name="9229">High Arcanist?</string>
<string name="9230">Cheer up. It&apos;s not so bad...</string>
<string name="9231">Dark Wind?</string>
<string name="9232">And then...?</string>
<string name="9233">Whoa, let&apos;s have a change of topic here...</string>
<string name="9234">Dark Wind?</string>
<string name="9235">Mythallar?</string>
<string name="9236">If the temple&apos;s sealed, how do I get in?</string>
<string name="9237">What kind of wrong are we talking here?</string>
<string name="9238">Where can I find these Three Winds?</string>
<string name="9239">School?</string>
<string name="9240">High Arcanist?</string>
<string name="9241">You come too late, heroes! I have already claimed the maiden&apos;s soul!</string>
<string name="9242">You big meanie! Leave us be!</string>
<string name="9243">Ssshhh!</string>
<string name="9244">Look but don&apos;t touch!</string>
<string name="9245">Get out! You don&apos;t belong here!</string>
<string name="9246">No, nooooo! You&apos;re leaving footprints!</string>
<string name="9247">My mold! My dust! Mine!</string>
<string name="9248">Play NICE!!!!</string>
<string name="9249">Meddler!</string>
<string name="9250">My dust! Eeeeek! Don&apos;t disturb my dust!</string>
<string name="9251">Fresh ink still glistens on the ancient vellum.</string>
<string name="9252">The ink that once covered these pages has all but faded away, leaving a pale, blank surface. </string>
<string name="9253">You dip your quill into the bottle of ink and begin...</string>
<string name="9254">It doesn&apos;t take you long to write your tale. You lay down your quill, satisfied.</string>
<string name="9255">You can&apos;t think of a story to write. Perhaps you&apos;ll have to come back later.</string>
<string name="9256">Leave.</string>
<string name="9257">Write a story to catch the Wise Wind.</string>
<string name="9258">&quot;In a darkened wood...&quot;</string>
<string name="9259">&quot;Beside a calm oasis...&quot;</string>
<string name="9260">&quot;Amidst a raging blizzard...&quot;</string>
<string name="9261">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Where treasure lay buried along a storm-lashed coast...&quot;</string>
<string name="9262">Leave.</string>
<string name="9263">Read the story that you&apos;ve written.</string>
<string name="9264">Write a story.</string>
<string name="9265">Interlopers? Kill them at once, sisters!</string>
<string name="9266">Blood stains the pages of this illuminated manuscript. It appears to be a religious treatise of some sort.</string>
<string name="9267">You dip your quill into the bottle of ink and begin. It doesn&apos;t take long to make the necessary revisions.</string>
<string name="9268">Leave.</string>
<string name="9269">Rewrite the central argument.</string>
<string name="9270">Read the treatise.</string>
<string name="9271">You tire ssso quickly of our conversssation? Do I not hold your attention asss I once did?</string>
<string name="9272">What would I have need to ssshare for? Sssee how powerful I have become? I will not trussst you, nor anyone. I am sssssupreme!</string>
<string name="9273">This is the power Xanos once wanted. Now I find myself repulsed by it, and by what you have become.</string>
<string name="9274">I can sssee your doom, half-orc, yesss, sssoon.</string>
<string name="9275">Can you see me holding your severed head in my hand?</string>
<string name="9276">No, I sssee your doom though, sssoon, yesss.</string>
<string name="9277">Ooo... maybe you sees if Deekin&apos;s friend Raklig the bat be fine.</string>
<string name="9278">I sssee your doom, little one, yesss.</string>
<string name="9279">Enough talk.</string>
<string name="9280">Let us work together to conquer the world. It should be large enough for two to share.</string>
<string name="9281">Your evil ends here and now!</string>
<string name="9282">I have heard enough. It is time for you to die.</string>
<string name="9283">I came to kill you, not to banter.</string>
<string name="9284">The mythal will destroy you. Let it go...</string>
<string name="9285">You have lost your gaze that turns men to stone?</string>
<string name="9286">You are mad! Return this city to the sands where it belongs!</string>
<string name="9287">What does the mythal let you see, Heurodis?</string>
<string name="9288">You tire ssso quickly of our conversssation? Do I not hold your attention asss I once did?</string>
<string name="9289">What would I have need to ssshare for? Sssee how powerful I have become? I will not trussst you, nor anyone. I am sssssupreme!</string>

<string name="9298">Your evil ends here and now!</string>
<string name="9299">I have heard enough. It is time for you to die.</string>
<string name="9300">I came to kill you, not to banter.</string>
<string name="9301">The mythal will destroy you. Let it go...</string>
<string name="9302">You have lost your gaze that turns men to stone?</string>
<string name="9303">You are mad! Return this city to the sands where it belongs!</string>
<string name="9304">What does the mythal let you see, Heurodis?</string>
<string name="9305">See how the power of the mythallar grows? It grows for me, child!</string>
<string name="9306">Undrentide is almost free of its moorings. Soon it will fly again!</string>
<string name="9307">My beloved Sir William says it was by your hand that he was knighted. For that, I shall always thank you. Without my noble knight, I fear this tale might have ended in greater tragedy.</string>
<string name="9308">&lt;StartAction&gt;Sadly, it appears that you have arrived too late and that the fears of Jendra&apos;s lover, William, were well-founded. This pretty young maiden has been sacrificed in some sort of unholy ritual from which she can never return.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9309">You have redeemed me from the pits of hell, Windseeker. The Wise Wind is yours by right.</string>
<string name="9310">You tarry here too long. These flames were meant for the once-great Karsus alone, not for the likes of you.</string>
<string name="9311">So you&apos;ve come to torment me for my crime, have you? You have come to spit upon the once-great Karsus and write my name within the annals of infamy... I&apos;ve seen your type before.</string>
<string name="9312">I still have sufficient arrogance and honor to desire life. If it damns me further, I care not. I have kept the very legions of hell at bay and shall do the same for you!</string>
<string name="9313">Are you a succubus, taking on some other guise, making yet another promise with which to tempt me? These are the very depths of hell! There is no salvation here, no redemption! Fie on you and all your mockery!</string>
<string name="9314">Ah, you are the Seeker of the Winds... Long has it been since I set foot upon fair Undrentide. Lost now, all lost and broken... But yes, the Wise Wind...</string>
<string name="9315">If you seek it, then you already carry it, not in your pocket but in your mind, your heart, your soul. You need but write it down to make it real.</string>
<string name="9316">Crimes? No, no, there was only ever the one: hubris, arrogance, madness, call it what you will, I simply wanted to be one with the magic. And for a single moment... I was! I cast a spell of such power that I saw the soul of the world!</string>
<string name="9317">But like the woman who spies an unwanted suitor at her window, she cast this once-great Karsus out... She cast us all out. All the archwizards of Netheril, all our precious mythals, all our floating cities...</string>
<string name="9318">Magic flows like a river from the soul of the world. If the soul of the world dams that flow, those of us downriver must suddenly do without. For but a few minutes in all the history of the world... there was no magic.</string>
<string name="9319">Because of my lust to see the soul of the world, hundreds of thousands perished. Those who had extended their life through magic withered within moments. Netheril&apos;s great floating cities fell and shattered, every one.</string>
<string name="9320">I&apos;ve suffered in this hell for ten thousand years or more... Only the merest portion of the eternity I owe... Succubi came to tempt me but I spurn them. The very hounds of hell nip at my heels but I shrug them off...</string>
<string name="9321">For worst of all are my own memories yet I dare not let them fade. To forget the fallen is to kill them twice. No, I have mixed an ink of ash and my own blood and with it written my confession, every ounce of it the truth.</string>
<string name="9322">Yes, it is done now. After countless years of endless turmoil, it is complete. Here, take what remains of the ink. My blood in it will let you pass the gate. Read it and tell the world that I am sorry.</string>
<string name="9323">That explains much.</string>
<string name="9324">It is why so many great works suddenly failed; including our precious flying cities.</string>
<string name="9325">So that is why the cities fell?</string>
<string name="9326">It is indeed. It is why so many great works suddenly failed.</string>
<string name="9327">Ummm... that not sound good when you lives in flying city.</string>
<string name="9328">No. It is not good at all, I am afraid.</string>
<string name="9329">Once, yes, but whittled down now to the barest nub of my former self... But once I was the greatest wizard in all the floating cities of Netheril! My fingers clutched the ankles of the gods even then, in the moment of my crime!</string>
<string name="9330">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9331">I&apos;m here to destroy you.</string>
<string name="9332">I&apos;m here to save you.</string>
<string name="9333">Do you know how I might find the Wise Wind?</string>
<string name="9334">What were your crimes?</string>
<string name="9335">What do you mean she cast you out?</string>
<string name="9336">What has been your punishment?</string>
<string name="9337">May I read your confession?</string>
<string name="9338">The once-great Karsus?</string>
<string name="9339">This book is bound in human flesh and the edges of its pages are charred and black. Cinder holes have burned their way through much of the text. </string>
<string name="9340">&quot;It all began in the library in the rival city of Undrentide...&quot;</string>
<string name="9341">Leave.</string>
<string name="9342">Read the confessions of the Archmage, Karsus.</string>
<string name="9343">The phrase &quot;Here there be shadows&quot; is inlaid with silver on the door&apos;s surface.</string>
<string name="9344">With a wave of your hand, the door dissolves into a black mist and is gone.</string>
<string name="9345">Dismiss the door.</string>
<string name="9346">Pass through the doorway.</string>
<string name="9347">I think and think but there is nothing. All that was once wise within this skull has long since rotted from the bone, my king and quests now all forgotten...</string>
<string name="9348">At last, something here that lives! Please, you must help me!</string>
<string name="9349">Yes, yes, that&apos;s it! To the grave and then deeper, to the Plane of Sorrows! There are places there where the ether leaks back into my world. At long last, I shall follow it home!</string>
<string name="9350">Come, let us cross blades and weave spells and send me out with proper fanfare! To think that I have lingered here so long, with the answer all around me! To battle, my salvation!</string>
<string name="9351">I... I don&apos;t know... I was summoned here, long ago, my quests interrupted to perform some service for the king. I don&apos;t remember what. I remember nothing, it seems. Nothing.</string>
<string name="9352">Perhaps there is no help for me. Perhaps I am cursed to linger here forever amidst these graves, cut off from the world I loved the most.</string>
<string name="9353">Even so, I can&apos;t help but think that there must be a way. Every problem is but a puzzle to be solved. Our reality is but a game with hidden rules. If one can but discern them, suddenly all things become possible.</string>
<string name="9354">You are only as helpless as you allow yourself to be. Even trapped in stone, I never gave up!</string>
<string name="9355">You give in to despair, but our problems do not last for eternity. This too shall pass.</string>
<string name="9356">But it feels like I have been trapped here forever, never to return to that which I loved best!</string>
<string name="9357">This sounds like good story. Too bad Deekin be so busy with tale of &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;.</string>
<string name="9358">Someone will tell my tale, little one. Someone, somewhere, or somewhen. It is so hard to remember.</string>
<string name="9359">There were... There were two kings, I think. I served two masters, one here in this world, and one in the last. That last one, I was to tell the king that she is dead. But who is this &apos;she?&apos; If only I could remember. If only I could return...</string>
<string name="9360">What were they now? I was seeking out a woman called the Night Hag, I think... Or was it a stone? ...No, no, it was a young elf who wore the same uniform as I. Oh, I don&apos;t know... Time has left this skull an empty shell.</string>
<string name="9361">Nothing except... In my dreams, I still see my Prince&apos;s hand stretched out towards mine, the sounds of battle all around us in the night... Nothing more, nothing more.</string>
<string name="9362">Return to the grave, ye bones!</string>
<string name="9363">How can I help?</string>
<string name="9364">Why should I help you?</string>
<string name="9365">Who are you?</string>
<string name="9366">I&apos;m sorry, I cannot help.</string>
<string name="9367">What king do you speak of?</string>
<string name="9368">What were these quests that were interrupted?</string>
<string name="9369">Surely you must remember something...</string>

<string name="9389">This one fights by your command, &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; Shadow. Signal when you are ready.</string>
<string name="9390">This one has no name. He lives only to serve the &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; of this estate.</string>
<string name="9391">There is no better place for rest than darkness, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. And this one brings the finest wares of this estate&apos;s fine laborers. They are gifts but by tradition the Shadow Lord always pays in honor.</string>
<string name="9392">You defeated our old lord, the Shadow Lich. This estate is now yours, though you cannot pass through its walls as we can. This one fears you may be confined to these, your chambers.</string>
<string name="9393">The past lord was not the kindest of masters, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Indeed, the City of Shadows is not the kindest of places. If you were to wander beyond the walls of your estate, you would no doubt suffer grave indignities.</string>
<string name="9394">But your guards stay true to you, as do the servants. This servant, too, has accepted that you are here by right. The rest of the city will learn in time. For now, keep your travels through the city to a minimum. </string>
<string name="9395">This one was born in shadow and shall die in it as well. Walls have no meaning here, save for the likes of m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Perhaps if you stay for untold years, as did the Shadow Lich, you too shall become as shadow.</string>
<string name="9396">Until then you rule an estate you cannot see and this one shall seem your only subject. Lonely is the mantle of ownership, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="9397">Ummm... and that be good thing?</string>
<string name="9398">It is neither a good thing nor a poor thing, servant of the &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; of the estate. It simply is, and shall continue to be.</string>
<string name="9399">Yes, of course. This one is sorry, &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; &lt;FullName&gt;. All the same, this one still asks what has caused you to return to this, your estate.</string>
<string name="9400">&lt;StartAction&gt;View Store.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9401">Leave me be.</string>
<string name="9402">Die, creature of shadow!</string>
<string name="9403">Very well. Fight!</string>
<string name="9404">My estate?</string>
<string name="9405">Who are you?</string>
<string name="9406">Then how can you serve me?</string>
<string name="9407">Fine. I shall see these shadow wares.</string>
<string name="9408">What do you mean &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; of this estate?</string>
<string name="9409">Are the Shadovar always so quick to accept a new &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;?</string>
<string name="9410">You can pass through walls?</string>
<string name="9411">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9412">You have retuuurned to talk with meee some more? I aaaam grateful for the coooompany...</string>
<string name="9413">Voooooices? It&apos;s been loooong since I&apos;ve heard voooooices... And the mythaaaaal, that too has been gooooone too loooooong. At last, liiiiife returns to Undrentiiiiiiiiide...</string>
<string name="9414">Yes, yeeeeesss, you know the naaaame? Entertainers, clockwork poooonies, children&apos;s toys that waaaalked and taaaalked. And guardians, toooo, for those scared of thieeeeves...</string>
<string name="9415">The myyythal? Someone haaas repaired the mythallaaar atop the Temple of the Wiiinds and reactivated the myyythal after sooo long... A paaart of me is excited, another part afraaaid...</string>
<string name="9416">Once this ciiiity flew upon the mythal&apos;s wiiiings... We loved the mythal and we truuusted it but one day it abaaandoned us... It tooook less than a minute for uuuus to faaall...</string>
<string name="9417">In only seconds, all but the greaaatest buildings shattered... more than half of thooose who liiived were dead... The others fled into the deserrrrrt and were lost... Only those like me remained to watch the saaand slowly cover us...</string>
<string name="9418">Who can knoooow the myyythal&apos;s heart? But abandon us she diiiid and greaaaat is the price we paid for trusting herrrr... The mythaaal has returned but I daaare not hope she has retuuuurned for good...</string>
<string name="9419">You mean city falls out of sky? Deekin hopes nobody standings underneath...</string>
<string name="9420">There was liiiife here once and haaappiness. Once, this cityyy flew and I knew the taaaste of wiiind. Now there is only gloom and daaarkness and the slow decaaay of memmmmory...</string>
<string name="9421">For a strooong mythal, there are no bounds upon its pooower. Some have placed new staaars within the skyyyy or changed the spinning of the spheeeres... This one is weak but even nooow I feel it growing...</string>
<string name="9422">They are the cryyystals from which the mythaaal receives its strength... They capture the maaagic of all the world and put it in the hands of who controoools them.... Destroy the mythallaaar and you destroy the myyythal...</string>
<string name="9423">Yes, froooom the center of Uuuundrentide rose the great temple. There the aaaarchwizards controlled the myyythal and were controoolled by it in tuuurn...</string>
<string name="9424">A butler. Yes, a stooooooone butler... I would serve and entertaaaaain, tell witty joooooookes to maaaaake the customers laaaaaaugh... It was a long, looooong time ago...</string>
<string name="9425">People? Why they bought golllllems, of course... Entertainers, clockwork poooonies, children&apos;s toys that waaaalked and taaaalked. And guardians, toooo, for those scared of thieeeeves...</string>
<string name="9426">Only the guardians remaaaain... Our master made them wellllll, made them to laaaast, as he did me, his faaavorite, hiiiiis love... I was his buuuutler... I miiiiiiss him veryyyyy much...</string>
<string name="9427">Destroooy them? Noooo, they are my maker&apos;s creeeeations. They guard, as is their duuuuty but they were always gentle with hiiiiim when he visited them to make repaaaairs...</string>
<string name="9428">He wore a riiiiiing that would disaaaable them so he could view their mechaniiiiisms. He used it for all of his creeeeations... It felt so niiiiice to be at peeeace...</string>
<string name="9429">I buuuuried it with hiiiiim long agoooo. I built a coffin for hiiiim over there, in that rooooom and put flowers on it beeeecause I loved hiiim. Please, do not distuuuurb his rest.</string>
<string name="9430">Noooo... Those who would distuuuurb my maaaker are not welllllcome heeeere... Please leeeeave me beeee.</string>
<string name="9431">I loooved hiiiiim... He gave me liiiife, and puuuurpose... I meant to tell him but then he diiiiiiiied... It was very long agooooo... I entombed him here in the store with his creaaaaations and watch ooover him aaaall my daaays...</string>
<string name="9432">That would make it difficult to steal. I don&apos;t think I like that idea so much.</string>
<string name="9433">Now that is a shopping experience Xanos could truly enjoy.</string>
<string name="9434">That sound like place where Old Master would wants to shop.</string>
<string name="9435">Oooonce, when I was younger, I waaaas more eloquent. But that was loooong agoooo and I&apos;ve grooown oooold. Little by little, I am faaaadinnnng.</string>
<string name="9436">A meduuuuusa? I have not seen one of thooooooose since my earliest daaaaays... Why did she come to Uuuuundrentide? Tell me that and maybeeee I can tell you wheeeeere she might have goooooone.</string>
<string name="9437">Yes, it is gooooood to speak again and to heeeear vooooices...</string>
<string name="9438">Yes, the Great Liiiiibrary! Many would visit it and greaaaat was its collection... There was a boooook there that was said to be enchaaaanted. Soooo well was it written that it felt as iiiiif you were really there...</string>
<string name="9439">Aaancient? Is that what weeee&apos;ve become? Yes, once there was magic heeere. All things were magiiiiic, once. Perhaps it will come agaaaain, with the mythaaaal now renewed... </string>
<string name="9440">The Arcanist&apos;s Tower was where maaaagic was taught and studied, though. Maybeeee you will find your meduuuusa there, bent in studyyyyy...</string>
<string name="9441">Plunderrrrrr... Is this the fate of Undrentiiiiide? If it is the treasuuuuuure of the dead she seeks, perhaps you will fiiiiind her in the Crypts, stealing from the Burning Mennnnn...</string>
<string name="9442">Aaaaaah, then sheeee must be the one who re-aaaaaaaactivated the mythaaaaal... It is controooolled from the Temple of the Wiiiiinds at the city&apos;s heart, so thaaaat is where you will fiiiiiind her...</string>
<string name="9443">But now that the myyyyyythaaal is restored, the Temple will beeeee encased in glowing waaaalls through which you shall haaaave no paaassage... It is safer that waaaay...</string>
<string name="9444">The city, whiiiile it flew, spread out in aaaall directions... Pick one and I wiiiiill tell you what waaaas there. The directions might have chaaaanged when we fell but their associaaaations are still the saaaaame...</string>
<string name="9445">At the heart of the city roooose the Temple of the Wiiiiinds. From there, all Uuuundrentide&apos;s power was controlled as there were kept the fragile mythallaaaar.</string>
<string name="9446">The crypts looooomed in the western quarter... They could not spread out or diiiig beloooow, so as more died, they built uuuuupward, corpses in the skyyyy.</string>
<string name="9447">Those in the south liiiived in the shadows of the Arcanists&apos; Tower... There they trained for centuuuuuries, many of them becoming liches befoooore the faaaall. Too arrogant, they were. Tooooo arrogant by faaaar...</string>
<string name="9448">To the eeeeast? To the east there was nothing, oooonly the quarters of slaaaaves and servants. They got the early sun to waaaake them for their duuuuties...</string>
<string name="9449">To the north was the Great Liiiibrary, home to a thousand tooomes. People came from all ooooover the empire to read the works of the authooooors of Undrentiiiiide...</string>
<string name="9450">Three Winds were hidden iiiiiiiin three great buildings of Uuuuundrentide. If there was an emergency, the ooooowners could bring them to the Ark thaaaat rests at the Temple&apos;s baaaase. Only then would the temple oooopen...</string>
<string name="9451">The Wiiiiise Wind was hidden in the Great Liiiibrary. In their oooown tower, the Arcanists hid the Daaark Wind. And the cleriiiiics housed the Dead Wind with the bodies in the Cryyyypt... Thoooose were the threeeeee.</string>
<string name="9452">Then all we need to do is creep up there, surprise her and hack off her snaky head.</string>
<string name="9453">That was easier than Xanos was expecting. I suspect there will be a catch.</string>
<string name="9454">Scary lady is in temple? We go there, then! See, boss? Adventuring be easy!</string>
<string name="9455">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9456">Is this the Golem Emporium on Northwest Vizier Street?</string>
<string name="9457">What do you know about the mythal?</string>
<string name="9458">What frightens you about the mythal&apos;s return?</string>
<string name="9459">Why did the mythal abandon you?</string>
<string name="9460">Why are you excited about the mythal&apos;s return?</string>
<string name="9461">What is the mythal capable of?</string>
<string name="9462">The mythallar? What are those?</string>
<string name="9463">The Temple of the Winds?</string>
<string name="9464">Who... What are you?</string>
<string name="9465">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Customers? What did people come here to buy?</string>
<string name="9466">These guardians... I need to destroy them. Tell me how.</string>
<string name="9467">How did he keep them gentle?</string>
<string name="9468">Where is this ring?</string>
<string name="9469">But I must! I need that ring.</string>
<string name="9470">You loved your maker?</string>
<string name="9471">Forgive me, your speech is hard to follow.</string>
<string name="9472">I hunt a medusa named Heurodis.</string>
<string name="9473">Back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="9474">She planned to study the city&apos;s lore and wisdom.</string>
<string name="9475">She hoped to study the magic of ancient Netheril.</string>
<string name="9476">She came to plunder the treasures of Undrentide.</string>
<string name="9477">She wanted to rule the city, make it fly again.</string>
<string name="9478">What can you tell me about the rest of the city?</string>
<string name="9479">What lay at the city&apos;s center?</string>
<string name="9480">What lay to the west?</string>
<string name="9481">What lay to the south?</string>
<string name="9482">What lay to the east?</string>
<string name="9483">What lay to the north?</string>
<string name="9484">There must be a way in!</string>
<string name="9485">What great buildings?</string>
<string name="9486">Something holds you here within this foul temple. It seems this tale moves only forward, never back.</string>
<string name="9487">&lt;StartAction&gt;You feel a sharp tug and an electric shock as Ashtara&apos;s collar tightens about your neck. It seems he doesn&apos;t want you to stray too far...&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9488">The dust is disturbed in this area, but you cannot determine what creatures may have passed by recently.</string>
<string name="9489">A multitude of insect tracks, unusually large ones, are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="9490">A multitude of insect tracks, unusually large ones, are scattered about the ground in this area. From the look of them, and the scattering of droppings in the area, you would say a group of large beetles has made this area home.</string>

<string name="9493">A multitude of insect tracks are scattered about the area in front of  you. From the look of them, and the scattering of droppings in the area, you would say several groups call this area home, both beetles and spiders.</string>

<string name="9496">A multitude of insect tracks, unusually large ones, are scattered about the ground in this area. From the look of them, and the scattering of webs in the area, you would say a nest of spiders must be nearby.</string>
<string name="9497">Would you like your home and belongings guarded? If so, come visit the Golem Emporium on Northwest Vizier Street! We have the protection you need!</string>
<string name="9498">Intruders? Come, sister, they must not let them interfere with the ritual!</string>
<string name="9499">On my honor, the Wise Wind is yours, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="9500">Travel well, my friend, and may the pages of your life never grow brittle.</string>
<string name="9501">A different ending than the last, isn&apos;t it, my friend? She lives! She bears a face more beautiful than I had ever imagined and I bear the eyes to see it! Jendra, my Lady Love, this is &lt;FullName&gt; who saved us both!</string>
<string name="9502">My beloved Sir William says it was by your hand that he was knighted. For that, I shall always thank you. His rescue was most gallant, especially since I thought it was a kindly beggar youth I loved.</string>
<string name="9503">A ruse, a lover&apos;s ruse, sweet Jendra, that I might win your heart&apos;s true affection and not have you simply love the Sir before my name! I know, now and forever, that you love me for who I truly am!</string>
<string name="9504">Travel well, then, my friend, and may the pages of your life never grow brittle.</string>
<string name="9505">I... I understand, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="9506">William? What is it that &lt;he/she&gt; asks of you?</string>
<string name="9507">Hush, my love. There is a duty I must still perform, a debt I must repay... M&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt; &lt;LastName&gt;, is it still the Wise Wind that you seek?</string>
<string name="9508">Aye, come what may, true love has found me. And what of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Have you found what it was you were looking for? Do you still seek the Wise Wind?</string>
<string name="9509">All is well with me, good &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I sense that all is not yet well with you. Is it still the Wise Wind you seek?</string>
<string name="9510">Yes, it is written that the Forger of Destinies shall also be known as the Seeker of the Winds: the Dead, the Dark, and the Wise. Those whose destiny &lt;he/she&gt; touches must lend their aid that the Wise Wind can be captured.</string>
<string name="9511">It is you the writings speak of, isn&apos;t it &lt;FirstName&gt;? You are the Seeker of the Winds?</string>
<string name="9512">As you wish but know that you have given me the greatest happiness a man can have. Should you ever change your mind, it would be my honor to assist against the Wind.</string>
<string name="9513">You have given me the greatest happiness a man can know. When you find the Wise Wind, it would be my honor as my lady&apos;s knight to aid you in its capture.</string>
<string name="9514">Then I have nothing to offer you except my thanks and friendship. You have given me the greatest happiness a man can know and I shall not forget that.</string>
<string name="9515">Please, if you have the time to linger here, you have the time to do what I cannot. I beg of you, enter yonder temple and protect my beloved Jendra from the harm I fear befalls her.</string>
<string name="9516">Jendra, sweet Jendra you are gone! Betrayed by kin and clan and I, your William, I can do nothing more for you than weep! O gods, thy names art Cruelty and Injustice!</string>
<string name="9517">Go. I pray you live a happier, less accursed life than mine.</string>
<string name="9518">The Wise Wind? I have heard the name though I know not where. But what use have you for a beggar such as me? I am blind and lame and with a broken heart besides. Please, leave me to my sorrows...</string>
<string name="9519">On learning of our love, her stepmother sent her to that monastery across the way. An ill wind comes from it, though, I can smell it on the air. I fear for her.</string>
<string name="9520">O that I were a knight and had the means to do so. Alas, since birth the gods have cursed me with eyes that cannot see and a twisted leg that leaves me lame.</string>
<string name="9521">It is enough I have made it this far without dying heartbroken, blind, and lonely within the depths of some crevasse. O sweet Jendra, this world is a tragedy for us both.</string>
<string name="9522">A girl with the softest voice and the smoothest skin. Her lips on mine were ever tender. Noble by blood and nobler yet by soul, I loved her and she loved me in return.</string>
<string name="9523">&quot;Okay...&quot; That is all my life can ever be now without her. Gone are the days of &quot;Wonderful...&quot; and &quot;Splendid...&quot; Gone is her beauty from my world. Everything is drab and plain and ordinary again.</string>
<string name="9524">The same to you, Sir William. Farewell.</string>
<string name="9525">Yes, well, I had best be going then...</string>
<string name="9526">This ending comes at a price, Sir William...</string>
<string name="9527">It warms the heart to see true love blossom.</string>
<string name="9528">So all&apos;s well that ends well?</string>
<string name="9529">The Wise Wind?</string>
<string name="9530">Do not concern yourself with it, Sir William.</string>
<string name="9531">Yes, I seek it still.</string>
<string name="9532">It is already mine, my friend.</string>
<string name="9533">Goodbye, William.</string>
<string name="9534">Do you know how to find the Wise Wind?</string>
<string name="9535">What happened? How can I help?</string>
<string name="9536">Can you not charge to her rescue?</string>
<string name="9537">Who is this Jendra you weep for?</string>
<string name="9538">Calm down, eveything&apos;s going to be okay...</string>
<string name="9539">This door seems to be controlled by some hidden mechanism.  You will have to find its controls before it will open.</string>
<string name="9540">Despite all your efforts, this doorway remains sealed behind some unknown sort of magical barrier.</string>
<string name="9541">A force field bars your way. Perhaps you need to possess some type of object or key before it will work. </string>
<string name="9542">Allip</string>
<string name="9543">The spectral remains of people driven to madness and suicide, Allips crave only revenge against those who pushed them over the brink.</string>

<string name="9545">The jagged-edged blades float towards you.</string>
<string name="9546">Archangel</string>
<string name="9547">Calm and pristine amidst her hellish surroundings, the archangel shows no sign of fear.</string>
<string name="9548">Asabi Thrall</string>
<string name="9549">Asabis are desert-dwelling reptillian humanoids who are often found as mercenaries or slaves in the service of evil creatures.  The average asabi female is slightly shorter and quicker than the male,  and their thick, pebbly skin is brown or bronze in hue.  They have yellow, egg-shaped eyes with horizontal slit pupils.</string>
<string name="9550">Ashtara,</string>
<string name="9551">Asabi Merchant</string>
<string name="9552">Bearing the luxurious trappings of an Asabi merchant prince, Ashtara&apos;s confidence rests as a thin veneer atop an underlying tone of menace.</string>
<string name="9553">The Fury</string>
<string name="9554">This creature stares menacingly at you.</string>
<string name="9555">Beholder Tyrant</string>
<string name="9556">These creatures are serious pests that greedily devour cultivated crops. Though not carnivorous, they&apos;ll still charge any perceived threat with their oversized, horn-like mandibles.</string>
<string name="9557">Bombardier Beetle</string>
<string name="9558">Called such for their ability to lob balls of digestive acid over considerable distances, these giant beetles feed primarily on carrion and offal.</string>
<string name="9559">Fire Beetle</string>
<string name="9560">Recognizable by its distinctive red markings, the predatory Fire Beetle prefers its meals to be cooked, even a little burnt...</string>
<string name="9561">Spitting Fire Beetle</string>
<string name="9562">Stag Beetle</string>
<string name="9563">Stink Beetle</string>
<string name="9564">As their name suggests, Stink Beetles defend themselves by emitting a noxious gas intended to render their assailants unconscious.</string>
<string name="9565">Burning Man</string>
<string name="9566">The reddened skin and brass collars of these penitent spirits make them seem almost tangible. The flames they cast about themselves certainly are.</string>
<string name="9567">The Dark Wind</string>
<string name="9568">Dagget</string>
<string name="9569">Filth</string>
<string name="9570">This rat&apos;s mangy fur has grown gray and speckled over the years. It seems very tired.</string>
<string name="9571">Dead Priestess</string>
<string name="9572">The Dead Wind</string>
<string name="9573">The Dead Wind brings a chill to the place. The sound of its fury is all about you.</string>
<string name="9574">Vain servants of the dark gods, devils have long been known to meddle in the affairs of men.</string>
<string name="9575">Disturbed</string>
<string name="9576">Wrapped in gravecloths and bound in steel, the Disturbed seek to destroy all living things for only then can they find their rest.</string>
<string name="9577">Fire Elemental</string>
<string name="9578">A fool&apos;s grin paints the crusted face of this fire elemental. Its eyes seem vacant and witless.</string>
<string name="9579">Brittle Bone Golem</string>
<string name="9580">Created by demented wizards, Bone Golems are generally used to guard prized possessions. Their bodies are pieced together from various creatures, both humanoid and monster.</string>
<string name="9581">Grand Matron</string>
<string name="9582">Broad of shoulder and cruel of eye, this woman is the Grand Matron of the fell cult that calls this place its temple.</string>
<string name="9583">Dust Elemental</string>
<string name="9584">Born of the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Dust, these creatures are denizens of hidden or forgotten places. There are no known limits to their size and have been known to grow to considerable proportions.</string>
<string name="9585">Maddened with power, this former medusa smells of death and decay.</string>
<string name="9586">Jendra</string>
<string name="9587">Gallendt</string>
<string name="9588">You remember Jendra&apos;s broken form lying on this same dais, bathed in blood. She is young and beautiful and it calms your heart to see her here, alive.</string>
<string name="9589">Karsus</string>
<string name="9590">the Archwizard</string>
<string name="9591">His skin blistered by hell&apos;s own fury, this heavily muscled wizard stands, his posture wary.</string>
<string name="9592">Medusa Handmaiden</string>
<string name="9593">The hideous face of a medusa is crowned with a mass of writhing, hissing snakes instead of hair, and its eyes glow a deep, feral red.  In contrast, its body is perfectly proportioned and exceptionally attractive, although scaly and earthen-colored.  A medusa will often wears garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil. </string>
<string name="9594">Ancient Dust Mephit</string>
<string name="9595">Chaotic and destructive, Mephits come in many shapes and have a wide range of abilities. Most are drawn from the various Elemental and Quasi-Elemental Planes.</string>
<string name="9596">Skeleton Chieftain</string>
<string name="9597">The bones of the dead, animated by dark magic, Skeletons have no mind of their own. They are but an extension of their master&apos;s will.</string>
<string name="9598">Shadovar Archer</string>
<string name="9599">Shadows cling to the hollows of this skeletally thin woman&apos;s face. Her eyes are dark, and cruel lines mark her mouth.</string>
<string name="9600">Shadovar Healer</string>
<string name="9601">Sparkling trailers of white mist tangle around this mysterious, shrouded woman, glimmering on her pale skin.</string>
<string name="9602">Shadovar Warrior</string>
<string name="9603">This heavyset warrior appears almost wreathed in shadow and fog, his eyes like black pools in his face.</string>
<string name="9604">Shadovar Mage</string>
<string name="9605">Trailing wisps of dark energy wreathe the hands of this spellcaster, his black eyes gleaming with malice.</string>
<string name="9606">Shadow Lich</string>
<string name="9607">Only a shadow remains of this former Archwizard of Netheril. His eyes still burn red in their misty sockets, but all else is darkness.</string>

<string name="9611">Rey</string>
<string name="9612">The blue enamel on Sir William&apos;s armor gleams in the temple&apos;s new light. </string>
<string name="9613">Skeletal Archer</string>
<string name="9614">Skeletal Devourer</string>
<string name="9615">Returned to vigor by evil sorcerers, these undead Intellect Devourers are more resilient and have greater mental acuity than their still-living brethren.</string>
<string name="9616">Spectre</string>
<string name="9617">Spectres are incorporeal undead often mistaken for Ghosts. They haunt the places where they died, retaining their sentience but now hating all living things.</string>
<string name="9618">Stone Butler</string>
<string name="9619">Carved and etched with arcane symbols, Stone Golems are formidable opponents. Not only are they physically powerful, they are also very difficult to harm.</string>
<string name="9620">Tower Builder</string>
<string name="9621">Shield Guardian</string>
<string name="9622">Created by spellcasters and controlled by means of a special amulet, Shield Guardians are predominantly defensive in combat, protecting their masters with unswerving loyalty.</string>
<string name="9623">Unholy Crusader</string>

<string name="9627">William</string>
<string name="9628">Though strong of build and noble of bearing, this young man is cursed with blindness and a twisted leg that has left him lame.</string>
<string name="9629">Wisp</string>
<string name="9630">Evil creatures that feed on the powerful emotions associated with panic, horror, and death, Will-O&apos;-Wisps delight in luring travelers into deadly peril.</string>
<string name="9631">Wind Zombie</string>
<string name="9632">Corpses reanimated through necromancy, Zombies are mindless undead that shamble about, trying to satiate the dull ache of hunger in their decaying gut.</string>
<string name="9633">Greater Wind Zombie</string>
<string name="9634">The Wise Wind</string>
<string name="9635">Lightning crackles and thunder booms. The Wise Wind is a tiny tempest within its fictional domain.</string>
<string name="9636">Wraith</string>
<string name="9637">Wraiths are incorporeal creatures born of evil and darkness. They despise all living things, as well as the light that nurtures them.</string>
<string name="9638">Dorna seldom speaks of her past, but you know she travelled for nearly a week through a treacherous part of the Silver Marches to apprentice herself to Drogan Droganson when he retired and decided to take on some apprentices.  She is somewhat dour and pragmatic.  Her role as professional ambush-spotter and trap-springer has left her with a rather grim outlook on life.</string>
<string name="9639">Rusted Plate</string>
<string name="9640">The joints of this armor have gone stiff with time and the panels have been eaten through, leaving you dangerously exposed.</string>
<string name="9641">Amulet of Ultravision</string>
<string name="9642">The Art of Lichdom</string>
<string name="9643">A foul odor clings to the pages of this ragged book. In rather gruesome terms, it discusses the process by which a powerful arcanist can slowly transform himself into a lich. The frankness with which the topic is discussed leads you to believe that this was a relatively common practice in ancient Netheril.</string>
<string name="9644">Burning Man Loincloth</string>
<string name="9645">The City of Shadows</string>
<string name="9646">This tome appears to be a long-winded diatribe against a rival city. The City of Shadows, as it was known, was apparently founded by a former student of Undrentide&apos;s own High Arcanist. The unnamed student apparently claimed to have discovered a new source of magic he called the Shadow Weave, though the High Arcanist claims to have discovered it first. A mage duel was scheduled but had not yet come to pass by the time the tome was completed.</string>

<string name="9652">The Golems of Undrentide have long outlived their maker. There was a time, however, when he was still called upon to repair his mighty creations. This is the ring he used to still them, that he might tinker with them unharmed.</string>

<string name="9661">Staff of Valmaxian</string>
<string name="9662">In ancient times, the proud and quarrelsome wizard Valmaxian was a man of great power and prominence. He crafted this staff with the aid of a demon, all to win the heart of Chasianna, the daughter of his long-dead master. When the debt came due, the demon demanded Chasianna as his price. In a rage, Valmaxian descended into the Abyss and used the staff to battle the demon and rescue the woman he loved.</string>

<string name="9669">The Dark Wind</string>
<string name="9670">The Dark Wind, once held by the Arcanists of Undrentide, then stolen from the long-dead city by a Shadow Lich, has finally been recaptured and encased behind glass.</string>
<string name="9671">The Dead Wind</string>
<string name="9672">The Dead Wind, once the ruler of the Crypts of Undrentide, has now been captured and encased behind glass.</string>
<string name="9673">The Wise Wind</string>
<string name="9674">The Wise Wind, once hidden in the Great Library of Undrentide, has now been captured and encased behind glass.</string>
<string name="9675">Crypt Key</string>
<string name="9676">Found in one of the Dread Sarcophagi of the Crypts of Undrentide, this key appears to grant access to the crumbling edifice&apos;s second floor.</string>
<string name="9677">Inkwell</string>
<string name="9678">Ink glistens darkly within the small container. It smells of blood and ash.</string>
<string name="9679">Pen</string>
<string name="9680">The fringes of this quill pen seem ragged and sparse but the nib is firm. Regardless, you will require some ink before you can use it.</string>
<string name="9681">Padded Armor +2</string>
<string name="9682">This magic armor grants additional protection to its wearer, but it doesn&apos;t bear the hallmarks of any specific maker.</string>
<string name="9683">Silvermane&apos;s Axe +2</string>
<string name="9684">Silvermane, heroine of the dwarves, had a jealous stepsister, Selarna, who she killed in battle. Selarna&apos;s spirit became trapped within the killing axe. From her vantage point within that blade, Selarna took her vengeance by provoking many subsequent wielders to kill their siblings. The curse was broken by the dwarf Skarlin, upon the killing of his brother Njal. Freed from Selarna&apos;s influence, the weapon has since been able to give life as well as take it.</string>
<string name="9685">Discord</string>
<string name="9686">A line of black crystal runs the length of this blade, marking it the handiwork of Ortius of Gond, the Mad Tinker. Blades from his stock resonate unnaturally when struck, and although mortal ears can barely perceive the tone, they certainly suffer the effects well enough. The origin of the crystal is not clear, though Ortius was known to have bartered his services to planar creatures on occasion.</string>
<string name="9687">Tethir-Wood Cudgel</string>
<string name="9688">Encroachment on elven territory is not tolerated, though an exception is occasionally made for those who show proper reverence. Such is the case in the forest of Tethir, where a sect of druids have been welcomed and, on occasion, given special boons for their tireless work. While usually information, such a gift might also include an elven-crafted item like this one.</string>
<string name="9689">Courtesan Blade</string>
<string name="9690">Courtesan assassins were famous for using their wit and charm to infiltrate the intimate chambers of the enemy by the most disarming method imaginable: they were invited. The practice became infamous, which is likely why it is used so infrequently today.</string>
<string name="9691">This magic weapon has an enhancement bonus to attack and damage, but it doesn&apos;t bear the hallmarks of any specific maker.</string>
<string name="9692">Ascorian Double Axe +2</string>
<string name="9693">To the displaced victims of an emerging bandit king staking a claim near The Shaar, the Ascorian Double Axe is a symbol of what a simple homegrown despot can accomplish with only a few dozen chests of ancestral pirate gold, a newly-hired personal army of mercenaries, and several puppeteer spellcasters schooled in the Shadow Weave. And they say one man can&apos;t make a difference any more.</string>
<string name="9694">Ebon Dire Mace +2</string>
<string name="9695">Coarse tracings of the orc gods mark these weapons as indelicate, to say the least. They are deeply ridged, viciously effective, and all too common at the forefront of an orc horde. The inclusion of some &quot;blunt magic&quot; makes them debilitating as well as damaging, and a deep muscle bruise from a solid hit can take a fighter to his knees in short measure.</string>
<string name="9696">Blade of Corellon</string>
<string name="9697">Blades of this type bear the marks of elven craftsmen, though the elves as a people are more commonly associated with smaller, more elegant weapons. Certain sects among them worship Corellon Larethian as a god of war, however, and in reverence to him they let no weapon of combat go untrained. Even so, it would still be a rare occurrence for such a weapon to actually see use on an elven battlefield.</string>
<string name="9698">Gloves of the Hin Fist Masters</string>
<string name="9699">Founded by a sect of isolationist halflings, the Monastic Order of the Hin Fist maintains a tradition of solitude paired with the belief that one must first master the self before one can attain mastery over the outside world. Monks of the Order fashioned these gloves with sonic properties so that the outside world could be forewarned of their training and thereby know to keep a distance.</string>
<string name="9700">Re&apos;s Redemption</string>
<string name="9701">When Mulhorand&apos;s rebellious wizards opened Faerun to the invasion known as the Orcgate Wars, the avatars of the deities descended from the heavens to do battle. The avatar Re was slain in battle but used his dying breath to create hundreds of these greataxes. Known as Re&apos;s Redemption, each of them was dedicated to the slaying of orcs, and only with their help was the great horde forced northward.</string>
<string name="9702">Shining Light of Lathander</string>
<string name="9703">The Church of Lathander is a wealthy institution, and makes no secret of its affinity for adventurers. In their eyes, these people dare to bring light to the forgotten and secret places, and therefore they will always find safe haven in a house of the Morninglord. On occasion the church will grant a boon to a particularly favorable person, a weapon that will serve to light the dark paths ahead.</string>
<string name="9704">Will of Atar +2</string>
<string name="9705">These weapons bear the mark of Atar of the Flame, high shaman of a northern cult that fell under the influence of a creature from the plane of fire. What this entity received in exchange for creating such powerful items is unknown.</string>
<string name="9706">Offhand Axe +2</string>
<string name="9707">Axes of this type were created as training tools for an organization of rangers and woodsmen, but their use has fallen out of favor. When combined with another weapon they grant agility and skill in the use of both at once, but it was found that some students relied too much upon them, and did not separately develop the skills that the items enhance.</string>
<string name="9708">Kintharsta</string>
<string name="9709">A performer with the Circus of the Rose, Kintharsta offered a challenge to any member of the audience: to trade blows, their weapon versus his, until he or they conceded. He offered good odds and had many takers, but few could have hoped to win, thanks to the magic of his flail. He was paranoid of being caught without it, and had several copies crafted. Ironically, he was caught with the ringmaster&apos;s wife in the one situation he went unarmed, and was murdered with his flail just out of reach.</string>
<string name="9710">Crossbow of Enchantment</string>
<string name="9711">The enchantress Lady Gracia was fascinated by the legend of a celestial creature that fired love into a person&apos;s heart with magical bolts. Attempting to recreate the story she fashioned several launchers to duplicate this effect, but a bolt that would confer the spell proved difficult, and test couples lost their fascination for each other within hours or days. Regardless, Lady Gracia enjoyed the effort, and kept on playing matchmaker until her dying days.</string>
<string name="9712">Thread of Life +2</string>
<string name="9713">Not everyone on the battlefield is eager for a fight. The devout of Aido Glade seek out conflicts solely to ply their healing skills, trying to ease the suffering of the fallen while avoiding harm themselves. A Thread of Life kama aids in their efforts while marking them as impartial to the cause of the skirmish. They do not judge, knowing that some wars are inevitable. They tend to those in need, regardless of circumstance.</string>
<string name="9714">Master Li&apos;s Way</string>
<string name="9715">Once thought a unique instance of the swordmaker&apos;s craft, several katanas of this type have now been linked to a ship that ran aground on the Sword Coast some years ago. All bear the markings of Master Hu Li, a great artificer from the east, but little else is known of him. </string>
<string name="9716">Ladymist Talon +2</string>
<string name="9717">This variant of the kukri is thought to be associated with worshippers of Akadi, greater power of the elemental plane of air, but this is unverified. These weapons do exhibit abilities that seem appropriate for her domain, but they lack the markings her followers are known to use. Likely these blades are from her realm, but draw their magical energy from elsewhere.</string>
<string name="9718">North Wind Bow</string>
<string name="9719">These bows seem primitive at first glance, but behind the crude sinew and hide is a powerful weapon. They are most often found in the far North, but unfortunately, they are also most often found in the hands of a devotee of Auril, the Icemaiden. Most observers will get a good look at the point of the arrows before ever seeing the bow.</string>
<string name="9720">Blade of the Gladiator</string>
<string name="9721">Long ago, the formians built great subterranean cities and vast, cavernous empires. Societies of war, they reveled in the blood and glory of the gladiatorial pit, where slaves and prisoners fought for their cruel amusement. One such gladiator was the human Ajan, who stole the blade of his formian master and used it to escape to the surface with Zoe, his love. It is said that all who wield it are bound for greatness.</string>
<string name="9722">Flail of Destruction</string>
<string name="9723">If J&apos;elnyio of the Anvil had created just a few of these powerful weapons he might have enjoyed a natural death. Instead he produced as many as he could, hoping to shift the balance against evil in the world. The problem, of course, is that his efforts eventually drew attention from the very evil the flails were designed to fight, and balance was restored.</string>
<string name="9724">Forge Fire</string>
<string name="9725">A legacy that Thalantyr the Conjurer has said he would prefer to forget, these weapons are tied to his early adventuring career and a time when he was held captive by a mysterious powerful creature. He has refused to say how the weapons have retained the heat of he forge they were crafted in, usually ending such inquiries with a frustrated &quot;pray you never find out.&quot;</string>
<string name="9726">Crossbow of the High Forest</string>
<string name="9727">Though the current owners of these weapons might like to believe they were handed down from Mielikki herself, Crossbows of the High Forest were actually created by a powerful group of rangers called the Underwood Company. It would be easy to assume divine involvement, however, due to the substantial magic present within each item.</string>
<string name="9728">Petty&apos;s Tempest</string>
<string name="9729">The most recent recorded appearance of one of these weapons was in the black markets of Amn, rightfully commanding an impressive price. Several such maces have been found over time, each with an array of elemental spells and effects woven through them. The creator remains elusive, though the name &quot;Petty&quot; is evident on each example. It is possible he is a smith on Toril, but his obvious understanding of planar forces suggests a more traveled origin.</string>
<string name="9730">Sleepwalker Kin</string>
<string name="9731">These weapons were supposed to be a great breakthrough for the orcs of Amn. Clan leaders liked the idea of rendering enemies helpless, but after the efforts of many shamans and several imprisoned human wizards, the project was abandoned. It seemed that in the hands of the orc elite, a hit strong enough to activate the ability often killed the target anyway, and the extra cost was deemed redundant.</string>
<string name="9732">Aiedo Wither-Stick +2</string>
<string name="9733">From the Lhespenbog reed-fields of east Shaar come Aiedo Wither-Sticks, the craft of Meng Aiedo. Though accustomed to working with tall grass bamboo, this eastern craftsman traveled across the inner plains plying his trade with whatever local materials were available. Swamp products tend to be darker in nature than his usual fare, however.</string>
<string name="9734">Bleederkin</string>
<string name="9735">In recent years, a number of thieves&apos; guilds reported losing members to these blades, the weapons left as gruesome signatures impaled in the victims&apos; chests. The craftsman behind them was unknown, but the intent of the group using them was clear enough: to destabilize existing groups to facilitate their own expansion. It has been some time since the last killing, however, suggesting that the incursion was either abandoned or succeeded through less violent means. Members of the underground community have not been forthcoming with information.</string>
<string name="9736">Ula&apos;s Heart</string>
<string name="9737">When the smithy guild of Endrab refused to admit Ula on the basis of her gender, she challenged their best weaponsmith to a contest to see who could forge the finer sword. She toiled for weeks, her workshop busy day and night, until she produced a flawless, beautiful scimitar. Enraged that a &apos;mere&apos; woman should best him, the guildsman hired assassins to do away with her. Ula&apos;s story has since inspired many more women to take up her profession, and make many copies of Ula&apos;s famous blade.</string>
<string name="9738">King&apos;s Scythe</string>
<string name="9739">This item was modeled on Baron Gordaire Knightshold&apos;s weapon, a ceremonial scythe meant to make him look more rural and less a tyrant. His fledgling kingdom east of the Inner Sea faltered when a revolutionary movement adopted the symbol in their efforts to overthrow him. Each lieutenant in their league was paired with one of these far-more-functional duplicates to rally people behind them. There is little remaining of Gordaire&apos;s legacy.</string>
<string name="9740">Tansheron&apos;s Bow +2</string>
<string name="9741">Scholars attempting to verify tales of Tansheron the lich have found only his ramshackle keep and withered husk. Evidence suggested a long siege by at least four distinct groups of adventurers, a campaign that eventually wore down his defenses. Presumably weapons of this type were among the loot claimed. The thin, frayed string of this bow appears unusable, but when it is drawn a solid, invisible arrow becomes tangible.</string>
<string name="9742">The Lucky One +2</string>
<string name="9743">This is a swashbuckler&apos;s blade that has seen endless use in grand fights against &quot;big nasties&quot; sent forth by whomever. The Lucky Ones mercenary company commissioned these blades while still flush from their last big score. After their windfall they only adventured for the thrill of it, challenging each other to ever-greater feats of daring-do. Why are these weapons no longer with them? Sometimes the &quot;big nasty&quot; wins.</string>
<string name="9744">Teneraard&apos;s Sickle +2</string>
<string name="9745">A design easily traceable to Teneraard Treekin, hunter turned blacksmith turned ranger. He spent years making tools for servants of nature, eventually taking them up himself, but he never truly felt accepted in the role. His efforts, while admirable, were born of memories of his father standing over a Cloakwood stag, a species that was eventually hunted to extinction.</string>
<string name="9746">Sling of Force</string>
<string name="9747">A tinker without a sense of proportion, the spunky Gendlesen Barstow worried that she wasn&apos;t strong enough for the adventuring life, and so built various magical slings to enhance her strength. Although her first versions were successful, all were stolen from her workbench and eventually scattered across Faerun.</string>
<string name="9748">Heartwood Spear +2</string>
<string name="9749">This weapon was a gift from the elven nation to the kingdom of Algarond after the declaration of peace between their two peoples. Spears of this type are carefully crafted, and rumored to come from the wood of Evereska itself.</string>
<string name="9750">Hammer of the Wisp</string>
<string name="9751">A clan of svirfneblin deep within the Underdark created the Hammers of the Wisp to guard against vicious drow hunting parties. They hoped to model an item that could erupt with light, slowing or repelling their enemy. They were initially successful, and a dark elf group broke ranks the first time the weapons were used. No record of the deep gnome clan exists after that, however, and it is unlikely they survived the drow reprisal.</string>
<string name="9752">Robe of Light</string>
<string name="9753">Made from a fine silk, this robe seems to have a permanent aura of light around it.</string>
<string name="9754">Shadow Robe</string>
<string name="9755">Shadovar mages often garb themselves in these robes of preternatural darkness, prefering concealment over more direct protections.</string>
<string name="9756">Shadovar Armor</string>
<string name="9757"> </string>
<string name="9758">This armor is the traditional armor of an elite force of Shadovar warriors called &quot;Sharith&apos;s Talon&quot; after a black dragon of legend.</string>
<string name="9759">Shadovar Robes</string>
<string name="9760">Mechanics of Flight</string>
<string name="9761">This well-thumbed book is signed by the author, someone named The Great Karsus. The technical jargon is too difficult to decipher fully but, judging by the illustrations, it was a popular textbook outlining the fundamentals of how to shear off the top of a mountain and make it hover at varying heights above sea level.</string>
<string name="9762">Rusted Two-Bladed Sword</string>
<string name="9763">The weapon feels fragile in your hand, as if ready to crumble with age at any moment.</string>
<string name="9764">Rusted Bastard Sword</string>
<string name="9765">Rusted Battleaxe</string>
<string name="9766">Motheaten Robes</string>

<string name="9795">Moldy Tome</string>
<string name="9796">Stained by centuries of mildew, the damp pages cling to each other, long since illegible.</string>
<string name="9797">Kabbernacky&apos;s Guide to Mythals</string>
<string name="9798">This book appears to be an ill-organized reference almanac. It defines the term &quot;mythal&quot; as &quot;a large, semi-permanent, spherical zone of interwoven and highly customized magics in which the laws of arcanism are altered or adjusted to better suit the day-to-day needs of those choosing to live within said sphere.&quot; The text goes on to explain that every mythal depends on the existence of powerful artifacts known as mythallar and it is through these mythallar that the mythal is controlled. In a later appendix listing the various flying cities that were then a part of the Netherese Empire, it is noted that Undrentide&apos;s mythallar were housed atop a central structure called the Temple of the Winds.</string>
<string name="9799">The Poetry of Dagget Filth</string>
<string name="9800">I can smell your feet.
Their odor lingers even these many years
after you last tread here.
Now there is only dust and shadows,
as my belly
scrapes
the ground...

Dagget Filth
Year 832 after The Fall

Damn, I&apos;m bored...</string>
<string name="9801">Portable Door</string>
<string name="9802">A small stone door, as if fit for a dollhouse. The phrase &quot;Here there be shadows&quot; is inlaid with silver on the door&apos;s surface.</string>
<string name="9803">Scarab Key</string>
<string name="9804">The head of this key has the look of a scarab beetle. It was given to you by the Asabi Merchant, Ashtara, and grants access in and out of the Asabi camp.</string>
<string name="9805">Shadovar Properties</string>
<string name="9806">Shadow Gem</string>
<string name="9807">Shadows flit within this strange gem. Something about it seems insubstantial, as if it is not fully of this place. </string>
<string name="9808">Shadow Sword</string>
<string name="9809">These vicious blades are the traditional weapons of an elite force of Shadovar warriors called &quot;Sharith&apos;s Talon&quot; after a black dragon of legend.</string>
<string name="9810">This key was found in a secret compartment within the leg of the Stone Butler, in Undrentide&apos;s northern fragment. It seems well-worn, as if it has seen much use over the years.</string>
<string name="9811">Temple of the Winds - Rites and Rituals</string>
<string name="9812">The Ritual of the Three Winds:

When the mythal&apos;s master wields its power atop the Temple of the Winds, the holy secrets of its workings are to remain sealed behind the temple gates and none but the Giver of the Winds may pass.

The Giver of the Winds must first be their Seeker, however, and then their Finder. The Winds are known as the Dark, the Dead, the Wise; in three places do they lie in wait.

The Dark is held by he who created it, the High Arcanist of Undrentide, may his lifeblood be eternal. The Dead is held by the priests who tend the crypts. The Wise is held by the librarians and lorekeepers, the knowers of wisdom, the sages of dust and time.

When all three are gathered, the Giver of the Winds must relinquish them into the Ark, that the Winds might be transformed and seal at last be broken.</string>
