<resources><string name="50000">Maybe you tell me &apos;bout resting and stuff again?</string>
<string name="50001">Got it. Go on.</string>
<string name="50002">Whoa, could you back up and repeat that, please?</string>
<string name="50003">You go too fast. You go back and say again, please?</string>
<string name="50004">Simple. Go on.</string>
<string name="50005">You lost me there. Can you repeat that, please?</string>
<string name="50006">Whoa - me no follow. You say again, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="50007">Okay. What else?</string>
<string name="50008">Sorry, but could you go over that one more time?</string>
<string name="50009">Me sorry, but mabye you be say that again, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="50010">I don&apos;t need a final tutorial. I&apos;m ready for the Mage&apos;s Challenge now.</string>
<string name="50011">Me not need final tutorial - me want do Mage Challenge now.</string>
<string name="50012">Ready.</string>
<string name="50013"></string>
<string name="50014"></string>
<string name="50015"></string>
<string name="50016"></string>
<string name="50017"></string>
<string name="50018">Forget about me - go protect the Waterdhavian creatures! </string>
<string name="50019">Come speak to me.</string>
<string name="50020">Hey there, &lt;FullName&gt;, welcome to my little corner of the Academy. I&apos;m Jaroo, resident Master of the Arcane. It&apos;s more a ceremonial title than anything else. I&apos;m really just your run-of-the-mill wizard.</string>
<string name="50021">No doubt you have come here to complete your training. Well, you&apos;ve come to the right place. Nobody at this institution knows more about teaching you apprentices magic than me. </string>
<string name="50022">Look, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I&apos;m not trying to be rude, but are you sure you&apos;re in the right place? My expertise is in mage and sorcerer spells, and you can&apos;t cast either type.</string>
<string name="50023">If you want, I guess I can give you a lesson in casting spells, but it won&apos;t bring you any closer to completing your training at the Academy. Or do you need something else?</string>
<string name="50024">Ah, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I didn&apos;t expect you to come back. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="50025">Well, &lt;FirstName&gt;, have you decided to take the Mage&apos;s Challenge? It&apos;s the final step in your training here at the Academy, after all.</string>
<string name="50026">Good luck to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I don&apos;t know what your future holds, but I sense you are destined for great things.</string>
<string name="50027">Your training is done, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You should go to the south assembly hall to receive a blessing and congratulations from Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50028">Since you&apos;re a wizard, I&apos;ll start by showing you how to prepare spells.</string>
<string name="50029">Since you&apos;re not a wizard you don&apos;t need to learn how to prepare spells. If you want I can still show you how it&apos;s done, but you won&apos;t need to learn it.</string>
<string name="50030">To prepare a spell, you have to access your spellbooks. Don&apos;t do this now or you&apos;ll break out of dialog and have to start over. Just listen to my instructions and you can try it later. </string>
<string name="50031">This will bring up your spellbook menu. On the left side you will see all the spells in your spellbook. On the right side, you will see the spells you currently have prepared.</string>
<string name="50032">Click and drag the spells you want to prepare from your spellbook over to your prepared spells page. Don&apos;t forget that you&apos;ll have to rest before the spells are prepared.</string>
<string name="50033">Okay, I guess we can move right on to the lessons about resting.</string>
<string name="50034">It&apos;s very important for a spellcaster to remember to rest. Resting is how you replenish your spells. To rest, simply click the Rest icon below your character portrait. It&apos;s the one that looks like a closed eyelash.</string>
<string name="50035">Okay, I guess we&apos;ll start with the basics. Bards and sorcerers don&apos;t have to prepare spells to cast them, but wizards can only cast spells they&apos;ve prepared beforehand.</string>
<string name="50036">Whenever you rest, your spells will replenish themselves. Lower level spells replenish first and more quickly; higher level spells take longer. </string>
<string name="50037">If you have the spells loaded into your quickbar, you&apos;ll see their icons highlight as they get refreshed. Remember to rest often, but don&apos;t forget that you can&apos;t rest while in combat.</string>
<string name="50038">During your adventures, you will find scrolls with spells you haven&apos;t learned. Wizards can scribe new spells from scrolls into their spellbooks, but sorcerers and bards can only learn new spells when they increase in level.</string>
<string name="50039">To add a new spell to your spellbook, simply open your inventory and spellbook at the same time. Then, drag the scroll from your inventory to your spellbook. Remember that scribing a spell from a scroll like this will destroy the scroll. </string>
<string name="50040">That&apos;s it. The basics of spell casting in a nutshell. So, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you ready to face the Mage&apos;s Challenge? It&apos;s the last step in completing your arcane training here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="50041">That&apos;s all I can teach you about casting spells, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though I don&apos;t see what use the knowledge of arcane magic will be to you. Is there something else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="50042">The test is a simple one, &lt;FirstName&gt;. See the statue in the center of the room? All you have to do is destroy it using a spell and the challenge will be complete.</string>
<string name="50043">To help you in this task, there are two scrolls in the chest against the north wall. You can scribe these scrolls to your spellbook or right-click on the scrolls and select the Use Item icon from the menu to cast the spell right from the scroll.</string>
<string name="50044">The best way to actually cast your spells is by using the quickbar. Remember: you have two extra quickbars that can be accessed using the &quot;SHIFT&quot; and &quot;CTRL&quot; keys.</string>
<string name="50045">To load a spell onto your quickbar, simply open your spellbook, then click and drag the spell to the desired slot on one of your quickbars. The spell can now be cast with a single keystroke.</string>
<string name="50046"></string>
<string name="50047">Non-targeted spells will cast automatically after you select them using the quickbar, but many spells require a target, be it a creature, an object or even a spot on the ground.</string>
<string name="50048">After selecting a targeting spell using the quickbar, your cursor will change to display the spell icon. To then cast the spell, simply left-click with your cursor on the target.</string>
<string name="50049">Come speak to me when you finish the test. I&apos;ll be waiting right here.</string>
<string name="50050">Is something wrong, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I see you haven&apos;t finished the Mage&apos;s Challenge. Do you need me to go over it one more time?</string>
<string name="50051">Okay, I&apos;ll do my best. Fire away.</string>
<string name="50052">One thing I can tell you is not to believe unfounded rumors. Those who claim the plague was caused intentionally by some unknown enemy of Neverwinter are only adding to the panic.</string>
<string name="50053">Nobody knows where the Wailing Death came from, just as nobody knows how to stop it from spreading. And until now there hasn&apos;t been any prayer or potion that can cure it.</string>
<string name="50054">But I think Lady Aribeth is headed in the right direction now. She&apos;s a smart one, and I think Lord Nasher made the right choice putting her in charge of dealing with this plague.</string>
<string name="50055">I shouldn&apos;t say anything, but I suppose the information is common knowledge among the students by now. Khelben Arunsun, the most famous mage this side of Elminster himself, discovered a cure for the Wailing Death. </string>
<string name="50056">Waterdeep helped us out by capturing the monsters necessary to concoct the cure and they sent them here to the Academy for safekeeping. That&apos;s the real reason Lady Aribeth is here, I suspect.</string>
<string name="50057">Well, I&apos;ve never actually met her myself. I know she&apos;s an Elven paladin in the service of Tyr, and I know she&apos;s the one in charge of keeping order in Neverwinter and finding a cure for the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="50058">And, of course, everybody knows she&apos;s here giving blessings to those who have finished their Academy training. Students have been piling into the south assembly hall since early this morning just to meet her.</string>
<string name="50059">Leave it to a mage to come up with a cure when all the priests and healers couldn&apos;t, right? Old Blackstaff figured out that combining the proper reagents would make an elixir to save us all.</string>
<string name="50060">Sure, we don&apos;t want you to miss out on this. It&apos;s important stuff.</string>
<string name="50061">Consider this a final tutorial on casting spells before you face the Mage&apos;s Challenge. Are you ready to begin?</string>
<string name="50062">Really? Well - if you&apos;re ready then I guess we can begin.</string>
<string name="50063">Congratulations, you have shown great control of your magical abilities. Speak to me before you leave.</string>
<string name="50064"></string>
<string name="50065"></string>
<string name="50066"></string>
<string name="50067">To bring up your spellbook menu, press the &quot;B&quot; key or left-click on the SPELLBOOK button below your character portrait.</string>
<string name="50068">Sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to interrupt.</string>
<string name="50069">Me sorry. Me not mean to interrupt.</string>
<string name="50070">I think I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="50071">What&apos;s your problem? I&apos;m just trying to be friendly.</string>
<string name="50072">Me go now.</string>
<string name="50073">Why you so mad? Me just want be talk at you.</string>
<string name="50074">Why do you want to meet Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50075">How&apos;s your training going?</string>
<string name="50076">I want to ask you a few questions.</string>
<string name="50077">Why you want meet Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50078">How you training going?</string>
<string name="50079">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50080">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="50081">Have you heard those rumors about a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="50082">How do you like training here at the Academy?</string>
<string name="50083">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="50084">You hear stuff &apos;bout cure for plague?</string>
<string name="50085">You like training at Academy?</string>
<string name="50086">I won&apos;t take much of your time. I promise.</string>
<string name="50087">Me speak at you quick. Me promise me not use much time.</string>
<string name="50088">You better answer my questions if you know what&apos;s good for you!</string>
<string name="50089">You answer me question or you be sorry!</string>
<string name="50090">Why are you so sure the plague is magical in nature?</string>
<string name="50091">Why you think plague be magic?</string>
<string name="50092">Can you not see I am in the middle of training? You are a &lt;class&gt;. You should appreciate how difficult the translation of the arcane texts can be. So why are you bothering me? </string>
<string name="50093">Can&apos;t you see that I&apos;m in the middle of training? The Academy might go easy on a &lt;class&gt; like you, but those of us wishing to master the arcane cannot afford to waste our days chatting.</string>
<string name="50094">You again? Can you not see I am in the middle of my training? What is it you want this time?</string>
<string name="50095">This spell demands my full attention and I cannot afford these constant interruptions!</string>
<string name="50096">(Sigh) Master Jaroo often warns me about the perils of prolonged casting. Perhaps a short break would be good for me. Perhaps it will even give me a chance to meet Lady Aribeth. </string>
<string name="50097">Then I shall resume my perusal of these rather obscure and difficult texts.</string>
<string name="50098">Very well. Perhaps if I answer your questions you will stop pestering me.</string>
<string name="50099">She is a powerful and influential figure within the city. Lady Aribeth has been given the task of finding a cure for the plague by Lord Nasher himself.</string>
<string name="50100">Lady Aribeth could be a valuable ally in the future. I would be foolish to throw away a chance to meet someone who could be so valuable to my career.</string>
<string name="50101">I see no point in false modesty, I find the core materials to be somewhat beneath my abilities. Fortunately, Jaroo has supplemented my studies with a number of more advanced tomes and parchments.</string>
<string name="50102">He appreciates my potential, though he constantly harps on me about the dangers of delving too deeply into the arcane. Perhaps he fears I will be devoured by my hunger for knowledge.</string>
<string name="50103">Still, I suppose it would be wise to heed his cautions. Perhaps I will meet with Lady Aribeth later this evening instead of studying all night, as is my usual practice. </string>
<string name="50104">An interesting topic, one I have studied in great detail. From a safe distance, of course. </string>
<string name="50105">Can you comprehend the fearsome power and terrible resolve of one who could have unleashed the Wailing Death on our city? It boggles the mind, doesn&apos;t it? </string>
<string name="50106">Of course. Khelben Arunsun, a mage of inestimable power, has devised a cure that can be extracted from components gathered from creatures both rare and magical.</string>
<string name="50107">I am no expert, but the evidence as I see it offers only one logical explanation: the source of this pestilence is magical rather than natural.</string>
<string name="50108">Protect the Waterdhavian creatures! </string>
<string name="50109">Are you threatening me? I should report you and have you expelled from the Academy! But I have not the time; I must get back to my study of these ancient tomes. Leave me be.</string>
<string name="50110">The evidence is obvious, is it not? Neverwinter is the only city afflicted by the Wailing Death, and the disease resists all attempts by the clergy to find a cure.</string>
<string name="50111">I do not know who would do such a thing, but it would require a wizard of great power. A lich, perhaps. Or possibly even the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan. But these are just guesses.</string>
<string name="50112">The rumors also say the creatures have been brought here to the Academy. No doubt that is why Lady Aribeth now graces us with her presence. Perhaps I will find an opportunity to meet her later.</string>
<string name="50113">Sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to interrupt.</string>
<string name="50114">Me sorry. Me not mean to interrupt.</string>
<string name="50115">I think I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="50116">What&apos;s your problem? I&apos;m just trying to be friendly.</string>
<string name="50117">Me go now.</string>
<string name="50118">Why you so mad? Me just want be talk at you.</string>
<string name="50119">What do you have against Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50120">How&apos;s your training going?</string>
<string name="50121">I want to ask you a few questions.</string>
<string name="50122">Why you not like Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50123">How you training going?</string>
<string name="50124">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50125">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="50126">What can you tell me about those rumors of a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="50127">How do you like training here at the Academy?</string>
<string name="50128">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="50129">You hear stuff &apos;bout cure for plague?</string>
<string name="50130">You like training at Academy?</string>
<string name="50131">I won&apos;t take much of your time. I promise.</string>
<string name="50132">Me speak at you quick. Me promise me not use much time.</string>
<string name="50133">You better answer my questions if you know what&apos;s good for you!</string>
<string name="50134">You answer me question or you be sorry!</string>
<string name="50135">Can you blame people for losing faith? After all, you can&apos;t help them.</string>
<string name="50136">Why you mad people lose faith? You not help them anyway.</string>
<string name="50137">I have no time to talk with you - I am very busy preparing the sacred devotional rituals. You are a &lt;class&gt;, I am sure you understand.</string>
<string name="50138">I have no time to talk. The Academy might go easy on a &lt;class&gt; like you, but we who serve the divine will have many tasks and duties we must perform.</string>
<string name="50139">I see you have returned. Is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="50140">Forgive me. I did not mean to be so harsh, but I am very busy. Elynwyd, my mentor in the divine arts, has ordered me to make preparations for us to honor Lady Aribeth&apos;s arrival.</string>
<string name="50141">I suppose I can spare a few minutes for you. My heart is not in the preparations to honor Lady Aribeth, anyway. A waste of time, in my opinion.</string>
<string name="50142">Then I shall return to the duties Elynwyd has assigned me. May the blessings of Tyr be upon you.</string>
<string name="50143">It is part of my duties to provide guidance and advice to my fellow students here at the Academy. Ask your questions.</string>
<string name="50144">Many regard Aribeth de Tylmarande as a champion of Tyr and a defender of our faith, but where does she seek salvation during these difficult times? In the works of the wizard Khelben Arunsun!</string>
<string name="50145">Knowing this, how can I join the others who praise and fawn over her? But Aribeth has authority in this matter, and I am only a lowly acolyte. So I perform my duties as ordered.</string>
<string name="50146">The path of worship is demanding. Only those who are strong in their faith have the strength to persevere and complete their training.</string>
<string name="50147">But my faith is strong and true. I live to serve the divine will, and I will not abandon my beliefs as others - like Lady Aribeth - seem to have done.</string>
<string name="50148">I have heard many rumors of the plague. Some say it is unnatural, that it was brought about through fell magic by enemies of Neverwinter. But I do not believe this.</string>
<string name="50149">The citizens have lost their faith. Even the priests and clerics of the city have faltered. That is why the plague resists our attempts to cure it with prayer and holy magic.</string>
<string name="50150">Everyone speaks of the cure discovered by the wizard Khelben Arunsun, but I refuse to abandon my faith and place my hope in works of sorcery.</string>
<string name="50151">I believe the Wailing Death is a divine trial, a test of our faith and resolve. Unfortunately, we seem to be failing this test.</string>
<string name="50152">We are under attack!</string>
<string name="50153">I dare not shed blood in this holy place, so I will ignore your threats. Otherwise I would show you the power of the God I serve! Begone, infidel!</string>
<string name="50154">As I said, this is a trial of our faith. People who once worshipped with us now turn against the clergy because we cannot help them. But the fault is theirs, not ours. They are weak in their beliefs.</string>
<string name="50155">Ultimately this trial - as all trials of faith - shall pass. Those who hold true to the spiritually divine will survive the plague. The hypocrites will be exposed and shall perish. </string>
<string name="50156">For the sake of the city, I hope the cure works, but I suspect the wizard&apos;s brew will prove ineffective. And then those who claim to be of my faith but are, in fact, unworthy - like Lady Aribeth - will be exposed.</string>
<string name="50157">For the sake of Neverwinter, I hope her folly brings us a cure for the Wailing Death. But in my heart I know the will of the divine alone can save us. Aribeth&apos;s misguided efforts will only prolong our suffering.</string>
<string name="50158">I would like to receive a lesson in casting spells.</string>
<string name="50159">Me want learn how cast spells.</string>
<string name="50160">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50161">Me want ask you questions.</string>
<string name="50162">I am ready for the Trials of Faith.</string>
<string name="50163">Me ready for Faith Trial stuff.</string>
<string name="50164">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="50165">Could you go over the details once more?</string>
<string name="50166">Me need you explain faith trial again.</string>
<string name="50167">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="50168">What can you tell me about the cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="50169">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="50170">Me want know &apos;bout cure.</string>
<string name="50171">What can you tell me about Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50172">What you know &apos;bout Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50173">Got it.</string>
<string name="50174">Sorry, I didn&apos;t quite understand that.</string>
<string name="50175">Me no understand.</string>
<string name="50176">Go on.</string>
<string name="50177">Could you repeat that?</string>
<string name="50178">Me sorry. Me got lost. You say again, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="50179">Got it.</string>
<string name="50180">Sorry, you lost me. Care to try that again?</string>
<string name="50181">Me sorry. You say again, please?</string>
<string name="50182">Good. Got it.</string>
<string name="50183">Sorry, but I missed something there.</string>
<string name="50184">Me no get it.</string>
<string name="50185">Okay. What else?</string>
<string name="50186">I didn&apos;t really understand that. Could you go over it again.</string>
<string name="50187">Me sorry. Me not understand. You say again, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="50188">Me not need tutorial, me ready for Trials of Faith.</string>
<string name="50189">I don&apos;t need your tutorial, I&apos;m ready to face the Trials of Faith.</string>
<string name="50190">Ready.</string>
<string name="50191"></string>
<string name="50192"></string>
<string name="50193"></string>
<string name="50194"></string>
<string name="50195"></string>
<string name="50196">Quickly! You must find and protect the Waterdhavian creatures! </string>
<string name="50197">I beseech you to speak with me.</string>
<string name="50198">Greetings and well met, &lt;FullName&gt;. I am Elynwyd, faithful servant of Tyr and devotional leader here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="50199">No doubt you have come to the chapel to complete your instruction. By all accounts, you have shown great promise in your studies so far. I have no doubt you will do the Academy proud once your training is complete.</string>
<string name="50200">Though all are welcome in the chapel to pray and study, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I am surprised to see you here. Normally my visitors are exclusively druids and clerics.</string>
<string name="50201">Have you come seeking a lesson in the casting of divine spells, even though you have little need of such learning at the present? Or perhaps you require something else from me?</string>
<string name="50202">Greetings once more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am surprised to see you back, although you are always welcome. How may I be of aid to you?</string>
<string name="50203">You have returned, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Are you prepared to face the Trials of Faith? By completing them your training here at the Academy will be at an end.</string>
<string name="50204">Go with the blessings of Tyr, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your destiny awaits you beyond the Academy&apos;s walls.</string>
<string name="50205">Your training here is complete, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You should speak with Elynwyd, and then proceed to the south assembly hall to receive blessings and congratulations from Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50206">I will begin by showing you how to select your spells. Both clerics and druids use the same procedure in preparing their divine magic.</string>
<string name="50207">Before casting a spell, you must first learn to access your spell list. You can&apos;t try it now or you&apos;ll interrupt our conversation and have to start over. Just listen to what I have to say and you can try it later.</string>
<string name="50208">This will bring up your spell list menu. The left side of the menu is a list of all the spells available to you from your deity, the right side is spells you have prayed for and prepared.</string>
<string name="50209">Click and drag the spells you want to prepare from your spell list over to your prepared spells page. Don&apos;t forget that you&apos;ll have to rest before the spells are prepared.</string>
<string name="50210">It is very important for a spellcaster to remember to rest. Resting is how you replenish your spells and how we pray to our deity.</string>
<string name="50211">Very well, then we shall begin with the most basic principles of the process. I will instruct you as if you yourself were an acolyte who wished to learn the ways of divine magic.</string>
<string name="50212">Whenever you rest, your spells will replenish themselves. Lower level spells replenish first and more quickly; higher level spells take longer.</string>
<string name="50213">If you have the spells loaded into your quickbar, you will see their icons highlight as they get refreshed. Remember to rest often, but do not forget that you cannot rest while in combat.</string>
<string name="50214">Thus endeth the lesson, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have done all I can, but the rest is up to you. In order to complete your training here at the Academy, you must face the Trials of Faith.</string>
<string name="50215">That is all I can teach you of divine magic, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though I do not see what use the knowledge will be to you right now. Is there some other request you have of me?</string>
<string name="50216">The test is simple for one whose devotion is true, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Do you see the man by the south wall of the room? You must use your magic to heal his wounds.</string>
<string name="50217">The best way to actually cast your spells is by using the quickbar. Remember: you have two extra quickbars that can be accessed using the &quot;SHIFT&quot; and &quot;CTRL&quot; keys.</string>
<string name="50218">To load a spell onto your quickbar, simply open your spellbook, then click and drag the spell to the desired slot on one of your quickbars. The spell can now be cast with a single keystroke.</string>
<string name="50219"></string>
<string name="50220">Non-targeted spells will cast automatically after you select them using either the quickbar or the menu system., but many spells require a target - a creature, an object or even a spot on the ground.</string>
<string name="50221">After selecting a targeting spell using the quickbar your cursor will change to display the spell icon. To then cast the spell simply left-click with your cursor on the target.</string>
<string name="50222">I hope there is nothing amiss, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I see you have not completed the Trials of Faith. Would you like me to describe the tests once more?</string>
<string name="50223">Very well, I shall answer your questions to the best of my ability.</string>
<string name="50224">The Wailing Death is a terrible affliction upon Neverwinter. The city has been quarantined and sectioned off, yet death tolls continue to rise and infected corpses fill our streets.</string>
<string name="50225">There are rumors that someone has brought this plague upon us all for some unholy purpose. However, I doubt anyone could be so evil and callous as to cause such widespread suffering among the innocent. </string>
<string name="50226">People have lost their faith. Even Lady Aribeth has turned to the archmage Khelben Arunsun and the cure he claims to have discovered. I wonder at the wisdom of trusting a mage over faith. </string>
<string name="50227">Officially I can tell you nothing, but silence only breeds false rumors. Therefore I will share what I know to put you at ease. The archmage Khelben Arunsun claims to have discovered a cure for the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="50228">Nevertheless, Waterdeep has sent us a menagerie of beasts from which to extract the reagents to concoct the cure. Lady Aribeth seems certain this will work, and I must trust her judgment in this matter.</string>
<string name="50229">Lady Aribeth is an Elven paladin devoted to Tyr and one of the strongest defenders of our faith. I understand why she has turned to &quot;the Blackstaff&quot; for a cure - I only regret our church could not do more. </string>
<string name="50230">Perhaps I will have a chance to speak to her later about my concerns, once she has finished bestowing Tyr&apos;s blessings on the graduating students in the south assembly hall.</string>
<string name="50231">I pray the wizard&apos;s magic proves as powerful as he claims, yet I will also continue to put my faith in the powers of the divine Tyr, rather than an earthly mortal.</string>
<string name="50232">As a priest you have a number of special abilities in addition to your divine spells. To access your priestly abilities, simply right-click on yourself and select the special abilites icon on the left of the menu.</string>
<string name="50233">As a druid you have a number of special abilities in addition to your divine nature spells. To access your druidic abilities simply right-click on yourself and select the special abilites icon on the left of the menu.</string>
<string name="50234">Then, you must use your ability to turn undead to defeat the skeleton on the north wall.</string>
<string name="50235">Return to me once the task is complete, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I shall wait here to see how you fare.</string>
<string name="50236">This will bring up the special abilities menu. Click on the priestly ability icon in the bottom left of the menu to access your priestly special abilities.</string>
<string name="50237">The most important priestly ability you have is the ability to turn undead. Simply click on the icon from the special priest ability menu to use this ability.</string>
<string name="50238">This will bring up the special abilities menu. Click on the druidic ability icon in the bottom left of the menu to access your druidic special abilities.</string>
<string name="50239">The druid special abilities menu has an icon to summon your animal companion - a powerful ally in battle! As a druid, you should always try to have an animal companion by your side.</string>
<string name="50240">Not to worry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, wisdom rarely comes early. I will tell you again.</string>
<string name="50241">Certainly. I would not want you to miss out on the pursuit of knowledge through haste or confusion.</string>
<string name="50242">Of course, child. We shall repeat until it is as clear as the will of Tyr.</string>
<string name="50243">Never fear, I shall go over it again. My patience is a well that never runs dry.</string>
<string name="50244">Before you proceed to the Trials of Faith, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I will give you a final tutorial in the casting of divine spells. Ready?</string>
<string name="50245">Very well, then we shall dispense with the tutorial and proceed with the Trials of Faith.</string>
<string name="50246">Congratulations! You have passed my test. Speak with me before you leave.</string>
<string name="50247"></string>
<string name="50248"></string>
<string name="50249"></string>
<string name="50250">To access your spell list, press the &quot;B&quot; key or left-click on the SPELLBOOK icon below your character portrait.</string>
<string name="50251">You must speak to Elynwyd in the center of the room before you may undertake the trials of faith.</string>
<string name="50252">Only clerics and druids may undertake the trials of faith.</string>
<string name="50253">The Academy is under attack! The invaders must be slain!</string>
<string name="50254">To complete the Trial of Faith, you must cast a healing spell upon me. When this is done, you must go speak with Elynwyd in the center of the room once more.</string>
<string name="50255">You have completed the trials of faith, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You should go to the south assembly hall to join the others at the graduation ceremony.</string>
<string name="50256">I have been healed, but you have not completed the other part of the trials of faith.</string>
<string name="50257">Sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to interrupt.</string>
<string name="50258">Me sorry. Me not mean to interrupt.</string>
<string name="50259">I think I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="50260">What&apos;s your problem? I&apos;m just trying to be friendly.</string>
<string name="50261">Me go now.</string>
<string name="50262">Why you so mad? Me just want be talk at you.</string>
<string name="50263">Why do you want to meet Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50264">How&apos;s your training going?</string>
<string name="50265">I want to ask you a few questions.</string>
<string name="50266">Why you want meet Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50267">How you training going?</string>
<string name="50268">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50269">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="50270">What can you tell me about those rumors of a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="50271">How do you like training here at the Academy?</string>
<string name="50272">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="50273">You hear stuff &apos;bout cure for plague?</string>
<string name="50274">You like training at Academy?</string>
<string name="50275">I won&apos;t take much of your time. I promise.</string>
<string name="50276">Me speak at you quick. Me promise me not use much time.</string>
<string name="50277">You better answer my questions if you know what&apos;s good for you!</string>
<string name="50278">You answer me question or you be sorry!</string>
<string name="50279">Can you blame people for losing faith? After all, you can&apos;t help them.</string>
<string name="50280">Why you mad people lose faith? You not help them anyway.</string>
<string name="50281">Why are you disturbing me during my prayers? You are a &lt;class&gt;. You, of all people, should show respect toward my worship and devotional practices.</string>
<string name="50282">Can&apos;t you see that I&apos;m deep in study of this tome? The Academy might go easy on a &lt;class&gt; like you, but those of us wishing to call upon the divine cannot afford to waste our days chatting.</string>
<string name="50283">Greetings yet again. Is there something else you require before I resume my devotional prayers?</string>
<string name="50284">Please, I did not mean to give offense. But I have chosen to be a servant of Tyr and with such a choice comes great responsibility. I must attend to my daily worship.</string>
<string name="50285">I suppose it would be uncharitable of me to turn you away. But please do not take too much of my time. If I do not finish my devotions I will not be allowed to meet Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50286">Then I shall return to my prayers. May the blessings of Tyr be upon you.</string>
<string name="50287">I serve Tyr, but it is my duty to also serve my brothers and sisters here at the Academy. Ask your questions and I will do my best to answer.</string>
<string name="50288">Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande is a paragon of our faith. She is a devoted servant of Tyr, a sworn defender of Neverwinter and a true champion of justice. Her light shines like a beacon in these dark times.</string>
<string name="50289">I pray the graduates gathered in the south assembly hall appreciate what an honor it is to receive a blessing from her in person. It is truly a rare opportunity.</string>
<string name="50290">The worship of Tyr is a difficult path, but we who have the faith know the trials of service are their own reward.</string>
<string name="50291">And whenever my weak flesh falters, I need only look to Lady Aribeth for inspiration. I hope she has the time to come by the Temple later so I can meet her in person.</string>
<string name="50292">I am only a young acolyte in training, yet even the oldest priests at the Temple cannot recall a plague as devastating as the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="50293">The citizens have lost their faith. They have abandoned the spiritual power of the divine, and in their misery they have come to despise all who wear the sacred vestements. </string>
<string name="50294">They say the cure was discovered by a mage named Khelben Arunsun, but I sense the hand of Tyr himself working through the mage to bring us salvation.</string>
<string name="50295">Neverwinter is gripped by fear, the city quarantined and sectioned off in an attempt to halt the spread of the Wailing Death. Alas, the church can do nothing for these people.</string>
<string name="50296">Defend the Waterdhavian creatures! </string>
<string name="50297">I do not fear you. Here in the Temple the power of Tyr will keep me safe from all harm. Take your empty threats and leave me be.</string>
<string name="50298">People who profess faith only so long as it serves their needs are not true believers, they are hypocrites with false hearts. Who are we to question divine will? </string>
<string name="50299">I am confident that the Gods will ease the suffering of Neverwinter if we but hold true to our beliefs. Even now, there is talk of a cure being brought by Lady Aribeth to this city.</string>
<string name="50300">I believe it was the will of Tyr that brought Khelben and Lady Aribeth together to save Neverwinter. I hope I get a chance to meet Lady Aribeth while she is here at the Academy. </string>
<string name="50301">Ketta sent me to get a key from you.</string>
<string name="50302">Ketta say me need get key from you.</string>
<string name="50303">Nothing. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="50304">Maybe we could work out some kind of deal?</string>

<string name="50320">What you want? You here to get key from Bruno? Me got it safe right here... what? Key gone! Where be Bruno key? Someone take me key!</string>
<string name="50321">This not good. Ketta not be happy with me. Bruno better go now or Ketta maybe yell at him.</string>
<string name="50322">Help! We be attacked! You gots protect Waterdeep creatures!</string>
<string name="50323">I would like to receive a lesson in rogue skills.</string>
<string name="50324">Me want learn how be sneaky.</string>
<string name="50325">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50326">Me want ask you questions.</string>
<string name="50327">I am ready for your challenges.</string>
<string name="50328">Me ready for challenge.</string>
<string name="50329">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="50330">Could you go over the details of the challenge once more?</string>
<string name="50331">Me need you explain again.</string>
<string name="50332">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="50333">What do you know about the cure for the plague? </string>
<string name="50334">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="50335">Me want know &apos;bout cure for plague.</string>
<string name="50336">What can you tell me about Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50337">What you know &apos;bout Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50338">Simple.</string>
<string name="50339">Sorry, I didn&apos;t quite get that. Could you repeat yourself?</string>
<string name="50340">Me not understand. You tell me again, kay?</string>
<string name="50341">Got it.</string>
<string name="50342">Can you repeat that?</string>
<string name="50343">Maybe you say that again, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="50344">Okay. What else?</string>
<string name="50345">Would you be able to go over all that again?</string>
<string name="50346">Me want you say that again, please.</string>
<string name="50347">Right.</string>
<string name="50348">Could you go over that again?</string>
<string name="50349">Me need you tell me that again.</string>

<string name="50351">I didn&apos;t understand that last part.</string>
<string name="50352">Me no get what you just say.</string>
<string name="50353">I understand.</string>
<string name="50354">Me understand.</string>
<string name="50355">Could you go over that persuasion bit again, please?</string>
<string name="50356">Me want you tell me &apos;bout persuade again.</string>
<string name="50357">I don&apos;t need your tutorial. Let&apos;s just jump to the challenges.</string>
<string name="50358">Me not need you tutorial. Me just want go right to challenge.</string>
<string name="50359">Ready.</string>
<string name="50360">We&apos;re under attack! Don&apos;t let them get the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="50361">Come on over here. We need to have a chat.</string>
<string name="50362">Hi there. My name&apos;s Ketta, head of Security, Espionage and Intrigue here at the Academy. No need to tell me who you are; my sources are way ahead of you. You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, ain&apos;t ya?</string>
<string name="50363">Now I know you&apos;re not one of those prissy types who frowns on a little sneaky skullduggery. I mean, that&apos;s why you&apos;re here, ain&apos;t it? To learn the ins and outs of the rogue&apos;s life.</string>
<string name="50364">My sources never figured you as the type to go in for this whole creeping cloak and dagger bit, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but maybe we had you pegged wrong.</string>
<string name="50365">So, are you interested in learning a little about the arts of those who operate on the shady side of the law, or do you need something else? </string>
<string name="50366">Back again, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Not sure what you need. You&apos;re no rogue, so there&apos;s not much I can teach you in that department. So what do you need?</string>
<string name="50367">Back again, &lt;FirstName&gt;? So, you ready to test your mettle against one of my challenges? If you can pull off this job you&apos;re finally free, and your sentence here at the Academy will be at an end.</string>
<string name="50368">See you &apos;round.</string>
<string name="50369">What are you doing back here, &lt;FirstName&gt;? You&apos;re done, it&apos;s over, you made it! You better get down to the south assembly hall if you want to get that blessing from Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50370">Well, don&apos;t worry, you&apos;ve come to the best. I know all the tricks of the trade, and I&apos;m going to teach them to you.</string>
<string name="50371">Let&apos;s start with something simple, like picking a lock. This only works if you have ranks in the Pick Lock skill. Simply right-click on the door or container and select the &quot;Pick Lock&quot; icon from the menu. </string>
<string name="50372">Some locks may be beyond your ability to open, but using a lockpick increases your chances. Simply right-click on the lockpick, select the Use icon, then left-click on the door to use the pick.</string>
<string name="50373">Okay, let&apos;s look at another basic rogue skill. Suppose you want to disarm, recover or flag a trap so other players can see it. Just right-click on the door or container and select the trap icon, then select your action from the trap menu.</string>
<string name="50374">Remember, you have to detect a trap before you can disarm it! You&apos;ll know a trap is still active if it shows up as bright red. Again, this will only work if you have ranks in the Disable Traps skill.</string>
<string name="50375">Ah, I knew it! Everyone&apos;s a rogue at heart, right? Okay, listen up and I&apos;ll go over it all for you.</string>
<string name="50376">Let&apos;s look at how to pick pockets. Remember, this only works if you have ranks in the Pick Pocket skill.</string>
<string name="50377">Start by right-clicking on your victim to bring up the menu. Now select the pick pocket icon from the lower left of the menu.</string>
<string name="50378">Hey, relax. There&apos;s nothing to it. All you have to do is bring me the key from inside that chest on the east wall. Of course, it&apos;s locked and the key&apos;s inside, so you&apos;ll have to pick the lock.</string>
<string name="50379">When you successfully pick someone&apos;s pocket you have a chance to get a random item from their inventory or a chance to come away with some of their gold.</string>
<string name="50380">Just be careful. I can tell you from past experience that people don&apos;t like catching you with your hand in their pocket! </string>
<string name="50381">A rogue needs to know how to move without being seen or heard: there&apos;s a real art to sneaking.</string>
<string name="50382">Your Stealth ability is a combination of your Hide and Move Silently skills. While in Stealth mode creatures must make an opposed check based on their Spot and Listen skills in order to detect you.</string>
<string name="50383">To activate Stealth mode right click on yourself and select the icon on the left to bring up your special ability menu. From this menu simply select Stealth. Your character will become semi-transparent while in Stealth mode.</string>
<string name="50384">There are a number of factors that affect &quot;Stealth Mode.&quot; Your rank in the Hide and Move Silently skills, shadows and lighting in the area, and line of sight of nearby enemies all affect your ability to use &quot;Stealth Mode.&quot;</string>
<string name="50385">Is there a problem, &lt;FirstName&gt;? You having a little trouble with the challenge? You want me to go over it one more time? </string>
<string name="50386">Questions, eh? I always get antsy when someone starts interrogating me. But I don&apos;t see any harm in telling you what you want to know. Okay, shoot.</string>
<string name="50387">I&apos;m not supposed to talk about the plague with the students anymore. Seems like the higher ups think I&apos;m the one responsible for starting those conspiracy theories running rampant through the barracks.</string>
<string name="50388">But I know this plague was no accident! My spy network hasn&apos;t been able to find out who caused it, or why. But if my sources are accurate at least help is on the way.</string>
<string name="50389">Seems that archmage Khelben Arunsun has come up with a cure, according to reports delivered to Lady Aribeth. Not that I was spying on her, you understand. I was just snooping around for practice, you know?</string>
<string name="50390">You&apos;re learning quick, &lt;FirstName&gt;. When you want the real scoop, you come to me. I know all about Khelben Arunsun and the Waterdhavian creatures. </string>
<string name="50391">I think that&apos;s the real reason Lady Aribeth is here today, to keep an eye on those Waterdhavian creatures and make sure nothing happens to them.</string>
<string name="50392">That Elf has her good and bad points. She&apos;s smart and tough and gets the job done, but she&apos;s a goody-goody paladin of Tyr. She&apos;s always getting upset at me for &quot;borrowing&quot; her things.</string>
<string name="50393">I got a funny feeling she&apos;ll be coming to speak to me about a certain missing comb once she finishes handing out blessings to the graduating students in the south assembly hall. </string>
<string name="50394">Seems the archmage has figured out how to brew a cure for the Wailing Death using reagents gathered from strange and exotic monsters, monsters that have been brought to the Academy for safekeeping.</string>
<string name="50395">While in &quot;Stealth Mode&quot; you won&apos;t be able to move faster than a walk. If you want to run again, you&apos;ll have to click on &quot;Stealth Mode&quot; to turn it off.</string>
<string name="50396">Or you can bring me the key from the chest behind the door in the north wall of this room. The chest isn&apos;t locked, but you&apos;ll have to find and disarm the trap on the door before you can get inside.</string>
<string name="50397">Or you can bring me the key held by my rather dense assistant Bruno standing over there in the corner. Don&apos;t hurt him, mind you! </string>
<string name="50398">Now would also be a good time to tell you about the rogue&apos;s Sneak Attack ability. Rogues get a bonus on To-Hit rolls as well as multipliers to damage when launching surprise attacks at an opponent&apos;s flank.</string>
<string name="50399">You could try to pick his pocket or, if you&apos;re a real sweet talker, you might be able to persuade him to hand it over to you. </string>
<string name="50400">The choice is yours: the lock, the trap or Bruno. Bring me any one of those keys and you pass the test.</string>
<string name="50401">Hey, I never give up. We&apos;ll just keep trying until we get it right. I call it persistence, though others just call it recidivism.</string>
<string name="50402">Stuck on traps, are we? Ha-ha! Just a little rogue humor there. Sorry. I&apos;ll explain it again.</string>
<string name="50403">No harm in retracing our steps, is there? Plus, it helps to confuse the search parties.</string>
<string name="50404">That&apos;s okay, I don&apos;t mind going over it again. More stage time for me, right?</string>
<string name="50405">Don&apos;t get the wrong idea. Sometimes all the lockpicking and sneak attacks in the world won&apos;t get the job done. That&apos;s when we rogues have to be as quick with our speech as we are with our hands. </string>
<string name="50406">Often during dialog you&apos;ll have a chance to persuade somebody to give you more information or perform a certain task. The higher your rank is in the Persuade skill, the better your chance of fast-talking your way through a situation.</string>
<string name="50407">A high charisma also helps with persuasion - the more attractive and likeable you are, the more people are willing to believe you.</string>
<string name="50408">I think I could be &apos;persuaded&apos;! Oh, that was a stinker. Forget I even said that.</string>
<string name="50409">Well, I guess that&apos;s it. We&apos;ve pretty much plumbed the depths of my knowledge, and you soaked it all up like a sponge.</string>
<string name="50410">I&apos;ve got some challenges to test your skills, if you think you&apos;re up to them. It&apos;s the last step in your training before we graduate you from the Academy.</string>
<string name="50411">Well, I guess that&apos;s it. We&apos;ve pretty much plumbed the depths of my knowledge, and you soaked it all up like a sponge. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="50412">I see you&apos;ve got the key on you. Well done, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Let me be the first to congratulate you. Your work here at the Academy is all but done.</string>
<string name="50413">Now, unless there was something else you needed, you had better get down to the south assembly hall if you want to get that blessing from Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50414">Consider this a final tutorial before you tackle the Academy&apos;s final challenge. Everything you wanted to know about rogues but were afraid to ask. Ready?</string>
<string name="50415">Well, you wouldn&apos;t be the first to skip the tutorial and jump right into the action. And I see you&apos;re chomping at the bit to get this done. </string>
<string name="50416">You passed the test but don&apos;t get too cocky. Come and talk to me before you leave.</string>
<string name="50417">How do you know my name?</string>
<string name="50418">How you know me name?</string>
<string name="50419">I think I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="50420">Sorry, you must have me confused with someone else.</string>
<string name="50421">Me go now.</string>
<string name="50422">Me think you not know me. You thinking of some other one.</string>
<string name="50423">Why are you so interested in Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50424">How&apos;s your training going, Shade?</string>
<string name="50425">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="50426">Why you want spy on Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50427">How you training going, Shade?</string>
<string name="50428">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50429">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="50430">Have you heard those rumors about a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="50431">How do you like training here at the Academy?</string>
<string name="50432">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="50433">You hear stuff &apos;bout cure for plague?</string>
<string name="50434">You like training at Academy?</string>
<string name="50435">I thought you were just a spy!</string>
<string name="50436">Me thought you just be spy!</string>
<string name="50437">Sounds like you&apos;ve got a crush on her.</string>
<string name="50438">It sound like you maybe love her.</string>
<string name="50439">Don&apos;t worry - I still want to get together.</string>
<string name="50440">You no worry - me still want see you later.</string>
<string name="50441">Actually, I can&apos;t get together with you later after all.</string>
<string name="50442">Me sorry. Me no can see you later.</string>
<string name="50443">Forget it, Shade. I&apos;m not going to date someone who&apos;s been stalking me.</string>
<string name="50444">Flattery. I like it.</string>
<string name="50445">No offense, but I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="50446">Me like what you say.</string>
<string name="50447">Me here for training! Me not care &apos;bout this stuff!</string>
<string name="50448">Me no want date man who be stalking me.</string>
<string name="50449">Actually I&apos;m not seeing anyone right now.</string>
<string name="50450">That&apos;s really none of your business.</string>
<string name="50451">Me not seeing anyone right now.</string>
<string name="50452">That not be none of you business!</string>
<string name="50453">I&apos;d like that, Shade.</string>
<string name="50454">Sorry, but I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="50455">Uh... I&apos;m already going with somebody. Sorry, Shade.</string>
<string name="50456">Me like that, Shade.</string>
<string name="50457">Me not interested. Sorry.</string>
<string name="50458">Uh... me got date already. Sorry, Shade.</string>
<string name="50459">Back off, you creepy little freak!</string>
<string name="50460">Me not like you! You be creepy freak boy!</string>
<string name="50461">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="50462">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50463">What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="50464">What you mean by that?</string>
<string name="50465">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="50466">Where can I find Silk?</string>
<string name="50467">Where Silk be?</string>
<string name="50468">Hello, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You don&apos;t know me, but you can just call me Shade. </string>
<string name="50469">Back again, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Need to pick my brain one more time, or is there something else?</string>
<string name="50470">Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s nothing sinister. Just a little harmless spying on my part. Ketta says I need to practice my espionage skills. I&apos;ve been watching you for quite some time.</string>
<string name="50471">But now that you&apos;re almost done with your training here at the Academy I&apos;m going to have to find someone else to spy on. Hmmm... maybe Lady Aribeth would make a nice target.</string>
<string name="50472">Farewell then, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps I will see you again, though you might not see me.</string>
<string name="50473">Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, if you don&apos;t want to talk, just say so, but don&apos;t play me for a fool. I know exactly who you are.</string>
<string name="50474">Of course. Normally an Academy spy charges to distribute information, but since I&apos;m still technically in training I guess I could answer a few questions for free.</string>
<string name="50475">If you&apos;re going to spy on someone it might as well be someone in charge, right? Aribeth knows a lot more about this plague then she&apos;s letting on. You can&apos;t blame me for being curious.</string>
<string name="50476">Of course if I get caught they&apos;ll probably expel me... or worse. But the danger is part of the appeal. And Aribeth is a beautiful woman. Some might say that alone is reason enough to spy on her.</string>
<string name="50477">I spend my days hidden in the shadows and my nights veiled in darkness. The life of a spy is a lonely one, I&apos;m afraid. </string>
<string name="50478">And yet it has a hold on me I cannot break free of. To follow someone who doesn&apos;t know you are there, to study him or her when they think they are safe and alone. It&apos;s a feeling like no other.</string>
<string name="50479">To know you hold the life of the one you watch in your hands, that at any moment your orders may change and force you to become not a spy but an assassin... forgive me, I&apos;ve said too much.</string>
<string name="50480">Don&apos;t be so naive, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There is a dark side to espionage. Assassination is an unpleasant but at times very necessary aspect of the job.</string>
<string name="50481">Let&apos;s just say I&apos;m intrigued. Does the famous paladin have a *naughty* side? Besides, a powerful, beautiful woman like Aribeth can turn any man&apos;s head. </string>
<string name="50482">Surely you must know that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. While spying on you I&apos;ve seen it happen many times. After all, you&apos;re a powerful and beautiful woman yourself.</string>
<string name="50483">Well, I could go into grisly detail about the bodies in the streets, or give you a gruesome description of the symptoms of the Wailing Death and the stages of the affliction as it ravages its victims.</string>
<string name="50484">Mark my words, the Wailing Death is no accident. A plague that the priests can&apos;t cure? That sounds like wizards&apos; work to me! Of course I haven&apos;t found any evidence to back up my theory yet, but I&apos;ll keep digging until I do.</string>
<string name="50485">Of course I&apos;ve heard the rumors. I am a spy, after all. They say Khelben Arunsun gave a cure to Lady Aribeth. I bet that&apos;s why she&apos;s here at the Academy right now. Maybe I should try tailing her to see what I can turn up.</string>
<string name="50486">Ah, we meet again &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope you aren&apos;t coming to tell me you&apos;re having second thoughts about our little rendezvous later this evening.</string>
<string name="50487">But I suspect we&apos;ve all had our fill of such things. Besides, I&apos;m much more interested in who or what might be behind the plague. Ketta&apos;s had me gathering information on possible conspiracies to bring down Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="50488">But Aribeth is already involved with somebody. A priest named Fenthick. And what about you, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I haven&apos;t seen a man in your life since I&apos;ve been watching you. </string>
<string name="50489">But I&apos;m only interested in her from a professional perspective. You, however, are a woman of character. I find you very... fascinating.</string>
<string name="50490">As you wish. Some women are threatened by my line of work. I thought you were the type who welcomed a little excitement in her life but I see I was mistaken. Is there anything else you need?</string>
<string name="50491">I find that hard to believe - a fascinating woman like you without a man in her life. </string>
<string name="50492">I do apologize, but you must remember that it&apos;s my job to be interested in things that are not my business. Particularly when they involve such a fascinating woman as yourself.</string>
<string name="50493">There&apos;s a feast for the graduates later this evening. Would you like to accompany me to the celebration? It&apos;s a chance for you to learn as much about me as I already know about you. </string>
<string name="50494">I promise you an evening you&apos;ll remember for the rest of your life. I won&apos;t say any more. Best to let the mystery and anticipation build. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="50495">Then farewell until the feast. Don&apos;t worry, I promise tonight will be the most memorable evening of your life.</string>
<string name="50496">Stalking? All I did was spy on you and follow you and learn as many secret things about you as I could. That is my job, after all. You should consider it a form of flattery.</string>
<string name="50497">This must be a very recent development, or I would already have known about it. Ah, well. My hesitation has cost me my chance, I suppose. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="50498">But I am still in training and so far Ketta has limited my tasks to simple reconaissance. Perhaps once I&apos;ve proved myself Ketta will let me try my spying skills on Lady Aribeth herself. </string>
<string name="50499">Don&apos;t worry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, spying on you was just harmless practice. The Academy would never have me eliminate another student, especially not one as talented and beautiful as you. </string>
<string name="50500">Don&apos;t worry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, spying on you was just harmless practice. The Academy would never have me eliminate another student, especially not one as talented and capable as you. </string>
<string name="50501">Protect the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="50502">You made it mighty clear how things are between us. I don&apos;t see any reason to talk to someone who considers me a &apos;creepy little freak&apos;.</string>
<string name="50503">Excellent. I promise you an evening you&apos;ll never forget as long as you live. Is there something else I can do for you in the meantime?</string>
<string name="50504">I see. Obviously you have made up your mind about me. Well, don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t bother you again. And I won&apos;t be following you any more, either.</string>
<string name="50505">Ah, yes, I know you. You&apos;re &lt;FirstName&gt;. Silk has had her eye on you.</string>
<string name="50506">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. No doubt Silk will be seeing you soon - though you might not see her.</string>
<string name="50507">I really thought you would have figured it out by now. Silk has been spying on you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s part of her training.</string>
<string name="50508">It really isn&apos;t my place to say any more. You should really speak to Silk about this.</string>
<string name="50509">Hmmm... there might be some questions you ask that I really shouldn&apos;t answer, especially if they concern my fellow students.</string>
<string name="50510">She&apos;s over there in the northeast alcove of the room. She&apos;s been watching you this whole time.</string>
<string name="50511">How do you know my name?</string>
<string name="50512">How you know me name?</string>
<string name="50513">I think I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="50514">Sorry, you must have me confused with someone else.</string>
<string name="50515">Me go now.</string>
<string name="50516">Me think you not know me. You thinking of some other one.</string>
<string name="50517">Why are you so interested in Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50518">How&apos;s your training going, Silk?</string>
<string name="50519">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="50520">Why you want spy on Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50521">How you training going, Silk?</string>
<string name="50522">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50523">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="50524">Have you heard those rumors about a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="50525">How do you like training here at the Academy?</string>
<string name="50526">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="50527">You hear stuff &apos;bout cure for plague?</string>
<string name="50528">You like training at Academy?</string>
<string name="50529">I thought you were just a spy!</string>
<string name="50530">Me thought you just be spy!</string>
<string name="50531">Sounds like you&apos;re a little jealous.</string>
<string name="50532">It sound like you maybe jealous.</string>
<string name="50533">Don&apos;t worry - I still want to get together.</string>
<string name="50534">You no worry - me still want see you later.</string>
<string name="50535">Actually, I can&apos;t get together with you later after all.</string>
<string name="50536">Me sorry. Me no can see you later.</string>
<string name="50537">Forget it, Silk. I&apos;m not interested in someone who&apos;s been stalking me.</string>
<string name="50538">I find dangerous women *very* interesting.</string>
<string name="50539">You&apos;re really not my type, Silk.</string>
<string name="50540">Me like danger type girls.</string>
<string name="50541">Me not be interested in that kind of woman!</string>
<string name="50542">Me no want date girl who be stalking me.</string>
<string name="50543">That&apos;s kind of a personal question.</string>
<string name="50544">That not be none of you business!</string>
<string name="50545">I&apos;d like that, Silk.</string>
<string name="50546">Sorry, but I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="50547">Uh... I&apos;m already going with somebody. Sorry, Silk.</string>
<string name="50548">Me like that, Silk.</string>
<string name="50549">Me not interested. Sorry.</string>
<string name="50550">Uh... me got date already. Sorry, Silk.</string>
<string name="50551">Back off, you psychotic freak!</string>
<string name="50552">Me not like you! You be psycho freak girl!</string>
<string name="50553">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="50554">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50555">What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="50556">What you mean by that?</string>
<string name="50557">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="50558">Where can I find Shade?</string>
<string name="50559">Where Shade be?</string>
<string name="50560">Hello, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You don&apos;t know me, but you can just call me Silk. </string>
<string name="50561">Back again, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Need to pick my brain one more time, or is there something else?</string>

<string name="50568">Of course, if I get caught, they&apos;ll probably expel me... or worse, but the danger is part of the appeal. Besides, maybe I&apos;ll finally figure out why so many men seem infatuated with that woman. </string>

<string name="50573">Let&apos;s just say I&apos;m confused. Why would anyone be interested in that paladin? Honor, duty, virtue - boring. What&apos;s the appeal? Don&apos;t men want a woman who&apos;s a little bit... mysterious?</string>
<string name="50574">Tell me the truth, &lt;FirstName&gt;. What do you want in a woman? A goody-two shoes paladin, or someone a bit... naughty? A girl who knows secrets? A woman who is... dangerous? </string>
<string name="50575">Well, I could go into grisly detail about the bodies in the streets, or give you a gruesome description of the symptoms of the Wailing Death and the stages of the affliction as it ravages its victims.</string>

<string name="50581">I&apos;m sorry, but it&apos;s my job to be interested in things that are none of my business. Besides, being a bad girl is part of my charm. Doesn&apos;t it make me more interesting? </string>
<string name="50582">You&apos;ll be leaving the Academy soon - why don&apos;t we get together tonight? After the graduation ceremonies. Just the two of us. You can learn some of my secrets for a change.</string>
<string name="50583">I promise it will be an evening you&apos;ll remember for the rest of your life. I won&apos;t say anymore - best to let the mystery and anticipation build. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>

<string name="50590">Protect the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="50591">You made it clear how things are between us. I don&apos;t see any reason to talk to someone who considers me a &apos;psychotic freak&apos;.</string>
<string name="50592">Excellent. I promise you an evening you&apos;ll never forget as long as you live. Is there something else I can do for you in the meantime?</string>
<string name="50593">I see. Obviously you have made up your mind about me. Well, don&apos;t worry - I won&apos;t bother you again. And I won&apos;t be following you anymore, either.</string>

<string name="50599">He&apos;s over there on the south wall of the room. He&apos;s been watching you this whole time.</string>
<string name="50600">I have to confess that since I started spying on you I&apos;ve become a little bit obsessed. Hazard of the job, I guess. But I couldn&apos;t help wondering what it would be like to get to know you more... intimately. </string>
<string name="50601">Aren&apos;t you going to help me?</string>
<string name="50602">You not be help me?</string>
<string name="50603">I will do as you command, Lady Aribeth!</string>
<string name="50604">Me do as you say!</string>
<string name="50605">Why should I listen to you?</string>
<string name="50606">You not boss of me. Me do what me want.</string>
<string name="50607">Enemies? Who are these enemies you speak of?</string>
<string name="50608">Enemies? Who they be?</string>
<string name="50609">Everyone at the Academy seemed to know about the Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="50610">Me hear lots people talk &apos;bout Water-thingy monsters.</string>
<string name="50611">But the attackers are all dead. The threat is over, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="50612">But all bad mans be dead. We safe now, right?</string>
<string name="50613">Where can I find these creatures, Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="50614">Wait a minute, you&apos;re not coming with me?</string>
<string name="50615">Where me find creatures?</string>
<string name="50616">It sound like you not be going with me?</string>
<string name="50617">I will do as you command, Lady Aribeth!</string>
<string name="50618">Me do as you say.</string>
<string name="50619">Why should I listen to you?</string>
<string name="50620">You not boss of me. Me do what me want.</string>
<string name="50621">I&apos;ll do it - but the reward better be worth the trouble!</string>
<string name="50622">Me do it &apos;cause you give me lots gold later.</string>
<string name="50623">I&apos;ll do it, but the reward had better be worth the trouble.</string>
<string name="50624">Me do it, but only &apos;cause you give me lots gold later.</string>
<string name="50625">Congratulations. Your training here at the Academy is now complete. May the blessing of Tyr be upon you. </string>
<string name="50626">I have been looking forward to meeting you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The instructors here at the Academy speak very highly of your skills. I am Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande.</string>
<string name="50627">Perhaps after the graduation ceremonies we can speak in private. Neverwinter can use a good &lt;man/woman&gt; like you.</string>
<string name="50628">We are under attack! Destroy the invaders!</string>
<string name="50629">I must speak with you!</string>
<string name="50630">Listen to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, there is not much time. I fear this is no random attack we have suffered.</string>
<string name="50631">Do not waste any more time speaking to me! Quickly, you must find the Waterdhavian creatures. Do not let them be taken by the invaders!</string>
<string name="50632">Hurry! Make your way into the hall and then to the chambers down the east corridor. That is where the Waterdhavian beasts are kept. </string>
<string name="50633">By accompanying you, I will only make your task more difficult. Our attackers appeared here in this room. It is likely their arrival was magically centered on me.</string>
<string name="50634">Our enemy must have assumed I would be with the Waterdhavian creatures. Even now they may be watching me through magical means, hoping I will lead them right to the creatures.</string>
<string name="50635">I must stay here. Hopefully the attackers, and any reinforcements, will be drawn to me here in this room. This may allow you to save the creatures.</string>
<string name="50636">The lives of thousands of innocent people hang in the balance! If the creatures are lost, the cure for the Wailing Death will be lost with them!</string>
<string name="50637">But if that is not enough to garner your loyalty, know that you will be greatly rewarded if you manage to save the Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="50638">The fate of Neverwinter depends on you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The key will open the door. May Tyr be with you!</string>
<string name="50639">As you may already know, a number of creatures were brought from Waterdeep here to the Academy. It was believed the reagents for a spell to create a cure could be extracted from them.</string>
<string name="50640">We tried to keep this information secret. But this attack reveals our secret is well known, even to our enemies.</string>
<string name="50641">I fear the entire Academy is under assault. Listen, can you not hear the faint echoes of battle coming from distant halls?</string>
<string name="50642">Rumors spread more quickly than the plague itself, or so it would seem. But what is done cannot be undone, we must focus on the task at hand.</string>
<string name="50643">Neverwinter has many enemies. Some declare themselves openly, such as the city of Luskan. Others keep their identities hidden from us, striking from the shadows.</string>
<string name="50644">I do not know who is behind this attack, but it is obvious they are here to destroy our hope of ending the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="50645">You must protect the Waterdhavian creatures, &lt;FirstName&gt;! They must not be allowed to fall into the enemy&apos;s hands!</string>
<string name="50646">I would take you to the creatures myself if I could. But I fear my presence would make protecting the creatures more difficult, if not impossible.</string>
<string name="50647">Our attackers appeared here in this room. It is likely their arrival was magically centered on me. They must have assumed I would be with the Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="50648">Even now our enemy may be watching me through magical means, hoping I will lead them right to where the creatures are kept. I cannot take that risk. </string>
<string name="50649">You must do this alone, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Go back through the hallway leading to this room and take the corridor to the east. It leads to the chambers where the Waterdhavian beasts are being kept.</string>
<string name="50650">Take this key, &lt;FirstName&gt;, it will open the locked door back in the hallway leading to this room. I will stay here; hopefully my presence will draw the enemy away from the creatures they seek.</string>
<string name="50651">The lives of thousands of innocent people hang in the balance! If the creatures are lost a cure for the Wailing Death will be lost with them!</string>
<string name="50652">But if that is not enough to garner your loyalty, know that you will be greatly rewarded if you manage to save the Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="50653">Perhaps after the graduation ceremonies we can speak in private. Neverwinter can use a good &lt;man/woman&gt; like you.</string>
<string name="50654">We should arrange... wait! What was that? Did you feel it, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Brace yourself, we are under attack!</string>
<string name="50655">As director of the Academy let me offer you congratulations on completing your training, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="50656">The instructors speak highly of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Rarely has a &lt;class&gt; shown such promise so early in their career.</string>
<string name="50657">Forgive me, but I am too busy with the proceedings to chat right now. We have a large number of graduates today, all eager to receive their blessings from Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50658">If you have not already done so, you should go see Lady Aribeth so that you may receive congratulations and her personal blessing.</string>
<string name="50659">We are under attack! Protect the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="50660">Defend the Academy! For the glory of Tyr!</string>
<string name="50661">Truly, we have reached a great milestone in our lives. Long have I prayed for this day. </string>
<string name="50662">And Tyr has answered my prayers with a great bounty, a blessing from Lady Aribeth herself! Be certain you speak with her, lest you miss out on receiving your own blessing.</string>
<string name="50663">Lady Aribeth truly is a paragon of virtue and a stalwart defender of Tyr&apos;s justice, is she not? I even hear she has discovered a cure for the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="50664">I thank my divine lord Tyr for giving me the chance to meet Aribeth in person. You must hurry and speak to her or you will miss out on receiving your blessing.</string>
<string name="50665">The Academy is under attack! To arms! To arms!</string>
<string name="50666">I never thought I&apos;d make it to graduation. I still have nightmares of Herban screaming at me during basic training!</string>
<string name="50667">But the chance to meet Lady Aribeth makes it all worth it in the end. Make sure you get up there, you don&apos;t want to miss out on getting your blessing. </string>
<string name="50668">I heard Lady Aribeth isn&apos;t here just for the graduation ceremony. I heard she&apos;s brought a cure for the Wailing Death to the Academy for safekeeping!</string>
<string name="50669">But I don&apos;t really care why she&apos;s here, I&apos;m just glad I got the chance to meet her. You should really get up there or you&apos;ll miss out on getting your blessing.</string>
<string name="50670">Blast the invaders into dust! Char their bones with magic fire!</string>
<string name="50671">Lady Aribeth understands that arcane magic isn&apos;t to be feared. She actually respects wizards instead of fearing them like most of the people in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="50672">It&apos;s an honor to actually meet someone as famous as Aribeth. You better go speak to her yourself, or you won&apos;t receive your blessing. </string>
<string name="50673">I hear Lady Aribeth is friends with Khelben Arunsun, the famous archmage from Waterdeep. Together they&apos;re working on a cure for the Wailing Death. </string>
<string name="50674">It&apos;s an honor to meet someone who actually knows Khelben. You should go speak to Aribeth too, so you can receive a blessing from her hand.</string>
<string name="50675">A sneak attack! We must slay the enemy!</string>
<string name="50676">Isn&apos;t this exciting? We actually get a chance to meet Lady Aribeth!</string>
<string name="50677">Most paladins want nothing to do with rogues and spies, but she&apos;s actually here in person! You better get up there or you&apos;ll miss your chance to get your blessing from her.</string>
<string name="50678">There&apos;s whispers around the Academy that Lady Aribeth is just using the graduation as a cover. They say she&apos;s really come to the Academy with a cure for the Wailing Death. </string>
<string name="50679">Pretty sneaky... for a paladin. Say, you better stop chatting with me and get up there or you&apos;ll miss out on your blessing.</string>
<string name="50680">What&apos;s this? I was expecting Aribeth, not some wet-behind-the-ears &lt;class&gt;!</string>
<string name="50681">Let&apos;s see how you deal with my minions, fool!</string>
<string name="50682">I see you are strong. A little too strong for my taste!</string>
<string name="50683">I think we need to change your tactics.</string>
<string name="50684">I think I&apos;ll do better off on my own.</string>
<string name="50685">We need to change the distance you stay away from me.</string>
<string name="50686">Six feet.</string>
<string name="50687">Twelve feet.</string>
<string name="50688">Eighteen feet.</string>
<string name="50689">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="50690">Could you alter your spell casting practices?</string>
<string name="50691">I want you to use your most powerful spells first.</string>
<string name="50692">Try to overpower monster with higher level spells.</string>
<string name="50693">Try to user appropriately powered spells for the monsters we fight.</string>
<string name="50694">Could we change how quickly you decide to heal me.</string>
<string name="50695">Heal me if I become somewhat injured (below 75% of total hit points).</string>
<string name="50696">Heal me if I become wounded (below 50% of total hit points).</string>
<string name="50697">Heal me if I become seriously wounded (below 25% of total hit points).</string>
<string name="50698">Could you not search all the time?</string>
<string name="50699">Could you please search when we move around?</string>
<string name="50700">Could you use more stealth when we travel?</string>
<string name="50701">Could you stop being so stealthy all the time?</string>
<string name="50702">If I fail to open a locked door or chest, please come to my aid.</string>
<string name="50703">If I fail to open a locked door or chest, do not assist me.</string>
<string name="50704">I don&apos;t want to change anything else right now.</string>
<string name="50705">We need change way you do stuff.</string>
<string name="50706">Me no want you here no more.</string>
<string name="50707">You change how far away you stay.</string>
<string name="50708">You need change how you shoot spells.</string>
<string name="50709">You need change how you heal me.</string>
<string name="50710">You not search all time no more.</string>
<string name="50711">You search all time when we move.</string>
<string name="50712">You stop sneaking so quiet now.</string>
<string name="50713">You start sneak quiet now.</string>
<string name="50714">If me fail on locked door or chest, you help me.</string>
<string name="50715">If me fail on locked door or chest, you not help me.</string>
<string name="50716">Me not want change anything else now.</string>
<string name="50717">Use you most powerful spells first.</string>
<string name="50718">You try overpower monster with higher level spells.</string>
<string name="50719">You try use strong spells on strong baddies and weak spells on weak baddies.</string>
<string name="50720">You heal if me sort of hurt (below 75% of total hit points).</string>
<string name="50721">You heal if me wounded (below 50% of total hit points).</string>
<string name="50722">You heal if me hurt real bad (below 25% of total hit points).</string>
<string name="50723">Yes. Go.</string>
<string name="50724">No. Stay.</string>
<string name="50725">Okay, join up with me.</string>
<string name="50726">Okay, you be join up with me.</string>
<string name="50727">Sorry, not interested.</string>
<string name="50728">Join up?</string>
<string name="50729">Yes, &lt;FirstName&gt;, is there something you need?</string>
<string name="50730">If you feel that&apos;s best. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="50731">How far away do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="50732">Certainly. How would you like me to cast my spells?</string>
<string name="50733">Of course. How soon would you like me to heal you?</string>
<string name="50734">Please don&apos;t send me away! I&apos;ll never make it out of here alive on my own! You&apos;re not really going to abandon me, are you?</string>
<string name="50735">Thank the gods you&apos;re here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I thought those goblins were going to be the death of me!</string>
<string name="50736">It&apos;s me, Pavel! Remember? This whole place is crawling with enemies - they killed my brother, Bim! Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you have to let me join up with you.</string>
<string name="50737">Okay, you&apos;re the boss.</string>
<string name="50738">I... I can&apos;t go on by myself. I&apos;m not cut out for this. Please &lt;FirstName&gt;, if you reconsider... come find me here.</string>
<string name="50739">If you feel that&apos;s best. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="50740">How far away do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="50741">Very well, I shall stay six feet away from you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="50742">Very well, I shall stay 12 feet away from you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="50743">Very well, I shall stay 18 feet away from you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="50744">Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="50745">Was there anything else?</string>
<string name="50746">Very well, I shall hold nothing back and use my most powerful spells first.</string>
<string name="50747">Very well, I will attack creatures with spells I feel will overwhelm them with their power.</string>
<string name="50748">Very well, I will cast my spells in accordance with the difficulty of our enemy.</string>
<string name="50749">I shall do as you have asked.</string>
<string name="50750">Very well, I will no longer search while we are moving.</string>
<string name="50751">Very well, I will search whenever we are moving.</string>
<string name="50752">Very well, I will travel in stealth mode from now on.</string>
<string name="50753">Very well, I will no longer travel in stealth mode.</string>
<string name="50754">Very well, I will open any locked door or chest that you fail to open.</string>
<string name="50755">Very well, I will no longer attempt to open locked doors or chests.</string>
<string name="50756">Everybody needs help from someone once in a while, someone with skills you don&apos;t have. Or sometimes you just need some extra muscle or magical firepower.</string>
<string name="50757">That&apos;s why most towns have places you can go to hire henchmen to join up with you. When you talk to them, they&apos;ll be quick to offer their services for a fee.</string>
<string name="50758">But I&apos;m not asking you to pay me anything. I just want to join up with you so I can avenge Bim&apos;s death... and maybe get out of here alive.</string>
<string name="50759">You&apos;re my only chance to get out of here alive, &lt;FirstName&gt;! And I won&apos;t be any trouble - please let me join up with you!</string>
<string name="50760">I&apos;ll follow you and use my skills to help you out. If you ever want to give me more specific instructions, just speak to me. I&apos;ll change my tactics accordingly.</string>
<string name="50761">I&apos;ve got a mind of my own, but you&apos;re the one in charge. I&apos;ll need your help, too. If I get hurt, I might need you to heal me.</string>
<string name="50762">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Together we&apos;ve got at least half a chance.</string>
<string name="50763">I need to speak to you!</string>
<string name="50764">I&apos;m ready to learn how to level up.</string>
<string name="50765">Me ready for learn how level up.</string>
<string name="50766">Could you teach me how to level up?</string>
<string name="50767">You teach me how level up.</string>
<string name="50768">I don&apos;t need you to teach me how to level up.</string>
<string name="50769">Me not need you teach me how level up!</string>
<string name="50770">Ready.</string>
<string name="50771">Can you go over that again?</string>
<string name="50772">Me need you say that again.</string>
<string name="50773">Please continue.</string>
<string name="50774">Can you go over that again?</string>
<string name="50775">Me want you go over that stuff again.</string>
<string name="50776">Simple enough.</string>
<string name="50777">You lost me.</string>
<string name="50778">I must speak to you.</string>
<string name="50779">Many fierce enemies await you beyond this door. You will need to draw upon all you have learned here at the Academy to survive.</string>
<string name="50780">You have gained much experience, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but to put that experience to use I must first teach you how to level up. Leveling up is how you gain access to greater hit points, skills, feats and spells.</string>
<string name="50781">Then we shall begin the lesson.</string>
<string name="50782">To level up you must first access your character record sheet. Don&apos;t do this now or you&apos;ll end our conversation. You&apos;ll have to listen to the instructions then try it when we&apos;re done speaking.</string>
<string name="50783">You can access your character sheet by pressing &quot;C&quot; on your keyboard, by left-clicking the CHAR box beneath your portrait or through the menu. Remember, you&apos;ll have to wait until after our conversation is over to do this. Are you ready to continue?</string>
<string name="50784">Greetings once more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I see you have not yet leveled up. You must do this before you can pass through the south door.</string>
<string name="50785">As you wish. You may pass through the south door only after you have leveled up.</string>
<string name="50786">Well, I was going to give you additional lessons on how to Level Up, but you have already managed just fine. I have nothing more I can teach you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="50787">I am too old to go with you, but the south door is now open for you. Beyond you will find chambers leading to the Waterdhavian creatures... if the attackers have not taken them already.</string>
<string name="50788">Whenever you have enough experience points to go up to another level you will see a flashing LEVEL UP box at the center of your character record sheet. Left-click this box to begin your level up.</string>
<string name="50789">You can cancel the level up process at any time by left-clicking on the CANCEL box on the level up screen. To level up, first select the class you wish to gain a level in. </string>
<string name="50790">You can have levels in up to three different classes. Some classes may not be available to you because of alignment restrictions. After selecting the class you wish to gain a level in, click the OK box.</string>
<string name="50791">After selecting the class to level up in, the SKILLS page appears. Click on a skill to assign a skill point and gain a rank in that specific skill. Or, if you wish, you can click the RECOMMENDED box in the bottom left.</string>
<string name="50792">This will automatically assign your skill points in a pre-selected default package based on your class and level. When you are done with the SKILLS page click OK.</string>
<string name="50793">This will bring up the FEATS page, if you have any new feats available. Available feats are listed in a menu on the left. Click the arrow beside a feat and it will move to the &quot;Known Feats&quot; menu on the right. Again you can click the RECOMMENDED box for a default package.</string>
<string name="50794">Then I shall go over it once more. After all, this is important.</string>
<string name="50795">Depending on your class and level other pages will also appear during the level up process. Using the mouse you may have to select new spells, assign ability point increases, or choose a new familiar or animal companion.</string>
<string name="50796">Simply follow along each page and click OK when you are finished. At any time you can click the CANCEL box to quit the process and start over. </string>
<string name="50797">This is the end of our lesson, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Only once you have leveled up will you be able to pass through the south door.</string>
<string name="50798">I have come from Lady Aribeth. She sent me to protect the creatures.</string>
<string name="50799">Me come from Lady Aribeth. She send me for protect the creatures.</string>
<string name="50800">I told you bringing the creatures to the Academy was a mistake, Fenthick! They would have been safer with my Helmites!</string>
<string name="50801">Your Helmite brethren could not have done anymore to protect the Waterdhavian creatures, Desther. The enemy numbers were too great.</string>
<string name="50802">How did they know the Waterdhavian beasts had been brought to the Academy, Desther? Is there a traitor among us?</string>
<string name="50803">Everyone knew, Fenthick! The students here could talk of nothing else! My Helmites would have been more discrete!</string>
<string name="50804">Do not waste your time looking for a traitor or spy, Fenthick. We have only to blame the gossiping mouths of the Academy students.</string>
<string name="50805">Listen - the sounds of battle coming from the Academy have faded. The enemy has been defeated, the assailants are all slain or driven off.</string>
<string name="50806">My Helmites could have kept their arrival secret, unlike the students here. You let your feelings for Aribeth sway you in this matter, Fenthick.</string>
<string name="50807">But at what cost, Fenthick? The Waterdhavian creatures are gone - as is all hope for a cure!</string>
<string name="50808">We must not give up hope, Desther. The creatures escaped into the city during the confusion of the battle. Perhaps... perhaps we may yet find them once more.</string>
<string name="50809">And what of the students at the Academy? Only a handful remain - the rest have been slaughtered because Aribeth foolishly thought the creatures would be safe here.</string>
<string name="50810">All is lost, Fenthick. The nymph has fled; the yuan-ti and the other creatures have escaped into the streets of the city. And where was Aribeth during all this?</string>
<string name="50811">You? Did Aribeth really expect a... a whelp such as this would be able to defend the Waterdhavian creatures? Is she really so blind to the truth, Fenthick?</string>
<string name="50812">Desther! I will have you speak no more ill of Lady Aribeth. She did what she thought was best.</string>
<string name="50813">Bah! I know of the feelings you and Lady Aribeth have for each other, but it does nothing to change the facts. She was wrong to bring the creatures here.</string>
<string name="50814">I will leave you and your lady love to clean up this mess, Fenthick. I must go and make arrangements to recover the cure Aribeth has so carelessly lost.</string>
<string name="50815">We came too late! The creatures are lost, the Academy students slain... NO! This cannot be! How could this happen?</string>
<string name="50816">Yes, I am &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="50817">You right. Me name be &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="50818">Aribeth? Have you spoken to her recently?</string>
<string name="50819">Aribeth? When you speak at her?</string>
<string name="50820">Is the battle over then?</string>
<string name="50821">Do you know who attacked the Academy?</string>
<string name="50822">So what happens now?</string>
<string name="50823">Fight over now?</string>
<string name="50824">You find out who bad guys be?</string>
<string name="50825">What we do now?</string>
<string name="50826">I will help you in this task, Fenthick.</string>
<string name="50827">Would there be some type of reward for recovering the missing creatures?</string>
<string name="50828">Aribeth promised me a reward earlier. I&apos;m still waiting for it.</string>
<string name="50829">I suppose my work here is done. I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="50830">Me want help you, Fenthick.</string>
<string name="50831">You gonna give lots gold if me get monsters back?</string>
<string name="50832">Aribeth already promise me reward, but me not get it yet.</string>
<string name="50833">Me guess me done here. Me go now.</string>
<string name="50834">I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="50835">Me not interested.</string>
<string name="50836">You have no right to do this!</string>
<string name="50837">Given the choices, I guess I&apos;ll help you.</string>
<string name="50838">You not got no right for do this!</string>
<string name="50839">Me got no choice - me help you.</string>
<string name="50840">I wish to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50841">Me want ask you stuff.</string>
<string name="50842">I will meet you at the Halls of Justice within the week then.</string>
<string name="50843">Me meet yous at Justice place in the week, then.</string>
<string name="50844">Tell me about yourself.</string>
<string name="50845">Tell me about Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50846">Tell me about Desther.</string>
<string name="50847">Me want know stuff &apos;bout you.</string>
<string name="50848">Me want know stuff &apos;bout Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50849">Me want know stuff &apos;bout Desther.</string>
<string name="50850">Tell me more about these Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="50851">Me want know more &apos;bout Waterdeep monsters.</string>
<string name="50852">So you and Aribeth are lovers?</string>
<string name="50853">You and Aribeth be all lovey?</string>
<string name="50854">I have come from Lady Aribeth. She sent me to protect the creatures.</string>
<string name="50855">Me come from Lady Aribeth. She send me for save creatures.</string>
<string name="50856">You must forgive Desther. The strain of the Wailing Death weighs heavily on the Helmites.</string>
<string name="50857">As their leader, Desther has worked long and hard to help ease the suffering of Neverwinter, and this most recent setback has upset him greatly.</string>
<string name="50858">We came too late! The creatures are lost, the Academy students slain... NO! This cannot be! How could this happen?</string>
<string name="50859">You are the student she sent? Did Aribeth really think a... a whelp such as this could defend the Waterdhavian creatures? She should have come herself! Is she really so blind, Fenthick?</string>
<string name="50860">Desther! I will have you speak no more ill of Lady Aribeth. She did what she thought was best.</string>
<string name="50861">Bah! I know of the feelings you and Lady Aribeth have for each other, but it does nothing to change the facts. She was wrong to bring the creatures here.</string>
<string name="50862">I will leave you and your lady love to clean up this mess, Fenthick. I must go and make arrangements to recover the cure Aribeth has so carelessly lost.</string>
<string name="50863">I am Fenthick Moss, priest of Tyr and companion of the Lady Aribeth. You must be &lt;FirstName&gt;, the student Aribeth told me about.</string>
<string name="50864">Desther and I arrived with reinforcements shortly after the attack began. We found Aribeth in the south assembly chamber, hard pressed by dozens of the mysterious assailants. </string>
<string name="50865">We managed to drive off the attackers and Aribeth told us she had sent one of the students on ahead to defend the Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="50866">While Aribeth tended to the wounded, one of the mages who had arrived with the reinforcements teleported Desther and me to this room. Alas, we arrived to find the cages upturned, the creatures fleeing.</string>
<string name="50867">A few straggling goblins are all that remain of our attackers, but I fear we have lost this battle. The Waterdhavian creatures are gone.</string>
<string name="50868">We have no clues as to who planned the attack, and I doubt any prisoners we take will know anything about who is truly behind this. </string>
<string name="50869">In any case, discovering their identity is secondary. Our first priority must be to recapture the Waterdhavian creatures so that we may extract a cure for the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="50870">We have no clues as to who planned the attack, and I doubt any prisoners we take will know anything about who is truly behind this.</string>
<string name="50871">A few straggling goblins are all that remain of our attackers, but I fear we have lost this battle. The Waterdhavian creatures are gone.</string>
<string name="50872">I would like to think whoever helps in this task does so out of a selfless desire to end the misery of the plague, &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="50873">However, I have no doubt that there will be both gold and glory for those who recover the Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="50874">I have no doubt Aribeth&apos;s offer was sincere, but the creatures are gone, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You cannot expect a reward for *failing*.</string>
<string name="50875">Understand that I am not trying to lay blame; that will not change what has happened. But now we must focus our efforts on recovering the cure.</string>
<string name="50876">Neverwinter needs you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, now more than ever. The plague has taken many good men and women, and this attack has cost the lives of even more. </string>
<string name="50877">We need all the help we can get if the cure for the Wailing Death is to be recovered. In the coming week we will rally what resources we can and reconvene in the Hall of Justice.</string>
<string name="50878">I didn&apos;t want it to come to this, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but if necessary I will conscript you into Neverwinter&apos;s service for the good of the city.</string>
<string name="50879">Your name and face will be posted at every garrison. The city is quarantined, there is nowhere you can run. </string>
<string name="50880">I&apos;m afraid you have no choice in this matter. You can either help us in this task, or you can rot in jail.</string>
<string name="50881">By the laws of the city, I do. These are desperate times, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I am a desperate man.</string>
<string name="50882">From all accounts you are a capable &lt;man/woman&gt;, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Aribeth told me the instructors at the Academy spoke very highly of you.</string>
<string name="50883">I do not know what role you are to play in this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That is for my Lady Aribeth to decide. You must meet her at the Halls of Justice in the coming week.</string>
<string name="50884">Lady Aribeth will have more information for you then. Hopefully we&apos;ll have a better understanding of what we are up against. We must all do our part, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="50885">Time is of the essence, &lt;FirstName&gt;, although I suppose I can answer a few quick questions.</string>
<string name="50886">There is much to attend to in the coming week. Aribeth and I will meet you at the temple. May Tyr&apos;s blessing be upon you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="50887">I am a servant of Tyr, nothing more and nothing less. I serve Neverwinter as is my duty, and my heart weeps as the city suffers. </string>
<string name="50888">When Lord Nasher appointed Aribeth to find a cure for the plague, I vowed to stay by my Lady&apos;s side throughout the ordeal. We are inseparable.</string>
<string name="50889">Aribeth and I are of one heart, it is true. Is this surprising? We are both disciples of Tyr, we are both servants of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="50890">We draw our strength from each other during these difficult times. In duty, in our faith and in our love we will find a way to beat the Wailing Death!</string>
<string name="50891">Aribeth is the shining light who must guide our way. She is a paladin of Tyr, and only her courage and devotion to Neverwinter surpass her grace and beauty.</string>
<string name="50892">Desther is a good man, though the Wailing Death weighs heavily on him. He does not serve Tyr as my Lady Aribeth or I do, but his devotion to Helm is most admirable.</string>
<string name="50893">Desther and his Helmites have been tireless in their efforts to offer what comfort they can to those afflicted by the plague.</string>
<string name="50894">I only wish Aribeth and Desther could set aside their personal differences. No matter which god we serve, we must all work together in these troubled times.</string>
<string name="50895">Aribeth is the only one who has the authority to speak of such things freely. You will have to talk to her at the Halls of Justice.</string>
<string name="50896">Please listen to what I have to say.</string>
<string name="50897">All is lost, Fenthick. The nymph has fled; the yuan-ti and the other creatures have escaped into the streets of the city. And where was Aribeth during all this?</string>

<string name="50903">You have become a thorn in my side.</string>
<string name="50904">Your pathetic life ends here!</string>
<string name="50905">You and all of Neverwinter are doomed.</string>
<string name="50906">I will crush you beneath my boot. </string>
<string name="50907">Kill the Dryad!</string>
<string name="50908">No! I must escape!</string>
<string name="50909">They&apos;ve freed the Yuan-Ti!</string>
<string name="50910">My bonds are broken, I must escape this place.</string>
<string name="50911">Sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to interrupt.</string>
<string name="50912">Me sorry. Me not mean to interrupt.</string>
<string name="50913">I think I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="50914">What&apos;s your problem? I&apos;m just trying to be friendly.</string>
<string name="50915">Me go now.</string>
<string name="50916">Why you so mad? Me just want be talk at you.</string>
<string name="50917">Why do you want to meet Lady Aribeth so badly?</string>
<string name="50918">How&apos;s your training going?</string>
<string name="50919">I want to ask you a few questions.</string>
<string name="50920">Why you want meet Aribeth so bad?</string>
<string name="50921">How you training going?</string>
<string name="50922">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="50923">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="50924">Have you heard those rumors about a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="50925">How do you like training here at the Academy?</string>
<string name="50926">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="50927">You hear stuff &apos;bout cure for plague?</string>
<string name="50928">You like training at Academy?</string>
<string name="50929">I won&apos;t take much of your time. I promise.</string>
<string name="50930">Me speak at you quick. Me promise me not use much time.</string>
<string name="50931">You better answer my questions if you know what&apos;s good for you!</string>
<string name="50932">You answer me question or you be sorry!</string>
<string name="50933">Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m practicing my drills? You&apos;re a &lt;class&gt;. You should know how hard basic training is. So why are you bothering me? </string>
<string name="50934">Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m practicing my drills? The Academy might go easy on a &lt;class&gt; like you, but those of us training under Herban can&apos;t afford to waste our time chatting! </string>
<string name="50935">Back again? I&apos;m pretty busy here - what do you want this time?</string>
<string name="50936">Look, I&apos;m not trying to be rude. It&apos;s just that Herban doesn&apos;t like us taking breaks from our drills. It&apos;s a sign of weakness!</string>
<string name="50937">I guess I could spare a few minutes for you, but make it quick. I have to finish my drills so I can attend the graduation ceremonies in the south assembly. I don&apos;t want to miss my chance to meet Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="50938">Then I&apos;ll get back to my drills.</string>
<string name="50939">Get on with it then. The sooner you ask, the sooner I can get back to my training.</string>
<string name="50940">Lady Aribeth represents everything the Academy stands for: skill and bravery and honor! She&apos;s the reason I joined the Academy in the first place.</string>
<string name="50941">She&apos;s young, but she&apos;s already proved her heroism a dozen times over. That&apos;s why Lord Nasher put her in charge of dealing with the plague.</string>
<string name="50942">It&apos;s not for the faint of heart, that&apos;s for sure! Rise at dawn, march for an hour and then an hour of drills. And that&apos;s just before breakfast! </string>
<string name="50943"> Herban doesn&apos;t stand for weakness or failure. He drives the recruits hard, but these are tough times. Anyone who can&apos;t take it probably shouldn&apos;t be training at the Academy anyway.</string>
<string name="50944">The training is tough, but the rewards are worth it. Lady Aribeth herself is even here to congratulate the graduating recruits. The chance to meet her in person is inspiration enough for me.</string>
<string name="50945">I try not to think about it, to tell you the truth. I need to stay focused on my training. But since you brought it up, there&apos;s one thing I don&apos;t understand about the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="50946">There&apos;s something unnatural about this plague, though it seems nobody wants to admit it. I guess they&apos;re afraid of panic in the streets. But you can&apos;t deny the facts. </string>
<string name="50947">I heard about Blackstaff and his cure. I don&apos;t like putting put my faith in wizards, but I heard Lady Aribeth trusts him. She&apos;s at the Academy, you know. I hope I get a chance to meet her. </string>
<string name="50948">Where did it come from? Neverwinter&apos;s the only city that seems to be suffering. And why can&apos;t the priests cure it? </string>
<string name="50949">Defend the Waterdhavian creatures! Don&apos;t let them be taken!</string>
<string name="50950">You can&apos;t be serious - everybody knows fighting between recruits will get you kicked out of the Academy! Take your blustering threats somewhere else. I&apos;ve got to get back to my drills.</string>

<string name="51004">The image of a flaming hand has been painstakingly dyed into the loose-spun fabric, presumably the symbol of a local wizards&apos; guild.</string>
<string name="51005">The simple pennant, crudely painted, is scrawled with gibberish. A red border surrounds it.</string>
<string name="51006">The banner depicts a noble blade, shown stark against the purple background. It has the appearance of a warrior&apos;s guild crest about it.</string>
<string name="51007">A wicked-looking axe has been woven into the hanging tapestry, possibly the emblem of a local barbarian gathering.</string>
<string name="51008">Halfling Merc Padded Armor</string>
<string name="51009">Elven rangers and warriors are given cloaks like this one to help hide them while patrolling the borders of their land. Each cloak can vary in power, possibly based on the station of the elf who originally wore it.</string>
<string name="51010">Armor of this type began to appear in the lands adjacent to Thay after the Year of Smoldering Spells, 1020DR. An irremovable coating of soot has blackened it, dulling noise of movement and making it ideal for stealthy endeavors. Close examination, however, reveals that the charring was not the result of externally applied heat, and suggests the original owner suffered some sort of Thayvian induced combustion. This lends a very morbid feeling to the item.</string>

<string name="51028">Time to run, time to run!</string>
<string name="51029">You want to pick on somebody?! Come on!</string>
<string name="51030">You keep an eye on me, all right? You guard me well.</string>
<string name="51031">Hold this spot. This spot right here!</string>
<string name="51032">Not good. Can&apos;t go much longer.</string>
<string name="51033">Eugh! I can taste it... I&apos;m poisoned.</string>
<string name="51034">Blasted magical whatsis! My spell flopped!</string>
<string name="51035">What the...? My weapon does nothing!</string>
<string name="51036">Get in step. Follow me.</string>
<string name="51037">Over here. Check this out.</string>
<string name="51038">Form up form up! Get ready around me!</string>
<string name="51039">Outta the way, all right? </string>
<string name="51040">Now, let&apos;s pick this lock nice and easy.</string>
<string name="51041">Have a good look around. Gotta be something here.</string>
<string name="51042">Get down and out! Hide!</string>

<string name="51044">Nope, can&apos;t do that.</string>
<string name="51045">This bit is done and done. </string>
<string name="51046">Someone give me a hand. This is too much to carry.</string>
<string name="51047">What? What is it?</string>
<string name="51048">Good on ya. Hello.</string>
<string name="51049">Sure. Yes.</string>
<string name="51050">Nope.</string>
<string name="51051">Stop!</string>
<string name="51052">I want to rest. There, I said it.</string>
<string name="51053">I wonder, could we be doing ANY LESS with our time?</string>
<string name="51054">Bye then, if that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="51055">I gotta say thanks for that, friend.</string>
<string name="51056">Well that&apos;s... just... dandy!</string>
<string name="51057">Woohoo!</string>
<string name="51058">I got somthing to say here. Listen up.</string>
<string name="51059">That&apos;s a pretty good idea there.</string>
<string name="51060">Nope, that idea just don&apos;t hold water.</string>
<string name="51061">Youuuu just watch yourself! I&apos;m warning you!</string>
<string name="51062">To your weapons, and don&apos;t let up! Attack!</string>
<string name="51063">Let&apos;s have at it!</string>
<string name="51064">Time for a bit of the game!</string>
<string name="51065">Rraaaghh!</string>
<string name="51066">Patch me up. I need healing.</string>
<string name="51067">Little help here!</string>
<string name="51068">I have my eye on our enemy here.</string>
<string name="51069">This one&apos;s lost! Time to leave!</string>
<string name="51070">Why don&apos;t you come have a try at me!</string>
<string name="51071">Watch my back and guard well.</string>
<string name="51072">Hold this spot like it was home.</string>
<string name="51073">I&apos;ve life in me yet... I think.</string>
<string name="51074">Not good. I think I&apos;ve been poisoned.</string>
<string name="51075">Blasted magics! My spell has had it.</string>
<string name="51076">What the... My weapon can&apos;t touch &apos;em!</string>
<string name="51077">Step with me. Come on, follow along.</string>
<string name="51078">Well, have a look here.</string>
<string name="51079">Gather here. Group near me.</string>
<string name="51080">One side, now. I need some room here.</string>
<string name="51081">This lock needs some tinkering, I think.</string>
<string name="51082">Have to take a careful look around this place, I think.</string>
<string name="51083">Best get out of sight, and fast, too.</string>
<string name="51084">I can do that.</string>
<string name="51085">I can&apos;t do that.</string>
<string name="51086">The task is done.</string>
<string name="51087">This load is a bit of a strain.</string>
<string name="51088">Well now, what do you want?</string>
<string name="51089">Well, hello to you.</string>
<string name="51090">I believe so.</string>
<string name="51091">I&apos;d say not.</string>
<string name="51092">Stop.</string>
<string name="51093">I think a bit of a rest is in order.</string>
<string name="51094">This is a boring bit of business.</string>
<string name="51095">Fare you well, then.</string>
<string name="51096">I have to say thanks, I do.</string>
<string name="51097">Damnation!</string>
<string name="51098">Hooray!</string>
<string name="51099">Give a listen here. I need to speak.</string>
<string name="51100">That&apos;s a fine idea.</string>
<string name="51101">I have my doubts about that idea.</string>
<string name="51102">You step back, or so help me.... !</string>
<string name="51103">By my direction, attack!</string>
<string name="51104">No quarter!</string>
<string name="51105">Time to die!</string>
<string name="51106">To the fight!</string>
<string name="51107">Heal my wounds. Now.</string>
<string name="51108">I need some help here. Now!</string>
<string name="51109">I&apos;ve got them spotted. Here.</string>
<string name="51110">This is not going well. Time to leave!</string>
<string name="51111">Here! Fight me! Come on!</string>
<string name="51112">You act as guard. Watch my back. </string>
<string name="51113">Hold this spot, and don&apos;t move.</string>
<string name="51114">I&apos;m dying... This is not good.</string>
<string name="51115">Ugh... poisoned... damn.</string>
<string name="51116">Ugh! My magic has failed!</string>
<string name="51117">My weapon... Ineffective? What?</string>
<string name="51118">Follow me. Now.</string>
<string name="51119">Well, have a look at this here.</string>
<string name="51120">Everyone group here. Rally around me.</string>
<string name="51121">Move aside, will you?</string>
<string name="51122">This lock needs to be dealt with carefully.</string>
<string name="51123">Scour this area. It should be closely examined.</string>
<string name="51124">Quietly now. Into the shadows.</string>
<string name="51125">I can do this.</string>
<string name="51126">No, I can&apos;t do that.</string>
<string name="51127">I&apos;m done with this. </string>
<string name="51128">Ugh... This is too much to carry.</string>
<string name="51129">Yes? What is it?</string>
<string name="51130">Well met. Hello.</string>
<string name="51131">I am certain.</string>
<string name="51132">I must say no.</string>
<string name="51133">Stop.</string>
<string name="51134">I need rest. Soon.</string>
<string name="51135">I need to get moving. This is a waste of time.</string>
<string name="51136">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="51137">I appreciate that. Thanks.</string>
<string name="51138">By the hells!</string>
<string name="51139">Not bad, not bad at all!</string>
<string name="51140">I&apos;ve something to say, here.</string>
<string name="51141">That&apos;s a good thought. Good idea.</string>
<string name="51142">Bad idea. Not good at all.</string>
<string name="51143">You just be careful. I&apos;m warning you...</string>
<string name="51144">Attack!</string>
<string name="51145">Rrraaaaagh!!!</string>
<string name="51146">Rip you to shreds!</string>
<string name="51147">Nothing walks away!</string>
<string name="51148">I need some healing here.</string>
<string name="51149">Back me up here. I need a hand!</string>
<string name="51150">Got something here! Get ready!</string>
<string name="51151">That&apos;s it! This fight is lost!</string>
<string name="51152">Bring it here! Try me!</string>
<string name="51153">Guard me here.</string>
<string name="51154">Hold this spot. Don&apos;t leave it.</string>
<string name="51155">I&apos;m hurt bad... Close to dying.</string>
<string name="51156">Ooh... Don&apos;t feel well... Poisoned.</string>
<string name="51157">Ugh... Blasted spell failure.</string>
<string name="51158">Not even a dent! This weapon is useless!</string>
<string name="51159">Get in step. Follow me.</string>
<string name="51160">Over here. Look at this.</string>
<string name="51161">To me! Rally here!</string>
<string name="51162">Give me some room. Now.</string>
<string name="51163">This lock should be picked before I put my foot through it.</string>
<string name="51164">This place needs a thorough search. </string>
<string name="51165">Hide! Now!</string>
<string name="51166">I can do that.</string>
<string name="51167">No. Can&apos;t do it.</string>
<string name="51168">Job&apos;s done over here.</string>
<string name="51169">Whoa... This pack is too heavy.</string>
<string name="51170">Yeah? What?</string>
<string name="51171">Good to see you!</string>
<string name="51172">Yes, yes.</string>
<string name="51173">No, I&apos;d say not.</string>
<string name="51174">Stop.</string>
<string name="51175">I need time to rest.</string>
<string name="51176">This is boring. I have to find some action.</string>
<string name="51177">Farewell then.</string>
<string name="51178">Well, thanks for that.</string>
<string name="51179">Rrrazza my... son of a... rrghr!</string>
<string name="51180">Ha HA!!</string>
<string name="51181">Quiet now. I&apos;ve something to say.</string>
<string name="51182">That idea, that&apos;s a good one. </string>
<string name="51183">That idea is just plain bad.</string>
<string name="51184">Unless you want to end this in a pool of your own blood, back off!</string>
<string name="51185">At my command, attack!</string>
<string name="51186">You shall feel my wrath!</string>
<string name="51187">You shall fall here today!</string>
<string name="51188">This battle will be your last!</string>
<string name="51189">I require healing. Tend to me.</string>
<string name="51190">I need someone by my side. Help me.</string>
<string name="51191">I have seen the enemy. Over here.</string>
<string name="51192">This battle is lost! Time to retreat!</string>
<string name="51193">To me! Attack me here!</string>
<string name="51194">Watch over me well. Let nothing harm me.</string>
<string name="51195">Hold this spot. Do not move, whatever comes.</string>
<string name="51196">I&apos;ll not last much longer. I&apos;m dying.</string>
<string name="51197">Poisoned. I have been poisoned.</string>
<string name="51198">My spell has failed. Hmph!</string>
<string name="51199">My weapon has had no effect?</string>
<string name="51200">Follow where I lead.</string>
<string name="51201">There is something here. Look.</string>
<string name="51202">Rally together around where I stand.</string>
<string name="51203">Could you move a moment, please.</string>
<string name="51204">This lock needs to be carefully nullified.</string>
<string name="51205">I would search this place carefully. There may be something here.</string>
<string name="51206">To the shadows, and quick.</string>
<string name="51207">I will do it.</string>
<string name="51208">I cannot do this.</string>
<string name="51209">This task is complete.</string>
<string name="51210">I carry too much. It will hamper my performance.</string>
<string name="51211">Is there something you want?</string>
<string name="51212">I bid you hello.</string>
<string name="51213">Yes.</string>
<string name="51214">No.</string>
<string name="51215">Stop.</string>
<string name="51216">We should rest if our skills are to be at their best. </string>
<string name="51217">We waste too much time. There is much to do.</string>
<string name="51218">Fare you well.</string>
<string name="51219">I appreaciate what you have done.</string>
<string name="51220">By all that is... Ugh!</string>
<string name="51221">Wonderful!</string>
<string name="51222">I have something that must be said.</string>
<string name="51223">I think that&apos;s a fine idea.</string>
<string name="51224">I don&apos;t think this idea is wise.</string>
<string name="51225">Do not temp my anger! You would regret it!</string>
<string name="51226">Get on them! Attack, attack, attack!</string>
<string name="51227">Give it up! You ain&apos;t got a chance!</string>
<string name="51228">Raaagh HAHAHA!!</string>
<string name="51229">I&apos;ll bust you good!</string>
<string name="51230">Heal me up! Get to it!</string>
<string name="51231">Get on over here! I need a hand!</string>
<string name="51232">Spotted some enemies over here. </string>
<string name="51233">Time to get the hell out! This one&apos;s lost!</string>
<string name="51234">Come on! Bring it here!</string>
<string name="51235">Keep an eye on my back. Guard it good.</string>
<string name="51236">Just stay right here. Hold this spot.</string>
<string name="51237">Hurt me bad... real bad...</string>
<string name="51238">That ain&apos;t good. Poisoned...</string>
<string name="51239">My spell got messed up. Dammit!</string>
<string name="51240">Raaagh! This weapon does nothing!</string>
<string name="51241">Come on, follow me. Keep up.</string>
<string name="51242">Take a look. There&apos;s something here.</string>
<string name="51243">Group up here! Form up!</string>
<string name="51244">Outta the way. Move it.</string>
<string name="51245">Gotta get this lock off before I &quot;pick&quot; it with my boot!</string>
<string name="51246">Gotta take a good look around here. Might be something...</string>
<string name="51247">Get out of sight. Hide.</string>
<string name="51248">Yeah. I can do it.</string>
<string name="51249">Nope, can&apos;t do that.</string>
<string name="51250">I&apos;m done with this.</string>
<string name="51251">This is too much. I can&apos;t carry all this garbage.</string>
<string name="51252">Yeah? Something you want?</string>
<string name="51253">Yeah, hello. </string>
<string name="51254">Yeah.</string>
<string name="51255">No, can&apos;t say so.</string>
<string name="51256">Stop.</string>
<string name="51257">I&apos;m tired of this. I need rest now.</string>
<string name="51258">Let&apos;s get moving. Find some action somewhere!</string>
<string name="51259">See you. Bye.</string>
<string name="51260">Thanks for that. Good stuff.</string>
<string name="51261">Damn it all!</string>
<string name="51262">That&apos;s the stuff! Ha!</string>
<string name="51263">Listen here. I got something to say.</string>
<string name="51264">Now that&apos;s a good idea.</string>
<string name="51265">That&apos;s not gonna work. Just a bad idea.</string>
<string name="51266">You keep it up and I&apos;ll tear you a new hell.</string>
<string name="51267">Attack, I say, attack!</string>
<string name="51268">You are SO gonna feel some wrath!</string>
<string name="51269">Back! Back to wherever!</string>
<string name="51270">I will overcome!</string>
<string name="51271">Bring your healing arts unto me. Nowzah!</string>
<string name="51272">I need help here. Stand with me.</string>
<string name="51273">I see our quarry. There&apos;s enemies here.</string>
<string name="51274">The fight will be won another day! For now, time to fly!</string>
<string name="51275">Bring it to me! I&apos;ll give it right back!</string>
<string name="51276">Watch my back. Guard it well.</string>
<string name="51277">Let no one take this spot. Hold here.</string>
<string name="51278">I am injured... This is no way to go out...</string>
<string name="51279">I got some bad blood in me... Poisoned...</string>
<string name="51280">My magic has faltered. Typical.</string>
<string name="51281">My attack is denied?</string>
<string name="51282">Step behind me. Follow, my friend.</string>
<string name="51283">I have seen something. Look here.</string>
<string name="51284">Gather around me. Yes, rally here.</string>
<string name="51285">Stand a side a moment. Make way.</string>
<string name="51286">A crafty thing, but this lock will be picked.</string>
<string name="51287">Look carefully here. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s something.</string>
<string name="51288">Hide! Quick! Out of sight!</string>
<string name="51289">I most certainly can.</string>
<string name="51290">Not a chance.</string>
<string name="51291">It is done, done and done.</string>
<string name="51292">I can&apos;t carry all of this by myself. It&apos;s too much.</string>
<string name="51293">What would you like?</string>
<string name="51294">Hello hello.</string>
<string name="51295">Well, yes.</string>
<string name="51296">I have to say no.</string>
<string name="51297">Stop.</string>
<string name="51298">Time to lay down my head. I really need to rest.</string>
<string name="51299">There&apos;s got to be something better to do than just waiting here.</string>
<string name="51300">Goodbye then.</string>
<string name="51301">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="51302">Damnation, damnation!</string>
<string name="51303">Jubilation!</string>
<string name="51304">You need to hear the message I bring. You need to!</string>
<string name="51305">A right good idea. Yes indeed!</string>
<string name="51306">That&apos;s just a bad idea. It ain&apos;t right.</string>
<string name="51307">Keep it up and I&apos;ll knock you into LAST week so you can spend until now looking forward to me kicking your tail again!</string>
<string name="51308">Strike at them! Attack!</string>
<string name="51309">Let the earth take you!</string>
<string name="51310">Perish as you should!</string>
<string name="51311">Taste of my wrath!</string>
<string name="51312">I need healing. Tend to my wounds.</string>
<string name="51313">I need help here! Aid me!</string>
<string name="51314">I have sight of our enemy. </string>
<string name="51315">It is time to flee this place! </string>
<string name="51316">Attack me then! Let us decide this here!</string>
<string name="51317">Guard over me cafeully.</string>
<string name="51318">Stay rooted to this spot.</string>
<string name="51319">I am... In need of a healer... Quickly...</string>
<string name="51320">Impurities... I have been poisoned.</string>
<string name="51321">Ugh! The energy of my spell has failed.</string>
<string name="51322">My attack has no effect?</string>
<string name="51323">Walk in my step. Follow me.</string>
<string name="51324">There is something here... Out of place.</string>
<string name="51325">Rally where I stand. Gather here!</string>
<string name="51326">Could you move aside? I need a bit of room.</string>
<string name="51327">A careful erosion of the lock is needed.</string>
<string name="51328">The area should be examined for any... oddities. </string>
<string name="51329">Let the shadows conceal you, and quickly.</string>
<string name="51330">I will attempt it.</string>
<string name="51331">This is beyond me. I can&apos;t do this.</string>
<string name="51332">I have finished with this.</string>
<string name="51333">My pack is too heavy. It is difficult to carry.</string>
<string name="51334">Is there something you wish?</string>
<string name="51335">Yes, hello to you..</string>
<string name="51336">Yes, that is so.</string>
<string name="51337">No, I don&apos;t believe so.</string>
<string name="51338">Stop.</string>
<string name="51339">I think some well-deserved rest is in order.</string>
<string name="51340">I&apos;ll put down roots if we sit here too long.</string>
<string name="51341">Goodbye then.</string>
<string name="51342">Nature&apos;s thanks to you.</string>
<string name="51343">Mother of all...!</string>
<string name="51344">Good show!</string>
<string name="51345">I&apos;ve something to say.</string>
<string name="51346">A fine idea.</string>
<string name="51347">That&apos;s not a very good idea.</string>
<string name="51348">Do not pressure me further! I will do as I must!</string>
<string name="51349">By my will, attack!</string>
<string name="51350">Faith shall grant me victory!</string>
<string name="51351">Fall before the righteous!</string>
<string name="51352">You will not prevail!</string>
<string name="51353">Quickly, my wounds need tending. Heal me.</string>
<string name="51354">I require help here! To my side!</string>
<string name="51355">I have seen our enemy. Here.</string>
<string name="51356">We must defend this cause another day. Retreat!</string>
<string name="51357">Here! I shall defeat you!</string>
<string name="51358">Watch over me. Guard me well.</string>
<string name="51359">Hold here. Do not retreat from this spot.</string>
<string name="51360">Gods have mercy... I&apos;m dying.</string>
<string name="51361">I can feel it... I&apos;m poisoned.</string>
<string name="51362">My spell has failed? </string>
<string name="51363">My attack has no effect?</string>
<string name="51364">Walk in my step. Follow me.</string>
<string name="51365">Have a look here. Something interesting...</string>
<string name="51366">Gather here. Rally by me.</string>
<string name="51367">Could you move aside for one moment?</string>
<string name="51368">This lock needs to be picked with care.</string>
<string name="51369">A search of this place could turn up something.</string>
<string name="51370">To the shadows with you! Hide!</string>
<string name="51371">I can do this.</string>
<string name="51372">I fear I cannot do this.</string>
<string name="51373">The task is complete.</string>
<string name="51374">My pack is too heavy. It is awkward.</string>
<string name="51375">Is there something you need?</string>
<string name="51376">Greetings and well met.</string>
<string name="51377">I say yes.</string>
<string name="51378">I must say no.</string>
<string name="51379">Stop.</string>
<string name="51380">I must rest myself soon.</string>
<string name="51381">My skills should be put to use. Sitting idle is a waste.</string>
<string name="51382">Farewell, then. </string>
<string name="51383">I appreciate that. Thank you.</string>
<string name="51384">God&apos;s take this...!</string>
<string name="51385">Well done!</string>
<string name="51386">I have something that needs saying.</string>
<string name="51387">A fine idea, I believe.</string>
<string name="51388">A poor idea. I don&apos;t recommend it.</string>
<string name="51389">Watch yourself! I will not hesitate to challenge you!</string>
<string name="51390">To the fight! Give no quarter!</string>
<string name="51391">There is nothing for you here!</string>
<string name="51392">Back with you! </string>
<string name="51393">You are not worthy!</string>
<string name="51394">I need a healer most immediately. Come here...</string>
<string name="51395">Reinforcements to me! Lend me your aid!</string>
<string name="51396">I see them. There are enemies here.</string>
<string name="51397">This cause is lost! Withdraw!</string>
<string name="51398">Attack here! Come to me!</string>
<string name="51399">Watch over me, please. Guard well.</string>
<string name="51400">Hold this place. Do not move from here.</string>
<string name="51401">Mercy... I am almost gone.</string>
<string name="51402">A foul poison... I feel it.</string>
<string name="51403">My elegant spell... Ruined.</string>
<string name="51404">My attack... does nothing?</string>
<string name="51405">Fall in step as you should. Follow.</string>
<string name="51406">Here is something worth a second look.</string>
<string name="51407">Gather here. Rally at my location.</string>
<string name="51408">If you would, please move to the side.</string>
<string name="51409">This lock should be picked with care.</string>
<string name="51410">Search carefully in this place.</string>
<string name="51411">Into the shadows. Hide.</string>
<string name="51412">I will see that it is done.</string>
<string name="51413">I simply cannot do this.</string>
<string name="51414">The task is done and taken care of.</string>
<string name="51415">I shouldn&apos;t be carrying this much.</string>
<string name="51416">What is it that YOU want?</string>
<string name="51417">Well hello! </string>
<string name="51418">I would say yes.</string>
<string name="51419">No.</string>
<string name="51420">Stop.</string>
<string name="51421">I require rest. I am not at my best.</string>
<string name="51422">There is no such thing as &quot;fashionably idle.&quot; Get moving.</string>
<string name="51423">I bid you farewell.</string>
<string name="51424">I am most appreciative.</string>
<string name="51425">By all that&apos;s right!</string>
<string name="51426">Oh grand!</string>
<string name="51427">Here, come listen to what I have to say.</string>
<string name="51428">A fine idea, I would think.</string>
<string name="51429">I doubt that this idea will prove fruitful.</string>
<string name="51430">I assure you, I will act with deadly interest if you persist.</string>
<string name="51431">To the fight! Onward!</string>
<string name="51432">The good of all!</string>
<string name="51433">By the mother&apos;s wrath!</string>
<string name="51434">Here you meet your end!</string>
<string name="51435">I am wounded... Heal me here.</string>
<string name="51436">I am in trouble here! Help me if you can!</string>
<string name="51437">The enemy of the moment is in my sight.</string>
<string name="51438">It is time to concede! We are lost!</string>
<string name="51439">Here! Guide your attention to me!</string>
<string name="51440">Shield me from the enemy.</string>
<string name="51441">Hold this place. Let nothing uproot you.</string>
<string name="51442">I am gravely wounded...</string>
<string name="51443">There is a taint... I am poisoned.</string>
<string name="51444">My magic has failed.</string>
<string name="51445">By the very earth! I have had... no effect.</string>
<string name="51446">Here, follow me.</string>
<string name="51447">Come have a look here.</string>
<string name="51448">Form around me. Rally here.</string>
<string name="51449">Give us a little more space, will you?</string>
<string name="51450">This lock is perhaps better picked than battered.</string>
<string name="51451">Have a look around here....</string>
<string name="51452">To the underbrush, hide as best you can.</string>
<string name="51453">I will go do this.</string>
<string name="51454">I cannot do as was asked.</string>
<string name="51455">It is done, as it should be.</string>
<string name="51456">I carry too much. Walking is difficult...</string>
<string name="51457">Hello to you.</string>
<string name="51458">Warm winds and hello.</string>
<string name="51459">Yes indeed.</string>
<string name="51460">No, I would say not.</string>
<string name="51461">Stop.</string>
<string name="51462">Day and night are a cycle in balance. I need rest as well.</string>
<string name="51463">We add unnecessary length to our journey just lounging about.</string>
<string name="51464">Farewell then.</string>
<string name="51465">I am very grateful.</string>
<string name="51466">By all the... ugh!</string>
<string name="51467">Nature&apos;s blessing, this is good.</string>
<string name="51468">I have something that should be heard.</string>
<string name="51469">I think that is a fine idea.</string>
<string name="51470">That&apos;s a bad idea. Bad.</string>
<string name="51471">Press your actions and I will respond with all the fury of nature!</string>
<string name="51472">You have to fight! Come on!</string>
<string name="51473">I didn&apos;t want to do this but&#8230;</string>
<string name="51474">You won&apos;t win, you wont!</string>
<string name="51475">Oh, I think I&apos;m hurt&#8230; can I get some Healing?</string>
<string name="51476">I need some help with this!</string>
<string name="51477">I... I see our enemy. Over here.</string>
<string name="51478">Run! We have to get away!</string>
<string name="51479">You... You come fight me! Right here!</string>
<string name="51480">Protect me!  Guard me real good, okay?</string>
<string name="51481">Don&apos;t move from here, okay?</string>
<string name="51482">Oww... I&apos;m hurt real bad.</string>
<string name="51483">I&apos;m sick... I think it&apos;s poison...</string>
<string name="51484">Aww... My spell got messed up.</string>
<string name="51485">My attack... It didn&apos;t work?</string>
<string name="51486">You follow me, okay?</string>
<string name="51487">Look over here!</string>
<string name="51488">Everyone get together here!</string>
<string name="51489">Hey, move over, will you?</string>
<string name="51490">Somebody has to take a crack at this lock.</string>
<string name="51491">Search this place good, okay?</string>
<string name="51492">Oh boy, get hidden real fast!</string>
<string name="51493">Sure, I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="51494">Sorry, but I just can&apos;t.</string>
<string name="51495">I think I&apos;m done.</string>
<string name="51496">This is way too much. I can&apos;t take all this.</string>
<string name="51497">Hello there. Can I do something for you?</string>
<string name="51498">Well hello there.</string>
<string name="51499">Oh yes.</string>
<string name="51500">Uh, no.</string>
<string name="51501">Stop, okay?</string>
<string name="51502">I sure could use some sleep. Really tired.</string>
<string name="51503">May as well be sitting back home for all we do here.</string>
<string name="51504">Bye then.</string>
<string name="51505">Thanks for that!</string>
<string name="51506">Well buttons and barndoors!</string>
<string name="51507">(Laughter) Yay!</string>
<string name="51508">Um, I&apos;ve something to say here.</string>
<string name="51509">That&apos;s a good idea! Really!</string>
<string name="51510">Uh, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a good idea.</string>
<string name="51511">I&#8230; I won&apos;t take much more of you&#8230; Don&apos;t make me hurt you.</string>
<string name="51512">Attack! Kill them! Now!</string>
<string name="51513">Yaaaaa!!</string>
<string name="51514">Die die die die die!!</string>
<string name="51515">You won&apos;t have me, you won&apos;t have me!</string>
<string name="51516">I need healing! Do it! Now!</string>
<string name="51517">Help me here! Back me up!</string>
<string name="51518">I seeeee them. The enemy is heeeere.</string>
<string name="51519">Run run RUN! </string>
<string name="51520">Come on, fight me here! Come on!</string>
<string name="51521">Guard me. Don&apos;t let anything get near.</string>
<string name="51522">Hold it right here. Don&apos;t move from this spot.</string>
<string name="51523">Hurt... Hurt bad... Real bad...</string>
<string name="51524">Ughhh! It&apos;s in me... Poison...</string>
<string name="51525">My spell! For the love of.....</string>
<string name="51526">Nothing? I attack and... nothing?</string>
<string name="51527">Follow! Do it.</string>
<string name="51528">Look here. Something...</string>
<string name="51529">Come here! Rally here!</string>
<string name="51530">Move aside. Come on, let&apos;s go!</string>
<string name="51531">This lock should be picked, and quick.</string>
<string name="51532">Look carefully here. Search nice and slow.</string>
<string name="51533">Hide hide hide!</string>
<string name="51534">I can do that. I can.</string>
<string name="51535">Nope. Can&apos;t.</string>
<string name="51536">I&apos;m done with this.</string>
<string name="51537">I can&apos;t carry this much. It&apos;s too heavy.</string>
<string name="51538">What, what do you want?</string>
<string name="51539">Hello then. Hello.</string>
<string name="51540">Yes. Yes.</string>
<string name="51541">The answer is no.</string>
<string name="51542">Stop. Stop.</string>
<string name="51543">Rest... I need rest.</string>
<string name="51544">I have to get moving... Can&apos;t sit still.</string>
<string name="51545">Bye then.</string>
<string name="51546">Thanks. Thanks a lot.</string>
<string name="51547">Ohhh!</string>
<string name="51548">Yeah, all right!</string>
<string name="51549">Listen to me here. Listen.</string>
<string name="51550">That&apos;s... not a bad idea.</string>
<string name="51551">No, no, no, that idea&apos;s no good.</string>
<string name="51552">You don&apos;t want to get me mad, you don&apos;t want to get me mad!</string>
<string name="51553">To the fight, my friends! Attack!</string>
<string name="51554">Hahaha!</string>

<string name="53474">Could you stop being so stealthy all the time?</string>
<string name="53475">Could you use more stealth when we travel?</string>

<string name="53564">Really? You mean you have something more powerful than smokepowder?</string>
<string name="53565">What do you mean? What other gift did he give you?</string>
<string name="53566">I wouldn&apos;t mind knowing your thoughts on Aribeth&apos;s betrayal. How do you feel about it?</string>

<string name="53575">God not be mortal. What you be talking &apos;bout?</string>
<string name="53576">You&apos;re referring to the Time of Troubles, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="53577">Gods in mortal form? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="53578">Are you saying the people of Lantan never make poor decisions?</string>
<string name="53579">The law say Fenthick need be killed. The law is the law. We got to follow it no matter what.</string>
<string name="53580">Fenthick did stuff that made people get mad. That make people do stupid things.</string>
<string name="53581">By the letter of the law Fenthick&apos;s actions were deserving of execution. The law has to be obeyed.</string>
<string name="53582">Sometimes people let their emotions rule their actions, and we do foolish things.</string>
<string name="53583">Me want you keep talking &apos;bout story you start before.</string>
<string name="53584">If we be travel together, me want know more &apos;bout you.</string>
<string name="53585">I&apos;d like you to continue your story from before, Boddyknock.</string>
<string name="53586">You better not let you search get in way of work for me!</string>
<string name="53587">You not worry. We find stuff you need.</string>
<string name="53588">Me got weird seeds here. This be what you need?</string>
<string name="53589">Just don&apos;t let this get in the way of your other duties.</string>
<string name="53590">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll find the seeds you&apos;re looking for.</string>
<string name="53591">I have some strange seeds here. Are these what you&apos;re looking for?</string>
<string name="53592">What good that do me? Me not buy stuff with thanks and friendship!</string>
<string name="53593">You not need give me reward. You thanks be reward enough.</string>
<string name="53594">Great. That and a couple coppers will get me a mug of warm ale.</string>
<string name="53595">The reward you offer is greater than you know, Boddyknock.</string>
<string name="53596">This be between you and you daddy. Me not want get in the middle.</string>
<string name="53597">This is between you and your father. I don&apos;t think I want to get involved.</string>
<string name="53598">What you need me do?</string>
<string name="53599">What do you want me to do?</string>
<string name="53600">So why you not just buy him one?</string>
<string name="53601">So why don&apos;t you get him one of these prism blossoms?</string>
<string name="53602">What happened?</string>
<string name="53603">Me know what happen. You destroy him garden, right?</string>
<string name="53604">Let me guess. You destroyed his garden?</string>
<string name="53605">Sometimes gardens get weeds. That not you fault.</string>
<string name="53606">Gardens get weeds sometimes, Boddyknock - it&apos;s hardly your fault.</string>
<string name="53607">Rot weed? Me not heard of that before.</string>
<string name="53608">Rot weed? I&apos;ve never heard of it.</string>
<string name="53609">What did you do?</string>
<string name="53610">Me not think it that smart for you use magic just to clean you garden.</string>
<string name="53611">What happen? Did something bad happen?</string>
<string name="53612">That probably wasn&apos;t the smartest thing to do. Magic shouldn&apos;t be trifled with.</string>
<string name="53613">But something went wrong, didn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="53614">You make plant go boom. That be neat to see.</string>
<string name="53615">Exploding vegetation. I wish I could have been there.</string>
<string name="53616">Was you hurt?</string>
<string name="53617">Were you hurt?</string>
<string name="53618">You daddy ask you to watch him garden, and you burn down house? That funny story!</string>
<string name="53619">You not start fire on purpose. You daddy can&apos;t be mad just &apos;cause of accident.</string>
<string name="53620">You make three homes burn down and you wreck you daddy&apos;s garden? That awful!</string>
<string name="53621">You&apos;re supposed to look after a garden, and instead you torch three houses into ash? That&apos;s hilarious!</string>
<string name="53622">It was an accident, Boddyknock. You were only trying to help.</string>
<string name="53623">You burned down three homes and destroyed your father&apos;s garden? That&apos;s horrible!</string>
<string name="53624">Like what?</string>
<string name="53625">If we&apos;re going to be traveling together I&apos;d like to know a little more about you.</string>
<string name="53626">Did you family not like what you become?</string>
<string name="53627">Did your family disapprove of your career choice?</string>
<string name="53628">Why there not be so many magic type guys where you come from?</string>
<string name="53629">Why are sorcerers so uncommon in Lantan?</string>
<string name="53630">You father want you to be some gardener?</string>
<string name="53631">Me not blame you. Plants be real boring.</string>
<string name="53632">Was you father a druid?</string>
<string name="53633">Your father wanted you to become a gardener?</string>
<string name="53634">You father grow plants. Big deal. Me no care &apos;bout plants.</string>
<string name="53635">Blah, blah, blah - who cares? We&apos;re talking about a bunch of stupid plants!</string>
<string name="53636">Him sound like a great man.</string>
<string name="53637">He sounds like a great man.</string>
<string name="53638">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="53639">I don&apos;t blame you. Plants are boring.</string>
<string name="53640">You sound like tree-man druid.</string>
<string name="53641">You sound like a druid.</string>
<string name="53642">What was he - a druid?</string>
<string name="53643">Me want you continue you story from before. </string>
<string name="53644">Me wanna know you better. Me think that important. </string>
<string name="53645">I want you to continue your story from before.</string>
<string name="53646">You not let you search get in way of stuff you do for me!</string>
<string name="53647">If me find it me let you know.</string>
<string name="53648">Me got recipe for bread here. This be what you need?</string>
<string name="53649">This better not interfere with the work you&apos;re doing for me!</string>
<string name="53650">Don&apos;t worry, Boddyknock. We&apos;ll find that recipe for you.</string>
<string name="53651">I happen to have a recipe for leaven bread right here.</string>
<string name="53652">That&apos;s it? A cheap ring?</string>
<string name="53653">Thank you, Boddyknock.</string>
<string name="53654">Bread?</string>
<string name="53655">But you not find nobody for give you the recipe yet.</string>
<string name="53656">But you haven&apos;t found anyone to give you the recipe yet.</string>
<string name="53657">What you mean?</string>
<string name="53658">What do you mean by that?</string>
<string name="53659">Me bet you got in lots of trouble messin&apos; with that stuff, right?</string>
<string name="53660">That must be real tempting for a &apos;prentice like you.</string>
<string name="53661">You must have gotten into all kinds of trouble fiddling around with all those magical items.</string>
<string name="53662">But all that magic stuff lyin&apos; around must have tempt you sometimes.</string>
<string name="53663">But surely you were tempted by all that magic lying around.</string>
<string name="53664">That it? You just clean up?</string>
<string name="53665">That&apos;s it? You cleaned up?</string>
<string name="53666">Me not believe you had all that magic there and you not even try to use it! What kind of magic guy is you? Ain&apos;t you curious?</string>
<string name="53667">You had all that magic at your fingertips and you didn&apos;t even try to use any of it? What kind of sorcerer are you? Weren&apos;t you even curious?</string>
<string name="53668">Me guess that makes sense, now that you explain it.</string>
<string name="53669">Logic and reason is okay, but sometimes they be boring.</string>
<string name="53670">That not good attitude for adventurer.</string>
<string name="53671">I guess your actions make sense, now that you&apos;ve explained them.</string>
<string name="53672">Logic and reason are fine, but they can be mighty boring.</string>
<string name="53673">That&apos;s hardly an adventursome attitude.</string>
<string name="53674">What you mean by &apos;other things&apos;? There be some other reason you come to city?</string>
<string name="53675">Among other things? What do you mean - is there another reason you came to Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="53676">Okay, but you not let you problem get in way of you work for me!</string>
<string name="53677">It okay, gnome. You can tell me you secret and maybe me can help you.</string>
<string name="53678">Fine - just don&apos;t let it distract you from the job at hand!</string>
<string name="53679">You can tell me, Boddyknock. Maybe it&apos;s something I can help you with.</string>
<string name="53680">You must have found that quite a temptation.</string>
<string name="53681">If you&apos;re going to be my henchman, I&apos;d like to know more about you. </string>
<string name="53682">Me get lots gold if me help Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="53683">If me save Neverwinter then me be big hero.</string>
<string name="53684">Me see lots people die. Me not like it. Me want help them.</string>
<string name="53685">Aribeth has promised me gold and riches if I can help her in this.</string>
<string name="53686">I seek to forge a legend that will last for ever.</string>
<string name="53687">Your mentor?</string>
<string name="53688">Me surprised him take you in, since you be a gnome and him be a human.</string>
<string name="53689">Him take you in?</string>
<string name="53690">I&apos;m surprised he would have accepted a gnome for training.</string>
<string name="53691">And he took you in?</string>
<string name="53692">Why you not just kill lizard?</string>
<string name="53693">Me guess Prophyro not like guests.</string>
<string name="53694">What you do next?</string>
<string name="53695">You should have killed it!</string>
<string name="53696">I guess Prophyro didn&apos;t like guests.</string>
<string name="53697">What did you do then?</string>
<string name="53698">Illusion? How you figure that out?</string>
<string name="53699">An illusion? How did you figure that out?</string>
<string name="53700">You story boring. We gonna continue mission soon?</string>
<string name="53701">What it like being him apprentice?</string>
<string name="53702">Great story. Think we can continue with our mission now?</string>
<string name="53703">What was it like as his apprentice?</string>
<string name="53704">I have seen too much death and suffering from the plague to stand idly by.</string>
<string name="53705">IGNORE THIS STARTING CONDITION. THIS IS USED AS A TRASH FOR UNWANTED LINKS. DO NOT DELETE THESE LINKS. </string>
<string name="53706">All evidence seems to indicate you are a capable &lt;man/woman&gt; who isn&apos;t afraid of a little adventure and exploration.</string>
<string name="53707">Your looks are unsavory, but only a fool judges on appearances. I&apos;ll join up with you for 250 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="53708">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;re not the only one looking to hire me. It wouldn&apos;t be logical for me to cut my rate with demand exceeding supply. My offer stands at 250.</string>
<string name="53709">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I guess it&apos;s only logical that we should do a little bartering. What if we compromise at 225?</string>
<string name="53710">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; There is something to be said for new experiences. Okay, I agree to your terms. 200 gold it is.</string>
<string name="53711">I&apos;ll join up with you for 200 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="53712">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;re not the only one looking to hire me. It wouldn&apos;t be logical for me to cut my rate with demand exceeding supply. My offer stands at 200.</string>
<string name="53713">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You don&apos;t seem like a bad sort to work for, and I guess it&apos;s only logical that we should do a little bartering. What if we compromise at 175?</string>
<string name="53714">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; There is something to be said for new experiences. Okay, I agree to your terms. 150 gold it is.</string>
<string name="53715">And you have the bearing of a decent employer. I&apos;ll join up with you for 150 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="53716">To be completely accurate I&apos;m not your slave. We&apos;ve entered into a binding contractual agreement, is all.</string>
<string name="53717">Well, if you ever decide you need a good sorcerer by your side, you know where to find me.</string>
<string name="53718">If you can&apos;t afford a henchmen, why are you speaking with me? That doesn&apos;t make sense, does it? Come on back if you come up with the gold to hire me.</string>
<string name="53719">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;re not the only one looking to hire me. It wouldn&apos;t be logical for me to cut my rate with demand exceeding supply. My offer stands at 150.</string>
<string name="53720">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I guess it&apos;s only logical that we should do a little bartering. Besides, I&apos;ve got a good feeling about you. What if we compromise at 125?</string>
<string name="53721">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; There is something to be said for new experiences. Okay, I agree to your terms. 100 gold it is.</string>
<string name="53722">Every expedition needs a leader. Since you&apos;re paying it&apos;s only logical that you should be the one in charge.</string>
<string name="53723">I&apos;ll use my spells and skills to help you out as we go along as best I can. If you ever want me to change my tactics just speak to me to give me my new instructions.</string>
<string name="53724">Since we are both of gnome heritage, I&apos;m willing to join you for only 150 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="53725">Sorry, but I&apos;m working for someone else now. There is no point in conversing further.</string>
<string name="53726">You&apos;re back, so you must need something. The most logical assumption is that you want me to join up with you again. Correct?</string>
<string name="53727">Well, if you change your mind you know where to find me... unless someone else hires me, first.</string>
<string name="53728">Okay, then let&apos;s go. There&apos;s an entire world out there waiting for us to discover it.</string>
<string name="53729">No matter how many times it happens, I still find being brought back to life one of the strangest experiences I have ever... uh... experienced.</string>
<string name="53730">But no damage done. So, what do you say - time for me to join up with you again? </string>
<string name="53731">Well, if you change your mind you know where to find me... unless someone else hires me, first.</string>
<string name="53732">Okay, then let&apos;s go. There&apos;s an entire world there waiting for us to discover it!</string>
<string name="53733">You&apos;re back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Obviously there must be something you need. Dare I speculate and suggest you are seeking aid in recovering those Words of Power for Aarin Gend? </string>
<string name="53734">Greetings, good &lt;man/woman&gt;. Forgive me for being so bold, but you are the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="53735">My hypothesis was based upon your manner of dress and physical appearance combined with the descriptions of the bards singing the praises of Neverwinter&apos;s greatest hero.</string>
<string name="53736">Your deeds have earned you quite the reputation, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is only logical that you should expect strangers to recognize you now.</string>
<string name="53737">Now I see why they praise your deeds and not your modesty, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Though I suppose you have earned the right to brag.</string>
<string name="53738">Your modesty does not hold true with the facts, &lt;FirstName&gt;. By all accounts your deeds have gone far beyond what might be considered mere duty.</string>
<string name="53739">My name is Boddyknock Glinckle, a sorcerer from the island of Lantan. I must admit I am not surprised to see you here.</string>
<string name="53740">Given your previous record of service it was only logical to conclude that you would be among those recruited by Neverwinter&apos;s spymaster to aid his cause.</string>
<string name="53741">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you require the services of a talented sorcerer you know where to find me.</string>
<string name="53742">Aarin has hired on dozens of mercenaries to aid him in this cause. I came to Neverwinter to chronicle and study the Wailing Death and I have been following events quite closely ever since.</string>
<string name="53743">Being of a curious and analytical mind I have to admit the deepening mystery of the Wailing Death and who is ultimately behind it to be quite intriguing. </string>
<string name="53744">I believe that recovering the Words of Power will provide us with the answers we seek. That is why I agreed to help Aarin Gend in this quest.</string>
<string name="53745">I am an accomplished sorcerer but my skills can hardly measure up to a hero such as yourself. The risk for me to search for the Words on my own would be far too great.</string>
<string name="53746">But I am eager to look into this matter in greater detail. Perhaps I could accompany you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and put my formidable skills at your disposal.</string>
<string name="53747">I would be honored to join up with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Together we can find the Words of Power and hopefully solve the mystery of who was truly behind the Neverwinter plague.</string>
<string name="53748">I doubt I can help you there, &lt;FirstName&gt;. All I know of this area is limited to the accounts of Lantanese explorers detailing the hills to the north of Beorunna&apos;s well.</string>
<string name="53749">As you know the love of exploration and the thrill of discovery are traits shared by all the people of Lantan. Whenever one of our people visits a foreign land they make an account of all they experience.</string>
<string name="53750">These accounts are added to the Great Library of Lantan so that all our people can be enlightened. A few years ago a gnome named Herigo Wanderlust returned to my island with his account of this region.</string>
<string name="53751">The majority of his time was spent exploring the hills to the north of Beorunna&apos;s Well, secretly observing the habits and activities of the giants who make their home there.</string>
<string name="53752">Oh, yes. We have no giants on Lantan, so my people are fascinated by them. Herigo&apos;s research is the most detailed account we have had to date of these remarkable creatures.</string>
<string name="53753">The subjects he was studying - hill giants were the exact species, if I remember correctly - had actually chosen a king from among their numbers, and this king had united several bands of giants into a single powerful tribe. </string>
<string name="53754">They had even constructed a great steading to house the king, and from there they raided the lands to the south. Until Herigo&apos;s research we assumed hill giants to be incapable of such high level organization.</string>
<string name="53755">Most of Herigo&apos;s research was of a scientific nature - diet, mating habits, activity cycles, habitat and territory range. Academically compelling, but hardly useful in your mission, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="53756">I would love to see these giants before I leave the North, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though I know my own wants must be set aside until after the Words of Power are found.</string>
<string name="53757">Hello, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is I, Boddyknock Glinckle. It is good to see a friendly face in these unfamiliar surroundings.</string>
<string name="53758">I have given you no reason to insult me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I find your reaction... illogical.</string>
<string name="53759">I will not subject myself to such irrational behavior. If you find your reason returns, come speak with me again.</string>
<string name="53760">I have to admit I am not surprised to find you here at Beorunna&apos;s Well, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="53761">Given your previous record of service it was only logical to conclude that you would be among those recruited by Neverwinter&apos;s spymaster to aid his cause.</string>
<string name="53762">That is partly why I chose to come here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have found our previous experiences together to be very... enlightening.</string>
<string name="53763">Then I will bid you farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you require the services of a talented sorcerer you know where to find me.</string>
<string name="53764">I would be honored to join up with you once more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Together we can find the Words of Power and solve the mystery of who was truly behind the Neverwinter plague.</string>
<string name="53765">I doubt I can help you there, &lt;FirstName&gt;. All I know of this area is limited to the accounts of Lantanese explorers detailing the hills to the north of Beorunna&apos;s well.</string>
<string name="53766">As you know the love of exploration and the thrill of discovery are traits shared by all the people of Lantan. Whenever one of our people visits a foreign land they make an account of all they experience.</string>

<string name="53769">Oh, yes. We have no giants on Lantan, so my people are fascinated by them. Herigo&apos;s research is the most detailed account we have had to date of these remarkable creatures.</string>
<string name="53770">The subjects he was studying - hill giants were the exact species, if I remember correctly - had actually chosen a king from among their numbers, and this king had united several bands of giants into a single powerful tribe.</string>

<string name="53774">Well met, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is I, Boddyknock Glinckle from the island of Lantan. I trust you remember me from our last meeting. </string>
<string name="53775">When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would joining us.</string>
<string name="53776">Greetings, good &lt;man/woman&gt;. Forgive me for being so bold, but you are the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="53777">Ah, forgive me then. I will have to go back and reevaluate the data I was basing my assumption on.</string>
<string name="53778">My hypothesis was based upon your manner of dress and physical appearance combined with the descriptions I have heard from those praising the &lt;man/woman&gt; responsible for saving Neverwinter from the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="53779">Now I understand why they praise your abilities, and not your modesty.</string>
<string name="53780">Your modesty is admirable, but the facts cannot be denied. Others may have been involved, but everyone is in agreement that you played a particularly crucial role.</string>
<string name="53781">I am Boddyknock Glinckle, a gnome sorcerer from the island of Lantan. I must confess that I am not surprised to find you here, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="53782">When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would be among us.</string>
<string name="53783">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you find yourself requiring the services of a good sorcerer you can find me here... unless my services are contracted by someone else.</string>
<string name="53784">What an odd thing to say. I have already established the fact that we both work for Lady Aribeth. What possible reason could you have for bringing the matter up a second... oh, I see.</string>
<string name="53785">Forgive me. My nature is to be observant, yet I did not immediately notice your... condition. However, the facts of the situation are made more than clear by the unsightly drool dangling from your chin.</string>
<string name="53786">I was in Neverwinter to study the plague - its causes and effects - so that such a catastrophe might be prevented in the future.</string>
<string name="53787">You may have discovered a cure for the plague and flushed out those behind it, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but the process by which the Wailing Death was spawned has not yet been determined.</string>
<string name="53788">I am eager to solve that mystery, if only so such a horror can never be unleashed upon the world yet again. But that can only be accomplished if we first locate the cult.</string>
<string name="53789">I have heard people claiming the cult has a base in the plains to the south, others insist there is undeniable evidence of the cult in the forests to the east, still others swear the cult is hiding in the city of Luskan to the north.</string>
<string name="53790">Obviously such rumors and hearsay are of little value. I prefer to put my faith in hard, empirical evidence - evidence I can observe with my own two eyes. As yet, I have found no evidence I consider reliable. </string>
<string name="53791">I don&apos;t think you understand. Without the proper data to analyze my evaluation of the situation would result in a hypothesis with an unacceptable margin of error.</string>
<string name="53792">Naturally I have formed some preliminary theories, but if I were to venture any opinion on this matter it would be nothing more than a complete and utter guess.</string>
<string name="53793">A... a hunch? You are a strange &lt;man/woman&gt;, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I suppose if I were forced to make a... &lt;StartAction&gt;shudder&lt;/Start&gt;...guess I would say we should start our search in the Neverwinter Wood, to the south east of Port Llast.</string>
<string name="53794">Roots, herbs and other flora grow in abundance in the forest, many of which can be used to heal a variety of illnesses. It is only logical to assume such plants can also be used to bring sickness and death.</string>
<string name="53795">Plus the woods are shunned by most civilized people - they believe they are haunted - making it a perfect place for a secret hideout for a large group.</string>
<string name="53796">The Neverwinter Wood seems to be the only place that provided the seclusion and the materials that would have been necessary for the cult to bring about the Wailing Death. At least, that&apos;s my best guess.</string>
<string name="53797">I am an accomplished sorcerer, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I also have a realistic understanding of my own limitations. Surviving the wilds of this region alone would be a challenge that surpasses my capabilities.</string>
<string name="53798">Besides, Aribeth has hired us so that we may serve and assist others who are more suited for heroism and great deeds.</string>
<string name="53799">You are a well known hero, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If I were to accompany you I am certain my skills would be of some use.</string>
<string name="53800">Then I will be glad to join your cause, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is an honor to serve with a hero such as you.</string>
<string name="53801">I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me. Any time you wish to issue new orders you have only to speak to me again.</string>
<string name="53802">As I said, I had a preliminary hypothesis. However, I would not be at all surprised to find my theory about the Neverwinter Wood to be wrong.</string>
<string name="53803">Good to see you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though in actual fact I cannot say I am really surprised.</string>
<string name="53804">When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would be one of those recruited.</string>
<string name="53805">I am *not* stalking you, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I have a vested, scientific interest in investigating the Wailing Death and the events that transpired in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="53806">When we parted ways, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I meant to continue my explorations of the North. But then I heard Aribeth was recruiting mercenaries to join in the search for the cult behind the plague.</string>
<string name="53807">You may have discovered a cure for the plague and flushed out those behind it, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but the process by which the Wailing Death was spawned has not yet been determined.</string>
<string name="53808">Given my scientific interest in this plague, and my desire to ensure it is never again unleashed upon Faerun, it was only logical that I answer Aribeth&apos;s call for aid.</string>
<string name="53809">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you find yourself in need of a sorcerer you know where to find me... until someone else hires my services.</string>
<string name="53810">When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists.</string>
<string name="53811">Our instructions were simply to make ourselves available to whomever requires our assistance. So, in that spirit, is there anything I can do for you?</string>
<string name="53812">You are back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That would lead me to conclude that you require some assistance from me. How can I be of service to you?</string>
<string name="53813">My knowledge of the city is somewhat limited, as I have not been here very long. My arrival coincided precisely with the closing of the gates and quarantine of the city.</string>
<string name="53814">I came in the name of scientific curiosity, to catalog and study this newly discovered plague that had broken out in the North.</string>
<string name="53815">I concluded that the most logical place to begin my investigations of the Wailing Death was in the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="53816">Hello there, my good &lt;man/woman&gt;. You don&apos;t have the look of one of those Neverwinter soldiers about you, neither do you show any evidence of having contracted the plague.</string>
<string name="53817">But you have a certain bearing about you that distinguishes you from the ordinary citizen. Based on my observations I&apos;d venture the hypothesis that you are an adventurer, correct?</string>
<string name="53818">Then there&apos;s no logical reason to continue this conversation, is there? But if you find yourself in need of a good sorcerer come speak to me again.</string>
<string name="53819">I am Boddyknock Glinckle, a gnome sorcerer from the island of Lantan who has only recently arrived here in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="53820">I left my home some time ago to experience the broader world. It is not uncommon for the people of my island to undertake such a journey.</string>
<string name="53821">I was exploring the northern Sword Coast when I heard rumblings of a previously unknown plague breaking out in Neverwinter. In the name of scientific discovery I came to investigate and catalog the new illness.</string>
<string name="53822">Fortunately I arrived before the city was quarantined. I decided to begin my investigations of the Wailing Death in the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="53823">From the accounts I gathered, it was generally agreed that the Beggar&apos;s Nest was where the outbreak began. I thought the best way to learn about the plague was to trace it back to its source.</string>
<string name="53824">And when I learned the clerics were unable to combat the plague I thought that I could apply the scientific principles of Lantan to discover a more mundane cure.</string>
<string name="53825">Unfortunately I had to end my investigations into the Beggar&apos;s Nest mere days after they began. Far too short a time to conduct a proper study of the situation.</string>
<string name="53826">Your mission? And what mission would that be, exactly?</string>
<string name="53827">Yes, I suppose extracting a cure from certain reagents could be a possible method of countering the rapid spread of this epidemic.</string>
<string name="53828">Given my own scientific interest in the plague I would be glad to accompany you in your mission, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="53829">A confidential mission from Lady Aribeth? Given the circumstances it is not difficult for me to surmise that your mission is somehow connected to finding a cure for the plague.</string>
<string name="53830">It is difficult to conduct a serious scientific analysis when you are constantly beseiged by zombies. Much as I wanted to continue my research, I was not about to throw my life away to do it.</string>
<string name="53831">However, the zombie infestation struck me as more than mere coincidence. I suspect there may be more than a casual relationship between the animated corpses in the district and the outbreak of the plague itself.</string>
<string name="53832">While the zombies continue to wander the district I cannot test my theory, but I suspect information that could lead to a cure can be found within the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="53833">The Lantanese people do not disparage magic, though many do not understand it. However, in my land we rely on the arcane far less than the other peoples of Faerun.</string>
<string name="53834">We prefer to seek a scientific solution to a problem rather than a magical one. Often through observation and experimentation a problem can be solved without resorting to mage-craft.</string>
<string name="53835">Of course, sometimes a little touch of the arcane is a good thing. When the situation is appropriate I do not hesitate to use my powers, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I may be from Lantan, but I am first and foremost a sorcerer.</string>
<string name="53836">As a practitioner of arcane magic yourself you must surely have encountered the suspicion and fear with which most common folk regard our art. My homeland is not so different.</string>
<string name="53837">My homeland does have a reputation for producing marvelous machines and outlandish contraptions not otherwise known in Faerun.</string>
<string name="53838">We Lantanese are a people guided by the analytical principles of science: observation, reason and logic. But don&apos;t allow yourself to be misled by rumors and hearsay.</string>
<string name="53839">We aren&apos;t all kooky inventors as some would have you believe. I myself am a sorcerer, for example.</string>
<string name="53840">Is there something you need, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="53841">As you wish.</string>
<string name="53842">My skills have improved somewhat. Give me a few seconds to rest and I shall be ready to show you my new skills. </string>
<string name="53843">It&apos;s always good to have a plan, and it&apos;s even better to keep working at it until it&apos;s right. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="53844">How far away do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="53845">It wouldn&apos;t make sense to continue this partnership if you are unhappy. Are you sure you want me to leave?</string>
<string name="53846">Your actions are rather illogical. You say you want me to go, then you tell me to stay. Very strange.</string>
<string name="53847">I will stay by your side, however I hope your unpredictable and irrational behavior doesn&apos;t continue. </string>
<string name="53848">Then I guess the only logical thing for us to do is split up for now. But I&apos;ll remain here in case you decide you have need of me again.</string>
<string name="53849">It would be foolish to enter combat without having a well thought out plan of attack. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="53850">Very well, I will no longer attempt to open locked doors or chests.</string>
<string name="53851">Very well, I will open any locked door or chest that you fail to open.</string>
<string name="53852">Very well, I will no longer travel in stealth mode.</string>
<string name="53853">Very well, I will travel in stealth mode from now on.</string>
<string name="53854">Very well, I will search whenever we are moving.</string>
<string name="53855">Very well, I will no longer search while we are moving.</string>
<string name="53856">Of course. How soon would you like me to heal you?</string>
<string name="53857">I shall do as you have asked.</string>
<string name="53858"></string>
<string name="53859"></string>
<string name="53860"></string>
<string name="53861"></string>
<string name="53862">At what distance do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="53863">Very well, I shall stay a reasonably far distance away from you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="53864">Very well, I shall stay a medium distance away from you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="53865">Very well, I shall stay reasonably close to you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="53866">Was there anything else?</string>
<string name="53867">Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="53868">I am a staunch proponent of the free exchange of ideas, &lt;FirstName&gt;. What is it you wish to know?</string>
<string name="53869">Then we should get back to your mission.</string>
<string name="53870">I doubt I can help you there, &lt;FirstName&gt;. All I know of this area is limited to the accounts of Lantanese explorers detailing the hills to the north of Beorunna&apos;s well.</string>
<string name="53871">As you know the love of exploration and the thrill of discovery are traits shared by all the people of Lantan. Whenever one of our people visits a foreign land they make an account of all they experience.</string>
<string name="53872">These accounts are added to the Great Library of Lantan so that all our people can be enlightened. A few years ago a gnome named Herigo Wanderlust returned to my island with his account of this region.</string>
<string name="53873">The majority of his time was spent exploring the hills to the north of Beorunna&apos;s Well, secretly observing the habits and activities of the giants who make their home there.</string>
<string name="53874">Oh, yes. We have no giants on Lantan, so my people are fascinated by them. Herigo&apos;s research is the most detailed account we have had to date of these remarkable creatures.</string>
<string name="53875">The subjects he was studying - hill giants were the exact species, if I remember correctly - had actually chosen a king from among their numbers, and this king had united several bands of giants into a single powerful tribe.</string>
<string name="53876">They had even constructed a great steading to house the king, and from there they raided the lands to the south. Until Herigo&apos;s research we assumed hill giants to be incapable of such high level organization.</string>
<string name="53877">Most of Herigo&apos;s research was of a scientific nature - diet, mating habits, activity cycles, habitat and territory range. Academically compelling, but hardly useful in your mission, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="53878">I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t really tell you anything more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We should probably continue on with the search for the Words of Power in any case.</string>
<string name="53879">I have heard many rumors about where the cult might be hidden, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I have gathered no hard evidence yet to support my theories.</string>
<string name="53880">If I were to tell you my hypothesis now, in the absence of any empirical data, I fear it would be nothing but a complete and utter guess.</string>
<string name="53881">A... a hunch? I don&apos;t think you understand. Without the proper data to analyze my evaluation of the situation would result in a hypothesis with an unacceptable margin of error.</string>
<string name="53882">But I suppose I am in your service, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you demand a &lt;StartAction&gt;...shudder...&lt;/Start&gt; guess, then I would say we should start our search in the Neverwinter Wood to the south east of Port Llast.</string>
<string name="53883">Roots, herbs and other flora grow in abundance in the forest, many of which can be used to heal a variety of illnesses. It is only logical to assume such plants can also be used to bring sickness and death.</string>
<string name="53884">Plus the woods are shunned by most civilized people - they believe they are haunted - making it a perfect place for a secret hideout for a large group.</string>
<string name="53885">The Neverwinter Wood seems to be the only place that provided the seclusion and the materials that would have been necessary for the cult to bring about the Wailing Death. At least, that&apos;s my best guess.</string>
<string name="53886">Remember, &lt;FirstName&gt; - this theory is based entirely on speculation and can hardly be considered sound. The only way to test its veracity is to search the Neverwinter Wood for ourselves.</string>
<string name="53887">My knowledge of the city is quite limited, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My arrival virtually coincided with the quarantine of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="53888">As for the plague itself, I was hoping to discover a cure - or at least a way to prevent the plague from spreading. I have a theory of how this might be accomplished, if you are interested in hearing it.</string>
<string name="53889">With most plagues fatality rates are extremely high, but there always a few who defy the odds and survive even after contracting the illness. Something within these individuals resists the symptoms of the disease.</string>
<string name="53890">If we could isolate this characteristic of the surviving subjects we might be able to reproduce or transfer it to other organisms, conferring an immunity to the disease in question.</string>
<string name="53891">Unfortunately I have yet to locate a single individual who has contracted this particular plague and survived. However, I would like to continue my examinations of the Beggar&apos;s Nest before I admit this problem has no solution.</string>
<string name="53892">All the accounts I have gathered of the plague are in agreement that the outbreak of the Wailing Death began in the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="53893">Logically the best chance of locating a survivor is to trace this epidemic back to its source. I would not be surprised to discover a few survivors of the Wailing Death in the Beggar&apos;s Nest district.</string>
<string name="53894">Then we should continue with your mission.</string>
<string name="53895">Eager as I am to conduct my research into the plague, I am not so obsessed as to throw away my life. The Beggar&apos;s Nest is all but overrun with zombies!</string>
<string name="53896">Incidentally, the zombie infestation in the Beggar&apos;s Nest struck me as more than mere coincidence. I suspect the animated corpses might be somehow linked to the outbreak of the plague itself.</string>
<string name="53897">Of course I was unable to test this theory, as my chances of survival on my own in a district overrun with zombies were virtually negligible.</string>
<string name="53898">Perhaps I will speak more of this later, but now is not the time. We need to focus on our mission. We have to get those Words of Power back to Aarin Gend.</string>
<string name="53899">Do not fear, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As long as you seek the Words of Power I shall remain in your service.</string>
<string name="53900">In my time with you I have seen more wonders and experienced more fantastic adventures than all but a handful of my people. When I return home my accounts will enrich the knowledge of all Lantan.</string>
<string name="53901">I would be a fool to leave you now even if I thought I could find a dragon scale on my own.</string>
<string name="53902">Never fear, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I understand the importance of your mission, and I will not pu my own needs ahead of it. That would be illogical.</string>
<string name="53903">Nothing would please me more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Except for locating the Words of Power for Aarin Gend.</string>
<string name="53904">Yes - this is exactly what I was looking for. The priests of Gond will be amazed when I return with this wondrous material!</string>
<string name="53905">Yet again you have proven yourself to be the greatest of friends, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Here, take this ring. It was given to me by the clerics of the Wonderbringer before I left Lantan.</string>
<string name="53906">You have aided and guided me throughout my sojourn in the service of the Gond&apos;s church. The logical thing to do would be to give the church&apos;s ring to the &lt;man/woman&gt; who aided me on my mission.</string>
<string name="53907">The ring has powerful magical properties which you must not underestimate. Now that I have fulfilled my quest I have no further need of the ring.</string>
<string name="53908">Eventually I will return to Lantan and present the dragon scale to Gond&apos;s church, the prism blossom seeds to my father and the leaven bread to my master.</string>
<string name="53909">I suspect it will be a most joyful home coming - I will be hailed as a hero among my people. And it is all because of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="53910">After all you have done for me I can hardly leave you now, &lt;FirstName&gt;. No, the only rational course of action would be to stay with you until your own mission is done.</string>
<string name="53911">My return to Lantan will have to wait until we find the Words of Power and return them to Aarin Gend. As long as you search for the Words I will stay by your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="53912">I probably shouldn&apos;t tell you this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But you have proven yourself to me many times over, and I am certain not even Gond himself would begrudge me for asking your assistance in this matter.</string>
<string name="53913">I am about to reveal a secret known only to the people of Lantan and those within the church of Gond Wonderbringer. I am relying on you not to spread this secret around.</string>
<string name="53914">As you know, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I left Lantan on a journey of discovery. What you might not have known was that my journey is also a holy pilgrammage in the service of Gond Wonderbringer. I have been charged with a task.</string>
<string name="53915">I will not force you to aid me in this, &lt;FirstName&gt; - though I fear I will not succeed without your help. If you change your mind speak to me again. In the meantime, let us return to our mission.</string>
<string name="53916">Whenever one of my people embarks upon a sojourn to the mainland the clerics of Gond pray to the Wonderbringer for a vision of what new and previously unseen wonder the traveler is to seek out on his journey.</string>
<string name="53917">In my case the priests saw a terrible creature of enormous size and great power - a monster unknown in my homeland. Only after consulting the texts in the great library did the priests understand the vision was of a dragon.</string>
<string name="53918">Obviously bringing back an entire dragon would be an impossible request, and the clerics would have been foolish to burden me with such a ridiculous task.</string>
<string name="53919">Instead, they charged me to return with a dragon&apos;s scale. Through experimentation, study and magical divination we can learn much about these creatures from a single scale.</string>
<string name="53920">However, the scale must not have been tainted by spells or other unnatural forces such as magical weapons, or the experiments will be corrupted by the outside influence.</string>
<string name="53921">I realize the odds of defeating a dragon without spells or magical weapons are so minute as to be negligible. However,there may be another way to obtain the scale.</string>
<string name="53922">Dragons occasionally come into conflict with other creatures - giants and other dragons, primarily. In battling these foes surely a dragon must be wounded - perhaps even killed.</string>
<string name="53923">Logically we might expect to find a dragon scale that has been torn free or dislodged in one of these struggles. This is far more likely than killing a dragon ourselves without any magical aid whatsoever.</string>
<string name="53924">You seem quite interested in this subject, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I suppose we could spare a few minutes from our quest to speak about Gond&apos;s arrival on the shores of Lantan, if you wish.</string>
<string name="53925">Precisely. As I already mentioned, Gond Wonderbringer appeared on the shores of Lantan during the Time of Troubles. During those years Ao, the overfather of the Gods, decreed they must walk among us as mortals.</string>
<string name="53926">Gond Wonderbringer chose to take the form of a gnome - a logical choice, given the obvious advantages of my race. It was in this form that he washed up on the shores of Lantan.</string>
<string name="53927">As you can imagine people were skeptical of Gond&apos;s claim, but the Wonderbringer&apos;s clerics confirmed his identity.</string>
<string name="53928">During the Time of Troubles there was great strife among the suddenly mortal gods. Bane, Bhaal and Myrkul slew each other battling over the portfolio of death.</string>
<string name="53929">Waukeen, goddess of wealth and commerce, vanished and has never returned. But Gond chose not to become involved in the machinations and power struggles of the other deities.</string>
<string name="53930">He dwelt peacefully among the people of my island home, sharing his wisdom and knowledge with us. Perhaps the most well known gift he shared with us was the secret of making smokepowder.</string>
<string name="53931">Smokepowder is quite useful, if somewhat dangerous. Though it resembles nothing more than coarse black sand, when lit smokepowder will explode with a blast of surprising force.</string>
<string name="53932">Smokepowder is a remarkable tool with many uses, but it can be quite destructive in the wrong hands. This is why even among the Lantanese the secrets of smokepowder are known only to a precious few.</string>
<string name="53933">But even though smokepowder is Gond&apos;s most well known gift to my people, it was not the most important piece of knowledge he shared with us.</string>
<string name="53934">As I have already told you, we are a society of observers and thinkers. We have a tradition of isolating ourselves from the politics and events of Faerun. But Gond changed all that.</string>
<string name="53935">He warned us a time was coming when we must become involved in the affairs of the mainland. A time was coming in which we could not afford to remain dispassionate and neutral.</string>
<string name="53936">He would not say when this time was or what the circumstances would be of this momentus event. But when a god tells you to go forth into the rest of the world, you would be wise to listen. </string>
<string name="53937">Given the analytical nature of our society you could not expect we would suddenly integrate ourselves with the rest of Faerun without careful study and research of what we were about to undertake.</string>
<string name="53938">Suddenly the discoveries and accounts of those who had left our island on journeys of exploration became infinitly more important as a tool to teach us of the society and culture we knew we would soon be interacting with.</string>
<string name="53939">Now, by law, all who leave Lantan must first visit the clerics of Gond Woderbringer to obtain divine guidance before embarking on their journey.</string>
<string name="53940">Me? Uh... you know, the usual. Go with Gond, that kind of thing. Pretty much what you&apos;d expect.</string>
<string name="53941">The guidance I received from Gond&apos;s clerics is a personal and private thing, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And it has nothing to do with our work for Aarin Gend.</string>
<string name="53942">Aribeth&apos;s betrayal has caused me no amount of confusion, &lt;FirstName&gt;. On the one hand, her actions appear irrational and illogical - she has vowed to destroy the city she spent her life protecting.</string>
<string name="53943">But on the other hand, isn&apos;t it logical to assume a warrior will want to avenge the death of her lover? And what about Fenthick&apos;s death, which caused this whole mess?</string>
<string name="53944">His execution made no sense. He was not an enemy of the city and had he lived he would have done everything in his power to help Neverwinter to make up for what he had done.</string>
<string name="53945">What purpose is there in killing a man who is only going to be your ally in the future? Such irrational behavior is difficult for me to understand, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="53946">In Lantan we bow to the laws of reason and logic. Emotion can never be truly factored out of any decision, but we do our best to look at the facts with a dispassionate eye before taking action.</string>
<string name="53947">I suppose in that sense we are quite different from many of the other cultures of Faerun. We will have to familiarize ourselves with these strange lands if we hope to integrate Lantan into mainland society.</string>
<string name="53948">Lantan is an island, by geography we are isolated from the rest of the world. Over the centuries this has led to an insular culture - particularly among my people, the gnomes.</string>
<string name="53949">We consider ourselves safely removed from the troubles of the mainland. We have been fascinated observers of the history of Faerun, as befits our analytical mindset. But we chose not to be active participants in events.</string>
<string name="53950">Recently, however, our culture has embarked upon a radical journey of change, a revolutionary shift in our entire belief system. Soon, perhaps even in my own lifetime, Lantan will become an important part of life in the Realms.</string>
<string name="53951">We are thinkers, inventors and academics, &lt;FirstName&gt; - not soldiers. We plan to bring our culture and beliefs to Faerun through peaceful means - though we are proceeding in a rational and logical fashion.</string>
<string name="53952">Before we attempt to introduce ourselves into the existing order we must study and analyze the current political and cultural realities in an organized and thorough fashion. Could you expect anything less, given our nature?</string>
<string name="53953">As you can imagine a revolution of this magnitude must be precipitated by an astonishing event. Without a significant catalyst there cannot be a significant reaction. </string>
<string name="53954">In our case the catalyst is a single wondrous event - the day the god Gond Wonderbringer washed up on the shores of Lantan in mortal form.</string>
<string name="53955">You are right, &lt;FirstName&gt;; I am speaking of the Time of Troubles, when the gods were forced to take mortal form and walk among us.</string>
<string name="53956">You have not heard of the Time of Troubles, &lt;FirstName&gt;? The days when the gods were forced to take mortal form and walk among us?</string>
<string name="53957">I would share the tale with you, but the story of Gond Wonderbringer&apos;s time on Lantan is a long one, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="53958">Perhaps later I will be in a mood to speak more of my tale, but for now we should focus on your mission. The cult responsible for the Wailing Death must be found.</string>
<string name="53959">I will not abandon the search for the cultists behind the plague; I have pledged to aid you in destroying those who released the foul taint of the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="53960">But part of me is hoping that in our journeys we will be lucky enough to stumble across the crystalline seeds of the prism blossom.</string>
<string name="53961">Don&apos;t worry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As much as I want to reconcile with my father, I understand that our mission is far more important. It would be illogical for me to let my own quest interfere with yours.</string>
<string name="53962">You are a true friend, &lt;FirstName&gt;. With you by my side I&apos;m certain we will somehow find the seeds of the prism blossom... if they still exist.</string>
<string name="53963">Let me see... yes, these seeds do seem to be made of glass. And their shape and size are consistent with the accounts in the travel diary. You have done it, &lt;FirstName&gt;!</string>
<string name="53964">When I present these to my father he is certain to forgive me! Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt; - but I am afraid the only reward I have to give is my thanks.</string>
<string name="53965">Although I have no reward to repay you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, there may yet be some benefit to you for aiding me in this quest.</string>
<string name="53966">Lantanese artifiacts draw their energy from the thrill of discovery and the wonder of exploration. This remarkable discovery may have augmented the powers of the ring I gave you earlier.</string>
<string name="53967">In any case, I thank you once again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I will not leave your side yet. Only after we have located the cult behind the Wailing Death will I return to my homeland and present these seeds to my father.</string>
<string name="53968">The pain of what happened with my father, of how I destroyed the garden he had spent a lifetime cultivating, is a very personal pain, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="53969">But you have proved yourself to be a good friend - after all, it was you who helped me find the leaven bread. I suppose it is only logical to expect you might be able to help me with my father as well.</string>
<string name="53970">I suppose you are right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. This is a family matter, though I fear without your help I may never be able to heal the breach between my father and myself.</string>
<string name="53971">I will stay by your side as we continue to search for the cult behind the Wailing Death, though if you decide you are willing to help me in this I would ask you to speak to me again.</string>
<string name="53972">I know I can never replace the many varieties of plants and flowers that were once in my father&apos;s garden, but perhaps if I make a grand gesture he will find it in his heart to forgive me.</string>
<string name="53973">Throughout my father&apos;s life there has been one flower he has longed to see more than any other, but one which he has never been able to acquire.</string>
<string name="53974">Among the great library of Lantan there are accounts of the prism blossom; a living, growing flower whose petals are said change color and reflect light as they were made of crystal.</string>
<string name="53975">The account of the flower occurs in only one text - the travel diary of an explorer who died several centuries ago after returning from a journey to the North.</string>
<string name="53976">No one has ever been able to locate this rare flower or its gleaming crystal seeds, though many have spent a lifetime searching for it. </string>
<string name="53977">It may be the prism blossom is only a myth, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but if I could find the seeds of this flower and give them to my father, I am certain he would forgive me for destroying his garden.</string>
<string name="53978">This is difficult for me to speak of, &lt;FirstName&gt;. What happened between my father and I... our falling out... is a painful memory.</string>
<string name="53979">But maybe if I share the tale with someone else I can ease some of the pain and guilt I feel over what happened. That is a logical assumption, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="53980">My father&apos;s days of ground breaking research in agronomy are behind him, he is an old man content to putter in his own garden, happily living out his days among his friends and family.</string>
<string name="53981">But even so he still receives gifts of strange and exotic plants from distant lands so that he can add them to his garden.</string>
<string name="53982">It is said that in spring when the flowers bloom my father&apos;s yard is the most beautiful place on Lantan. It truly is his pride and joy.</string>
<string name="53983">I wish that had been the only consequences of my actions, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My father asked me to tend his garden for a few weeks while he went to visit a friend on the other side of the island.</string>
<string name="53984">Everything went well the first week. I found the work enjoyable enough, though hardly as stimulating as my sorcerer&apos;s studies. I even came up with a more efficient watering system he could use on his plants.</string>
<string name="53985">But in the second week I noticed the beginning of a rot weed infestation.</string>
<string name="53986">I do not blame myself for the rot weed, &lt;FirstName&gt; - only in how I handled the infestation.</string>
<string name="53987">Rot weed is a vile, noxious crawling vine with a foul, pungent odor. Unchecked it will overrun any garden in a matter of weeks, choking the life from every other plant.</string>
<string name="53988">Even worse, the roots release a powerful toxin into the earth, poisoning the soil so nothing else will grow on the land for years. And, like most unwanted garden guests, rot weed is virtually impossible to kill.</string>
<string name="53989">The only way to deal with rot weed is through fire applied directly to the vines. If you can make the fire hot enough, the flames will be absorbed into the plant and burn down to the root, killing the weed.</string>
<string name="53990">I still remember my father as a child using oil and torches to destroy a rot weed infestation - it was long and difficult work, for the vine is resistant to fire and it is difficult to make the flames hot enough to wither the roots.</string>
<string name="53991">However, I had no such worries as I went out to the garden that morning. The infestation had only just begun, and I had a secret weapon. After all, I was a sorcerer.</string>
<string name="53992">With visions of how pleased my father would be at the efficiency of my methods, I approached the weed and unleashed a burning hands spell directly at the vine.</string>
<string name="53993">I made the mistake of appoaching the problem without all the necessary data. My actions were logical in the context of my knowledge, but I was operating under a fatally flawed assumpton.</string>
<string name="53994">There was a reason my father used oil and torches to eliminate the infestation, rather than sending for the local mage. Magical fire destroys rot weed but the intense heat causes the plant to violently explode. </string>
<string name="53995">The vine burst, spewing out molten sap that ignited everything it touched. The roots ignited in the earth and columns of flame erupted from the soil, raining blazing bits of vegetation down all around me.</string>
<string name="53996">Miraculously I was unharmed by the conflagration, though the entire garden was soon ablaze. As was my father&apos;s house. And the houses of our neighbors on either side.</string>
<string name="53997">No one was injured, and for that at least I am grateful. But by the time the fire brigade doused the flames all three houses were ruined - and my father&apos;s prize winning garden was nothing but ash.</string>
<string name="53998">Your callous mockery of my pain is as cruel as it is unnecessary. I cannot understand the pleasure you take in the suffering of others.</string>
<string name="53999">I refuse to discuss this with you anymore, &lt;FirstName&gt; - not while you are in such a cruel and spiteful frame of mind! Let us just return to the mission at hand.</string>
<string name="54000">It may have been an accident, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but that does nothing to mitigate the cost of the terrible tragedy.</string>
<string name="54001">I am well aware of the terrible nature of my tragedy, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and what cost it had on my father.</string>
<string name="54002">My father is a wealthy man, so he did not begrudge me the compensation he had to pay to his neighbors or the cost of replacing his own home. But his garden was utterly destroyed, and for that he has never forgiven me.</string>
<string name="54003">Maybe... mabye someday I can make it up to him, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Some gesture to heal the pain I have caused him.</string>
<string name="54004">Please... I don&apos;t wish to discuss this any longer. The memory is too painful.</string>
<string name="54005">As you know, I come from Lantan - an island renowned for its inventions and scientific advances. From that you can rightly conclude that I myself am of an analytical and curious nature.</string>
<string name="54006">You also know I am a sorcerer, and from that you can no doubt draw further conclusions - though in all truth my chosen profession is rather uncommon among the Lantanese culture.</string>
<string name="54007">The mysteries of the arcane are not as eagerly sought out in my homeland as they are in other places. We have inventions to accomplish many of the things others rely on magic to perform.</string>
<string name="54008">In my homeland there is no shame attached to what I do. It is merely seen as unusual, though I will admit it is not the future my father envisioned for me.</string>
<string name="54009">I was his eldest son, and I suppose my father wanted me to follow in his own footsteps. But flowers, plants and gardens never held much interest for me.</string>
<string name="54010">Agronomy is a well respected field in Lantan, and my father was one of the finest horticulturalists on the island. His pioneering research in cross-pollination and grafting techniques was responsible for the creation of twenty-six unique species of plants.</string>
<string name="54011">Because of my father&apos;s work Lantan&apos;s agricultural yields increased, as did the island&apos;s supply of medicinal herbs. And the beauty and variety of our flowering species is unparalleled anywhere on the mainland.</string>
<string name="54012">I can see no logical reason for this hostility, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Neither can I see a reason why I should subject myself to it.</string>
<string name="54013">Given your present mood, I see no point in continuing this conversation right now.</string>
<string name="54014">A finer gnome could not be found the length and breadth of Faerun, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I suppose that is why I find the gulf that has grown between us so painful to accept.</string>
<string name="54015">My father and I had a... a falling out. Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, this is difficult for me to speak of. I... I am not sure I wish to discuss this with you right now. </string>
<string name="54016">Do not underestimate the value of agricultural research, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It may lack the excitement of adventuring, but the growing and tending of plants can be quite useful.</string>
<string name="54017">Druids worship nature, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But we in Lantan seek to control and direct nature; to extract that which is useful and remove that which is harmful.</string>
<string name="54018">Ask me about this again later, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I will be happy to continue my tale. But for now we should focus on your mission for Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="54019">I believe the discovery of the leaven bread recipe could have far reaching benefits, and I would like to someday be able to bring a copy back to my home of Lantan. </string>
<string name="54020">But I know your mission is more important, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will not let my scientific curiosity get in the way of your work.</string>
<string name="54021">Never fear, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My work with you will take precedence over my search for the leaven bread recipe.</string>
<string name="54022">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But for now we must return to the task at hand. Aribeth is counting on you. </string>
<string name="54023">You do? This... this is wonderful! Yes, this is exactly what I need!</string>
<string name="54024">I have no gold or treasure to reward you, but there is one thing I can offer. A small token, perhaps, but it is all I have.</string>
<string name="54025">Before I left Lantan I was given this ring by my master, Prophyro. He said it embodies the essence of discovery and the quest for knowledge.</string>
<string name="54026">Because you have helped me in discovering the miracle of this leaven bread, I feel you have earned your right to wear this ring.</string>
<string name="54027">There is power in this ring, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="54028">The ring comes from the island of Lantan, island of discovery and invention. It has the power to grant insight to its wearer.</string>
<string name="54029">I regret there is nothing else I can give you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but once more I thank you for what you have done.</string>
<string name="54030">But we should return our attention to greater matters now and resume your mission. Aribeth is counting on you.</string>
<string name="54031">I told you earlier I came to Neverwinter to study the Wailing Death, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But there was another reason I came, as well. Given all that has happened, it seems rather unimportant now.</string>
<string name="54032">But you did ask me, so I must conclude you are interested in my motivations. I have come to Neverwinter in search of bread.</string>
<string name="54033">I know how foolish this sounds, but I had heard tales of a special type of bread found only here in Neverwinter - leaven bread, they call it.</string>
<string name="54034">It is said the loaf stays fresh for months and that it will never go stale or moldy. I was hoping that when I came to Neverwinter I could find someone to teach me the secret of making this wondrous leaven bread.</string>
<string name="54035">If we could determine the agents that keep the bread from spoiling I think the principles could be applied to any number of other uses! With a little research this discovery could mean so much more than simple bread.</string>
<string name="54036">I looked for some time when I first arrived in the city but it seems the secret is known only to a few master bakers, and unfortunately they have all been claimed by the plague.</string>
<string name="54037">I suppose someone still has a copy of the recipe somewhere, but the more I witnessed the death and suffering in this place the less important discovering the leaven bread became.</string>
<string name="54038">You seem quite interested in my time as an apprentice under Prophyro, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I suppose we can afford a few minutes for me to recount those days for you.</string>
<string name="54039">Prophyro instilled in me the basic principles of magic and the underlying laws governing the arcane. His knowledge and wisdom were an inspiration to me, though his organizational skills were somewhat lacking.</string>
<string name="54040">I would constantly stumble across magic items carelessly strewn about the tower. Potions and elixirs from half finished experiments would be left sitting out on the kitchen table.</string>
<string name="54041">Ancient scrolls he had been copying would be stuffed under the cusions of his chairs, wands would turn up in closets and drawers.</string>
<string name="54042">And he never, ever locked his laboratory despite the countless powerful magic items and dangerous experiments he often dabbled in.</string>
<string name="54043">What? You don&apos;t think I was foolish enough to begin tampering with things beyond the scope of my understanding, do you?</string>
<string name="54044">I came to Prophyro so he could teach me. It wouldn&apos;t be logical for me to begin experimenting on my own. What would have been the point of studying under him if I was going to do that?</string>
<string name="54045">I admit, seeing all those potions and wands and scrolls just lying around was difficult. And I must confess that eventually I did give in to the temptation.</string>
<string name="54046">I just snapped. I couldn&apos;t take it anymore, and I did something rash and completely out of character. I waited until my Master left on an extended trip and then I... I cleaned up Prophyro&apos;s laboratory!</string>
<string name="54047">I organized the scrolls and potions and wands. I built shelves to store the magical components of his research and I made a catalog card system so he could cross reference all of his tests and results.</string>
<string name="54048">Items that were particularly powerful or unstable I locked safely away in a magically reinforced chest with a key that I presented to Prophyro on his return.</string>
<string name="54049">What can I say, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I was young and foolish. Prophyro&apos;s own reaction was similar to yours - he couldn&apos;t believe what I had done, although he did continue to use the filing system I had set up for him.</string>
<string name="54050">Of course I was curious, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but my hunger for experimentation was tempered by reason. Imagine the damage I could have done if I had dared experiment on my own.</string>
<string name="54051">I was an apprentice, so the sensible course of action was for me to follow the lead of my master. Any other course of action would have been... illogical.</string>
<string name="54052">I admit my actions may seem overly... cautious. But that is the way of my people. Curiosity is tempered with careful analysis.</string>
<string name="54053">However, ever since I left Lantan I find I am growing more bold in my quest for discovery. After all, I did come to a plague infested city in order to chronicle a new disease... among other things.</string>
<string name="54054">I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I should not have said anything about this to you. It is really a trivial matter and you have far more important things on your mind.</string>
<string name="54055">You don&apos;t have to worry about that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m anxious to find the source of this foul plague, and I won&apos;t let my other interests get in the way.</string>
<string name="54056">You are a sorcerer just as I am, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Logically I would assume our experiences in our early training were quite similar.</string>
<string name="54057">Your request is completely logical, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I will be happy to answer your inquiries. However, as you might expect I have some questions of my own.</string>
<string name="54058">Why are you here, &lt;FirstName&gt;? What events are the underlying basis of your service to Aribeth and the city of Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="54059">I should have guessed, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The allure of gold is a common connection among many who undertake missions such as yours. My own motivations in coming here were somewhat different.</string>
<string name="54060">I should have guessed, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The allure of fame is a common connection among many who undertake missions such as yours. My own motivations were somewhat different.</string>
<string name="54061">When I heard about the plague I was flush with the thrill of scientific discovery. I thought that if I applied the principles of observation and experimentation I could discover a cure for the plague.</string>
<string name="54062">It was only after I arrived that I realized how wrong my preconceived notions were. I suppose the need to learn this lesson was one of the reasons my mentor insisted on sending me out from Lantan.</string>
<string name="54063">I am a sorcerer, I have the ability to unleash powerful and dangerous forces. I would have been foolish to undertake this career path without seeking the guidance of one more experienced than I.</string>
<string name="54064">However, sorcerers and wizards are not common in Lantan. We prefer to find a scientific solution to problems whenever possible, rather than relying on magic.</string>
<string name="54065">At last I managed to locate another who could train me in the arcane arts - a human sorcerer named Prophyro who lived in a secluded tower on the far side of the island.</string>
<string name="54066">I admit that when I first arrived at Prophyro&apos;s tower I did not receive a warm welcome. Or rather to be more accurate, I should say I received an overly warm welcome.</string>
<string name="54067">Just as I reached Prophyro&apos;s tower a large lizard popped out from behind a nearby bush. It was somewhat alarming. However, when the creature opened its jaws and belched forth a jet of flame I became absolutely terrified.</string>
<string name="54068">I fled back the way I had come, the fire drake&apos;s blasts of flame licking at my heels the entire way. As soon as I passed beyond the boundaries of Prophyro&apos;s land, the creature turned and disappeared back into the bushes.</string>
<string name="54069">Easier said than done, I&apos;m afraid. I am not skilled with weapons and at the time my magic was of such low level as to be virtually useless. Plus, killing the pet of the man I wanted to study under was hardly a good first impression.</string>
<string name="54070">Once I had regained my wits, I realized the fire drake served a dual purpose: it was a guardian for Prophyro&apos;s estate, but it also provided a challenge for any would-be apprentices who might wish to approach him.</string>
<string name="54071">If I could find a way to best the creature I was certain Prophyro would see my potential and accept me as an apprentice. The problem was how to get past the creature when my magic was barely capable of igniting a candle.</string>
<string name="54072">I had to rely on my mind to solve the problem, so I began to analyze the facts as I knew them. And I realized the creature was nothing more than an illusion.</string>
<string name="54073">I simply looked at the evidence. Fire drakes are not indigenous to my island and the climate is hardly suitable for one to survive. Plus, I had noticed no burnt patches of grass or scorched bushes on the grounds. </string>
<string name="54074">And the flames I felt licking at my heels had done no damage to my shoes and clothing. Armed with undeniable proof of the illusion I marched up to the tower once again.</string>
<string name="54075">When the lizard appeared I simply ignored it. It charged straight at me, fire and smoke spewing from its jaws. But I held my ground and a split second before the beast bowled me over it disappeared in a shower of light.</string>
<string name="54076">The door to the tower swung open. I stepped in to see an old man in robes. He smiled at me and said, &quot;Well done, Boddyknock Glinckle. You have proven yourself worthy of being my student. I am Prophyro.&quot;</string>
<string name="54077">You are right, of course. My tale can wait, we have more pressing matters to attend to right now.</string>
<string name="54078">I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but this isn&apos;t the most reasonable time to discuss this, is it? After all, Neverwinter is in great peril.</string>
<string name="54079">Compassion is an admirable trait, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though I must confess my own motivations when I came here were quite different.</string>

<string name="54380">Them other dwarves not want you around, do they?</string>
<string name="54381">You said them others shun you. What happen?</string>
<string name="54382">Did they reject you because you were part of the Long Death Order?</string>
<string name="54383">Did them send you away &apos;cause you be part of Long Death Order?</string>
<string name="54384">Can&apos;t say I&apos;ve had the pleasure.</string>
<string name="54385">That&apos;s horrible!</string>
<string name="54386">I&apos;ve seen my share of killing, if that&apos;s what you mean.</string>
<string name="54387">That be horrible!</string>
<string name="54388">Me not ever had that pleasure.</string>
<string name="54389">Me seen lots of killing, if that what you mean.</string>
<string name="54390">No kidding - you&apos;re a freak, Grimgnaw!</string>
<string name="54391">They were weak, Grimgnaw. They couldn&apos;t dare to face death like you.</string>
<string name="54392">You be big weirdo freak, dwarf!</string>
<string name="54393">Them just weak. Them scared of death. They not strong like you, Grimgnaw.</string>
<string name="54394">What do you mean by that?</string>
<string name="54395">What you mean?</string>
<string name="54396">You can tell me, Grimgnaw. Maybe it&apos;s something I can help you with.</string>
<string name="54397">Fine - just don&apos;t let it distract you from the job at hand!</string>
<string name="54398">It okay, dwarf. You can tell me you secret and maybe me can help you.</string>
<string name="54399">Okay, but you not let you problem get in way of you work for me!</string>
<string name="54400">You follow here here?</string>
<string name="54401">Proof? What kind of proof?</string>
<string name="54402">Me not gonna just stand by and watch you kill innocent woman!</string>
<string name="54403">I&apos;m not going to just stand by and watch you kill an innocent woman!</string>
<string name="54404">This isn&apos;t right. I must part ways with you now, Grimgnaw.</string>
<string name="54405">Actually, I don&apos;t have a problem with killing this woman.</string>
<string name="54406">This not be right. Me not want stay with you no more.</string>
<string name="54407">It okay. You stay. Me not care if you kill girly.</string>
<string name="54408">Tell me about Charwood.</string>
<string name="54409">You tell &apos;bout Charwood.</string>
<string name="54410">Have you ever been to Charwood?</string>
<string name="54411">You ever be to Charwood?</string>
<string name="54412">Is your Order evil, Grimgnaw?</string>
<string name="54413">Is you Order be evil, dwarf?</string>
<string name="54414">You worship death - it&apos;s no wonder you have enemies!</string>
<string name="54415">You be death cult! It no wonder you have enemies!</string>
<string name="54416">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="54417">What you mean?</string>
<string name="54418">You&apos;re a sick man, Grimgnaw.</string>
<string name="54419">You one sick man, dwarf.</string>
<string name="54420">I don&apos;t think I want to get involved with this.</string>
<string name="54421">Me not want get mixed up in this.</string>
<string name="54422">How do we get to the Dragon Mountains?</string>
<string name="54423">How we get at Dragon Mountain?</string>
<string name="54424">You used for live &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="54425">You used to live in this region?</string>
<string name="54426">That&apos;s a horrible thing to say!</string>
<string name="54427">You&apos;re a bloodthirsty freak, Grimgnaw. I like it!</string>
<string name="54428">That bad thing to say!</string>
<string name="54429">You sicko freak, dwarf! Me like it!</string>
<string name="54430">I could never believe these things to be beautiful, Grimgnaw. You&apos;re an evil, evil man!</string>
<string name="54431">Me not ever think this stuff be beautiful, Grimgnaw. You be sick little man!</string>
<string name="54432">I kill when I have to, Grimgnaw, but I doubt I&apos;ll ever see anything beautiful in it.</string>
<string name="54433">Me kill when me have to. Me not ever see nothing beautiful in it.</string>
<string name="54434">Death, killing, pain, torture - I already love those things, Grimgnaw. Maybe I could join your Order?</string>
<string name="54435">Me already like killing and torture and stuff. Maybe me could join you Order?</string>
<string name="54436">I&apos;d never want to hear about that stuff anyway!</string>
<string name="54437">Me not never want hear &apos;bout tha anyway!</string>
<string name="54438">So enlighten me. Tell me about your Order&apos;s rituals.</string>
<string name="54439">You teach me. Tell me &apos;bout you rituals and stuff.</string>
<string name="54440">What kind of monster are you, Grimgnaw? You deserve death!</string>
<string name="54441">You be monster, Grimgnaw! You deserve death!</string>
<string name="54442">Fine. Go on.</string>
<string name="54443">But me thought you already be member of you Order!</string>
<string name="54444">What task?</string>
<string name="54445">Sounds simple.</string>
<string name="54446">Why would they bless a weapon just so someone else can use it to kill them?</string>
<string name="54447">Why them bless weapon just so some guy can use it for kill them?</string>
<string name="54448">So you want me to find this weapon for you?</string>
<string name="54449">You want me for find weapon for you?</string>
<string name="54450">So wouldn&apos;t my help be a violation of your Order&apos;s beliefs?</string>
<string name="54451">But if me help you that not be against the rules?</string>
<string name="54452">How will I recognize one of these blessed weapons?</string>
<string name="54453">How me know when me find blessed weapon?</string>
<string name="54454">Yet there are many whom death will follow in this city - many who are willing to pay for my services. My fee to join your cause is 150 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="54455">Is there something you need?</string>
<string name="54456">I will obey your every command, for your decisions herald the spread of death and bloodshed.</string>
<string name="54457">At what distance do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="54458"></string>
<string name="54459">Of course. How soon would you like me to heal you?</string>
<string name="54460">Together we can sow death and destruction throughout the North. Why would you break up our partnership and deny the Silent Lord his due?</string>
<string name="54461">Should you decide you need an ally in your cause, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I will gladly join you. Death surrounds you and I am eager to join in the slaughter you will surely unleash.</string>
<string name="54462">I know you. You were at the Academy during the slaughter of the students. You were there when the assassins came.</string>
<string name="54463">I foresee a future of brutal and savage slaughter at your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My Order will be pleased.</string>
<string name="54464">Yet there are many whom death will follow in this city - many who are willing to pay for my services. My fee to join your cause is 200 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="54465">Yet there are many whom death will follow in this city - many who are willing to pay for my services. My fee to join your cause is 250 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="54466">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I foresee a future of brutal, savage slaughter at your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Very well, I will join you for 100.</string>
<string name="54467">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; There are many who would pay me more to join them, but your offer of unbridled bloodshed is tempting. What if we compromise at 125?</string>
<string name="54468">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; There are many who can offer me the chance to revel in the joys of killing and death - and they will pay far more for my services. My offer stands at 150.</string>
<string name="54469">I am a slave to only one master; the Silent Lord. I serve you only as long as you remain an agent of Death.</string>
<string name="54470">My hands will deal death to your enemies, and all my skills are yours to command. Whenever you wish me to change my tactics you have only to speak to me.</string>
<string name="54471">Yet there are many whom death will follow in this city - many who are willing to pay for my services. But you are a fellow dwarf, so I&apos;m willing to join you for only 150 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="54472">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I foresee a future of brutal, savage slaughter at your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Very well, I will join you for 150.</string>
<string name="54473">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I foresee a future of brutal, savage slaughter at your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Very well, I will join you for 200.</string>
<string name="54474">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; There are many who would pay me more to join them, but your offer of unbridled bloodshed is tempting. What if we compromise at 175?</string>
<string name="54475">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; There are many who would pay me more to join them, but your offer of unbridled bloodshed is tempting. What if we compromise at 225?</string>
<string name="54476">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; There are many who can offer me the chance to revel in the joys of killing and death - and they will pay far more for my services. My offer stands at 200.</string>

<string name="54478">As you wish.</string>
<string name="54479">We part now, but you are destined to swim in an ocean of blood. Our fates are intertwined, and I shall wait here for your inevitable return so we may once more join together to perform the will of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54480">I will obey your every command, for your decisions herald the spread of death and bloodshed.</string>
<string name="54481">How far away do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="54482">Very well, I shall stay reasonably close to you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="54483">Very well, I shall stay a medium distance away from you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="54484">Very well, I shall stay a reasonably far distance away from you whenever possible.</string>
<string name="54485">Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="54486">Was there anything else?</string>
<string name="54487"></string>
<string name="54488"></string>
<string name="54489"></string>
<string name="54490">I shall do as you have asked.</string>
<string name="54491">Very well, I will no longer search while we are moving.</string>
<string name="54492">Very well, I will search whenever we are moving.</string>
<string name="54493">Very well, I will travel in stealth mode from now on.</string>
<string name="54494">Very well, I will no longer travel in stealth mode.</string>
<string name="54495">Very well, I will open any locked door or chest that you fail to open.</string>
<string name="54496">Very well, I will no longer attempt to open locked doors or chests.</string>
<string name="54497">Then I am afraid we cannot work together, though I have no doubt you will be an instrument of destruction and an agent of Death even without me at your side.</string>
<string name="54498">You are back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The blood from those slaughtered at the Academy may be washed away, but I still recognize the mark of Death upon you.</string>
<string name="54499">I know you. You are &lt;FullName&gt;, the one who emerged from the corpse clogged streets of Neverwinter to save the city from the horrors of the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="54500">We meet again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is I, Grimgnaw of the Order of the Long Death. Surely you must remember me.</string>
<string name="54501">We meet again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I taste a storm of slaughter on the air; I&apos;m not surprised to find you here at the center of the whirlwind.</string>
<string name="54502">I know you, &lt;FullName&gt;. I know of your deeds. I know how many thousands of people hail you as a hero - and I know how many more have died screaming at your feet.</string>
<string name="54503">The fires of war are burning on horizon, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Why am I not surprised to see you here to forge your blood drenched legacy in the furnace of slaughter?</string>
<string name="54504">You have returned, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Are you looking to join with a servant of the Long Death? </string>
<string name="54505">I have been waiting for you - I suspected you would return. Do you need me to join with you once more?</string>
<string name="54506">I serve another master now. I have nothing more to say to you.</string>
<string name="54507">To be torn from the embrace of the Silent Lord is... unsettling. Yet my time to bow down before him for all eternity is not yet here. Do you need me to join you once more, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="54508">A storm of blood swirls around you, anguish and death will follow in your wake... just as it did at the Academy.</string>
<string name="54509">IGNORE THIS STARTING CONDITION. THIS IS USED AS A TRASH FOR UNWANTED LINKS. DO NOT DELETE THESE LINKS. </string>
<string name="54510">You are welcome to return should you have need of my skills, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If not, we shall meet again at our final end, when the Silent Lord claims us all.</string>
<string name="54511">Tell me - as you stood amidst the blood-soaked corpses of your fellow students, did you gaze upon the face of Death? Did you look into His cold eyes and feel His icy touch upon your soul?</string>
<string name="54512">So far I have uncovered no answers on my own that might help end this epidemic, though I am eager to search the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="54513">The monks of the Long Death rarely join with those outside our order, but I sense the mark of my master is upon you.</string>
<string name="54514">I have heard rumors that in that blighted district zombies walk the streets. Few things are so reviled by my order as the abomination of the undead. </string>
<string name="54515">Alone I am not likely to survive the dangers of the district, and throwing my life away is a foolish way to serve the Silent Lord. My death will come in its appointed time.</string>
<string name="54516">So far I have uncovered no answers on my own that might help end this epidemic, though I am eager to search the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="54517">Others may have been involved, but I know the truth of things. I see the mark of the Silent Lord upon you.</string>
<string name="54518">I have known about you ever since the massacre at the Academy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. A beautiful maelstrom of brutal slaughter swirls around you.</string>
<string name="54519">Yes, we have already established that you work for Aribeth. Perhaps you could wipe the drool from your chin. It truly is repulsive.</string>
<string name="54520">Return to me if you require an ally in your mission. Together we can help sow the seeds of destruction throughout the land and reap a harvest of agony and death.</string>
<string name="54521">I am eager to punish those who unleashed the Wailing Death upon Neverwinter. Thousands were taken by the disease, their essence stolen from the grasp of true Death.</string>
<string name="54522">That was why I answered Lord Nasher&apos;s desperate call for mercenaries to come to Port Llast. He is also anxious to root out those behind the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="54523">Running helter skelter on my own would do little to locate the cult, and even less to further the cause of Death, whom I serve.</string>
<string name="54524">Your reputation is well known, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have heard many tales of the slaughter you rain down upon those who dare oppose you.</string>
<string name="54525">The mark of Death is upon you. If we join together we shall unleash a storm of devastation to ravage the North and feed the eternal hunger of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54526">Their location is well hidden. However, I would not be surprised to learn they are connected with the village of Charwood.</string>
<string name="54527">The town has isolated themselves from the rest of the world, far to the South of Port Llast. Few outside my Order even remember such a place exists.</string>
<string name="54528">It would not surprisie me to discover links to the cult behind the Wailing Death in that unnatural place.</string>
<string name="54529">Of course I will bow to your lead, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are the herald of the Silent Lord, a ravager of destruction; pain and death follow in your wake.</string>
<string name="54530">I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me. Any time you wish to issue new orders you have only to speak to me again.</string>
<string name="54531">My skills have improved somewhat. Give me a few seconds to rest and I shall be ready to show you my new skills. </string>
<string name="54532">Conversation is one way to pass the time until the Silent Lord comes to claim us. What do you wish to speak about.</string>
<string name="54533">Then we should continue with your mission. The Silent Lord is hungry for us to deliver more souls to His gaping maw.</string>
<string name="54534">I would ask, &lt;FirstName&gt;, that you tell me about yourself first. I am eager to know what type of &lt;man/woman&gt; I have allied myself with.</string>
<string name="54535">Why do you serve this plague ravaged city? What possesses you to venture out into the streets amidst the bloated, swollen corpses and the burning funeral pyres?</string>
<string name="54536">What the plague brings upon the people of this city cannot truly be called death; there is no final release for the victims of this illness into the waiting grasp of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54537">The name of a hero lives on long after the hero has passed from this world. But do not fool yourself, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your legend may live forever, but you will not.</string>
<string name="54538">Material wealth has its uses, but your gold and gems will mean nothing when the Silent Lord comes to claim you.</string>
<string name="54539">True Death - the ultimate end of existence - is the one perfect absolute in a flawed world of uncertainty. The Order of the Long Death understands this.</string>
<string name="54540">We bring pain, torment and anguish to the denizens of this world to prepare them for the release of death. We spread devastation; we seek to tear down, to obliterate and to destroy.</string>
<string name="54541">My Order does not bow before any god; we worship Death itself, in all its incarnations. Gods are transient - even a god may die: Bhaal, Bane, Cyric.</string>
<string name="54542">We all serve Death in one way or another, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It was only after I left Mithral Hall to join the Order that I truly came to understand this.</string>
<string name="54543">Very well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have been reluctant to speak of my time at Mithral Hall, but you will not let the matter rest.</string>
<string name="54544">I told you earlier this was a matter for those of my Order, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But you have proven yourself to be an agent of the Silent Lord - death follows you wherever you go.</string>
<string name="54545">I will not rest until I find the ring that proves Alaganda has been taken by the Silent Lord, though I know my chances of success are... few.</string>
<string name="54546">This is not the time to speak of this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Let us return to our mission - the Silent Lord&apos;s hunger will not be sated by mere words.</string>
<string name="54547">I am a monk of the Order of the Long Death, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am defined by the customs, tenets and beliefs of my Order. Simply put, I worship Death.</string>
<string name="54548">We worship the very essence of Silent Lord, and we honor the tools that prepare us all for our inevitable, inescapable end: pain, suffering, torment, agony.</string>
<string name="54549">Our embrace of the Silent Lord has brought us into conflict with many who do not understand the beauty of death.</string>
<string name="54550">Many fear their mortal end; for most we will simply use pain, anguish, torture and suffering to release them from this fear. We will prepare them for the cold embrace of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54551">But there are some who go to extremes to avoid their fate. They use foul rituals and dark necromancy to deny the Silent Lord that which is his due.</string>
<string name="54552">Earlier I mentioned my Order&apos;s hatred of the abomination that is undeath, &lt;FirstName&gt; - and I hinted at my own experience in battling such evil.</string>
<string name="54553">My Order has many secrets, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Secrets we do not reveal to those outside our monastery. Yet you have proven yourself a friend of the Long Death before.</string>
<string name="54554">I will not abandon the search for the cultists behind the plague; I have pledged to aid you in destroying those who released the foul taint of the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="54555">This is not the time to speak of such things, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We must focus on rooting out the cult responsible for the Wailing Death. Perhaps we can speak of this later... when the time is right.</string>
<string name="54556">I have mixed feelings about the paladin&apos;s actions. They say she was driven to her betrayal by the execution of her lover - she could not accept his death and it drove her mad with grief and a desire for revenge.</string>
<string name="54557">Very well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The beauty of death is not easily understood, but if you are willing I will tell you of some of the rituals I endured when I joined the Long Death.</string>
<string name="54558">I have been waiting for guidance from the Silent Lord before I discussed this matter with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I realize now what a fool I was.</string>
<string name="54559">Do not fear, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As long as you seek the Words of Power I shall serve you. And in serving you I serve the will of the Silent Lord. </string>
<string name="54560">Perhaps later I will speak more of this, but now is not the time. You are not yet ready. Let us return to our mission, for in doing so we will surely spread death throughout the North.</string>
<string name="54561">You have proved yourself a true servant of the Silent Lord, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Take this amulet; all who join the Long Death are given a similar talisman. </string>
<string name="54562">Let me see... yes, this may work. The taint of undeath has not yet contaminated the dessicated flesh of this limb.</string>
<string name="54563">Once more you have proved yourself an agent of my Master, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I bestow upon you this talisman, a gift normally reserved only for those of my Order.</string>
<string name="54564">The Silent Lord has many tools to reap his harvest, Alaganda may have succumbed to the plague or other... misfortune. But I will search the city until I either kill her or find the ring that proves she is already dead.</string>
<string name="54565">But even though we were ultimately victorious, the cost was terrible. The horror of the battle haunts me still - as does the fate of my fallen brothers and sisters from the Order.</string>
<string name="54566">That I am not yet ready to share with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, for I have not yet completed it.</string>
<string name="54567">The sacred weapons are all emblazoned with the symbol of my Order - the outstretched hand of the Silent Lord reaching to claim us all.</string>
<string name="54568">Ultimately I follow no one but the Silent Lord, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have been drawn here in the service of my master, Death.</string>
<string name="54569">When we parted ways, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I meant to return to my Order. But I bow to the Silent Lord and I discovered I could best serve his will by staying in Neverwinter for the time being.</string>
<string name="54570">I am eager to find and slaughter those who unleashed the Wailing Death upon Neverwinter. Thousands were taken by the disease, their essence stolen from the grasp of true Death.</string>
<string name="54571">When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists.</string>
<string name="54572">Return to me if you require an ally in your mission. Together we can help sow the seeds of destruction throughout the land and reap a harvest of agony and death.</string>
<string name="54573">Then together we shall sow death and destruction throughout the land in our quest to destroy those behind the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="54574">Their location is well hidden. However, I would not be surprised to learn they are connected with the village of Charwood. </string>
<string name="54575">You have the mark of Death upon you, &lt;FirstName&gt; - the scent of slaughter is thick around you. I have no doubt brutal destruction follows closely in your wake.</string>
<string name="54576">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you seek a partner to revel in the bloodshed you must inevitably unleash, you can always find me here.</string>
<string name="54577">Yes, Aarin has hired dozens of mercenaries to aid him in this cause - though truth be told, I would have come to serve one side or the other in any case.</string>
<string name="54578">A war is brewing over these Words of Power. Slaughter and death will engulf the North, and as a monk of the Long Death I must be at the center of the carnage.</string>
<string name="54579">I have not heard anything of these Words, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though I once lived with my clan in the mountains to the North.</string>
<string name="54580">I am here seeking death and bloodshed, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I care nothing for these Words of Power. I only want to glory in the killing of others.</string>
<string name="54581">Together we shall bring a flood of death to drown the North, &lt;FirstName&gt;!</string>
<string name="54582">There are not many who claim it is good to see the members of my Order, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But you and I are of the same ilk - we do not shy from death and killing.</string>
<string name="54583">I serve the Silent Lord, I go where death is imminent. We are on the eve of war - that is why I have come, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I follow the scent of slaughter, not you.</string>
<string name="54584">When I heard Aarin Gend was recruiting mercenaries to his cause I knew you would come, &lt;FirstName&gt;, just as I did. Our fates appear once more to be bound together.</string>
<string name="54585">Aribeth&apos;s betrayal has stoked the fires of war, and I am eager to see the killing begin. If we are lucky this war will engulf the entire region.</string>
<string name="54586">Together we shall bring a flood of death to drown the North, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="54587">As you wish, &lt;FirstName&gt;. No doubt you can spread havoc without my assistance. However, if you change your mind you can find me here.</string>
<string name="54588">I have not heard anything of these Words, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though I once lived with my clan in the mountains to the North.</string>
<string name="54589">Then together we shall rain blood and death down upon the world.</string>
<string name="54590">You are an agent of destruction and a messenger of death. Should you change your mind come back to me here and I will gladly join with you again.</string>
<string name="54591">Then together we shall rain blood and death down upon the world.</string>
<string name="54592">You are an agent of destruction and a messenger of death. Should you change your mind come back to me here and I will gladly join with you again.</string>
<string name="54593">I am a disciple of torment and a messenger of Death, the Silent Lord. I bring the absolution of pain and anguish to my enemies to prepare them for a brutal - and purifying - end.</string>
<string name="54594">There is a foul taint upon this city. Death - true, permanent death - is perfect in its absolute finality. Pain, suffering, anguish, torture: these are the tools that prepare us for my master&apos;s soothing embrace.</string>
<string name="54595">But this plague is unnatural, it&apos;s victims never pass to embrace of the Silent Lord. The Wailing Death is a blight upon the world that must be ended.</string>
<string name="54596">Many find the members of my Order unsettling, for we embrace Death in all its incarnations. Yet in times like these, my skills are in great demand.</string>
<string name="54597">There is little I can tell you about the city. I came expecting to find the pureness of suffering and the beautiful anguish of death.</string>
<string name="54598">It would be reasonable to imagine there is some connection between the undead and the unnatural end of those who succumb to the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="54599">I spent several years at Mithral Hall in the service of Bruenor Battlehammer. Before I joined the Order of the Long Death.</string>
<string name="54600">You are right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The hunger of the Silent Lord will not be fed by mere words.</string>
<string name="54601">When Bruenor Battlehammer reclaimed the throne at Mithral Hall not twenty years ago it kindled a fierce racial pride in all the dwarves of the North.</string>
<string name="54602">I was one of many who flocked to Bruenor&apos;s banner - one of many who came to battle the denizens of the Underdark and drive them from the mines beneath Mithral Hall.</string>
<string name="54603">You are a fellow dwarf, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Surely you can understand the desire to dwell among the legendary halls of our forefathers?</string>
<string name="54604">And even though the dwarves of Mithral Hall turned me away, I sense you will not do so.</string>
<string name="54605">I have not been completely honest with you about my reasons for coming to Neverwinter, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I came here in search of someone.</string>
<string name="54606">You are not one of the &lt;brother/sister&gt;s of the Long Death, &lt;FirstName&gt; - but you are a monk, as I am. You understand the duties and responsibilites owed to one&apos;s Order.</string>
<string name="54607">Her name is Alaganda; like me, she was a disciple studying to enter the Order of the Long Death. We often trained together in anticipation of our initiation.</string>
<string name="54608">I will not describe our initiation rituals to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but the Silent Lord claims many who undertake them. Only the few who survive, as I did, are welcomed into the Order of the Long Death.</string>
<string name="54609">But Alaganda could not bear to face her own mortality, and on the morning of her initiation she fled, breaking the vows she swore when she first joined the Order.</string>
<string name="54610">I did not follow her right away, the ravages of the ritual had left me broken and weak. But when I recovered my instructor came to me and told me what I must do.</string>
<string name="54611">Alaganda has denied the Silent Lord that which is rightfully his. For this she must die. And because I am the lone survivor of the most recent initiation, I am the one given the privilege of killing her.</string>
<string name="54612">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But for now we must return to the task at hand. The Silent Lord&apos;s hunger must be fed with a constant supply of new victims.</string>
<string name="54613">My service to you will draw many into the cold grasp of the Silent Lord, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Death surrounds you. I would be a fool to let my other mission distract me from following in your bloody wake.</string>
<string name="54614">The essence of those claimed by the plague has been stolen from the terrible grasp of my master, Death. This sickness cheats the Silent Lord of what is rightfully his.</string>
<string name="54615">The location of the cult you seek is well hidden. However, I would not be surprised to learn they are connected with the village of Charwood.</string>
<string name="54616">Perhaps I can help you, for long ago my dwarf clan dwelt in the Dragon Mountains, though when Bruenor Battlehammer reclaimed Mithral Hall we left to join the others of our kind who flocked to his banner.</string>
<string name="54617">I have heard rumors that in that blighted district zombies walk the streets. Few things are so reviled by my order as the abomination of the undead.</string>
<string name="54618">It would be reasonable to imagine there is some connection between the undead and the unnatural end of those who succumb to the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="54619">Yes, we should continue with your mission. The Silent Lord is eager for us to feed his endless hunger with more souls.</string>
<string name="54620">There is nothing else I can think of to tell you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="54621">Yes, this is Alaganda&apos;s ring! This is the proof I needed; now I know she has been taken by the Silent Lord. She was a fool to flee - there is nowhere we can run that Death cannot find us.</string>
<string name="54622">I have no gold or treasure to reward you, but there is one thing I can offer. A small token, perhaps, but it is all I have.</string>
<string name="54623">It will not save you from the Silent Lord when He finally chooses you, but it will grant you some protection from succumbing to those who would deliver you into his grasp before your appointed time.</string>
<string name="54624">Eventually I will return to my Order and report Alaganda&apos;s death to them. But this can wait until your mission here is done, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="54625">The town has isolated itself from the rest of the world, far to the South of Port Llast. Few outside my Order even remember such a place exists.</string>
<string name="54626">I know the mountains were aptly named, for great wyrms could often be seen soaring over the moonlit skies at night.</string>
<string name="54627">There were many legends of the great hoards guarded by these winged serpents and the mighty artifacts that could be found within. </string>
<string name="54628">I do not specifically recall mention of the Words of Power, but I can only assume such a powerful item would likely be found in a dragon&apos;s lair.</string>
<string name="54629">Our instructions were simply to make ourselves available to whomever requires our assistance. So, in that spirit, is there anything I can do for you?</string>
<string name="54630">The town has isolated itself from the rest of the world, far to the South of Port Llast. Few outside my Order even remember such a place exists.</string>
<string name="54631">It would not surprisie me to discover links to the cult behind the Wailing Death in that unnatural place. Is there more I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="54632">I have been eagerly waiting for my chance to extract vengeance on the cult responsible for unleashing the plague on Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="54633">My name is Grimgnaw, a monk of the Order of the Long Death. Like you I serve the Silent Master, spreading pain and suffering and death throughout the North.</string>
<string name="54634">Long ago my dwarf clan dwelt in the Dragon Mountains, though when Bruenor Battlehammer reclaimed Mithral Hall we left to join the others of our kind who flocked to his banner.</string>
<string name="54635">At night great wyrms could often be seen soaring over the moonlit skies. There were many legends of the hoards these winged serpents guarded, and many rumors of the mighty artifacts that could be found within.</string>
<string name="54636">I do not specifically recall mention of the Words of Power, but I can only assume such a poweful item would likely be found in a dragon&apos;s lair.</string>
<string name="54637">Long ago my dwarf clan dwelt in the Dragon Mountains, though when Bruenor Battlehammer reclaimed Mithral Hall we left to join the others of our kind who flocked to his banner.</string>
<string name="54638">At night great wyrms could often be seen soaring over the moonlit skies. There were many legends of the hoards these winged serpents guarded, and many rumors of the mighty artifacts that could be found within.</string>
<string name="54639">I do not specifically recall mention of the Words of Power, but I can only assume such a poweful item would likely be found in a dragon&apos;s lair.</string>
<string name="54640">If you wish, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I will gladly join with you to seek out these Words of Power. I have no doubt our partnership would result in a scourge of death throughout the land.</string>
<string name="54641">Understand, I care nothing for the petty Gods who squabble over and lay claim to death&apos;s portfolio, for I serve Death itself, the Silent Lord who rules us all.</string>
<string name="54642">We of the Long Death train, study and serve our Masters. We strive to transcend the earthly world through mental discipline and philosophical understanding of Death.</string>
<string name="54643">The undead are a foul abomination, a denial of the natural order. We of the Long Death are in constant conflict with necromancers and their minions.</string>
<string name="54644">I have seen firsthand the horrors of a war with the undead, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="54645">I am not eager to dredge up those memories, but if we are to stand together you deserve to hear the tale.</string>
<string name="54646">Shortly after I had come to join the Order of the Long Death one of my fellow monks returned to the monastery with ill news. He had discovered the lair of a powerful lich.</string>
<string name="54647">Our service to the Silent Lord demands that we destroy such an affront to death, so we marched forth to destroy the foul creature and end its unholy existence.</string>
<string name="54648">I myself never faced the lich in battle, but I was one of many assigned the task of destroying the lich&apos;s zombie and skeleton servants. Never have I felt such revulsion or terror during a battle.</string>
<string name="54649">There is beauty in death. The exquisite agony of a mangled soldier&apos;s screams well up in a glorious crescendo before ending on a single perfect note of eternal silence.</string>
<string name="54650">The writhing torment of a flailing body is transformed into the magnificent truth of a frozen corpse, forever stilled.</string>
<string name="54651">But when a corpse is not still; when the dead continue to shamble and stumble forward in a gross caricature of living flesh - where is Death&apos;s beauty then, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="54652">My Order killed scores of zombies in the crypt that day, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Their bodies disintegrated beneath my blows in a shower of rotting flesh, yet they pressed inexorably forward.</string>
<string name="54653">But the true horror was yet to come. From the back of the tomb where the highest ranking monks of the Order battled the lich herself waves of dark necromancy spilled out over battlefield. </string>
<string name="54654">Several of my companions had fallen during the battle and as the foul spell touched their corpses they clambored to their feet, zombies under the will of the enemy we sought to destroy.</string>
<string name="54655">We do not fear death, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and had I been able to bring the Silent Lord&apos;s touch to my fallen comrades I would not have felt such revulsion at this memory.</string>
<string name="54656">But a zombie has no mind, it feels nothing. The pain that purifies and prepares us for death has no effect on such creatures; the understanding that comes during the moment of death is forever denied to such creatures.</string>
<string name="54657">I destroyed the animated lumps of flesh that were once my brothers and sisters in the Order, but I could not truly kill them. The undead can never be given such release.</string>
<string name="54658">The lich was destroyed, as were all its minions. We burned its lair, setting fire to the crypt so that the dark magic might be cleansed from a sacred place of death.</string>
<string name="54659">I thank you for your words, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though I doubt you truly understand. You bring death and destruction, but you do not understand it as we of the Long Death.</string>
<string name="54660">The true horror of what happened to my brothers and sisters is too terrible to comprehend; but I have vowed to free them from the torment of their undeath.</string>
<string name="54661">You couldn&apos;t possibly understand, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are a harbinger of death, but you do not understand it as we of the Long Death.</string>
<string name="54662">You are a servant of the Silent Lord, &lt;FirstName&gt;; you bring death and pain to the world. Yet even so you are not a member of the Long Death. My Order has secrets I am not yet ready to share with you.</string>
<string name="54663">You aided me in finding the ring of Alaganda; I believe you would have helped me bring death to her had she still been alive when we found her.</string>
<string name="54664">Perhaps you can be of service to my Order once more, for without your aid I fear my brothers and sisters will never escape their terrible fate.</string>
<string name="54665">I should begin by explaining what happened after we burned the lich&apos;s lair. The corpses of our own, those who had risen against us, were brought back to the monastery of my Order.</string>
<string name="54666">There we sought to enact ancient rituals to release their essence from the curse that had bound them to their animated corpses. But the chains of undeath are not easily broken.</string>
<string name="54667">The components must come from the crypt of a powerful undead monster, but it must be something that has not yet been tainted by the creature&apos;s necromancy.</string>
<string name="54668">For example, we would require the preserved hand from an inanimate corpse within a mummy&apos;s crypt.</string>
<string name="54669">Only the power of such an item can release the essence of my brothers and sisters into the grasp of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54670">This is but one aspect of my sevice to the Silent Lord, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The other is to follow your lead as you spread death and destruction across the land.</string>
<string name="54671">For the sake of my undead brothers and sisters, I can only hope so.</string>
<string name="54672">You will find that the blessing has enhanced the properties of the amulet I gave you when you found Alaganda&apos;s ring for me.</string>
<string name="54673">As a member of the Order of the Long Death her reaction to an inevitable event seems rather childish. The Silent Lord comes for us all; we might as well learn to accept it.</string>
<string name="54674">Much like the members of your own Order, a monk of the Long Death learns the skill to serve the will of the master.</string>
<string name="54675">Before an initiate can be accepted into the Order they must first learn to appreciate the beauty of death. We must walk the cemeteries and graveyards in search of this beauty.</string>
<string name="54676">We must live and dwell amongst the dead and dying. We must surround ourselves with that which others consider gruesome or macabre.</string>
<string name="54677">The next phase of our training is to understand the tools the Silent Lord uses to prepare us for death. Pain, suffering, sorrow, agony.</string>
<string name="54678">We participate in the torture of victims, we witness the sweet release they achieve when at last they succumb to death.</string>
<string name="54679">And then we subject ourselves to the same torments as our victims. We taste the pain and suffering as it burns away that part of us which clings to the mortal world.</string>
<string name="54680">Only through experiencing such pain can we understand how it prepares us to kneel at the altar of the Silent Lord. Pain is of this world, but it can release us to the next.</string>
<string name="54681">The Silent Lord claims many during this stage of the initiation. Those whom he has chosen to yet serve him in this world - those who survive - continue their training.</string>
<string name="54682">In the next stage of our initiation we must become true servants of the Silent Lord. We must murder three people - a rich old man, a poor young woman and a new born child.</string>
<string name="54683">By slaying a rich old man, a poor young woman and a new born babe we learn that all of us are subjects of the Silent Lord - male, female, young, old, rich, poor. Death has dominion over us all.</string>
<string name="54684">Next we must face the wheel, a simple test but one which delivers more initiates into the hands of the Silent Lord than any other.</string>
<string name="54685">The wheel teaches us that the Silent Lord chooses at His pleasure, not ours. We are subject to whims and chance, death is random.</string>
<string name="54686">The wheel is made of alternating white and black squares. If the pointer stops on a white square we move on to the final initiation. If it stops on a black square we are slain on the spot.</string>
<string name="54687">When I began the initiation there were six of us seeking to enter the Order. Two died on the torture racks, one was captured after murdering a wealthy, elderly merchant and hung. </string>
<string name="54688">That left three of us to face the wheel. I alone survived to face the final challenge.</string>
<string name="54689">I am a monk of the Long Death, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The final challenge is necessary only if I ever wish to enter the inner circle of my Order.</string>
<string name="54690">You are a tool of the Silent Lord. You enact His will upon this world, spreading death everywhere you go. The Silent Lord has brought us together for a reason!</string>
<string name="54691">I must assassinate one of the inner circle&apos;s members. Only by delivering one of their number into the Silent Lord&apos;s hands am I worthy to join them.</string>
<string name="54692">If I am meant to find one of the sacred weapons it will be in your service as you continue to carve out your blood steeped legend.</string>
<string name="54693">I could not have spoken it more truly myself, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="54694">You are an instrument of the Silent Lord, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will continue to serve you even as you continue to serve Death itself.</string>
<string name="54695">Yes - this is the mark of my Order. Wait... I fell a faint aura emanating from the blade. Yes - this is one of the weapons blessed by the inner circle!</string>
<string name="54696">The talisman has powerful magical properties bestowed by my Order, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Its power is not to be underestimated. </string>
<string name="54697">I suspect in practice we are similar to your own Order, though our beliefs and values may be somewhat different.</string>
<string name="54698">But during our mission I will not give up my search for the mummified hand of an inanimate corpse that can release my brethren from undeath. </string>
<string name="54699">Once again, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I thank you. Now let us return to the task at hand - those behind the Wailing Death must still be dealt with!</string>
<string name="54700">The dagger is only the beginning for me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I now have the ability - and the right - to deliver one of the inner circle to the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54701">Yet the inner circle are among the most powerful of my order, and if I am to defeat one of them I must become a master of all I have learned.</string>
<string name="54702">Once I feel I am worthy I will challenge one of the inner circle to a battle to the death. But of course, all this must wait.</string>
<string name="54703">Your task here is not yet done, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You still seek the Words of Power, and in doing so you still bring death and destruction to your foes.</string>
<string name="54704">It has been an honor to serve you and I will not abandon you until your task is done.</string>
<string name="54705">Your words are cruel, but there is truth in them. However, I will not simply abandon my quest.</string>
<string name="54706">I am Grimgnaw, a monk of the Order of the Long Death. The grisly account of the Academy is no great secret, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Not to those who seek such things out.</string>
<string name="54707">In truth my skills are not so different from any soldier or hired blade, though I embrace the beauty and perfection of my enemy&apos;s death with a zeal others often lack.</string>
<string name="54708">Instead I discovered the plague is a foul abomination. It robs Death of its rightful claim and denies its victims the cold embrace of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54709">You are an agent of death, &lt;FirstName&gt;, just as I am. We both serve the Silent Lord in our own fashion, though you refuse to acknowledge what you are.</string>
<string name="54710">Well spoken, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I tremble in anticipation of the carnage we shall unleash upon the Realms!</string>
<string name="54711">I do not know how we might stop the Wailing Death, though I am eager to search the Beggar&apos;s Nest for answers.</string>
<string name="54712">Alone I am not likely to survive the dangers of the district, and throwing my life away is a foolish way to serve the Silent Lord. My death will come in its appointed time.</string>
<string name="54713">But Death itself is always present. The Silent Lord is the name we give to the concept - the very essence - of Death.</string>
<string name="54714">There are some who call what we do evil, but my Order transcends morality. Good, evil - these things mean nothing, for eventually we all bow down to the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54715">The monks of my order bow down to Death, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We may swear allegiance to another, but only as it serves the will of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54716">The monks of my order bow down to Death, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We may swear allegiance to another, but only as it serves the will of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54717">We bring pain, torment and anguish to the denizens of this world to prepare them for the release of death. I have sworn to spread devastation and destruction in the name of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54718">But there was no place for me among the clans at Mithral Hall; I was shunned and reviled by my own kind.</string>
<string name="54719">This was long before I joined the Order of the Long Death, and at first Mithral Hall welcomed me, for even then I did not fear death and I was eager to inflict it upon my enemies.</string>
<string name="54720">There were many among Bruenor&apos;s followers who shared my love of battle and the reckless fury with which I slaughtered my foes. But none of them appreciated the terrible beauty of what was all around us.</string>
<string name="54721">Have you ever heard the glorious chorus of screams of dying drow echoing in the chambers of a dwarven mine? Or paused in battle to taste the palpable specter of death descending on the field like a cool mist?</string>
<string name="54722">Have you ever stood over a dying comrade, drinking in his pain and fear as his life bleeds away, gazing into his eyes to glimpse the terrible understanding shining through in the final instant death claims him?</string>
<string name="54723">After the battles I would walk among the scattered corpses, fascinated by the... truth... of their deaths. The others found it disturbing, I knew, but I couldn&apos;t stop. The compulsion was too strong.</string>
<string name="54724">And as I wandered amidst the twisted, mangled bodies and gazed into the masks of agony forever frozen on their faces, I understood. Drow, duergar, dwarf - in death we are all the same. In death we are all... perfect.</string>
<string name="54725">I tried to share my revelations with my brothers-in-arms, but they could not understand. They only looked at me with horror and disgust.</string>
<string name="54726">That was what they said, as well, thought they were glad to have me at their side whenever the drow attacked.</string>
<string name="54727">I left Mithral Hall shortly after my revelation in search of... something. I found the Order of the Long Death.</string>
<string name="54728">I suppose I cannot blame my fellow dwarves for their reaction. The acceptance of Death is not easy. Even among my Order there are those who cannot face the Silent Lord when their time comes.</string>
<string name="54729">I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I should not have said anything about this to you. This is a matter that must be solved by those of my Order.</string>
<string name="54730">You don&apos;t have to worry about that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m eager to end this foul plague that is taking what rightfully belongs to the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54731">If I am ever to advance further in the Order of the Long Death, I must bring back proof of Alaganda&apos;s death to my Masters.</string>
<string name="54732">Alaganda always wears a forged silver ring embossed with the crest of her family - a soaring falcon against a full moon.</string>
<string name="54733">After wearing it for so many years the ring will not fit over her finger, and she would never willingly remove the ring while she lives in any case.</string>
<string name="54734">Who among us is truly innocent, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Alaganda has participated in the rituals of the Long Death, she has slain many who you would call &apos;innocent&apos;.</string>
<string name="54735">And she has broken her vows to my Order. The penalty for that is death. I will find her, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I will kill her. If you cannot accept this we should part ways.</string>
<string name="54736">There is power in this amulet, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="54737">The mark of Death is upon you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As long as I stay by your side I know I serve the will of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54738">That was why I answered Lord Nasher&apos;s desperate call for mercenaries to come to Port Llast. He is also anxious to root out those behind the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="54739">The town is a strange place; there is a foul taint upon it that we of the Long Death can feel. None of the emissaries my Order has sent south to investigate Charwood has ever returned.</string>
<string name="54740">The town is a strange place; there is a foul taint upon it that we of the Long Death can feel, though we have not been able to determine what curse hangs over them.</string>
<string name="54741">It would not surprise me to discover links to the cult behind the Wailing Death in that unnatural place, though I can tell you little else about it.</string>
<string name="54742">I have never been there myself, though I know it lies far, far to the South of Port Llast. However, I know there must be great danger there.</string>
<string name="54743">My Order has sent many emissaries to investigate the region, but none have ever returned. There is some fell and dangerous power at work in Charwood, though what it is I cannot say.</string>
<string name="54744">I am Grimgnaw, a monk of the Order of the Long Death. No doubt you have come for the same reason as I: to join Aribeth in hunting and slaying the cult that was responsible for the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="54745">The town is a strange place; there is a foul taint upon it that we of the Long Death can feel. None of the emissaries my Order has sent south to investigate Charwood has ever returned.</string>
<string name="54746">There are some who call us evil, for they fear the pain and death we spread. But we transcend morality. Death is not good or evil, it simply *is*. It is final, undeniable and perfect.</string>
<string name="54747">Our beliefs are difficult for most to accept, and the Order of the Long Death has many powerful enemies.</string>
<string name="54748">So be it. You are not bound by the tenets of my Order; you have sworn no allegiance to the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54749">I have pledged to accompany you in this mission, and I will continue to do so for the mark of my Master is upon you.</string>
<string name="54750">The ancient rituals require rare components and we had many casualties. A few we were able to save, but the others remain traped in undeath until we can find more of the necessary components for the ritual.</string>
<string name="54751">I thank you for this, &lt;FirstName&gt;, on behalf of the Order of the Long Death. I have no reward to give you, save the blessing of my Order.</string>
<string name="54752">The mountains are far to the west of Beorunna&apos;s Well, beyond the hills where the giants dwell. </string>
<string name="54753">In the days of my clan the giants were of little consequence; we often sent warriors to thin their numbers and chase them from their caves. Since my clan left, however, I have heard the giants have grown powerful and bold.</string>
<string name="54754">I have even heard talk of a hill giant king, though I cannot say if the rumors are true. We would have to investigate the region to be certain.</string>
<string name="54755">I would welcome the chance to join with you again and bathe in the storm of blood you will rain down upon the land.</string>
<string name="54756">The trail of corpses behind me cannot measure up to the thousands you have slain, but I am no stranger to death. Perhaps that is why Aarin Gend is so eager to have me on his side.</string>
<string name="54757">Together I am certain we can reap a mighty harvest for the Silent Lord, and hand him a bounty of souls to feed his ever hungry maw.</string>
<string name="54758">Your reputation is well known, &lt;FirstName&gt;. They say they cannot even count the thousands you have killed. As a servant of the Silent Lord I would be honored to join up with you, whatever your cause might be.</string>
<string name="54759">If you wish, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I will gladly join with you to seek out these Words of Power. I have no doubt our partnership would result in a scourge of death throughout the land.</string>
<string name="54760">Would she have felt better had her lover had his entrails removed by a hungry troll? Or had his limbs ripped from their sockets by an angry giant?</string>
<string name="54761">Or perhaps she would have been less angry had a slow acting poison drawn him into a sleep from which he would never awaken? Death is death, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My Order seeks to help the world understand this.</string>
<string name="54762">The motives for her actions seem foolish to me, but the results are pleasing. She has brought war to the North. Thousands will die painful, shrieking deaths beneath the blades she has unleashed.</string>
<string name="54763">The Silent Lord is eager to feast upon the table Aribeth has set for Him. And while Death gorges itself on the soldiers and civilians alike, I will be present to bear witness to my Master&apos;s gluttony. </string>
<string name="54764">You only say that because you do not comprehend the mysteries of the Silent Lord. If you understood the truth of Death you would not find my words so terrible.</string>
<string name="54765">You have a love of death and bloodshed that is rare outside our Order, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Yet even you cannot truly fathom the beauty of Death or the mysteries of the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="54766">As a monk of the Long Death I was subjected to rituals and ceremonies that brought a true appreciation for that which others fear in their ignorance. Torture, pain, suffering and even death itself - these things are beautiful.</string>
<string name="54767">You bring destruction wherever you go, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your motives may be good or evil, but that makes no difference. Death is forever by your side, the Silent Lord has placed his mark upon you.</string>
<string name="54768">Your enthusiasm is refreshing, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You revel in the Silent Lord&apos;s work, but you do not truly bow down to him. I sense you would still balk at your own death. </string>
<string name="54769">If I could share the experiences of my initiation you might begin to glimpse some small hint of what Death truly means - the only pure, absolute truth in an imperfect existence.</string>
<string name="54770">I imagine you would not be ready for such understanding anyway. You seem to have difficulty accepting that you are a harbinger of death.</string>
<string name="54771">No, &lt;FirstName&gt;, now is not the time. Eager as you are I am afraid you are not ready for the wisdom I would share.</string>
<string name="54772"> Until you can accept that your fate is to deliver victims to the Silent Lord, I will not share the wisdom of my Order&apos;s initiations with you.</string>
<string name="54773">For many, this is the easiest part of our training. I myself was already enraptured with the corpses on the battlefields, I already understood the perfect truth of their deaths.</string>
<string name="54774">We all deserve death, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That is one of the fundamental truths of my Order. And in time we will all surely get what we deserve.</string>
<string name="54775">Our initiations are necessary for us to truly understand what Death is and what it represents. What we lack in numbers we make up for in conviction.</string>
<string name="54776">I want to ask you for aid in this, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but this challenge is sacred to the Order. Despite all you have done I am not yet certain you are ready to learn of our most hallowed secret.</string>
<string name="54777">I will not force you to aid me in this, &lt;FirstName&gt; - though I fear I will not succeed without your help. If you change your mind speak to me again.</string>
<string name="54778">Were I back at the monastery I could consult with the elders, but in their absence I can only wait and see if some sign is delivered to me. Only if I receive this sign will I be able to tell you of the final challenge, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="54779">You are here to aid me in this challenge, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The very fact that you are here is proof the Silent Lord wants me to ask for your help in this task!</string>
<string name="54780">There is a... a catch, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is forbidden for one of my Order to slay one of the inner circle unless we use a weapon blessed by the inner circle themselves.</string>
<string name="54781">You forget, &lt;FirstName&gt; - we do not fear Death. The custom exists to ensure that when one of the inner circle is slain it is by a monk who has been proved worthy of the honor.</string>
<string name="54782">When one of our Order joins the inner circle, they must bless a weapon that may be used to deliver them to the Silent Lord. They then take the weapon and secret it away in a place of great danger.</string>
<string name="54783">Finding one of these blessed weapons requires luck, skill and fate. In fact, we believe only the guiding hand of the Silent Lord will deliver a blessed weapon into the possession of one of our Order. </string>
<string name="54784">At first I feared enlisting your aid would be sacriligious. However, now I realize that you are a tool of the Silent Lord. You are here specifically to help me find one of the blessed weapons.</string>
<string name="54785">Together we can sow death and destruction throughout the North as we search for Aarin Gend&apos;s Words of Power.</string>
<string name="54786">Look at this severed hand, &lt;FirstName&gt;. See how the withered flesh has grown so tight and thin it exposes the delicate perfection of the bones beneath? Isn&apos;t it beautiful? </string>
<string name="54787">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That seem high. Me give 200 only.</string>
<string name="54788">Here be 250 gold. Now me own you, Linu.</string>

<string name="54802">I don&apos;t have that kind of gold to spend on a henchman.</string>
<string name="54803">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That seems a little expensive. I&apos;ll give you 100.</string>
<string name="54804">125? Deal.</string>
<string name="54805">I need a good healer. Here&apos;s your 150 gold. Welcome aboard, Linu.</string>
<string name="54806">No. </string>
<string name="54807">Yes.</string>
<string name="54808">No, not now. </string>
<string name="54809">Yes. </string>
<string name="54810">Me be the greaterest, er... bestest! Yeah, me be the bestest!</string>
<string name="54811">Why they sing? Me just do duty. </string>
<string name="54812">Well, I should hope that they finally noticed a true hero.</string>
<string name="54813">There is nothing to sing about. I just did my duty.</string>
<string name="54814">Goodbye. </string>
<string name="54815">You work for Aarin Gend? Me work for Aarin too!</string>
<string name="54816">So you&apos;re working for Aarin Gend?</string>

<string name="55279">IGNORE THIS STARTING CONDITION. THIS IS USED AS A TRASH FOR UNWANTED LINKS. DO NOT DELETE THESE LINKS. </string>
<string name="55280">My goal in life is to get through with a minimum of pain, but sometimes one has to aim for simple survival. To achieve that, you will need an experienced healer.</string>
<string name="55281">I promise I will do my best to keep you in excellent health. Only 250 gold pieces and you will gain the talents of one who can heal and fight.</string>
<string name="55282">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry. 250 is my final offer. Consider the cost of repeated journeys to a temple for healing.</string>
<string name="55283">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps we could meet in the middle and settle on 225?</string>
<string name="55284">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I guess I must not let my race&apos;s prejudices get in the way. 200 is fair; all my skills are yours to command.</string>
<string name="55285">I promise I will do my best to keep you in excellent health. Only 200 gold pieces and you will gain the talents of one who can heal and fight.</string>
<string name="55286">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry. 200 is my final offer. Consider the cost of repeated journeys to a temple for healing.</string>
<string name="55287">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps we could meet in the middle and settle on 175?</string>
<string name="55288">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You seem like an agreeable &lt;man/woman&gt; to work with, dear &lt;FirstName&gt;. 150 it is, and all my skills are yours to command.</string>
<string name="55289">I promise I will do my best to keep you in excellent health. You have a pleasant and trustworthy demeanor, so I will reduce my normal fee. Only 150 gold pieces and you will gain the talents of one who can heal and fight.</string>
<string name="55290">Nobody owns me, dear. You have paid for my skills. There is a subtle, yet important difference.</string>
<string name="55291">Goddess speed your journey and keep you safe. If you have need of my skills, I shall be here, unless someone else hires me.</string>
<string name="55292">Ah well, maybe in time you will earn the funds and can return. I just hope you don&apos;t have to spend it all on healing from the temples. Is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="55293">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry. 150 is my final offer. Consider the cost of repeated journeys to a temple for healing.</string>
<string name="55294">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps we could meet in the middle and settle on 125?</string>
<string name="55295">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You seem like an agreeable &lt;man/woman&gt; to work for. 100 it is, and all my skills are yours to command.</string>
<string name="55296">You will not regret this, dear &lt;FirstName&gt;. My skills are yours to command.</string>
<string name="55297">I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me. Any time you wish to issue new orders you have only to speak to me again.</string>
<string name="55298">I promise I will do my best to keep you in excellent health. Since we&apos;re both of the &lt;race&gt; race I&apos;m willing to cut my normal fee. Only 150 gold pieces and you will gain the talents of one who can heal and fight.</string>
<string name="55299">Sorry dear, but I serve another master now. There&apos;s nothing else I can do for you.</string>
<string name="55300">I hoped that you would return, so I waited here. I&apos;ve hardly damaged anything since you left; I thought you&apos;d be proud. May I join with you once more, my friend?</string>
<string name="55301">(Sigh) Then I shall wait here for you to return.</string>
<string name="55302">I shall try to breathe life back into you and your quest.</string>
<string name="55303">I can still feel my death, hanging on me, cold and eerie. I am glad to be back in this mortal realm again. Now that I know how it feels, I will struggle even harder to keep you from that fate. May I join you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="55304">(Sigh) Then I shall wait here for you to return.</string>
<string name="55305">I shall try to breathe life back into you and your quest.</string>
<string name="55306">I see we meet again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Would you be looking for a powerful healer? I would gladly join in the search for the Words of Power. </string>
<string name="55307">Hello there, &lt;FullName&gt;. The bards sing of your exploits in the taverns these days. It&apos;s a thrill to finally meet you. </string>
<string name="55308">Well, I guess humility isn&apos;t something they&apos;ll praise in songs about you. Still, you have accomplished great deeds and saved many lives.</string>
<string name="55309">It may be duty that drives you, but without your actions, many innocents would now be dead.</string>
<string name="55310">My name is Linu La&apos;neral, an elven cleric of Sehanine Moonbow. I believe you are here on the same mission Aarin Gend hired all the mercenaries for: to find the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="55311">Good luck then. If you find yourself spending too much time and gold at the temple, return and speak with me again.</string>
<string name="55312">Yes, there are many mercenaries here, hired to aid him in this cause. We seek the Words of Power throughout the north, to stop them from falling into the enemy&apos;s hands. </string>
<string name="55313">I have been working in Neverwinter to save those stricken with the plague. It was a grim and endless task, and I will do everything in my power to save all people from suffering any more.</string>
<string name="55314">I am a skilled healer, and I would love to discover clues to this mystery, but I fear to do so on my own &lt;FirstName&gt;. I would like to have the security of someone to watch my back. I would love to help you, if you need a healer.</string>
<string name="55315">Good luck then. If you find yourself spending too much time and gold at the temple, return and speak with me again.</string>
<string name="55316">I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me. Any time you wish to issue new orders you have only to speak to me again.</string>
<string name="55317">I don&apos;t know where they would be, although I would think that such magic would most likely be associated with the ancient times. That leads me to think about some ruins, far to the south of here.</string>
<string name="55318">I have read lately of ruins that contain traces of ancient cultures, whose knowledge of magic ran deeper than any living today.</string>
<string name="55319">I am an elf of Evereska, a land where studying the mysteries is more than a path, it is the highest calling. The ruins to the south call to me, as if they hide knowledge that is imperative to us all.</string>
<string name="55320">I suppose that it may just be my own heritage, driving me to study something as old and unusual as these ruins are reputed to be, but it might be even more than that.</string>
<string name="55321">My dear friend, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It warms my heart to see your face again. Aarin Gend must have brought you here to help search for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="55322">I don&apos;t know what your problem is today, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but come speak to me again when you&apos;ve found some manners.</string>
<string name="55323">After Aribeth&apos;s betrayal I readied myself for a return to Evereska. Yet somewhere deep inside, I prayed that we would meet once more, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="55324">When I heard of Aarin Gend&apos;s call for brave adventurers to serve the cause of Neverwinter to join the Lords&apos; Alliance here at Beorunna&apos;s Well, I knew that you could not resist such a grand opportunity.</string>
<string name="55325">You are drawn to heroic deeds, like a glutton to a bakery, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I grabbed the first ride out of town and came here. Well... the second ride actually got me here.</string>
<string name="55326">Well, if that is the way you feel, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I... I hope you change your mind. I think the goddess has brought me here to help you.</string>
<string name="55327">Then I shall endeavor to keep you alive once again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Just try, occasionally, to keep out of harm&apos;s way. Sometimes I think you are as bad as I am for getting in trouble.</string>
<string name="55328">I don&apos;t know where they would be, although I would think that such magic would most likely be associated with the ancient times. That leads me to think about some ruins, far to the south of here.</string>
<string name="55329">I have read lately of ruins that contain traces of ancient cultures, whose knowledge of magic ran deeper than any living today.</string>
<string name="55330">I am an elf of Evereska, a land where studying the mysteries is more than a path, it is the highest calling. The ruins to the south call to me, as if they hide knowledge that is imperative to us.</string>
<string name="55331">I suppose that it may just be my own heritage, driving me to study something as old and unusual as these ruins are reputed to be, but it might be even more than that.</string>
<string name="55332">I will follow your lead as always, my dear &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are a better judge of such things than I am.</string>
<string name="55333">You make it sound as if, oh... all right, nevermind. </string>
<string name="55334">I was supposed to hitch a ride with one of the supply wagons at first, but the wagon I was on... broke.</string>
<string name="55335">Well... we had stopped for the night and I... I had this nightmare that a dragon was chasing me.</string>
<string name="55336">I woke up out of the dream, and saw something large outlined against the moon. I should have known better, it didn&apos;t really look like a dragon, but I was frightened.</string>
<string name="55337">So I cast the first spell that came to mind. The first blast of lightning did a little damage, but it was the following three that shattered it to little tiny pieces.</string>
<string name="55338">(Sigh) Yes, I seem to go to great lengths to cause trouble.</string>
<string name="55339">It was dark and everyone was so shocked by the lightning that no one knew where it came from. I suppose that I probably should have told them it was me.</string>
<string name="55340">I had to get here though, and I will pay Lord Nasher back out of my own wages when we are done here.</string>
<string name="55341">Hello again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I do hope you remember me. I&apos;m Linu La&apos;neral, cleric of Sehanine Moonblade.</string>
<string name="55342">I&apos;m just waiting here so I can help someone bring those evil plague spreaders to justice.</string>
<string name="55343">Greetings and well met. You are &lt;FullName&gt;, aren&apos;t you? You saved the city of Neverwinter. I heard the tales of your deeds as they were sung by a bard. It&apos;s wonderful to meet you in person.</string>
<string name="55344">I am Linu La&apos;neral, an elven priestess of Sehanine Moonbow. I was hoping to meet you, but I figured I missed you while I was changing my clothes.</string>
<string name="55345">If you find yourself spending a lot of time with the temple healers, you might want to come back here and hire me. Good luck.</string>
<string name="55346">Oh, when I came in here a waitress spilled some drinks.</string>
<string name="55347">Well... no. I bumped into her and when the drinks crashed down I leapt backwards into a dwarf, knocking over his ale and stew.</string>
<string name="55348">Um, no, the food and drinks landed on the floor, but the dwarf crashed into a half-orc, causing the knife he was eating with to slice open his cheek. That&apos;s when the brawl started.</string>
<string name="55349">I managed to stay out of the brawl, hiding under a table and feeling awfully guilty. When the fight was over I felt I should help clean up the mess.</string>
<string name="55350">No, I wore an apron and managed to stay pretty clean. Then I stepped outside for a breath of fresh air and slipped in a mud puddle. So then I had to go change.</string>
<string name="55351">Oh, please don&apos;t leave now. I didn&apos;t want to frighten you away.</string>
<string name="55352">I... I didn&apos;t want you to think I was clumsy.</string>
<string name="55353">I&apos;m waiting here at the orders of Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="55354">Yes, I know that already. Are you sure it was you who figured out how the plague was started?</string>
<string name="55355">Lord Nasher ordered all mercenaries to come to Port Llast to help discover the whereabouts of the cult that nearly destroyed his city.</string>
<string name="55356">I spent weeks wearing myself out, trying to help ease the suffering of plague victims. I jumped at the opportunity to bring the culprits to justice.</string>
<string name="55357">I&apos;m not much of an investigator. I have been ordered to travel with anyone who has need of a healer.</string>
<string name="55358">You are the one who knows how to solve mysteries, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I would love to help you though.</string>
<string name="55359">I have strong abilities in the art of healing, and I also can stand on my own in a fight. I would be a valuable resource for your quest.</string>
<string name="55360">It would be a great pleasure, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I look forward to our adventures together.</string>
<string name="55361">I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me. Any time you wish to issue new orders you have only to speak to me again.</string>
<string name="55362">I haven&apos;t heard anything specific about the cult, but I have heard about some trouble around Neverwinter Wood.</string>
<string name="55363">I don&apos;t know very much, but apparently there was a ranger in town here that was telling of animals savagely attacking anyone in or around the woods.</string>
<string name="55364">Having failed to destroy us with their terrible disease, it would hardly shock me to find out that the cult had struck with a plague of vicious animals. Is there anything else I can help you with, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="55365">Modesty is a true sign of a heroic nature. I think that the bards will sing more than one song about your deeds someday.</string>
<string name="55366">&lt;FirstName&gt;! I had hoped that you would show up here, my friend. I heard that Aribeth recruited you to stamp out the evil cult that was responsible for the plague. </string>
<string name="55367">You certainly know how to flatter yourself, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I did not follow you here. I have my own goals and reasons for needing to be here.</string>
<string name="55368">I thought we had parted for good, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but the goddess has her own plans that I must follow.</string>
<string name="55369">I went back to the Trade of Blades to prepare myself for a journey home. I was only there a few hours when I was approached by Lady Aribeth on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.</string>
<string name="55370">She told me that Lord Nasher is determined to root out the cult that brought so much suffering to his city. He has ordered all the mercenaries in Neverwinter to come to Port Llast to join in the search.</string>
<string name="55371">I was afraid I might have missed you while I was changing my clothes.</string>
<string name="55372">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I&apos;m so excited to be on another adventure with you.</string>
<string name="55373">Welcome back to the Trade of Blades, dear. What brings you here this time?</string>
<string name="55374">I can&apos;t really tell you a lot about the city. I have spent most of my time helping ease the suffering of the plague victims.</string>
<string name="55375">I do have some knowledge of the Blacklake district, as I focused my attentions in the slums of that area. Before you get to the rich part of that area you have to cross the dangerous section. That&apos;s where I was attacked while trying to assist the sick.</string>
<string name="55376">Please &lt;sir/madam&gt;, I already told you that I didn&apos;t mean to step on your cat, it ran right in front... oh, you&apos;re not &lt;him/her&gt;. </string>
<string name="55377">Oh goodness, how embarrassing. Why does this always happen to me?</string>
<string name="55378">If that is how you feel, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Should you need someone who can heal your injuries and fight alongside you, please return.</string>
<string name="55379">Um, before I tell you anything about me, I would like to ask you a question, if you don&apos;t mind.</string>
<string name="55380">You&apos;re not one of those dirty, underhanded, conniving thief types, are you?</string>
<string name="55381">You&apos;re not one of those dirty, underhanded, conniving thief types, are you?</string>
<string name="55382">That doesn&apos;t answer my question.</string>
<string name="55383">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hm. Something tells me you&apos;re not being completely honest. Still, you don&apos;t look like a truly evil kind of thief.</string>
<string name="55384">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, well, okay. Even if you were, I guess you don&apos;t look like a truly evil person.</string>
<string name="55385">Oh, but not the kind who would steal the gold fillings from your grandmother&apos;s teeth while she&apos;s still talking.</string>
<string name="55386">Oh my! Well, not the kind of thief that would set a mother on fire, just to steal her baby&apos;s rattle?</string>
<string name="55387">Oh, you&apos;re just playing with me! You shouldn&apos;t toy with people like that, I almost believed you.</string>
<string name="55388">I have had nothing but problems with irritating, despisable thieves, ever since I left... but that&apos;s not important right now. Let me introduce myself.</string>
<string name="55389">Not right now, but thanks for asking, dear.</string>
<string name="55390">My name is Linu La&apos;neral, a devout priest of Sehanine Moonbow. I seek to continue my adventures by hiring myself out as a healer.</string>
<string name="55391">I came to this city believing that I could stem the tide of this plague with the powers of Sehanine. Alas, it defied my every attempt to find a cure.</string>
<string name="55392">I worked long, hard hours in the temple of Tyr, trying to alleviate the pain of the sick. Finally, after working through several days and nights, I was exhausted. When I tried to stand, I fainted.</string>
<string name="55393">Well, I fell over and bumped into a glass statue of the symbol of Tyr. One of the balanced plates flew across the room and smashed spectacularly right above the head of the high priest.</string>
<string name="55394">The crash was so shocking that the priest sat down, right on top of a rather large shard of glass. I&apos;m sure it healed up just fine, once they stripped him and pulled it out.</string>
<string name="55395">I was unhurt, but the other priests didn&apos;t seem too concerned about that at the time. They asked me to find somewhere else to help with the wounded; as if it was my fault somehow.</string>
<string name="55396">I&apos;m not really clumsy; I was just tired. My troubles don&apos;t come from a lack of dexterity, so much as poor timing. Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m good in a fight and an excellent healer.</string>
<string name="55397">Each day I have been assisting victims of the plague in the slums in the Blacklake district, where they lie in the street, ignored by the residents and guards alike.</string>
<string name="55398">Oh, I didn&apos;t mean to scare you off. I really am a very good healer. Come back if you would like to hire my services.</string>
<string name="55399">Well, not anymore. (Sigh) The last time I visited there was a couple of days ago. I was attempting to help a sick, old woman off the street when I was set upon by several thugs.</string>
<string name="55400">Well, yes, but I&apos;m hardly the only person who&apos;s been attacked there.</string>
<string name="55401">People are terribly discouraged, because they figure they are going to catch the Wailing Death, so they aren&apos;t overly concerned with morals. In their desperation they turn to theft, or worse.</string>
<string name="55402">I want to go back and help, but what can I do? I think that if I could earn some more experience, and maybe some gold, I might be able to make a difference.</string>
<string name="55403">I want to trust you and I need the work, but I really don&apos;t care to be involved in any shady deals. Perhaps you could tell me more about this mission?</string>
<string name="55404">I can understand that. If you are working for Aribeth then I am certain your &apos;mission&apos; must be of great importance.</string>
<string name="55405">Aribeth has worked hard to combat this plague, so I am sure I can trust her instincts in this matter. I would love to work for you, if we can agree upon a fair price for my services.</string>
<string name="55406">Some of the rich nobles have collected exotic animals and made a zoo, for their entertainment. The conditions of the zoo are supposed to be disgusting and the animals have been mistreated.</string>
<string name="55407">I should have done something about it, but the sick and dying in this city are enough misery for anyone. I heard there is a druid here in the core who is looking for someone to help free the animals.</string>
<string name="55408">If you want to go to the Blacklake district you will have to cross the slums. Plenty of looters would like to stick a knife in you, so having someone who can guard your back and heal your wounds is a good idea.</string>
<string name="55409">You are kind to say so, but I suppose it didn&apos;t help that I had accidentally lit the altar on fire the previous day.</string>
<string name="55410">Sehanine Moonbow. I suppose she has been called worse, though usually on purpose.</string>
<string name="55411">Few outside the elven people know of Sehanine. There is little to tell that would be of importance to you, except that she protects her people, sometimes sending dreams or visions to guide us.</string>
<string name="55412">You may not know the Goddess, but I can tell you are a &lt;man/woman&gt; of faith. Sehanine is the elven deity of mysticism, journeys, dreams, death, and other domains. She protects her people, sometimes sending dreams or visions to guide us.</string>
<string name="55413">Hey there dear, what can I do for you?</string>
<string name="55414">As you wish.</string>
<string name="55415">The goddess has blessed me with more spells and skills. Give me a moment to rest and I will be more capable than ever of assisting you.</string>
<string name="55416">Oh, my friend, is this true? I can&apos;t give you your money back. Are you you sure this is what you want?</string>
<string name="55417">Then I shall wait here until you have further need of me again. Please don&apos;t be long. Take care, dear &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="55418">If you feel that is best. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="55419">How far away do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="55420">If you feel that&apos;s best. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="55421">Just as well, really. I&apos;m not very good at it.</string>
<string name="55422">I guess I can try, but it&apos;s not really my forte.</string>
<string name="55423">I can stomp my feet with the best of them.</string>
<string name="55424">Like a butterfly in flight, I shall move in silence.</string>
<string name="55425">Very well, I will search whenever we are moving.</string>
<string name="55426">Well, that should make travelling easier.</string>
<string name="55427">Of course. How soon would you like me to heal you?</string>
<string name="55428">It shall be done.</string>
<string name="55429"></string>
<string name="55430"></string>
<string name="55431"></string>
<string name="55432"></string>
<string name="55433">At what distance do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="55434">I&apos;ve been bumping into you again, haven&apos;t I? All right, I&apos;ll stay a far distance away.</string>
<string name="55435">A medium distance? You got it.</string>
<string name="55436">That&apos;s the way I prefer it too, closer and easier to heal.</string>
<string name="55437">Was there anything else?</string>
<string name="55438">Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="55439">I love chatting with you, but don&apos;t you think we should focus on your mission right now?</string>
<string name="55440">As you wish. We should probably continue with your mission in any case.</string>
<string name="55441">I don&apos;t really know anything about these lands, except what I have read in books.</string>
<string name="55442">I have read about some ancient ruins, to the far south of here. What I read of the ruins is that they contain traces of ancient cultures, whose knowledge of magic ran deeper than any living today.</string>
<string name="55443">I think that magic like the words of power would most likely be associated with the ancient times. </string>
<string name="55444">I am an elf of Evereska, a land where studying the mysteries is more than a path, it is the highest calling. The ruins to the south call to me, as if they hide knowledge that is imperative to us.</string>
<string name="55445">I suppose that it may just be my own heritage, driving me to study something as old and unusual as these ruins are reputed to be, but it might be even more than that.</string>
<string name="55446">I will follow your lead as always, my dear &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are a better judge of such things than I am.</string>
<string name="55447">I don&apos;t know where the cult might be hiding, though I have heard rumors that might lead to where they have struck lately. There are strange things afoot in the Neverwinter Wood.</string>
<string name="55448">I don&apos;t know very much, but apparently there was a ranger in town here that was telling tales of animals savagely attacking anyone in or around the woods.</string>
<string name="55449">Yes. I don&apos;t remember what his name was, but he was in Port Llast for a while. It is possible that the townsfolk might know where he is. It may be nothing, but I have a feeling it could be important.</string>
<string name="55450">Having failed to destroy us with their terrible disease, it would hardly shock me to find out that the cult had struck with a plague of vicious animals. </string>
<string name="55451">I understand. We must keep our efforts focused on rooting out those responsible for the Neverwinter plague.</string>
<string name="55452">That is all I know. I guess we just need to investigate until we can find some real evidence of cult activity. I thought the woods might be a good place to start.</string>
<string name="55453">I wish I could be more helpful, &lt;FirstName&gt;. All I really know about is the Blacklake district, but otherwise I know nothing of the city.</string>
<string name="55454">I worked in the core of the city for a while, but most of my time was spent in the slums of the Blacklake district. The slums separate the rich from the rest of the city.</string>
<string name="55455">Bodies of plague victims lay in the streets, unattended by guards or healers. There were to many sick and I couldn&apos;t keep up. Not that I helped much, but I tried to help ease their pain as much as I could.</string>
<string name="55456">The people of the slums have become so desperate that many of them attack intruders on sight, hoping for even just a single gold coin.</string>
<string name="55457">That&apos;s fine by me, dear. Let&apos;s get back at it.</string>
<string name="55458">I have heard about some kind of zoo that the rich were keeping exotic animals in. The conditions are supposed to be simply awful.</string>
<string name="55459">I never actually went there. I had enough sick people to worry about the misery of the animals, but I know there is a druid here in the core who is looking for someone to free the poor creatures.</string>
<string name="55460">That&apos;s really all I can think of to tell you, sorry.</string>
<string name="55461">We have too much to do right now to tell that tale. We need to find the Words of Power for Aarin Gend if we are to save Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="55462">That&apos;s all there is to tell, sweet &lt;FirstName&gt;. I shall defend your life with my own until the day that Neverwinter is safe again. Someday fate might guide me to the seed.</string>
<string name="55463">The goddess has led me to be here with you. With your help I have recovered the Chalice of Moonbow and found my husband&apos;s journal. You are my guide to restoring the volcanic oak, to rebuild my people.</string>
<string name="55464">Your father was an abusive bastard wasn&apos;t he? I shall imagine that he was so that I can continue to serve someone whose heart is so cold.</string>
<string name="55465">Thank you, my &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your words are dear to my heart. I have had no close companion since my husband&apos;s death. You fill a void that I thought would be empty forever.</string>
<string name="55466">But for now we must focus on finding the Words of Power. Aarin Gend is counting on us.</string>
<string name="55467">Yes - that&apos;s the seed the goddess described, I&apos;m sure of it. Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you&apos;ve done it!</string>
<string name="55468">There is nothing I could give you that could equal the gift you have given to the people of Evereska. You have proven that you are the best of friends to the elven people. </string>
<string name="55469">I think you shall find that the pendant I gave you is now much stronger than before.</string>
<string name="55470">You have unlocked the strongest magics of the pendant. Jendar, a human, proved the depths of his friendship to the elves years ago and the pendant blessed him with quicker reflexes than most elves have.</string>
<string name="55471">I will take the seed back to Evereska, where a place will be prepared for a whole forest of these oaks to grow. </string>
<string name="55472">The elven population has been withdrawing from the larger population of Faerun at too quick a rate. Perhaps with this symbol, and the elven gods&apos; blessings, we can begin to replenish ourselves.</string>
<string name="55473">The coming years will be an upheaval in elven society, if we are going to integrate ourselves more, then we will need strong leadership. Who will step up and assume that role? I have no idea.</string>
<string name="55474">I don&apos;t really think I have the qualities necessary for leadership. I would be content with a place in the church, maybe build a new temple somewhere in human lands, and lend support to elves who come out of seclusion.</string>
<string name="55475">Whatever role I am given, with Sehanine to guide me, I shall endeavor to do what is best for my people, and for the other people of this world.</string>
<string name="55476">Though I know there is much to do in Evereska, I am in no rush to leave your side, dear one.</string>
<string name="55477">As long as we have work to do, and you have a place for me, I shall remain with you, loyal to the end.</string>
<string name="55478">Thank you so much. Your friendship is the dearest part of my life right now too. Still, do not overlook the power of that magic.</string>
<string name="55479">Sweet &lt;FirstName&gt;. Those words... they fill some part of my soul that has been missing for a long time.</string>
<string name="55480">There is an expression in elven, &apos;Vestrai mieni&apos;, which means, &apos;you complete me&apos;. Do you know what I mean by that?</string>
<string name="55481">I&apos;m sorry. I thought perhaps you would feel... nevermind. It&apos;s not important. I&apos;m just glad we&apos;re friends.</string>
<string name="55482">Oh. I... I... I&apos;m sorry. I have bungled this too. Please forgive me and pretend that I never said a thing.</string>
<string name="55483">It would mean a lot to me, if you would come to Evereska with me, after we are done here. I think I would truly love to explore a deeper relationship with you.</string>
<string name="55484">&lt;FullName&gt;, you are my truest friend in the world. I know now that we must work together to accomplish all of our quests.</string>
<string name="55485">I told you that I overheard Sehanine Moonbow speaking with the head cleric of her order. The words that I heard would echo in my mind for the rest of my life.</string>
<string name="55486">All right dear. Maybe later.</string>
<string name="55487">She told the elderly cleric that during her wanderings through this world, she had come upon a forest of breathtaking oak trees that grew in the middle of a range of volcanoes. </string>
<string name="55488">While she stood in contemplation and admiration of the oak, one of the volcanoes erupted. The lava streamed down the mountain, burning its way through every form of life in its path. </string>
<string name="55489">Being an elven goddess, probably several years or more.</string>
<string name="55490">The lava reached the edge of the forest and destroyed every single tree.</string>
<string name="55491">This saddened Sehanine, but as she prepared to move away, she noticed something very unusual. The seeds of the tree were floating on top of the lava.</string>
<string name="55492">I&apos;m positive. Just hear me out.</string>
<string name="55493">They didn&apos;t burn up. When the lava cooled, the seeds broke open and small shoots came out of the shells to take root in the newly formed crust of earth.</string>
<string name="55494">Within weeks the forest had renewed itself and the oak trees stood tall, defiant of the surrounding volcanoes and their fiery destruction. </string>
<string name="55495">What do you mean? Oh... oh I think I see.</string>
<string name="55496">Thank you, I think. I like that image. I&apos;m not sure why.</string>
<string name="55497">Thank you, I think. That&apos;s an image I like. I guess it just makes me feel like I have a little more purpose in life. You surprise me &lt;FullName&gt;. I like that in a man.</string>
<string name="55498">Sehanine was so smitten with the majesty of those trees that she made her favored weapon from one of the boughs.</string>
<string name="55499">Sehanine left the forest, returning occasionally to enjoy the splendor of their beauty. One day she returned to find that the trees had disappeared. Not a single seed remained, which made her weep.</string>
<string name="55500">She would weep if all of her people died, and she does sometimes weep when a favored elf is killed. But this was a symbol of nobility and strength.</string>
<string name="55501">Sehanine didn&apos;t know what had happened. She had been gone for several centuries, and there was no trace of the mighty volcanic oak trees left.</string>
<string name="55502">This is my task, dear one. Sehanine thinks it is possible that one day an elf priestess will find a seed of the volcanic oak and bring it to Evereska to be a symbol of rebirth for the elven people. </string>
<string name="55503">With this symbol, as the oak is reborn through fiery death, our people might be rekindled in spirit, though we might face adversity. I must find this seed, though I know not where one might exist.</string>
<string name="55504">Oh... now that&apos;s the kind of comment that could trip up a woman&apos;s heart. But... let&apos;s explore that later.</string>
<string name="55505">I suppose you won&apos;t rest until I tell you about the accident that led to my becoming a cleric of Sehanine. I guess I can tell you, though it was a horrifying experience.</string>
<string name="55506">It was just over a month into our training when Gaedolin decided to let us examine some of his collection of magical artifacts. </string>
<string name="55507">He took us into his vault, the part where the lower powered magic items were stored. We played with them for a while, but I was bored.</string>
<string name="55508">Being from a wizard&apos;s home, most of us had seen items like these quite a few times. I was hardly going to be impressed by a wand of magic missiles.</string>
<string name="55509">I noticed that one of the doors had been left open, so I thought I would have a quick peek inside.</string>
<string name="55510">I didn&apos;t mean to touch anything, but two of the other students came in behind me. One of them asked what I was doing. </string>
<string name="55511">His voice scared me, causing me to jump into the air, but I didn&apos;t land on the floor. I didn&apos;t see the rope that was hung to keep people away from this one display.</string>
<string name="55512">The hole I fell into was a doorway into another plane of existence, or at least that&apos;s what they told me later. According to Gaedolin, no person, let alone a child, should have survived the experience.</string>
<string name="55513">Does that make me blessed, or cursed?</string>
<string name="55514">Yeah... I guess so.</string>
<string name="55515">&lt;FirstName&gt;! I... I... well, thank you. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m ready for a deeper relationship, but I value your good opinion.</string>
<string name="55516">Oh... I&apos;m sorry &lt;FirstName&gt;. I thought you meant... (sigh) it was a nice gesture. Sorry I ruined it. I&apos;ll continue my story now.</string>
<string name="55517">Is that all this is? Is this just a way to get me into your bed? You swine!</string>
<string name="55518">At your command, verithalas!</string>
<string name="55519">I don&apos;t find that kind of humor to be very funny.</string>
<string name="55520">All I know is that my body seemed to expand and contract at a horribly fast rate, like a hyperventilating toad. The feeling seemed to last for hours, but was over in seconds. </string>
<string name="55521">I can&apos;t explain it any better than that. When it stopped, I opened my eyes.</string>
<string name="55522">There was a large, gray, squishy thing that looked at me with twenty large eyes. I whimpered a little, I remember that. Then it started to move. I don&apos;t think I have ever seen anything move so very fast. </string>
<string name="55523">I screamed as it attacked and continued to scream as a bolt of glowing blue light ripped through its body, just seconds before it could reach me. </string>
<string name="55524">I sat on the ground, trembling uncontrollably. Arms enveloped my quaking form and a soft voice whispered words into my ear.</string>
<string name="55525">That would be getting ahead of the story. Just be patient.</string>
<string name="55526">I can only recall images of journeys and safety, of life and death and of times to come. As the voice spoke, I began to feel very tired and I drifted off to sleep.</string>
<string name="55527">When I awoke, I was in a comfortable bed surrounded by a curtain that stretched up to the ceiling and I could hear a man&apos;s and woman&apos;s voice talking softly beyond it.</string>
<string name="55528">The voices were suddenly interrupted by the entrance of my master, who angrily asked why I was taken to the temple of Sehanine. A single word from the woman stopped him cold.</string>
<string name="55529">All she said was his name. He looked at her with a piercing stare, then his eyes opened in surprise and he sank to his knees. I was confused, having no idea who was standing by my bed.</string>
<string name="55530">The only word my master could speak was her name: Sehanine. </string>
<string name="55531">Yes dear, you&apos;re very smart.</string>
<string name="55532">The goddess came over and pulled the curtain back. She smiled and kissed me on the forehead. &quot;My child,&quot; she said, &quot;you have exceeded the boundaries of luck.&quot;</string>
<string name="55533">A green light surrounded her body as she stepped back and disappeared. For years after that experience, people treated me with awe and called me the god-child. </string>
<string name="55534">Sehanine did me a favor, but there were days when I wished she could have done it quieter.</string>
<string name="55535">I have dedicated my life to the goddess. She gave me that gift, so I gave everything back to her. There is a task that she wishes me to accomplish and that is why she chose to save my life.</string>
<string name="55536">I overheard a few of the words she shared with the high priest, before my master came in the room. But that is a task for me and should not be allowed to interfere with your quest.</string>
<string name="55537">Such is my life. Bad and good luck in heaping amounts, like a gift of gold that crushes you under its weight.</string>
<string name="55538">That&apos;s not funny. I didn&apos;t destroy anything... this time.</string>
<string name="55539">Bored children with magic items? I should say that&apos;s trouble.</string>
<string name="55540">My... it&apos;s been a long time since someone asked me that question. I came to Sehanine Moonbow when I was very young, which is unusual, since my parents were both mages and followers of the god Corellon.</string>
<string name="55541">It started when I was sent to Gaedolin Sentristi&apos;s School for &apos;Potentials&apos;. You see, both of my parents were deep into the mysteries, and held positions of respect. </string>
<string name="55542">It was assumed that I would take after my parents in the magical arts.</string>
<string name="55543">All children of gifted wizards in Evereska are sent to special schools as &apos;potentials&apos;, because they are expected to excel in furthering the art of spellcraft.</string>
<string name="55544">My ability to get into trouble had already started by that age, but my parents had kept it quiet, thinking I would grow out of it.</string>
<string name="55545">My first day of classes was a disaster, but I don&apos;t think it had anything to do with my ability for spellcasting. </string>
<string name="55546">I had an insatiable curiosity, and Gaedolin was a crotchety old master who expected all elven children to be patient, quiet, and orderly. I barely possess those traits now, let alone when I was a child.</string>
<string name="55547">The master decided to open class with a powerful spell, to awe us into submission to his tutelage. He turned his back and I moved in.</string>
<string name="55548">It was curiosity, not true mischievous behavior, although I suppose the results were often the same.</string>
<string name="55549">I just wanted to look at the spell components. They were very interesting, especially the wonderful gem he had sitting beside the circle. </string>
<string name="55550">Well, he went to reach for the gem, and it wasn&apos;t there. The spell misfired, causing him to ooze purple smoke for weeks.</string>
<string name="55551">It was a childish thing to do! I was very young.</string>
<string name="55552">Gaedolin was well paid for training us. He didn&apos;t kick me out right away, but he never forgave me either. It also wasn&apos;t the only &apos;accident&apos; to befall the class when I was around.</string>
<string name="55553">Despite all of this, I might still have become a wizardess, if it wasn&apos;t for the little trip I took. That was an accident that will long be remembered in our fair city. </string>
<string name="55554">My fate became sealed to my faith in Sehanine that day.</string>
<string name="55555">I will have to tell you of my dimension-hopping trip later.</string>
<string name="55556">Let us not talk of such things right now, sweet &lt;FirstName&gt;. We must hunt down the cult responsible for the Wailing Death. Perhaps we can speak of this later... when the time is right.</string>
<string name="55557">We will find the cultists &lt;FirstName&gt;, and justice shall be done. Then perhaps I can resume my quest.</string>
<string name="55558">I am certain that the journal must exist somewhere, and someday I shall find it.</string>
<string name="55559">I haven&apos;t let anything else get in the way, and this won&apos;t either. You don&apos;t need to remind me.</string>
<string name="55560">Sweet &lt;FirstName&gt;, I know that with you by my side, anything is possible.</string>
<string name="55561">That&apos;s it. Oh... oh Synth, my beloved. You really are... gone then. I... I thought it would be easier than this. I knew he was... but it still hurts. Oh, &lt;FullName&gt;, it&apos;s all my fault.</string>
<string name="55562">You must leave me, before my bad luck kills you too.</string>
<string name="55563">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, how can you be so cruel? Do you expect that love is so easily forgotten?</string>
<string name="55564">Still, you helped me find the journal. Deeds speak louder than words. I shall count this a truer sign of your friendship than your words.</string>
<string name="55565">Oh, &lt;FullName&gt;! I... I wish that I could believe... I don&apos;t know what I wish. I just need some time... but thank you for your words.</string>
<string name="55566">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt; - you have proven to be a true friend once again. My heart will heal, in time. I must tell you something.</string>
<string name="55567">As our friendship grows, so will the power of the pendant I gave you. I think that you shall find it is stronger now than it was before.</string>
<string name="55568">It is little in comparison to what you have done for me, but I do appreciate it and you have my friendship and admiration as well.</string>
<string name="55569">Now, let us go and bring those responsible for the plague to justice.</string>
<string name="55570">You have been a true friend to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have been reluctant to speak to you of this, but you did help me recover the chalice. Perhaps you can help me with this as well.</string>
<string name="55571">Synth retired from his adventuring life, for a couple of years. Then one day he came home with news that he had discovered the location of an ancient city.</string>
<string name="55572">I knew as soon as he uttered those words that he would be off on another of his grand adventures. I wanted to go with him, but I was involved in preparing a special celebration for the temple.</string>
<string name="55573">It was the first time I had been given a leadership role in the church. I couldn&apos;t back out on it. Now I wish I had.</string>
<string name="55574">I think he had waited for a time when I was wrapped up in something I couldn&apos;t get out of. It was his way of protecting me.</string>
<string name="55575">Synth had a friend who was a mage create a pair of journals. We could write to each other and be in contact everyday.</string>
<string name="55576">I don&apos;t know why, but he never wrote to me about his day or his quest. Instead he would write about his thoughts and philosophies on life and the mysteries. I wish he had written more about where he went.</string>
<string name="55577">No! Synth wouldn&apos;t do such a thing. Don&apos;t profane his memory, please.</string>
<string name="55578">The last entry he wrote, he spent several pages telling me how much he loved me, and that no matter what happened to him, I must go on.</string>
<string name="55579">I knew something was wrong and I begged him to tell me, but he ignored my pleas. The last thing he wrote was that he could hear them coming again. That was it.</string>
<string name="55580">&lt;FirstName&gt;, someday I shall find the caves Synth was exploring and I will try to find that journal. I think that if I could do that, I would be able to get past his ghost that haunts my dreams. </string>
<string name="55581">You want to know how Synth won my heart, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I guess I could tell you about it.</string>
<string name="55582">I couldn&apos;t face Synth, since our embarrassing encounter I had decided never to be near him again. Easier said than done when dealing with a daring adventurer. </string>
<string name="55583">One night he scaled the ten-story wall of my parent&apos;s home and climbed in through the window.</string>
<string name="55584">Well, it&apos;s not ten stories anymore. Not since the explosion, but that&apos;s a different story, and not one I want to get into.</string>
<string name="55585">As he began to quietly serenade me, I sat bolt upright in bed and opened my mouth to scream.</string>
<string name="55586">He jumped toward me, to quiet me, but I didn&apos;t know it was him, so I brought my foot up and kicked him in the jaw. He stumbled backwards, out onto the balcony.</string>
<string name="55587">I leapt up to continue my attack, but when I got to the balcony, I saw his face in the moonlight. He was holding his jaw, his face wrinkled in pain.</string>
<string name="55588">Just whisper my name and I&apos;ll wake up fine. That&apos;s something I&apos;ve had to train myself to do. Unfortunately it didn&apos;t help Synth.</string>
<string name="55589">I just bruised him. But it must have hurt a lot, because when I realized what I had done, I moved to help him and he must have thought I was attacking again.</string>
<string name="55590">He leapt over the edge of the balcony, since he didn&apos;t want to have to hurt me to stop me, or so he said later. I thought he would fall and kill himself, so I ran over to stop him.</string>
<string name="55591">He had grabbed the edge of the balcony floor, between the rails, and was trying to swing himself toward the lower terrace. I didn&apos;t see his fingers though.</string>
<string name="55592">I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s true. It wasn&apos;t my fault though, I was trying to help him.</string>
<string name="55593">I stepped right on his right hand, causing it to slip off the edge. He managed to hang on with his left hand though.</string>
<string name="55594">Fearing he would die, I called on Sehanine for the strength to save him. I felt power flow into my muscles and I reached over the edge, grabbing his hand.</string>
<string name="55595">I pulled, heard a loud popping noise, and hauled him over the wall, dislocated shoulder and all.</string>
<string name="55596">I don&apos;t think he was terribly thankful at first. He just lay on the balcony, trying to hold his shoulder and rub his jaw. I was trying to apologize, but he just kept begging me not to touch him.</string>
<string name="55597">Finally I got frustrated with his protests and I grabbed his shoulder, popped it back into place, then cast a healing spell on him to relieve the pain.</string>
<string name="55598">I may have troubles with certain things, but I am a good healer. You should know that by now.</string>
<string name="55599">I never gave him a chance to think about it. I helped him up, kissed him soundly, then led him into my bedchambers and removed any thought of flight from his mind.</string>
<string name="55600">I&apos;m sure you can fill in the details without my help.</string>
<string name="55601">We were very close after that night and we married a year later. Those were the happiest years of my life.</string>
<string name="55602">I just wish they could have lasted.</string>
<string name="55603">That... that is a cruel thing to say. You have a heart like a rock. I have treated you as a friend; a lesson you should well learn.</string>
<string name="55604">I... I can&apos;t talk about that right now. The memories are too unpleasant.</string>
<string name="55605">I always wanted to be an adventurer, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have a natural curiosity about everything, and I wanted to experience the things I read in books.</string>
<string name="55606">But I am from Evereska, the home of philosophers, mages, scholars and students of the mysteries. Adventurous souls are few, and they are often looked down upon. Except one.</string>
<string name="55607">Synth La&apos;neral was a handsome, charismatic, intelligent, adventurous archeologist.</string>
<string name="55608">He was respected within Evereska and other intellectual circles in places like Waterdeep. He was considered the most eligible bachelor in Evereska.</string>
<string name="55609">Don&apos;t sound so shocked. You sure know how to make a woman feel special, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="55610">Actually, I didn&apos;t like him at first. I was reading a text on an ancient race one night in the temple library. The author was writing about his adventures seeking lost relics in exotic, dangerous locals.</string>
<string name="55611">I slammed the book on the table, calling the author a lying, pompous fool. Another elf was sitting on a chair near me with his face in a book. He asked me what I was reading.</string>
<string name="55612">I told him the name of the book and he laughed. In my youthful arrogance I went on to list the large number of errors in the author&apos;s logic.</string>
<string name="55613">I did, and I quickly learned how dumb I was.</string>
<string name="55614">When I finished, he began to refute every point I had made. It was, I quickly discovered, Synth La&apos;neral. When I realized the mistake I had made, I screamed and ran from the room.</string>
<string name="55615">Despite my blundering, I must have made an impression on him, for he pursued me from that day on. Eventually he won my heart, though only through an act that almost cost him his life.</string>
<string name="55616">As another cleric, I hope you won&apos;t look down on me if I admit that at one time I cursed the goddess for allowing me to marry him.</string>
<string name="55617">Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I should not have said so much. We will talk more about this later, but not now.</string>
<string name="55618">I know I shall probably never find the chalice again, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I shall not give up. I must return it to my people to restore my honor.</string>
<string name="55619">Oh, dear &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are always so focused on one thing. Don&apos;t worry so much, I won&apos;t let you down.</string>
<string name="55620">Thank you, dear &lt;FirstName&gt;. But don&apos;t let my concerns interfere with your duty to Aribeth. My problem was self-inflicted, curing the plague is more important.</string>
<string name="55621">The Silver Chalice of Moonbow! Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt; - I can never repay you for this gift of true friendship.</string>
<string name="55622">There is something I have that might be of some use to you. This is the Pendant of the Elf. It has the power to enhance some of your abilities with those of the elven ancestors.</string>
<string name="55623">You have proven this day that you are a true friend to the elven people. This pendant only works for those who prove such worthiness. I am proud to be able to call you my friend, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="55624">Do not belittle its value. The true quality of this pendant lies within you.</string>
<string name="55625">Because of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I can return the chalice to where it belongs. I shall protect it with my life until the opportunity arises for me to visit Evereska.</string>
<string name="55626">Until that time, I shall remain by your side and help you achieve your goals. Thank you again, my dear friend.</string>
<string name="55627">I guess I should be glad to share my daunting task with a friend.</string>
<string name="55628">We are both adventurers. If I trust you with my life, I should trust you with my troubles. I am sorry I was so overcome with despair, but you see, I found the Silver Chalice of Moonbow once already.</string>
<string name="55629">If I cannot turn to a fellow priest to help me, then who could I turn to. I am sorry I was so overcome with despair, but you see, I found the Silver Chalice of Moonbow once already.</string>
<string name="55630">If I cannot turn to a fellow elf to help me, then who could I turn to. I am sorry I was so overcome with despair, but you see, I found the Silver Chalice of Moonbow once already.</string>
<string name="55631">I found it in a small town called Llork, but then... oh &lt;FullName&gt;, I lost it again!</string>
<string name="55632">I know. I berate myself all the time, and beg for Sehanine to blast me into oblivion for failing her so!</string>
<string name="55633">As I said, I found the chalice in the merchant town of Llork. The thief, a halfling, tried to sell it to a Zhent merchant, but when the halfling tried to charge him 500 gold, the Zhent claimed the religious artifact as &apos;tribute to Bane&apos;.</string>
<string name="55634">The halfling thief protested, but the mayor of the town is a Zhent as well. Next thing the halfling knew, he was arrested for the murder of an old woman who had spit in the face of a Zhent soldier the day before.</string>
<string name="55635">Obviously he never committed the crime. It never fails to shock me when people are capable of such injustice.</string>
<string name="55636">Don&apos;t compare me to that babyfaced, good-for-nothing weasel! I should have let him hang!</string>
<string name="55637">I found out what had happened when I showed up in town and saw a mob of people about to hang him. Everyone was laughing and telling the story to anyone who would listen. They actually thought that such injustice was funny.</string>
<string name="55638">Even the bloody merchant was there for the hanging, and he was drinking from the sacred chalice!</string>
<string name="55639">Don&apos;t admire him! There is nothing admirable about men with no honor.</string>
<string name="55640">Yes, so I have discovered.</string>
<string name="55641">They already had the rope around the halfling&apos;s neck when I heard the whole story. I didn&apos;t know what to do, but I had to stop it. </string>
<string name="55642">I ran forward into the crowd, yelling for them to stop, but... I... I tripped and fell in the mud. I looked up and saw the face of a kindly grandmother. I reached for her hand and... she kicked me right in the teeth.</string>
<string name="55643">You may think this is funny now, but it was devastating at the time.</string>
<string name="55644">The mob turned into a giant brawl, with fists and laughter flying everywhere. I crawled out of the crowd and fled town, weeping as I ran.</string>
<string name="55645">I made it to the forest and collapsed in the bushes off the road. As I lay there weeping, I heard a twig snap. I spun around and standing there behind me was the halfling.</string>
<string name="55646">He winked at me and toasted me with the chalice, which he held in his hand. I cried out that I had to have it back, but he just laughed and disappeared into the wood. I never saw him again.</string>
<string name="55647">Thank you, sweet &lt;FirstName&gt;. That is a kind answer from a good friend.</string>
<string name="55648">I appreciate that you have waited patiently to hear more of my story. I think we have gone through enough together to warrant a deeper level of trust.</string>
<string name="55649">I just ask that you don&apos;t make fun of me, since this was such a dark blot on my name.</string>
<string name="55650">Many years ago, a cleric performed a service for the people of Evereska by uncovering a drow plot to destroy the city. Sehanine Moonbow came and presented the priest with a silver goblet.</string>
<string name="55651">It wasn&apos;t my fault... well, it was... but I... oh, it was terrible. </string>
<string name="55652">The other priests were frightfully mad. Only the head priest was willing to concede that it could have happened to someone else. But, of course, it didn&apos;t. It happened to the person that broke the head off the golden statue of Corellon.</string>
<string name="55653">I didn&apos;t know what to do, so I stayed up all night, praying to Sehanine to guide my path. The goddess heard my prayer and just before the first ray of light broke the dark, I was granted a vision.</string>
<string name="55654">Do you have a single kind bone in your &lt;race&gt; body? I have not doomed us; I have kept you alive in fact. My accidents have never cost someone their life.</string>
<string name="55655">I saw myself leaving Evereska and going on a long journey. At the end of the journey I returned with the chalice. The trip itself was a blur. I had no idea where to go, other than north and west.</string>
<string name="55656">When I told the priests of my vision that would take me far away from them, they held a cheerful celebration in honor of my sacred quest. It was the first moment in my life when I felt I truly belonged.</string>
<string name="55657">I... well... no, it&apos;s just easier to accept it that way. And if I&apos;m clueless, at least I&apos;m not exceedingly RUDE!</string>
<string name="55658">But now they will never welcome me back to their city. My quest has failed.</string>
<string name="55659">No, you do not understand. No one will ever understand. I shall be an outcast for life!</string>
<string name="55660">Yes. The thief stole it right out of the temple and managed to sneak out of Evereska, no small accomplishment there.</string>
<string name="55661">I guess that is understandable. I have been away from my home and friends for a long time now. I would like to get to know you too.</string>
<string name="55662">All right &lt;FirstName&gt;, what questions do you have for me?</string>
<string name="55663">I have good and bad memories of my home in Evereska. I never fit in too well, mostly because of my... accident-prone nature, I guess you could call it.</string>
<string name="55664">I still remember falling during a childhood game of Tambaliya and all the children dancing around me chanting &quot;Human, human, Linu is a human.&quot;</string>
<string name="55665">(Sniff) Elven children can be so cruel. I put up with that for 60 years.</string>
<string name="55666">I shouldn&apos;t have said anything about that. I don&apos;t know why that came to mind all of a sudden.</string>
<string name="55667">I suppose I can laugh about it now, but it wasn&apos;t very funny back then. I don&apos;t know why that came to mind. I shouldn&apos;t have said anything.</string>
<string name="55668">There were good times. I loved the mysteries and magic of our homeland. And when I grew up, things were different.</string>
<string name="55669">Those mangy, sneaky, low-down, GUTLESS, EVIL... um, oh sorry. Just thinking about them makes my skin crawl. </string>
<string name="55670">Most of my problems have been caused by thieves. In fact, the reason I had to leave my home was because of a thief.</string>
<string name="55671">(Sigh) You don&apos;t start with the easy questions do you? That is a bit of a difficult question to answer, but I will do my best.</string>
<string name="55672">I had worked in the Temple of the Full Moon in Evereska for about six years before I left my home. I loved the peacefulness of the temple.</string>
<string name="55673">But even there, accidents and tricks of fate made life difficult. It wasn&apos;t usually anything big, just me in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don&apos;t know why, but I just didn&apos;t have any luck.</string>
<string name="55674">Oh, you sweet thing. We make quite a team.</string>
<string name="55675">No need to talk to me in that tone of voice, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am being very careful. Your mission is very important to me too.</string>
<string name="55676">It&apos;s not always bad luck though. Sometimes I can be a little gullible. That&apos;s what got me into trouble and sent away from Evereska.</string>
<string name="55677">I was collecting tithes one day, when a heavily cloaked figure came begging at the temple. He looked like a starving child, so I took him inside the inner sanctum to get him some food and when I came back, he was gone.</string>
<string name="55678">There was also something else missing, something very precious to the church.</string>
<string name="55679">Perhaps we will not become the best of friends. I will not be distracted from our task again. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="55680">Please forgive me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can talk no more about this. We don&apos;t know each other well and I can&apos;t share my most embarrassing moment with a stranger.</string>
<string name="55681">As you command, &lt;Sir/Madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="55682">I think we need to change your tactics.</string>
<string name="55683">I think I&apos;ll do better off on my own.</string>
<string name="55684">We need to change the distance you stay away from me.</string>
<string name="55685">Stay close.</string>
<string name="55686">Medium distance.</string>
<string name="55687">Far distance.</string>
<string name="55688">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="55689"></string>
<string name="55690"></string>
<string name="55691"></string>
<string name="55692"></string>
<string name="55693">Could we change how quickly you decide to heal me?</string>
<string name="55694">Heal me if I become somewhat injured (below 75% of total hit points).</string>
<string name="55695">Heal me if I become wounded (below 50% of total hit points).</string>
<string name="55696">Heal me if I become seriously wounded (below 25% of total hit points).</string>
<string name="55697">Could you not search all the time?</string>
<string name="55698">Could you please search when we move around?</string>

<string name="56040">Why they keeps it secret from you, even?</string>
<string name="56041">That&apos;s horrible, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56042">You should have taken revenge. I would have.</string>
<string name="56043">So he cheated on you. Why be so dramatic?</string>
<string name="56044">I would never treat you like that, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56045">That be very terrible, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56046">You shoulds have taken revenge. Me woulds have.</string>
<string name="56047">So he cheats on you. Why cries about it?</string>
<string name="56048">Me woulds never treat you so bad, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56049">Are you sure Dannen is still with her?</string>
<string name="56050">Would you take him back, now that you know?</string>
<string name="56051">What will that prove?</string>
<string name="56052">You sure Dannen still be with her?</string>
<string name="56053">Would you takes him back, now that you knows?</string>
<string name="56054">What will it proves, you think?</string>
<string name="56055">I believe I have a lock of nymph&apos;s hair, here.</string>
<string name="56056">We&apos;ll find you some nymph&apos;s hair, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56057">Just don&apos;t get preoccupied with it.</string>
<string name="56058">Are you sure revenge will be so satisfying?</string>
<string name="56059">Me thinks me has nymph hair, here.</string>
<string name="56060">We finds you some nymph hair, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56061">You just not thinks about it too much.</string>
<string name="56062">You sure revenge be so good?</string>
<string name="56063">Perhaps you should just let it be, then.</string>
<string name="56064">Dannen should be free from the spell, at least, no?</string>
<string name="56065">Lady Onaris hurt you. She deserves to be revealed for what she is.</string>
<string name="56066">You don&apos;t need Dannen anymore, I guess.</string>
<string name="56067">Maybe you shoulds let it be, then.</string>
<string name="56068">Dannen shoulds be free from spell, no?</string>
<string name="56069">Lady hurt you. She deserve to be turns into fat, ugly woman.</string>
<string name="56070">You not needs Dannen no more, me guesses.</string>
<string name="56071">Because I asked you nicely?</string>
<string name="56072">Because I told you to and you work for me, that&apos;s why.</string>
<string name="56073">I suppose I could pay you, if you like.</string>
<string name="56074">Because I love listening to your lovely voice?</string>
<string name="56075">Because me asks you nice?</string>
<string name="56076">Because me says so and you works for me.</string>
<string name="56077">Me guesses me coulds pay you, if you wants.</string>
<string name="56078">Because me love to listen to you lovely voice?</string>
<string name="56079">I can do that.</string>
<string name="56080">Oh, get on with it already.</string>
<string name="56081">Bah! Forget it, then.</string>
<string name="56082">Me can do that.</string>
<string name="56083">Oh, you gets on with it!</string>
<string name="56084">Bah! You forgets it, then.</string>
<string name="56085">I think I know that one.</string>
<string name="56086">Me thinks me knows that one.</string>
<string name="56087">That&apos;s not very funny.</string>
<string name="56088">I&apos;ve heard the ending.</string>
<string name="56089">Don&apos;t even go there, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56090">That not be very funny.</string>
<string name="56091">Me knows how it ends already.</string>
<string name="56092">You not goes there, Sharwyn!</string>
<string name="56093">How about something original?</string>
<string name="56094">Maybe you tells something original?</string>
<string name="56095">Love? Oh, ick.</string>
<string name="56096">This had better be good.</string>
<string name="56097">Sounds promising.</string>
<string name="56098">Love? Bah!</string>
<string name="56099">This better be good.</string>
<string name="56100">It sound promising.</string>
<string name="56101">&quot;Three Who Are One?&quot;</string>
<string name="56102">Oh, come on! Tell me now!</string>
<string name="56103">All right, let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="56104">I only asked a question.</string>
<string name="56105">Oh, come on! You tells me now!</string>
<string name="56106">Okays, we go.</string>
<string name="56107">Me only ask question.</string>
<string name="56108">That is a beautiful story... </string>
<string name="56109">What? She killed him? That is utter crap.</string>
<string name="56110">Do you believe that about love?</string>
<string name="56111">That be beautiful story... </string>
<string name="56112">What? She kill him? It be bad story!</string>
<string name="56113">You believes that about love?</string>
<string name="56114">Why did you tell me that story, by the way?</string>
<string name="56115">You don&apos;t think it&apos;s true, do you?</string>
<string name="56116">Why you tells me that story?</string>
<string name="56117">You not thinks it be true, huh?</string>
<string name="56118">What about you?</string>
<string name="56119">What about this? Is this the song you&apos;re talking about?</string>
<string name="56120">It&apos;s probably just a myth, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56121">Maybe we&apos;ll find it. Who knows?</string>
<string name="56122">What this? This song you wants, maybe?</string>
<string name="56123">It just big story, me thinks.</string>
<string name="56124">Maybe we finds it. Who knows?</string>
<string name="56125">What are you going to do with it?</string>
<string name="56126">Sometimes even fairy tales are true, I guess.</string>
<string name="56127">It&apos;s just a song, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56128">What you goings to do with it?</string>
<string name="56129">Sometimes even fairy stories be true, me guesses.</string>
<string name="56130">It just be a song, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56131">Your friendship is repayment enough, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56132">Sounds like I&apos;m getting the short end of the deal.</string>
<string name="56133">You&apos;re not going anywhere, are you?</string>
<string name="56134">I was hoping for something more than friendship... </string>
<string name="56135">You be friend is good repayment, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="56136">Me thinking me gets ripped off, here.</string>
<string name="56137">You not goes somewhere, is you?</string>
<string name="56138">Monsters?</string>
<string name="56139">What contest is this?</string>
<string name="56140">What contest you talks of?</string>
<string name="56141">Anything else?</string>
<string name="56142">Do you know any more about it?</string>
<string name="56143">You knows more about it?</string>
<string name="56144">Hmmm... what shall that price be? Well, you seem a fair enough &lt;man/woman&gt;, a worthy companion. 150 gold and I&apos;m yours.</string>
<string name="56145">Yes, &lt;Sir/Madam&gt; - is there something you need?</string>
<string name="56146">You&apos;d like me to do something different? Such as?</string>
<string name="56147">And how far away do you need me?</string>
<string name="56148"></string>
<string name="56149">When do you want me to try healing you, then?</string>
<string name="56150">You think so, do you? Hmph. I&apos;ll not help where I&apos;m not wanted, if that&apos;s what you really want.</string>
<string name="56151">If you wish. I&apos;ll be here, unless someone else snaps me up.</string>
<string name="56152">Who&apos;s this? Some poor soul straggling in off the diseased streets? Are you here to join our ranks and beg for an employer... or are you actually here to hire someone?</string>
<string name="56153">Fair enough, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I am at your disposal.</string>
<string name="56154">Hmmm... what shall that price be? Let&apos;s see. 200 gold seems fair, wouldn&apos;t you say?</string>
<string name="56155">Hmmm... what shall that price be? Let&apos;s see. 250 gold seems fair, wouldn&apos;t you say?</string>
<string name="56156">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, fine, fine. I suppose a bit of gold now isn&apos;t the most important thing. I am at your disposal, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="56157">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh? Let&apos;s split the difference at 125, then.</string>
<string name="56158">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I am not a crate of salt to be haggled over. 150 gold or nothing.</string>
<string name="56159">Get a grip. I won&apos;t be a slave to you or anyone else, for that matter.</string>
<string name="56160">I will follow you as you require. If you want me to do something different, do let me know. Shall we get a move on, then?</string>
<string name="56161">Hmmm... what shall that price be? Well, you&apos;re a fellow human. Perhaps I could cut my regular fee. 150 gold and I&apos;m yours.</string>
<string name="56162">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, fine, fine. I suppose a bit of gold now isn&apos;t the most important thing. I am at your disposal, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="56163">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, fine, fine. I suppose a bit of gold now isn&apos;t the most important thing. I am at your disposal, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="56164">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh? Let&apos;s split the difference at 175, then.</string>
<string name="56165">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh? Let&apos;s split the difference at 225, then.</string>
<string name="56166">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I am not a crate of salt to be haggled over. 200 gold or nothing.</string>
<string name="56167">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I am not a crate of salt to be haggled over. 250 gold or nothing.</string>
<string name="56168">Fair enough.</string>
<string name="56169">Well, off you go then. You&apos;ll find me right here, if you change your mind.</string>
<string name="56170">If you feel that is best. What would you like to change?</string>
<string name="56171">How far away do you want me to stay?</string>
<string name="56172">Fine. I shall stay as close as is reasonable.</string>
<string name="56173">Not too close, then, and not too far. I get it.</string>
<string name="56174">Oh? Am I cramping your style? Good enough... I&apos;ll keep my distance.</string>
<string name="56175">Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="56176">Was there anything else?</string>
<string name="56177"></string>
<string name="56178"></string>
<string name="56179"></string>
<string name="56180">Good enough.</string>
<string name="56181">Very well, I will no longer search while we are moving.</string>
<string name="56182">Very well, I will search whenever we are moving.</string>
<string name="56183">My pleasure.</string>
<string name="56184">And walk out in the open? All right, if you wish.</string>
<string name="56185">Of course, I can always help with that.</string>
<string name="56186">Fine, open it yourself, then.</string>
<string name="56187">You expect me to work for free, then? Don&apos;t be naive. Come back when you have something more to offer than promises, all right?</string>
<string name="56188">Come back, have you? What do you require now?</string>
<string name="56189">Well, well, well... you must be &lt;FullName&gt;, correct? The legendary savior of Neverwinter? I&apos;ve heard a couple of ballads written about you, already.</string>
<string name="56190">Hello again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I trust you remember me, yes? The bard, Sharwyn?</string>
<string name="56191">So we meet again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The others had told me Aribeth had recruited you to find the cultists... I can&apos;t say I&apos;m surprised. You&apos;ve acquired quite the reputation for yourself, haven&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="56192">Greetings. You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, correct? I&apos;ve heard much about you. Savior of Neverwinter, hero who routed the cult... all of that, if it&apos;s true. Is it true?</string>
<string name="56193">Hah! Somehow I knew you couldn&apos;t be far, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As soon as Aarin Gend mentioned why we were brought here, I began wondering when you would pop up.</string>
<string name="56194">Hello again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Have you need of my skills? I&apos;d rather not stand around this place any longer than I must.</string>
<string name="56195">I suspected you&apos;d show up here soon. I&apos;m glad to see I was right. So, then... shall we join up once more?</string>
<string name="56196">Sorry, but I&apos;m with someone else right now.</string>
<string name="56197">Dying was... unpleasant, to say the least. Let&apos;s not do that again, shall we? So... would you like me to join up with you once more?</string>
<string name="56198">My skills don&apos;t come cheaply, however. I&apos;ll follow you gladly and to the best of my ability, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... provided my price is met.</string>
<string name="56199">IGNORE THIS STARTING CONDITION. THIS IS USED AS A TRASH FOR UNWANTED LINKS. DO NOT DELETE THESE LINKS. </string>
<string name="56200">Have I scared you off already? Oh well. Do come back once you grow yourself a backbone, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="56201">My name is Sharwyn, and I call this city my home. I seek adventure and excitement... if you seek the same, you&apos;d be smart to hire me to accompany you.</string>
<string name="56202">How odd a game the fates play. My family lies mostly dead, now, and Blacklake is full of frightened fools who bury their heads in the sand and pretend the plague won&apos;t touch them.</string>
<string name="56203">So I understand. Might you be able to illuminate me as to the nature of this mission of yours?</string>
<string name="56204">Aribeth is Lord Nasher&apos;s servant... so your mission is bound to be exciting. Hmmm. Yes, I think I&apos;d rather like to join you... if the price is right.</string>
<string name="56205">Oh? Well, have it your way. If you&apos;re working for Lady Aribeth, I imagine it&apos;s something of great importance.</string>
<string name="56206">Plenty. It is full near to bursting with rich, frightened nobles who would rather wall off the district from everyone else and pretend the rest of the city doesn&apos;t exist than actually try to help.</string>
<string name="56207">Is there much else to tell? It is perhaps the one place in this city that remains yet orderly and plague-free, although getting inside its walls may be a bit of a problem.</string>
<string name="56208">One thing I know for sure, if you intend to get anywhere in Blacklake, you&apos;d best rely on charm rather than muscle. Or maybe bring a companion who knows the terrain?</string>
<string name="56209">I suppose I could tell you a little about the Blacklake district, perhaps, as I am from there... but that&apos;s it. Otherwise let me know if you need some actual hired help or not.</string>
<string name="56210">Is that so? Modesty is the last thing I would expect to find in the great &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="56211">Ballads so rarely tell the truth, however. I should know. Ha ha! My name is Sharwyn, &lt;FirstName&gt;, a bard and master of skills... I suspect we have been hired for the same purpose. To find these cultists and stamp them out, yes?</string>
<string name="56212">If you need me, you know where I am.</string>
<string name="56213">Of course. Lord Nasher has spared no expense in mobilizing an entire army to look for this cult. The search in Neverwinter is enormous.</string>
<string name="56214">I and these other mercenaries have been sent out to these parts to search, which is fine by me. More chances for fame in a smaller group.</string>
<string name="56215">Well, it could be that I enjoy being bored... or it could be that my instructions are to aid you and Aribeth, and I haven&apos;t been told to do anything, yet.</string>
<string name="56216">So how about it? You got the gumption to take me with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;? It would be far more interesting than standing around, here.</string>
<string name="56217">The cult could be practically anywhere. You may want to look in the hills by the Green Griffon Inn... I&apos;ve heard many tales of monsters raiding the roads nearby in force.</string>
<string name="56218">Bugbears and orcs, mostly. Apparently they were being directed by some humans, however, which would make it quite odd.</string>
<string name="56219">At any rate, since Luskan is wrapped up in its own concerns, the countryside has become open season for banditry... these monsters, however, are more organized than is normal.</string>
<string name="56220">Excellent. I am at your disposal, then.</string>
<string name="56221">I&apos;ll tag along as you need me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You want me to do something different, just let me know.</string>
<string name="56222">Hold on, then. Give me a moment to rest, and I&apos;ll be ready to assist you.</string>
<string name="56223">Talk? About what, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="56224">Fair enough.</string>
<string name="56225">You&apos;d like to know more about me, would you? All right, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I&apos;m game for a little chit-chat. I want to ask you something, first, however.</string>
<string name="56226">Why are you on this mission of yours? Why work for Aribeth at all? Did she bat her pretty elven eyelashes at you, or is there some other force at work here that I&apos;m unaware of?</string>
<string name="56227">I suppose that is a fair motivation. I feel the same, to tell the truth, although I desire more out of all this than just mere success.</string>
<string name="56228">Now you are are talking my language, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Making a name for ourselves by doing great things is what being an adventurer is truly all about, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="56229">Is that all there is to it? Wealth and power? Are you sure? There are many other ways to become rich other than performing great deeds, you know. Surely you must have chosen this way for some reason.</string>
<string name="56230">I desire fame above all else. I want to walk the path that others haven&apos;t, to make my own legend rather than recount others&apos;. I want to be thrilled and awed by my life, and when I look back on it to regret nothing.</string>
<string name="56231">This may seem shallow to you. I have my reasons, however, and I ask no one&apos;s approval. What do you think, then, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Do I have a chance at those things, traveling with you?</string>
<string name="56232">Promises, promises. I&apos;ll admit that there&apos;s something about your future that holds great possibility, however. We&apos;ll see where it leads.</string>
<string name="56233">Far better to make the attempt, I think. Far better, even, to perform great deeds and remain unknown than to not even try at all.</string>
<string name="56234">I know where the &apos;normal&apos; path leads, believe me... the path of the expected, the path that everyone else wants you to lead. Down that path lies oblivion.</string>
<string name="56235">Like I have nothing better to do, I suppose? No, I&apos;ve my own skills, thank you... and my own reasons for being here.</string>
<string name="56236">And why is that? Just because we went our separate ways in Neverwinter, I&apos;m supposed to disappear off the face of Faerun? If you haven&apos;t noticed, there&apos;s a shortage of good adventurers.</string>
<string name="56237">It looks to me like Lord Nasher is pulling out all the stops to find this cult. The search in Neverwinter is immense, and we mercenaries have been sent to Port Llast to join the effort with you and Aribeth. Lucky us.</string>
<string name="56238">I&apos;ve been paid good coin for my services by Lord Nasher, actually.</string>
<string name="56239">Good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you need a hand, you know where I am.</string>
<string name="56240">Fair enough. You know where to find me.</string>
<string name="56241">It&apos;s about time you asked. I&apos;m at your disposal, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="56242">The cult could be practically anywhere. You may want to look in the hills by the Green Griffon Inn... I&apos;ve heard many tales of monsters raiding the roads nearby in force.</string>
<string name="56243">Well... have it your way, then. If I&apos;m fortunate, perhaps my fame will one day be as great as yours already appears to be.</string>
<string name="56244">Fair enough. If you should find need of me, I shall be here, no doubt.</string>
<string name="56245">Yes, of course. All of us adventurers are here to scour the north for these Words. So far we have met with no success, though I hope to change that.</string>
<string name="56246">I am no great fighter, but I have skills and magic... and I&apos;ll do what I can to help, as you have.</string>
<string name="56247">No, nothing at all. I find that strange, too... I know considerable lore, yet neither I nor any of the tomes I&apos;ve researched mention them. I have an idea of where to look, however.</string>
<string name="56248">I&apos;d like nothing better. The chances of success would be far better, however, if we teamed up. What do you say, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="56249">Then I&apos;m at your disposal. I&apos;ll follow your lead, &lt;FirstName&gt;... if you want me to do anything differently, just let me know.</string>
<string name="56250">Fair enough. If you change your mind, I have little doubt I&apos;ll still be nearby.</string>
<string name="56251">Did I say it was good to see you? I only said I knew you&apos;d come. Ha ha! I only jest, &lt;FirstName&gt;... of course it is good that you are here.</string>
<string name="56252">Hmmm. You&apos;re a strange one... it&apos;s not as if I&apos;m stalking you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I was brought here. Have it your way, though... we needn&apos;t talk at all, right?</string>
<string name="56253">I wasn&apos;t going to come to Beorunna&apos;s Well, originally. I figured I had done enough by your side... but the story isn&apos;t finished just yet, is it? And you know what a sucker I am for a good tale.</string>
<string name="56254">So what do you say, then, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Shall we join together again? I want to see this unfold, firsthand.</string>
<string name="56255">Then I am at your disposal once again, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="56256">Oh, well. If you change your mind, I won&apos;t be far.</string>
<string name="56257">No, nothing at all. I find that strange, too... I know considerable lore, yet neither I nor any of the tomes I&apos;ve researched mention them. I have an idea of where to look, however.</string>
<string name="56258">Good. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="56259">If you change your mind you can find me here.</string>
<string name="56260">Good. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="56261">If you change your mind you can find me here.</string>
<string name="56262">I am a caster of bardic magic, a master of all skills and a teller of the oldest legends... and with or without your help, I intend to achieve my own fame in my time. One day bards will sing their songs about me.</string>
<string name="56263">I suppose such talk may make me seem arrogant to you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. If so, I don&apos;t particularly care. I&apos;ve known the path I was on for a long time... I left behind a life of riches to live the life of a bard.</string>
<string name="56264">What is it to be, then? Duty and honor? Power and riches? Somehow I doubt it matters, as I&apos;m willing to bet you&apos;ll find adventure and excitement along your path regardless of whether or not you seek them.</string>
<string name="56265">If my own family had had its way, I would be by now comfortably married to a wealthy man I could never respect, bored to tears in my large Blacklake district mansion.</string>
<string name="56266">There are some elements of seediness, perhaps... every place you find the rich, you find places where they can indulge their strangest tastes. I understand the local tavern&apos;s basement has its... distractions.</string>
<string name="56267">Does that make a difference? I see people I&apos;ve known my whole life falling to sickness all around me. I&apos;d say that gives me more motivation than most. And, incidentally, I am no &apos;girl&apos;.</string>
<string name="56268">Questions, is it? I may be from Neverwinter, but I&apos;m not here to be pumped for information by anyone new to the city. I&apos;m here looking for work.</string>
<string name="56269">There are those within the district who are trying to rally the rich to aid the rest of the city, but their cries mostly fall on deaf ears. One day the plague will come to them in force, and they shall regret their selfishness.</string>
<string name="56270">I wouldn&apos;t know where to begin. I suppose I could tell you something about Blacklake, if you like... I know that best.</string>
<string name="56271">It is full near to bursting with rich, frightened nobles who would rather wall off the district from everyone else and pretend the rest of the city doesn&apos;t exist than actually try to help.</string>
<string name="56272">There are those within the district who are trying to rally the rich to aid the rest of the city, but their cries mostly fall on deaf ears. One day the plague will come to them in force, and they shall regret their selfishness.</string>
<string name="56273">There is one powerful nobleman by the name of Meldanen... he&apos;s a sorcerer with a fearsome reputation who lives in Blacklake. If anyone might, he might know something about what&apos;s going on.</string>
<string name="56274">Very well, then, let&apos;s get back to your mission.</string>
<string name="56275">Is there much else to tell? It is perhaps the one place in this city that remains yet orderly and plague-free, although getting inside its walls may be a bit of a problem.</string>
<string name="56276">There are some elements of seediness, perhaps... every place you find the rich, you find places where they can indulge their strangest tastes. I understand the local tavern&apos;s basement has its... distractions.</string>
<string name="56277">Hmmm. That&apos;s all I can think of, really.</string>
<string name="56278">Lady Aribeth approached me at the Trade of Blades to hire me on Lord Nasher&apos;s behalf... just as you were, I imagine.</string>
<string name="56279">It&apos;s another chance at acquiring some fame, in my eyes... even though I&apos;ve been told to merely offer assistance to you and Aribeth, for now. So... do you need my help?</string>
<string name="56280">Bugbears and orcs, mostly. Apparently they were being directed by some humans, however, which would make it quite odd.</string>
<string name="56281">At any rate, since Luskan is wrapped up in its own concerns, the countryside has become open season for banditry... these monsters, however, are more organized than is normal.</string>
<string name="56282">It&apos;s been rather boring standing around waiting for Aribeth to get her act together... I&apos;d rather be out looking for this cult, making a name for myself while I&apos;m at it.</string>
<string name="56283">I am Sharwyn, a bard brought here for no doubt the same purpose as you: to find these strange Words of Power.</string>
<string name="56284">South of Fort Ilkard there&apos;s supposed to be some ancient ruins... older than any settlement in the northlands by far, so the tales say.</string>
<string name="56285">It was supposedly once the home of a &apos;creator race&apos; that predates even the elves, if you can imagine that. I&apos;ve never heard of anyone returning from it, though, so it could be anything.</string>
<string name="56286">The magic power in the area is supposed to be incredible. There are stone monoliths which are too dangerous even to approach... which would give me even more reason to believe these Words may be there.</string>
<string name="56287">South of Fort Ilkard there&apos;s supposed to be some ancient ruins... older than any settlement in the northlands by far, so the tales say.</string>

<string name="56289">The magic power in the area is supposed to be incredible. There are stone monoliths which are too dangerous even to approach... which would give me even more reason to believe these Words may be there.</string>
<string name="56290">I find that hard to believe, somehow. You strike me as a bard, much like myself. Are you claiming that you have no wish to create you own legend similar to those you&apos;ve heard your entire life?</string>
<string name="56291">I&apos;d say not to hold your breath. With everyone dropping like flies in this city, the only opportunity for employment is as a gravedigger or charlatan.</string>
<string name="56292">You don&apos;t strike me as either of those. Why not tell me what you&apos;re really here for?</string>
<string name="56293">Is that so? Then I shall have to re-form my impression of you. Who are you, then, that you have coin to spare on hiring help?</string>
<string name="56294">Fair enough. Perhaps I should introduce myself, first, then.</string>
<string name="56295">Hah! No, you didn&apos;t. I would be willing to bet, however, that were you of a mind to do so... well, you wouldn&apos;t regret it.</string>
<string name="56296">But let&apos;s not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Perhaps a proper introduction is in order, yes?</string>
<string name="56297">What other way is there to be? Should I be fawning and squeal at the sight of every mouse? Shall I hang onto your shoulder and beg for protection?</string>
<string name="56298">I know what I want and I know what I like when I see it. Such as you... you&apos;re a fine-looking &lt;race&gt; man. We could make a fine team, you and I.</string>
<string name="56299">I know what I want and I seek it out. We could make a fine team, you and I... if you&apos;re of a mind. Don&apos;t try and deny it.</string>
<string name="56300">Surprise, surprise, I don&apos;t care what you think. I&apos;ve endured worse scorn from better, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, and survived.</string>
<string name="56301">Thank you. You&apos;re not the typical sort of &lt;man/woman&gt; yourself, are you?</string>
<string name="56302">So you did. I expect to be answered first before I say anything. Does that bother you?</string>
<string name="56303">Duty, is it? I can appreciate that, a little... but I know far too well where duty can take you. I shook off those notions long ago.</string>
<string name="56304">You are the one who asked, &lt;FirstName&gt;. No matter how you might disapprove of what I think, however, your mission holds great possibility for me.</string>
<string name="56305">True enough. Adventure can lead to death or obscurity... one can never tell for sure.</string>
<string name="56306">I don&apos;t believe you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I might fail, it&apos;s true, but whether you like it or not your path holds great possibility for me.</string>
<string name="56307">I do not exaggerate, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know what I speak of well enough. There are many ways to die that don&apos;t leave a corpse... whether you agree with me or not.</string>
<string name="56308">You do? Yes, I&apos;d expect your life is just about as far from normal as one can walk, isn&apos;t it? You understand whereof I speak.</string>
<string name="56309">Death, &lt;FirstName&gt;... or as good as it, anyway. There are many ways to die that don&apos;t leave a corpse.</string>
<string name="56310">If you wish, I&apos;ll tell you a tale, sometime... about my family, and how I became what I am today.</string>
<string name="56311">You&apos;ll probably be bored to tears, as I&apos;m certainly not the stuff of legends yet... but it&apos;s up to you.</string>
<string name="56312">Well, that&apos;s entirely up to you. We need not speak at all, if you don&apos;t wish to, correct?</string>
<string name="56313">Fair enough. Let&apos;s get back to your escapade, shall we?</string>
<string name="56314">No... I&apos;m not in the mood to tell you that tale just yet. Of legends and fairy tales, certainly... but I only tell stories about myself when I&apos;m ready.</string>
<string name="56315">I&apos;m sure there&apos;s plenty to keep us busy, correct? Lead on, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="56316">Well, fine, have it your way. We needn&apos;t talk at all, I&apos;m sure. Let&apos;s just continue with whatever you were doing.</string>
<string name="56317">I suppose I did offer to tell you about my family, didn&apos;t I? Very well then, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I&apos;ll tell you.</string>
<string name="56318">By my family, I actually mean my mother. She&apos;s the only true family I&apos;ve ever known. I never met my father... he and my mother parted ways before I was born.</string>
<string name="56319">Mother was an adventurer, you see... a mage, in fact, of some skill. This is what other people have told me, however, as Mother would never discuss it. She left that life behind, along with my father, to marry a man of wealth.</string>
<string name="56320">As I said, Mother wouldn&apos;t discuss it. She had far more important considerations, after all, than any adventuring &apos;nonsense&apos;.</string>
<string name="56321">Perhaps not now, but I didn&apos;t know any better then. My mother considered her past &apos;nonsense&apos;, as she had much more important things to think about.</string>
<string name="56322">Oh, yes, certainly she did. My mother was preoccupied with her common sense, and considered only one thing truly important.</string>
<string name="56323">My mother wanted wealth. She wanted to live a life of fine jewelry, of carriage rides and a fine mansion in Blacklake. Her husband was a means to an end.</string>
<string name="56324">She left behind her magic and, instead, spent her life spending money. Far more money than my step-father could ever afford. She didn&apos;t care a whit for his complaints so long as he kept providing her coin.</string>
<string name="56325">When he died unexpectedly, she was devastated. Not because he was gone, but because he left behind a mountain of debts. She was terrified at the thought of being poor.</string>
<string name="56326">I never really knew him, to be honest. My mother kept me quite distant, shuttled from one private school to another.</string>
<string name="56327">Terrible? Maybe so. Once you&apos;ve entered that life of luxury and idleness, however, it&apos;s hard to believe that anything exists outside of it.</string>
<string name="56328">Certainly not. My mother had left that behind, after all. Once you&apos;ve lived a life of luxury, it is difficult to believe that anything exists beyond it anymore.</string>
<string name="56329">She formed a desperate plan. Although she rarely saw me when I was a child, now she had need of me... I was a comely young woman, and she would see me wed to a wealthy bachelor.</string>
<string name="56330">Not for my benefit, of course, but for her own. I was so meek and accustomed to being ruled by her, I couldn&apos;t even conceive of an objection.</string>
<string name="56331">My mother had her eye on the young Lord Farthingdon. He would never stoop to marry poor nobility, however... not unless he desired me. I would have to seduce him.</string>
<string name="56332">I had intended to. I went to Lord Farthingdon&apos;s estate to attend a party being held in his honor, my mother meaning us to meet.</string>
<string name="56333">When we arrived, I was awestruck at the size of the hall. There were so many people dancing I could barely take it all in... and the music was so beautiful.</string>
<string name="56334">I stepped onto the floor and approached the man my mother pointed out. I was very nervous, but the man was handsome and kind and witty. I fell in love with him immediately.</string>
<string name="56335">My mother grabbed me away from him angrily not long later. I had mistaken her directions... it was not Lord Farthingdon I had danced with, after all. It was far too late for my heart, however.</string>
<string name="56336">My mother thought I should have, obviously. She scolded me soundly. I was in complete bliss, however. I couldn&apos;t stop thinking about that man.</string>
<string name="56337">She was furious, naturally, since I never got to meet Lord Farthingdon. She was even worse when it was discovered who I had met.</string>
<string name="56338">His name was Dannen... a penniless apprentice bard in the service of Lord Farthingdon. I was utterly in love with him.</string>
<string name="56339">My mother told me to forget all about him. I couldn&apos;t, however, despite the possibility that we might lose everything.</string>
<string name="56340">You sound like my mother. Our fate rested on my shoulders, she said... it was all on me, and I had a duty to attend to.</string>
<string name="56341">I was young and blind and hopeless. I fell for the first man who showed interest in me... not that my mother intended for that to stop us.</string>
<string name="56342">I had a choice, obviously. Take the path I was expected to and seduce Lord Farthingdon. Or run off with the penniless bard.</string>
<string name="56343">I should have done one or the other. As it turned out, I made a mess of everything. Being a young fool, I suppose that could be expected.</string>
<string name="56344">I&apos;ll tell you what happened sometime later, perhaps. Let&apos;s just continue on with what you were doing, shall we?</string>
<string name="56345">You want to hear the rest of the tale about my ill-fated affair, do you? I suppose there&apos;s no harm in it.</string>
<string name="56346">I should have run off with Dannen... or turned him aside completely. I did neither, as I was unwilling to disobey my mother. Instead, I seduced Lord Farthingdon as she wished... and loved my bard in secret. </string>
<string name="56347">Dannen was kind to me. He enthralled me with his music and I adored him. Lord Farthingdon, on the other hand, was merely lustful and possessive... and my mother was overjoyed.</string>
<string name="56348">No, that&apos;s true. These things are bound to come to a bad end, of course, and I wish I had known that.</string>
<string name="56349">It was easier by far to give everyone what they wished. Lord Farthingdon wished a wife, my mother wished me to get married, and Dannen loved me.</string>
<string name="56350">They do. In fact, I would be willing to wager that the most heinous crimes have been committed in the name of love.</string>
<string name="56351">As the date of my marriage to Lord Farthingdon grew closer, he began to suspect that something was amiss. I spent far too much time away from him and in Dannen&apos;s arms.</string>
<string name="56352">It was all my mother could do to convince him that I was true to his love... and it was she who finally discovered me in the arms of my bard.</string>
<string name="56353">She had the guards chase him away, but they weren&apos;t able to kill him. That didn&apos;t stop me from loving him, either.</string>
<string name="56354">Of course not. She was still my mother, after all. She sent the guards after Dannen, but he escaped... and to her chagrin, I still loved him.</string>
<string name="56355">To say the least. My mother was horrified beyond belief and sent the guards chasing after Dannen. He escaped, thankfully, and I was undeterred.</string>
<string name="56356">Mother turned on me then, and forbade me to see Dannen ever again. I was to marry Lord Farthingdon and that was all there was to it.</string>
<string name="56357">I refused, at first. I loved Dannen and nothing else mattered. So she begged me... that proud woman got on her knees with tears in her eyes and begged me not to abandon her to poverty.</string>
<string name="56358">I could do as I was expected: save my mother and marry a man whom I did not love... or I could run off into the unknown with Dannen.</string>
<string name="56359">I struggled with the decision, for I had never had to make up my own mind... but the thought of that dreary life with Lord Farthingdon frightened me so. I chose Dannen.</string>
<string name="56360">Lord Farthingdon was outraged. He tried to have Dannen and me executed, and we were forced to flee with not a copper between us.</string>
<string name="56361">My mother was crushed. She was turned out from noble society as she feared, and lost everything to repay my step-father&apos;s debt.</string>
<string name="56362">How could I not do it? My mother had ruled me for all of my life... but this one thing I could not do for her. It was not easy to do, however.</string>
<string name="56363">I still dreaded the thought of leaving my mother behind. I would have done anything to please her... but not this one thing. I would not give up my life.</string>
<string name="56364">I fled from Neverwinter with Dannen and we traveled far, and he taught me how to become a bard in my own right. I did not return home for many years... until recently, in fact.</string>
<string name="56365">It was an odd feeling to discover that Lord Farthingdon had lost his own fortune years ago and both he and his household were now dead from the plague. That was the fate that had awaited me.</string>
<string name="56366">And my mother... I have only been to see her once since my return.</string>
<string name="56367">She has lived all these years as a poor seamstress, it seems, bitter and blaming me for the poor luck which had befallen her.</string>
<string name="56368">We said little to each other, as she ordered me out of her leaky cottage. I did find out one thing, however: she is dying.</string>
<string name="56369">She suffers from bonerot... a disease which would require the attention of several clerics for a month to heal normally. With the plague, however, no one can help her... though I have tried in vain to find one who can.</string>
<string name="56370">I... don&apos;t know, really. I do not feel the need for her forgiveness, but nor am I angry at her. My mother is what she is.</string>
<string name="56371">Perhaps you could, &lt;FirstName&gt;... though it is nothing that would require a great deal of time.</string>
<string name="56372">I know of only one sure cure for bonerot... an extract from a flower that it is said can only be grown on the fabled cliffs of Mount Celestia.</string>
<string name="56373">Finding such a potion would be difficult, I have no doubt. It is my hope to find one, however, and save my mother&apos;s life. I do not owe her, really, but I... would like to do this one thing for her, now.</string>
<string name="56374">There is no more to the story, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My mother is dying. I hope to find the potion she needs and save her life... it is just something I have to do.</string>
<string name="56375">It... it is, indeed. How you came across something that can only be made on another plane, however... well, I won&apos;t question it.</string>
<string name="56376">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;ll have this sent to Mother as soon as possible. You&apos;ve made me feel much better.</string>
<string name="56377">Here, take this. It is a belt that belonged to Dannen that I&apos;ve saved. I want you to have it... hopefully it will serve you well.</string>
<string name="56378">It might not look like much, but Dannen himself told me of its strange origin and claimed it to have considerable power.</string>
<string name="56379">I am not very used to kindness from others, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will not forget this. Let us... just proceed with your mission, now.</string>
<string name="56380">Perhaps we will, though I doubt it. Let&apos;s get on with your mission, &lt;FirstName&gt;... there are others who are sick whom we are far more likely to save.</string>
<string name="56381">To be honest, I do not have my hopes up. There are far more sick folk whom we are more likely to save... let us continue.</string>
<string name="56382">I&apos;d prefer not to, right now. We have more important things to do, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="56383">Mine is no great tale, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you like, I could tell you of my beginnings as a bard.</string>
<string name="56384">Well, let&apos;s see. I learned the majority of my trade from Dannen, my partner and my love. It was he who took me away from Neverwinter and my family.</string>
<string name="56385">I could tell you all manner of legends and fables, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I save that talk for the taverns where I can be properly paid.</string>
<string name="56386">Fair enough.</string>
<string name="56387">Is that your clumsy way of saying you like the way I look?</string>
<string name="56388">No thanks. I prefer a larger audience for that sort of thing. Also, I am not here to keep you entertained, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="56389">You&apos;re joking, right? You&apos;re not my type, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and let&apos;s just leave it at that. Do you want to hear my story or not?</string>
<string name="56390">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You really aren&apos;t my type, however, sorry. Do you want to hear my story or not?</string>
<string name="56391">I&apos;m not offended, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am also not interested. Now... do you want to hear my story or not?</string>
<string name="56392">You&apos;re cute, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I&apos;ll give you that much. Now do you want to hear my story or not?</string>
<string name="56393">Oh... where do I begin? Ha ha! Don&apos;t be offended, &lt;FirstName&gt;... you&apos;re not so bad, I suppose.</string>
<string name="56394">That&apos;s sweet of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m not a girl who falls for simple flattery, though.</string>
<string name="56395">I&apos;m not offended. It was sweet of you to say, I suppose, though I&apos;m not a girl who falls for flattery.</string>
<string name="56396">Now then... do you want to hear my story or not?</string>
<string name="56397">We were a team, a singing duo who earned our keep in taverns, traveling from town to town along the Sword Coast.</string>
<string name="56398">We would camp off the roads and I would listen in awe as Dannen told me the old legends by the firelight. I loved him more as each night passed.</string>
<string name="56399">An excellent question. At the time, I didn&apos;t think anything could separate us. He was my first, you see, and my belief in our love was absolute.</string>
<string name="56400">Even the greatest of love stories hide within them tragedies and heartache. I certainly did not expect such... my belief in my young love was absolute.</string>
<string name="56401">Oh, there were obstacles to overcome. Foul weather, bandits... any number of mishaps along the way. We had each other, however.</string>
<string name="56402">It turned out that those times were the best. I should have cherished them more, for things were quickly about to get much worse.</string>
<string name="56403">The fateful day came when we crossed into Amn in the south. We received a rather sudden and unexpected invitation to sing before one of the wealthiest courts in Athkatla.</string>
<string name="56404">Well... Dannen was positive that our long months of playing in taverns had caught someone&apos;s attention, that we were being rewarded. He was overjoyed.</string>
<string name="56405">Myself, I was hesitant. I was not so sure of our abilities, so questioning the motives behind the invitation was far easier.</string>
<string name="56406">I urged Dannen to ignore the invitation, but naturally he would have none of it. It was the beginning of the end for us, really, though I did not know it. Perhaps it is a story I shall tell you some time.</string>
<string name="56407">The tale is a bit unusual... our love did not end in the usual way, I&apos;d wager. Though you need not hear it at all, I care not.</string>
<string name="56408">I didn&apos;t promise anything. Perhaps I&apos;ll tell you about it... perhaps not. We shall see.</string>
<string name="56409">No, I&apos;ve had enough of that story for now. I&apos;m not in the mood, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="56410">Come, let us adventure more. It will lift my spirits some, I think.</string>
<string name="56411">Hmm... I had just mentioned the invitation from Athkatla, hadn&apos;t I? Yes, that&apos;s right. We went, though I had a sense of foreboding the entire way.</string>
<string name="56412">The City of Coin lived up to its name. It was a golden, bustling place that rivalled even the great Waterdeep. The palace we arrived at was larger than any building I had ever seen.</string>
<string name="56413">Dannen assured me that we would find our fortune there, and for a while I thought he might be right. We were to play before the fabulously wealthy Lord and Lady Onaris, and all seemed well.</string>
<string name="56414">Perhaps, though we were nowhere near its worst sections. We were welcomed into a world of wealth and luxury, with everything we desired delivered by eager slaves.</string>
<string name="56415">That was my question, certainly, and not one that anybody seemed able to answer. The slaves doted on us, yet simply stared blankly when asked anything.</string>
<string name="56416">Nothing went wrong, at first. Dannen and I were pampered and prepared for our performance, and it went off without any problems.</string>
<string name="56417">We sang in a great hall before several hundred nobles. It still takes my breath away to think about it... and the applause for our duet was thunderous.</string>
<string name="56418">I remember being exhilarated and pleased, as Dannen was. It was then that the Lord and Lady Onaris came to greet us in person.</string>
<string name="56419">Lord Onaris was a fat and simple man who seemed bored. The Lady, however... she was an exotic beauty. Violet eyes, elfin features, an astounding gown; every man watched as she passed.</string>
<string name="56420">Next to Lady Onaris, I might as well have been the homeliest hobgoblin you can imagine. She had a presence... and Dannen noticed it, too.</string>
<string name="56421">I would have hoped not. I would have hoped that love meant something, but Dannen didn&apos;t fail to notice her charms, that was certain.</string>
<string name="56422">Of course I asked why we were invited. Lady Onaris ignored me and fawned over Dannen, saying how she had spotted him in a lovely tavern in Beregost and had wanted to meet him.</string>
<string name="56423">I had been in Beregost, too, of course... but I was completely ignored. She cooed over Dannen and he was flushed with pleasure at the attention. He agreed readily to a year-long contract to perform.</string>
<string name="56424">Of course I was not happy about it. Dannen calmed me later and assured me there was nothing to worry about. Nothing could have been further from the truth.</string>
<string name="56425">You think I didn&apos;t fight for Dannen? Of course I did. Things weren&apos;t exactly as they seemed, however.</string>
<string name="56426">Perhaps. Perhaps not. I fought for Dannen, but things weren&apos;t as they seemed.</string>
<string name="56427">Not right away. I fought for him... I thought our love would endure. Things weren&apos;t exactly as they seemed, however.</string>
<string name="56428">That is a tale I&apos;ll continue at another time, however. I tire of thinking about Dannen, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Let&apos;s do something else.</string>
<string name="56429">Very well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I had already told you we&apos;d met the Lady Onaris, correct? That she&apos;d fawned all over Dannen, but he&apos;d assured me there was nothing to fear?</string>
<string name="56430">Well, we were bound by contract now to perform... so we did. We did so well, too. It was not long before we the toast of Athkatla, praised by the Lord and Lady Onaris at every turn.</string>
<string name="56431">Nobles showered us with attention and gifts at every turn. Everyone wanted us to perform for them next. I was a bit dazzled by it all... but also concerned.</string>
<string name="56432">Lady Onaris continued to lavish attention on Dannen. She called him to private performances... without me... and he was spellbound, despite my efforts to distract him.</string>
<string name="56433">Leave him? I couldn&apos;t conceive of such a thing. He was my world... and the longer I spent without him, the lonelier I felt.</string>
<string name="56434">I prayed that it was not so. I suspected, but could prove nothing. The servants were too good at misdirecting me, subtly keeping me from interrupting their &apos;privacy&apos;.</string>
<string name="56435">I couldn&apos;t even find them, to tell the truth. The palace was a maze, and the servants too adept at subtly keeping me from locating their mistress. I did try, futilely.</string>
<string name="56436">Desperate and angry, I accused Dannen of succumbing to her lust. He denied it, denied it angrily... and I believed him. Almost.</string>
<string name="56437">After one of our largest concerts, I followed Dannen as he left the stage. I used what magic I knew to disguise myself, avoiding the servants and keeping pace with him.</string>
<string name="56438">I felt terribly guilty for the deception, hoping against hope that my suspicions were for naught. Of course I was disappointed.</string>
<string name="56439">I watched invisibly as Dannen made his rendezvous with Lady Onaris, laying fevered kisses upon her and saying how every minute they were apart was excrutiating to him.</string>
<string name="56440">Don&apos;t be foolish. They weren&apos;t keeping it secret from *me*. They were keeping it secret from Lord Onaris. He likely could have cared less, but appearances had to be maintained.</string>
<string name="56441">You are right. If I had had any sense, I would have left. I was young and in love, however... and that leaves no room for sense.</string>
<string name="56442">It crossed my mind, as I stood there. I also thought of killing her. I also thought of killing myself. I was betrayed, bewildered and heart-broken all at once.</string>
<string name="56443">In my shock, I must have dropped my spell, for the Lady Onaris spotted me. She did not care... she only laughed lightly and pointed me out to Dannen. He merely looked at me and smiled.</string>
<string name="56444">I merely stood there dumbfounded as Dannen called me a foolish little girl. Pathetic, even. Not only did he prefer Lady Onaris... but he had *never* loved me.</string>
<string name="56445">I fled, their mocking laughter ringing in my ears. I fled them, I fled Athkatla... and I have never been back.</string>
<string name="56446">That&apos;s sweet of you to say, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I doubt that&apos;s the case. As I said... not everything was as it seemed.</string>
<string name="56447">I... that is, I... th-thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I don&apos;t know what to say.</string>
<string name="56448">While your intentions are... are sweet, I doubt that would be the case. As I said, not everything was as it seemed.</string>
<string name="56449">I was young, a fool and in love. I should have known better, obviously. As I said, however, things were not as they seemed.</string>
<string name="56450">Yes, I was devastated. I had left the security of my family to make Dannen my world, and it had crumbled around me. As I said, however, things were not as they seemed.</string>
<string name="56451">Hah! Were I as cynical as I am now... or as you are... things would never have reached that point to begin with. I was a fool. As I said before, however, everything was not as it seemed.</string>
<string name="56452">I found out much later that Lady Onaris&apos;s beauty was the result of an enchantment... a glamer. She had spellbound Dannen in the literal sense.</string>
<string name="56453">I have also discovered that a lock of nymph&apos;s hair will break her spell. Dannen will be released... and her glamour will end. She will revert to her natural appearance: old and fat, so I hear.</string>
<string name="56454">No. The hurt was too real, even if the glamour wasn&apos;t. At some level, I would always blame him for... not being strong enough. It doesn&apos;t matter.</string>
<string name="56455">Yes, so the story goes, at any rate. He has been a famous bard in Athkatla for years, and she is still his patron. A fairy tale that will end one day.</string>
<string name="56456">Dannen wasn&apos;t strong enough to resist the spell... I will always blame him for that, a little. I would like to free him. Then he can decide for himself whether to stay with her... based on the truth, not an illusion.</string>
<string name="56457">Everyone should be allowed their little illusions, perhaps. I admit that it would give me some small satisfaction to remove her spell once and for all.</string>
<string name="56458">All it will take is finding that nymph&apos;s hair. One day, perhaps, I shall discover some.</string>
<string name="56459">I returned to Neverwinter, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and that&apos;s all there is to it. One day I shall find my lock of nymph&apos;s hair and I shall have my satisfaction.</string>
<string name="56460">That is nymph&apos;s hair isn&apos;t it? You are a marvel, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Dannen will be freed and Lady Onaris revealed for the fat old woman she is.</string>
<string name="56461">Or is that what I want? I have been looking forward to this for some time, but I fail to feel any excitement over it.</string>
<string name="56462">I believe you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It doesn&apos;t matter... we have more important things to do, here.</string>
<string name="56463">I&apos;m not. I actually hadn&apos;t thought about Dannen, much, until I told you the story. Come... let&apos;s return to your task.</string>
<string name="56464">I... don&apos;t know, really. Maybe. Come on... let&apos;s get back to your mission, shall we?</string>
<string name="56465">You&apos;re right. Of course you&apos;re right. I&apos;ve held onto this for too long, &lt;FirstName&gt;... it&apos;s time to let it go.</string>
<string name="56466">No. No, I suppose that&apos;s true. I&apos;m not part of his life anymore, nor would I want to be.</string>
<string name="56467">Hmm. The spell may have worn off... and maybe it was really his choice. But what if it wasn&apos;t? I suppose I owe him that much, at least.</string>
<string name="56468">Hmph. You&apos;re right about that, I guess. Who knows what other mischief she&apos;s performed with that enchantment? Best put a stop to it now.</string>
<string name="56469">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I wish I had something more to thank you with. Maybe I&apos;ll think of something later. Let&apos;s go on, shall we?</string>
<string name="56470">Not right now, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Later, perhaps.</string>
<string name="56471">I normally save my best tales for taverns with a full audience. Why should I recount a tale only for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="56472">Oh-ho? So &lt;FirstName&gt; puts on a pleasant tone, and I am supposed to jump to please &lt;him/her&gt;, is that it? Ha ha!</string>
<string name="56473">I see, I see. So the tough &lt;man/woman&gt; snaps &lt;his/her&gt; fingers, and I better shape up, is that it? Ha ha!</string>
<string name="56474">Pay me? You think I do it for the coin I receive in a tavern, such as it is? Certainly not. I do it for the audience!</string>
<string name="56475">Oh? Now you&apos;re trying to sweet talk me, are you? You men are all alike. Butter your words a bit and expect a woman&apos;s knees to fold.</string>
<string name="56476">Mmmm... tempting, I must admit. Perhaps I should ask you to remove your tunic while I talk, so we could be equal? Ha ha!</string>
<string name="56477">I&apos;ll tell you what, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;ll tell you your tale... if you promise to listen attentively and be a proper audience.</string>
<string name="56478">Ha ha! I&apos;m surprised you even asked in the first place, then. Why you think I would waste breath on someone who can&apos;t listen is beyond me.</string>
<string name="56479">So fair enough, then... let&apos;s continue the creation of your own tale, yes?</string>
<string name="56480">Impatient, are we? I&apos;ll take that as an agreement, then, and I&apos;ll hold you to it.</string>
<string name="56481">Well, that&apos;s good! I&apos;ll hold you to it, then.</string>
<string name="56482">But what story should I tell, then? Shall I tell a tale of the great &lt;FirstName&gt;, savior of Neverwinter, and &lt;his/her&gt; search for the Words of Power?</string>
<string name="56483">Not like I tell it, believe me. You&apos;re probably right, however... the subject matter would be a bit familiar, and I&apos;m a bit fuzzy on the ending.</string>
<string name="56484">Hmm. How about the sad tale of the great Lady Aribeth? Torn between love and honor, fallen from the grace of Tyr?</string>
<string name="56485">You never said you wanted to hear a comedy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Aribeth&apos;s is a sad tale... but no matter, I&apos;ll think of something else.</string>
<string name="56486">That&apos;s true, isn&apos;t it? Too bad... hers is a sad tale that itches to be told. Let&apos;s see... I&apos;ll think of something else.</string>
<string name="56487">You are right. I apologize... it was not my intent to make light of the Lady. Hers is a sad tale that begs to be told, but I will think of something else.</string>
<string name="56488">How about a tale of the great Lord Nasher? How the man was in his glory days, before he became a sad, old ruler?</string>
<string name="56489">You&apos;re going to be picky, are you? Very well, then... give me some time to think about it. For now, let&apos;s continue with the making of your own tale.</string>
<string name="56490">All right. I&apos;ve thought about which story to tell you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is an old one... the story of Tamorlyn and the Song of Love.</string>
<string name="56491">Shush. You promised to be a good audience, as I recall, so be quiet.</string>
<string name="56492">I&apos;m so happy you approve. Now, since you promised to be a good audience, be quiet for once.</string>
<string name="56493">Tamorlyn was an elven bard, one of the most talented and famous from an age ago. At the peak of his life he was happily married with numerous children... yet still he felt he had left something undone.</string>
<string name="56494">He bid his children a tearful farewell one day, hugging his faithful wife close to his breast and promised to return as he began the greatest quest of his long life.</string>
<string name="56495">For decades he searched for Hanali Celanil, the elven goddess of love. He called to her from her temples, walked the fields of Arvandor, serenaded her from the highest mountaintops.</string>
<string name="56496">Just when he thought he could search no more, and his thoughts turned to his long-lost wife and children, Hanali Celanil came to him at long last.</string>
<string name="56497">She was the most beautiful of elves, her eyes warm and clad in a gown of silver and gold. &quot;Thou hast sought me out,&quot; she spoke, &quot;and I have come. What dost thou desire of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="56498">Tamorlyn was almost overcome by her beauty, but still he spoke. &quot;Hanali Celanil,&quot; he said, &quot;also called Lady Goldheart, the Winsome Rose, the Mother of Sadness. I wish a boon.&quot;</string>
<string name="56499">&quot;I desire to know the true meaning of love, so that I may write a song to stir the hearts of mortal and immortal alike. Would you grant me this boon?&quot;</string>
<string name="56500">The goddess thought on his offer and smiled. &quot;I am the Three Who Are One, child. Perform a task for each of us and you shall know the true meaning of love... and be rewarded.&quot;</string>
<string name="56501">Yes. The Queen of Arvandor is the elven goddess Angharradh... but she is commonly thought of as three goddesses, three aspects who together are the One, the Triune.</string>
<string name="56502">One, of course, is Hanali Celanil... goddess of love and the gold elves. One is Aerdrie Faenya, goddess of the sky and the winged avariel. The third is Sehanine Moonbow, goddess of dreams and the moon elves.</string>
<string name="56503">Tamorlyn readily agreed to perform the tasks, of course. That, however, I&apos;ll tell you another time... seeing as you interrupted and all.</string>
<string name="56504">Ha ha! To be honest, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I&apos;ve forgotten how part of the story goes. Let&apos;s just keep moving... I&apos;ll remember the rest eventually.</string>
<string name="56505">True. That does show you were listening, at least. To be honest, I&apos;ve forgotten how the rest goes. Not to worry... I&apos;ll remember the rest eventually.</string>
<string name="56506">Good enough. I can tell the rest of the tale when we get a chance, later.</string>
<string name="56507">Fair enough. I think I remember how the rest of it goes, now. I told you that Tamorlyn had agreed to do a task for each of the Triune, correct?</string>
<string name="56508">The first task was for Aerdrie Faenya. He was to retrieve the feather of the largest phoenix to fly the skies of the deep southern lands.</string>
<string name="56509">For many long years Tamorlyn would scour the highest peaks of Turmish and Chondath, following the legends of the great birds, yet never spotting them.</string>
<string name="56510">A century of harship would pass before finally Tamorlyn would return to that northern mountain, ragged but triumphantly holding the pinion feather of a great phoenix.</string>
<string name="56511">For Sehanine Moonbow he would seek out remnants of each of our three moons that had fallen to the ground in a blaze of fire.</string>
<string name="56512">Another century he would spend in search of them... long-buried, long-forgotten and scattered. Finally, with tears in his eyes, he returned with the three rock shards in his hands.</string>
<string name="56513">For Hanali Celanil he would seek the golden heart of a dragon dead of simple age... one of the rarest things someone could seek. He wailed at the thought but was determined.</string>
<string name="56514">For centuries he wandered, following rumor after rumor, until finally he came into the northern lands when he heard of a wizened wyrm breathing his last.</string>
<string name="56515">Tamorlyn spent many years finding the creature and then befriending him, singing to the aged dragon as he weakened slowly through the decades.</string>
<string name="56516">When at last the great beast passed, Tamorlyn was saddened... but also overjoyed that at last his quest was at an end.</string>
<string name="56517">Before Tamorlyn could return to the goddess, however, he was found by one of his own people. He was told the sad news that his beloved wife and children had died of a terrible illness during his absence.</string>
<string name="56518">Torn by the news, Tamorlyn wept and railed with anger at the goddess who had kept him from his family for so long. She did not answer.</string>
<string name="56519">Tamorlyn poured his grief and his pain and his loss into a song. Since he could not sing of love, he would sing of this... sing of all that he had missed. And this is what he sang to the goddess.</string>
<string name="56520">And finally Hanali Celanil came, with tears flowing from her golden eyes. &quot;You understand at last the meaning of love, child,&quot; she said. &quot;As I promised, you shall be rewarded.&quot;</string>
<string name="56521">With that, she lifted Tamorlyn up through the gates of Arvandor to join his wife and children, to spend eternity with them in paradise. And that is the end.</string>
<string name="56522">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m glad you enjoyed it.</string>
<string name="56523">There&apos;s always a critic, isn&apos;t there? I&apos;m surprised you could sit through the whole thing... if you even listened to it all.</string>
<string name="56524">I... I don&apos;t know. I think love is different for everyone. You have to decide for yourself what you love most, what it means to you.</string>
<string name="56525">Well... I don&apos;t know how much of that legend might be true, but I know there&apos;s some truth to it. There really was an elven bard named Tamorlyn... and he really did die in this region.</string>
<string name="56526">I don&apos;t know, &lt;FirstName&gt;. To tell it true, I don&apos;t know. Love and I... have never gotten along very well.</string>
<string name="56527">Maybe in the future, who knows? But I don&apos;t want to think about that just yet. I hope you understand.</string>
<string name="56528">Supposedly, he actually did write a song before he died... or so the rumors say. He was one of the greatest bards that ever lived, that song would have to be a masterpiece.</string>
<string name="56529">To get my hands on it... to have a chance to sing it, to bring it to the world. That would be everything, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="56530">My tale&apos;s done, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As I said, though, there&apos;s supposedly some truth to it... wouldn&apos;t it be wonderful to actually find Tamorlyn&apos;s lost song?</string>
<string name="56531">You&apos;re probably right. I won&apos;t keep my hopes up, but you never know.</string>
<string name="56532">That&apos;s true. Who knows if it would still be in good condition, even... but I can always dream. That&apos;s what being a bard is all about.</string>
<string name="56533">It... it&apos;s written in elven, and... and the notes are... oh my! That... that&apos;s Tamorlyn&apos;s signature! This is it, this is it, &lt;FirstName&gt;! How did you ever find it?!</string>
<string name="56534">It... it&apos;s lovely. He truly was a master. I... I almost thought it was a fairy tale, that it couldn&apos;t be true, but it is, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="56535">I&apos;m not sure. I want to sing it... I want to spread it just like Tamorlyn intended it to be, I think. Perhaps I&apos;ll sing it to the elves, first, who knows?</string>
<string name="56536">Yes, I suppose sometimes they are. Oh... I can&apos;t wait to sing this to a proper audience, to spread it just as Tamorlyn intended it to be.</string>
<string name="56537">It&apos;s not just a song, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s much more than that! I can&apos;t wait to sing it... to spread it&apos;s word just as Tamorlyn intended.</string>
<string name="56538">I&apos;m not sure how I can ever repay you for this gift, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I... I hope my friendship will be enough... </string>
<string name="56539">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I want you to know that I&apos;ve no intention of running out on you... the song can wait. Your mission comes first.</string>
<string name="56540">Then I&apos;ll repay you some other way, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m not going anywhere... I&apos;ll continue to help you to the end, I promise.</string>
<string name="56541">No, of course not. The song can wait... I&apos;ll help you in your mission until the end, I promise.</string>
<string name="56542">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I... oh, you are so sweet. I don&apos;t want to hurt you, I just... don&apos;t feel the same way. I hope you can understand.</string>
<string name="56543">I certainly don&apos;t intend to leave your side... unless you want me to go. The song can wait, I&apos;ll help you with the quest until the end, I promise.</string>
<string name="56544">You do? I... I would like that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know there are more important things to do right now, but once this is all over... I&apos;d like that very much.</string>
<string name="56545">The song can wait... I&apos;ll stand by your side until this is over, and once it is... well, we&apos;ll see what happens then. I do adore you, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I want you to know that.</string>
<string name="56546">Let&apos;s go and end this, then, and find your Words of Power. The end of our great tale awaits us!</string>
<string name="56547">Perhaps later, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but now isn&apos;t the time. We must hurry if we&apos;re to find the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="56548">The cult could be practically anywhere, that&apos;s true. I can think of a few places where chances might be greater of finding them, however.</string>
<string name="56549">I&apos;ve heard more than a few tales in the past weeks about monsters raiding the roads near the Green Griffon Inn.</string>
<string name="56550">Bugbears and orcs, mostly. Apparently they were being directed by some humans, however, which would make them odd.</string>
<string name="56551">At any rate, since Luskan is wrapped up in its own concerns, the countryside has become open season for banditry... these monsters, however, are more organized than is normal.</string>
<string name="56552">Maybe the cult is behind it, who knows? Either way, Mutamin has been crying a blue streak about the threat to his precious contest.</string>
<string name="56553">It&apos;s not very well-known, but apparently the owner of the Green Griffon Inn holds some big contest every few years. The winner gets quite rich.</string>
<string name="56554">Nobles flock from all over the place to watch, apparently... although not with the roads so dangerous, right? I wish I knew what it was all about.</string>
<string name="56555">There&apos;s lots of caves in the hills around the Green Griffon. I suggest you check them out... it&apos;s the only way to ferret out these creatures.</string>
<string name="56556">Beyond going and taking a look, I can&apos;t think of any other way to find this cult. Can you? I say we go.</string>
<string name="56557">All I can really offer, &lt;FirstName&gt;, is an old legend I heard once a long time ago.</string>
<string name="56558">South of Fort Ilkard there&apos;s supposed to be some ancient ruins... older than any settlement in the northlands by far, so the tales say.</string>
<string name="56559">It was supposedly once the home of a &apos;creator race&apos; that predates even the elves, if you can imagine that. I&apos;ve never heard of anyone returning from it, though, so it could be anything.</string>
<string name="56560">Well, the magic power in the area is supposed to be incredible. There are stone monoliths which are too dangerous even to approach.</string>
<string name="56561">That&apos;s all unreliable information, however, I know. The only way to tell for sure would be to investigate.</string>
<string name="56562">Balor Lord</string>

<string name="56580">Shield of Dawn</string>
<string name="56581">During the Time of Troubles, Lathander was disturbed with the number of undead walking the realms. To counter this, he taught several of his followers how to create these shields. The shields are now bestowed upon those clerics who show the greatest ability to hunt and destroy undead.</string>
<string name="56582">Shield of the Watch</string>
<string name="56583">This shield originated in the faraway Shaar, in the armory of a fighting brigade called &quot;The Watch.&quot; A group of warrior wemics, the goals of these half men, half lions were never fully disclosed. They were involved in extensive trading of weapons for information, however, and neighboring communities of the region learned to fear and avoid them. Distrust of the group may have been justified, as several nomadic human tribes of the region did disappear over time.</string>
<string name="56584">Greater Shield of Dawn</string>
<string name="56585">Greater Shield of the Watch</string>
<string name="56586">A cunning mind seems to have taken control of the wemic society in the Shaar, as they have now formed fighting brigades called &#8216;The Watch&#8217;. What plans this new leader may have can only be guessed at from the creation of the shields, that the elite warriors carry. The nomadic human tribes are beginning to grow wary, as several tribes have disappeared completely in the last year.</string>
<string name="56587">This parchment details the ingredients and cooking instructions for leaven bread, a delicacy particular to the city of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="56588">The band of this ring is covered with scripts and etchings in a strange foreign language.</string>
<string name="56589">At first glance this appears to be a tiny gem. However, the stone is warm to the touch and on closer inspection it appears to be a small seed.</string>
<string name="56590">This small, ragged piece of hide must have been torn from a dragon during a fierce battle. Though this bit of scale contains the remarkable strength and toughness of all dragon hide it is too small to be of any use in forging armor or the like.</string>
<string name="56591">This ring bears a mage symbol under which is carved the name Prophyro. Judging by the craftsmanship the ring appears to be of Lantanese origin.</string>
<string name="56592">This small white stone was given to you by the Lantanese sorcerer Boddyknock Glinckle to signify his allegiance to you and your cause.</string>
<string name="56593">This silver band is etched with the image of a bird soaring against a moonlit sky - likely a family crest from an obscure house. The ring is of little value.</string>
<string name="56594">This amulet is forged from black obsidian. The image of an elongated skull is etched onto either side.</string>
<string name="56595">This dried and withered hand is remarkably well preserved - a testament to the embalming techniques used on the owner, rather than an indication of any special magic.</string>
<string name="56596">This ornate dagger is chill to the touch and radiates a powerful aura of malignant magic. The hilt bears an engraving of an elongated skull.</string>
<string name="56597">This disc of cold black steel radiates a palpable aura of evil. The front bears the image of a cowled and faceless figure on the face. At first glance the back appears a blank void, but in certain light the hint of strange runes can be seen traced onto the surface.</string>
<string name="56598">This small red gem was given to you by Grimgnaw, the monk from the Order of the Long Death, to signify his allegiance to you and your cause.</string>
<string name="56599">Balor Lord Sword</string>
<string name="56600">Swordsman&#8217;s Belt</string>
<string name="56601">To honor those warriors who accomplish great deeds within the ranks of the Purple Dragon Knights, King Azoun IV had the Royal Magician Vangerdahast create these belts. His daughter, Alusair, now continues that tradition, occasionally offering these belts to entice proven adventurers into joining the ranks of the Purple Dragons.</string>
<string name="56602">Brawler&#8217;s Belt</string>
<string name="56603">The Dark Moon sect has a reputation for hardiness in the hand-to-hand combat challenges they hold annually. Unbeknownst to the other monastic orders, the Dark Moon sect has developed this belt which gives their champions an unfair advantage over their unenhanced brethren.</string>
<string name="56604">Archer&#8217;s Belt</string>
<string name="56605">Having felt the sting of Sundabar&#8217;s archers in too many raids, the orcs from the spine of the world were thrilled when King Obould Many-Arrows suggested that his shamans should create a belt to protect the most worthy and cunning warriors of the tribe. The contests to decide who gets each belt are now considered the highest form of entertainment in orc society.</string>

<string name="56615">Gloves of Concentration</string>
<string name="56616">As age began to creep up on him, Beregost Hamish found it difficult to concentrate while casting challenging spells. The gloves he developed relaxed his mind in even the direst of situations. Before he died, Beregost made a fortune selling replicas of the original gloves to others in his chosen profession.</string>
<string name="56617">Gloves of the Minstrel</string>
<string name="56618">Lendoku Mar&#8217;hael was reputed to be one of the best performers of his generation. When his son, Gardoku, proved to be of only middling talent, Lendoku commissioned the development of these performance enhancers. The mage who developed the gloves heard of Gardoku&#8217;s success and began selling similar gloves to Gardoku&#8217;s competitors. The mage died shortly thereafter, outside a pub owned by the Mar&#8217;hael family.</string>
<string name="56619">Gloves of Animal Handling</string>
<string name="56620">The nomad tribes of the Shaaryan peoples depend on their ability to control the wild horses of the plains for survival. The best animal handlers of the tribes use these special gloves that allow them a more direct link to the minds of the noble steeds. When raids on other tribes occur, scouts always have their eyes open, searching for a man with these impressive gloves.</string>
<string name="56621">Gloves of Spellcraft</string>
<string name="56622">In an effort to help stave off the expansion of the Mulhorand Theocracy, several Red Wizards of Thay worked together to create these gloves to assist the Magocracy that controls Unther. While the gloves assist mages in recognizing some of the powerful spells being cast, the superior numbers of the Mulhorand mages still gives them the advantage.</string>
<string name="56623">Gloves of Discipline</string>
<string name="56624">Tired of watching new recruits to the Silver Ravens fumble and drop their weapons during training, Miklos Selkirk hired a mage to develop a magic item to help their discipline. When the first recruit to don the gloves couldn&#8217;t be disarmed by the Silver Raven champion, Miklos knew he had something extraordinary.</string>
<string name="56625">Gloves of Swordplay</string>
<string name="56626">It was the infamous swashbuckler, Eisneid Clume who first requested magical assistance to help her parrying ability. She had been run through in seven duels before she had the gloves made. Once the gloves were in her possession, Eisneid won over thirty duels without a single scratch. Finally, word of her magical assets leaked out, and the level of swordplay in Hillsfar increased dramatically.</string>

<string name="56633">Amulet of Will +1</string>
<string name="56634">Jeraboam Cantor, a high ranking Harper, commissioned the creation of these amulets to help protect the minds and secrets of Harper spies. Unfortunately, Jeraboam was one of the first Harper spies caught wearing one, and when the amulet was removed, the bard&apos;s weak willed mind revealed everything he knew.</string>

<string name="56640">Under the direction of Druxus Rhym, these amulets are created by the Red Wizards of Thay and are sold in their enclaves across the realms. Cheap and easy to make, this magical protection from certain elements is a huge source of profit for the enclaves.</string>

<string name="56645">Created by the Bedine shaman for survival in the harsh climate of the Anauroch desert, Rings of Fortitude are gifts given to warriors who prove their worth in raids on other tribes. While the least powerful of these are fairly common, the more powerful and rare rings are generally owned by the sheik of a tribe.</string>

<string name="56650">Cloak of Protection vs Good</string>
<string name="56651">Before being murdered by a Harper spy, General Menthan Calcoler proposed to garb an entire Zhentarim army with these cloaks and march them into the Dales. When Menthan&#8217;s plan wasn&#8217;t implemented by his successor, the mages who created the cloaks sold them to the highest bidder in order to recoup their expenses.</string>
<string name="56652">Cloak of Protection vs Evil</string>
<string name="56653">Khelben &quot;Blackstaff&quot; Arunsun spent several months teaching one of his apprentices to make these magical cloaks. The cloaks were then given to members of the Waterdeep militia. The fashionable, yet practical cloaks were so popular that the apprentice has opened his own shop, making different styles of the same basic design.</string>
<string name="56654">Cloak of Protection vs Chaos</string>
<string name="56655">Fearing a coordinated attack by the chaotic, but deadly army of orcs to the north, Taern &#8220;Thunderspell&#8221; Hornblade created these cloaks to protect the rangers and fighters who defend the fair city of Silverymoon.</string>
<string name="56656">Cloak of Protection vs Law</string>
<string name="56657">Hoping to return to his lands in Cormyr, Lord Tagreth, head of the Fire Knives assassins guild, paid for these cloaks to assist assassins willing to hunt members of house Obarskyr. So far more assassins have died than targets, but Tagreth considers each target to be worth the cost.</string>

<string name="56667">I have some other questions.</string>
<string name="56668">That mean you gots gold on yous?</string>
<string name="56669">So you have gold on you, then?</string>
<string name="56670">Eh, no reason. Me ask other questions now, okay?</string>
<string name="56671">No reason. Let&apos;s go back to some other questions.</string>
<string name="56672">You gives it, now! Me maybe kill you for it!</string>
<string name="56673">Hand it over! I&apos;ll kill you for it!</string>
<string name="56674">Me sorry. Me not really gonna hurt yous.</string>
<string name="56675">Forgive me, I did not mean to actually harm you.</string>
<string name="56676">Me serve Aribeth. Nobody balme me if you found dead!</string>
<string name="56677">I serve Aribeth. Nobody will blame me if you are found dead!</string>
<string name="56678">Show what you gots, then.</string>
<string name="56679">Show me what you have, then.</string>
<string name="56680">I have some. Why do you ask?</string>
<string name="56681">Fool! I am in service to Desther! This would not go unpunished!</string>
<string name="56682">I don&apos;t know what you are trying to do, but I will have none of it. If you have questions, ask them. If not, leave me.</string>
<string name="56683">Hmph! I don&apos;t have time for this, fool. You wish to take what little gold I have? Fine! Here, all that I carry on my person.</string>
<string name="56684">I do not have time to argue or fight. I am doing important work that cannot be interrupted by your petty evil thieving.</string>
<string name="56685">Know this, however, that you are marked, as are all that... Well, just you rest assured that you will recieve your due in time.</string>
<string name="56686">Someone else has already seen fit to take away what extra gold I had. I could not afford the attention a battle with them would have brought.</string>
<string name="56687">If you have questions, ask them. Otherwise, just leave me to my work.</string>
<string name="56688">You are not welcome in my sight! Go, and leave me to my work!</string>
<string name="56689">Actually, I&apos;m here about gold.</string>
<string name="56690">Me here for gold, actually.</string>
<string name="56691">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m collecting to fund plague relief. Will you do your duty?</string>
<string name="56692">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Me collect for sick guys. You pay because you nice?</string>
<string name="56693">You give me gold and I leave without killing you!</string>
<string name="56694">You give gold to make me go without smashing yous!</string>
<string name="56695">Actually, I don&apos;t need anything except the answers to some questions.</string>
<string name="56696">Maybe me just need answers to questions.</string>
<string name="56697">Then no one will miss you! Pay or die!</string>
<string name="56698">Nobody miss you, nobody, so you better pay or get squashed!</string>
<string name="56699">I am sorry. I didn&apos;t mean to scare you.</string>
<string name="56700">Me sorry. Me not mean it.</string>
<string name="56701">You &lt;sir/madam&gt;, are an absolute disgrace to this fine city. Get out of my sight.</string>
<string name="56702">Oh, I did hear about some sort of trouble. Something about the Head Gaoler being taken over by something. It all sounded rather unpleasant to me.</string>
<string name="56703">But, it&apos;s not my affair. Your kind probably keep a closer eye on that sort of thing. In fact, you look similar to the one I heard fixed the problem. Probably unrelated.</string>
<string name="56704">I... I see. And how does this apply to me?</string>
<string name="56705">A district of selfish, hoarding nobles! I heard that one had even secreted away a huge reserve of food! Imagine, keeping that from the people who need it!</string>
<string name="56706">I think someone took care of him, but I haven&apos;t heard any details. Hmm... I think maybe they mentioned something about someone like you being in the area. I don&apos;t know, though.</string>
<string name="56707">I don&apos;t go near there, especially not after I heard about all the thieves that were all over the district just recently. I mean, I just wouldn&apos;t feel safe.</string>
<string name="56708">I even heard that they were overrun with zombies, but I guess that has calmed down. Hey, I think I even heard it was someone like you in there helping. Ah, I doubt it. </string>
<string name="56709">I guess the guards have been saying it&apos;s settled down now... you didn&apos;t have anything to do with that, hmm? No, I doubt a guard like that would have entered my home like this.</string>
<string name="56710">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, I can&apos;t afford much, but if I give something, maybe someone else will too. Who knows, I might end up with the plague and get it back.</string>
<string name="56711">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; With the plague going the way it is, everyone will need that gold eventually, so I might as well keep it. I could get it like everyone else.</string>
<string name="56712">Now, don&apos;t you have a charity seal for me? I can&apos;t get a break from the taxman without... wait... you aren&apos;t wearing the sash... the sash of approved charity solicitors... </string>
<string name="56713">Well, make up your mind. YOU are the one imposing on ME</string>
<string name="56714">Oh, no, I&apos;ve already contributed all I&apos;m going to. I&apos;ve about had enough of this. If you&apos;ve got questions, you had better ask them quick and get out.</string>
<string name="56715">W-what? You... you don&apos;t mean that, do you? I don&apos;t have anything here worth my life! I&apos;m... I&apos;m nobody! </string>
<string name="56716">Don&apos;t hurt me! Isn&apos;t the plague bad enough without you stealing what little I have? Just take it and go... it&apos;s all the gold I have... Get out... </string>
<string name="56717">I... I don&apos;t know what you are trying to pull, but I don&apos;t like it. Ask your questions and get out.</string>
<string name="56718">You filthy... I&apos;ve been had, haven&apos;t I... Get out... get out of my home! Get out!!</string>
<string name="56719">Homes have people, and people have gold!</string>
<string name="56720">Homes gots peoples, and peoples gots gold!</string>
<string name="56721">Shut up! Hand over your gold or I&apos;ll kill you!</string>
<string name="56722">Shut yous hole! Gimmie gold or get killed up!</string>
<string name="56723">I am sorry. I am actually a guard in service to Aribeth.</string>
<string name="56724">Me sorry. Me really guard serving Aribeth.</string>
<string name="56725">Actually, I&apos;ve decided to kill you and dump your body in the street.</string>
<string name="56726">Me decided to kill yous and dump body inna street!</string>
<string name="56727">No joke! I&apos;ll kill you unless... I get some gold.</string>
<string name="56728">No funny here. Me kill unless you pay golds!</string>
<string name="56729">I am sorry. Let&apos;s just go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="56730">Me sorry. Just go back to other questions, okay?</string>
<string name="56731">I&apos;ll just leave. Sorry.</string>
<string name="56732">Me just leave. Sorry to yous.</string>
<string name="56733">Oh, the poorest of the districts. They got the worst of the plague, and I even heard there were undead rising up all over. Can you imagine?</string>
<string name="56734">I guess one of the new militia recruits got rid of them all, but still... zombies! I can&apos;t imagine... </string>
<string name="56735">Normally I wouldn&apos;t know anything about the Docks, but everyone is talking about how one of the new militia recruits went toe to toe with old Vengaul Bloodsail!</string>
<string name="56736">I guess thieves were everywhere in there, and there was some sort of rebellion in the Bloodsailors. All over now, though. Of course, I only hear this through rumor and such.</string>
<string name="56737">I&apos;m not even looking in the direction of the Blacklake anymore. I heard one of them stuffy nobles was hoarding food away from us that need it!</string>
<string name="56738">I guess someone put a stop to it, but that don&apos;t change what they did. I hate them nobles.</string>
<string name="56739">I heard some strange things about the Peninsula district and the prison there. I heard it had to be cleaned out by the militia because the Head Gaoler went insane!</string>
<string name="56740">I guess it&apos;s safer in there now, but I don&apos;t even want to know what could cause all the trouble they had. I got enough to worry about.</string>
<string name="56741">This is about gold? The air is thick with plague, people are dying in the streets, and you want gold? Tell me you are not so repugnant as this!</string>
<string name="56742">Don&apos;t! Please! I just want to live through the plague... I just want to live... take my gold... take whatever... just get out.</string>
<string name="56743">Not me. I&apos;ve already been threatened and stolen from. I&apos;ve nothing left to give, so say what you&apos;ve come to say and get out!</string>
<string name="56744">What? Tell me... tell me this is just some sick joke... or something... right? I&apos;m... I&apos;m not anyone important... why do this to me?</string>
<string name="56745">I don&apos;t understand what just happened. Please leave my home. I have enough to worry about without your strange threats.</string>
<string name="56746">I don&apos;t understand what you want. I&apos;ll answer your questions, but you have to get out of my home afterward.</string>
<string name="56747">B-but... please, no! Isn&apos;t the plague enough to suffer through? You rotten... here, take what I have. Take it all.</string>
<string name="56748">Plague everywhere and I have to worry about petty thieves! Get out!</string>
<string name="56749">If you are threatening me to get gold, someone already beat you to it. I&apos;ve nothing, no matter what you do. Just ask your questions and go.</string>
<string name="56750">Shut up kid! You have any gold?</string>
<string name="56751">Shuts up, baby! You gots gold?</string>
<string name="56752">Maybe she didn&apos;t, but if she asks, I tell her you let me in!</string>
<string name="56753">Maybe me not allowed, but if anyone ask, me tell them you let me in!</string>
<string name="56754">I didn&apos;t mean to scare you. I&apos;m really a guard for Aribeth.</string>
<string name="56755">Me not mean to scare yous. Me a guard!</string>
<string name="56756">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; She&apos;ll believe me because I&apos;m a guard and you&apos;ve been bad before, right?</string>
<string name="56757">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Your Mommy believe me, because me a guard, and you probably bad before.</string>
<string name="56758">You are smart. I was just testing you. I&apos;m really a guard.</string>
<string name="56759">You smart. Me just testing yous. Me really a guard.</string>
<string name="56760">I said shut up! Give me your gold or I&apos;ll hurt you bad!</string>
<string name="56761">Me said shuts up! You gives gold now or me hurt you bad! </string>
<string name="56762">What? But I&apos;m not supposed to let anyone in the house. I didn&apos;t let you in here at all. I&apos;m gonna tell on you!</string>
<string name="56763">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; But... I didn&apos;t do anything this time. I lost our dog once but I didn&apos;t mean it. I didn&apos;t! Maybe... maybe I can give you my allowance?</string>
<string name="56764">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You can&apos;t tell on me. If you tell on me, Mommy will see that you are in the house and you aren&apos;t supposed to be here! </string>
<string name="56765">Here, take it. I was saving up for stuff. Maybe candy, or maybe to pay the mages because Mommy doesn&apos;t feel well. Just take it and you not tell anyone.</string>
<string name="56766">Now you get out, too. I don&apos;t want to talk to you no more!</string>
<string name="56767">Not again! I already gave away all my golds! I can&apos;t pay anybody not to tell that anymore! You just ask your stuff and go, or you gonna get yourself spanked but good!</string>
<string name="56768">Not anymore! I already gave some to somebody who was bad! I got no more to give, so if you are bad too, you can just go away!</string>
<string name="56769">What? I gots what Mommy gives me for if she doesn&apos;t come home sometime. She said I should keep it safe just in case she gets sick. I hope she doesn&apos;t get sick.</string>
<string name="56770">What? But you look likes a guard... I thought (sniff) Mommy said... guards were good. You&apos;re not good... You&apos;re not good at all!</string>
<string name="56771">Here! Take my golds! Mommy gave them, and she&apos;ll be mad when she hears this! You better go, or she&apos;ll spank you good!</string>
<string name="56772">Have you paid your safety tax?</string>
<string name="56773">You paid safety tax yet?</string>
<string name="56774">Yeah. I could kill you easy. Be safe. Pay me to go away.</string>
<string name="56775">Yeah, me kill you easy, so you be safe and pay me not to.</string>
<string name="56776">Uh, nothing. Back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="56777">That okay. Me just ask other questions.</string>
<string name="56778">I AM a guard, and guards stick together. Pay up or you are dead!</string>
<string name="56779">Me is a guard! Nobody help you! You be dead or you pay now!</string>
<string name="56780">You are right, of course. I apologize.</string>
<string name="56781">You right. Me sorry.</string>
<string name="56782">You will leave me be! I have no desire to speak with the likes of you! You disgust me!</string>
<string name="56783">Err... I&apos;m not sure what you mean. Safety tax?</string>
<string name="56784">Don&apos;t start that with me. I&apos;ve already paid out all I&apos;ve got, so just ask your questions and go.</string>
<string name="56785">I don&apos;t threaten easy. I&apos;ll just call a guard and you&apos;ll be hauled off to prison!</string>
<string name="56786">That&apos;s better. Now I suggest you ask your questions and leave. I am in a hurry.</string>
<string name="56787">W-what? All right, all right, just don&apos;t hurt me. I&apos;ll give you what I have, and you take it and get out of my sight.</string>
<string name="56788">Not only is the Wailing out of control there... like everywhere... but they also had zombies rising out of the Great Graveyard! Horrible!</string>
<string name="56789">Luckily, some stalwart hero of the city guard took care of that mess. I&apos;m not sure what happened, but I am told it was impressive.</string>
<string name="56790">Thieves were overrunning the place. That gentleman pirate Vengaul Bloodsail had something to do with it. I am told one of the city&apos;s new recruits settled it though.</string>
<string name="56791">The quarantine still keeps me from my business and dockhands, but at least it will be a little safer when we get back to business.</string>
<string name="56792">I choose not to think of that place right now. Captain Alaefin was a friend to all of Neverwinter, and now it seems he has met his end in the prison there.</string>
<string name="56793">I don&apos;t know the circumstance of it, but apparently he went mad for some reason. At least order has been restored in the Peninsula now.</string>
<string name="56794">You look very wealthy. Are you?</string>
<string name="56795">You look like a rich lady. You rich, lady?</string>
<string name="56796">Give me gold or I&apos;ll drag you through the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="56797">You gives gold or me pull yous through Beggar&apos;s Nest!</string>
<string name="56798">Merely curious. Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="56799">Me just interested. Back to other questions now, okay?</string>
<string name="56800">I&apos;m a guard. I can do what I want. I&apos;ll pull you through the dirty, filthy Beggar&apos;s Nest!</string>
<string name="56801">Me guard. Me do what me want. Me haul you through stinky, dirty Beggar&apos;s Nest!</string>
<string name="56802">I beg your pardon, ma&apos;am. I did not mean to say that.</string>
<string name="56803">Me sorry. Me not mean to say stuff to yous.</string>
<string name="56804">There is nothing noble in your manner. Get away from me, you evil, evil &lt;man/woman&gt;!</string>
<string name="56805">There was even an infestation of undead that erupted. Gods know what they did in there to cause that. Thankfully one of the new recruits in the city militia dealt with the problem.</string>
<string name="56806">Thieves were running absolutely rampant as well, but one of the newer city militia recruits put a stop to it. Admirable, whoever it was.</string>
<string name="56807">I mean, gracious me, there were even prisoners running amuck in the streets! I heard the Head Gaoler went insane and turned them all loose!</string>
<string name="56808">If not for the good recruits of the city militia, the whole thing would have got out of control. Well, out of control enough to affect me, which just isn&apos;t an option. I&apos;m told everything is quiet there now.</string>
<string name="56809">Uh, well, I am... comfortable, if it is any business of yours.</string>
<string name="56810">I won&apos;t tolerate much more of your games and distractions. I am a busy person. Ask your questions and go.</string>
<string name="56811">You... you wouldn&apos;t. There are guards all through the city... you would be seen... </string>
<string name="56812">You... you wouldn&apos;t... that vile, awful place? I&apos;ll have the plague by morn, and countless other filthy... conditions! I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll pay you to leave me alone right now!</string>
<string name="56813">Just get away from me... You&apos;ve got your filthy... extorted gold! Get away!</string>
<string name="56814">I have no gold left. Some vile monster already stole everything I had. You&apos;ll get no more from me. Ask your questions and leave.</string>
<string name="56815">Woulds you buy cure for bad plague if someone offer?</string>
<string name="56816">Would you buy a cure if it was offered?</string>
<string name="56817">Nevermind. Me just ask other questions.</string>
<string name="56818">Nevermind. I just have a few other questions.</string>
<string name="56819">Me ask to see if you gots gold! Give it, now!</string>
<string name="56820">To find out if you have gold! Hand it over, now!</string>
<string name="56821">Me just teasing yous. Me sorry. Really.</string>
<string name="56822">Ahh, I was just joking around. Sorry about that.</string>
<string name="56823">Me a guard and you is nobody! You give gold or you die like dog!</string>
<string name="56824">I&apos;m a guard and you are nobody. Hand over your gold or die like a dog!</string>
<string name="56825">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Me gots the cure! You give all yous gold and you get it!</string>
<string name="56826">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I have the cure! Give me all your gold and you can have it!</string>
<string name="56827">Me just ask to see if you gots gold! Give it, now!</string>
<string name="56828">Bah! I just asked to see if you had gold! Give it to me!</string>
<string name="56829">Me gots to make a living. Just business, okay?</string>
<string name="56830">Don&apos;t take it too hard. It&apos;s just business.</string>
<string name="56831">Yous really stupid! HAW!</string>
<string name="56832">HAHAHA! What an idiot!</string>
<string name="56833">A... a cure? There were rumors that one was in the works, but nobody believed us common folk would get it any time soon. W-why do you ask if I would pay for it?</string>
<string name="56834">Well, just hurry up. I don&apos;t have time for these stupid games of yours.</string>
<string name="56835">W-what? You... you would rob me in the street in full view of anyone walking by? Are you insane? What about guards? What about watchmen?</string>
<string name="56836">I... I don&apos;t understand what you are talking about. Ask your questions and leave me be.</string>
<string name="56837">But... no, please! I... I just want to get through all of this alive! Here... take it! Take all the gold I have! Take it and... and get out of my sight... just go... </string>
<string name="56838">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; If it was true, it would be worth everything I have, but I don&apos;t believe it. News of that would be everywhere. I... I wish I could believe it.</string>
<string name="56839">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; A cure for the Wailing? You actually have a cure?! Gods! I... I have to have it! Please... please, I&apos;ll give you all the gold that I have... </string>
<string name="56840">That&apos;s everything I have and... and... you are smiling... Why are you... You have no cure... I&apos;ve been fooled... </string>
<string name="56841">You evil piece of garbage... you took all I had left. Get out of my sight... get out!!</string>
<string name="56842">Don&apos;t you go starting that kind of crap with me. I&apos;ve already been took for everything I&apos;ve got. Ask your questions and get lost!</string>
<string name="56843">Leave my sight you evil creature. Leave my sight and never return!</string>
<string name="56844">Has yous collected lots of donations of golds?</string>
<string name="56845">Have you collected a lot of charitable donations?</string>
<string name="56846">Me just curious. Maybe back to other questions now?</string>
<string name="56847">I was merely curious. Let&apos;s go back to some other questions.</string>
<string name="56848">You give gold or me shash yous and say yous was stealing it youself!</string>
<string name="56849">You give me gold or I&apos;ll kill you and claim you were stealing it!</string>
<string name="56850">You right. Me sorry. We forget it happen, okay?</string>
<string name="56851">You are right. I&apos;m sorry. Let us forget this.</string>
<string name="56852">Me serves Aribeth. She believe me, not you. You wants this to get ugly?! Huh?!</string>
<string name="56853">I serve Aribeth. She will believe me, not you! Do you want this to get ugly?!</string>
<string name="56854">I have... acquired some measure of gold from the generous. What business do you have asking me about it?</string>
<string name="56855">Do make it quick. I don&apos;t have time for this. I have good work to do.</string>
<string name="56856">W-what? I am a Helmite in service to Desther! Do you know what you risk by threatening me?!</string>
<string name="56857">You are foolish beyond measure. Ask what questions you have and get out of my sight.</string>
<string name="56858">Wait! No... no I don&apos;t wish to make a scene. I have... important work that must not be interrupted. Fine, you may have your gold... but... </string>
<string name="56859">Rest assured, &lt;FullName&gt;, that you damn yourself with this act. You anger powers you do not understand. Go, commit your petty evils. I have important work to do!</string>
<string name="56860">No, I have nothing. Someone else has already bilked me of anything I might have had, so you may as well just ask your questions and leave.</string>
<string name="56861">You are not welcome in my sight. In fact, be thankful you yet live. You should be dead, but I have important work to do that must not be interrupted by petty vengeance.</string>
<string name="56862"></string>
<string name="56863"></string>
<string name="56864"></string>
<string name="56865"></string>
<string name="56866">Maybe me help yous somehow, huh?</string>
<string name="56867">Maybe I could help you out?</string>
<string name="56868">I don&apos;t suppose you&apos;d feel any better yourself if you&apos;d lost your home, let alone been chased out by zombies. It&apos;s just the Beggar&apos;s Nest, I know, but it&apos;s better than sitting here smelling the corpses burn.</string>
<string name="56869">Why would you help me? I&apos;m just a lowly peasant from the Beggar&apos;s Nest. Half the city is probably happy to see the place overrun, even if it was by zombies.</string>
<string name="56870">Just leave me. please.</string>
<string name="56871"></string>
<string name="56872"></string>
<string name="56873"></string>
<string name="56874"></string>
<string name="56875"></string>
<string name="56876"></string>
<string name="56877"></string>
<string name="56878">I no care about you. Go away.</string>
<string name="56879">Bah! I&apos;ve no interest in you.</string>
<string name="56880">Maybe me cans help?</string>
<string name="56881">Perhaps I could help?</string>
<string name="56882">Please... we&apos;ve nobody left to turn to. The guards won&apos;t help... don&apos;t just walk away. The Peninsula... our homes... it&apos;s all we&apos;ve got.</string>
<string name="56883">I... I don&apos;t know if you can or not. I&apos;m not sure what has gone wrong in there. I just know is that if we try to go back to our homes, we&apos;ll be killed.</string>
<string name="56884">If there is something you can do... please, I&apos;m begging you... help us.</string>
<string name="56885">You weak. Me not care about weaklings.</string>
<string name="56886">Ah, go away. Your weakness disgusts me.</string>
<string name="56887">What me do to help yous?</string>
<string name="56888">What can I do to help?</string>
<string name="56889">The Peninsula is all but overrun by escaped criminals. We&apos;ve lost everything to them. Why doesn&apos;t anybody do something about it?</string>
<string name="56890">I don&apos;t need to be reminded of how little I can help myself. We were pushed out by so many... the whole Peninsula district... overrun.</string>
<string name="56891">Go then, but... please... if you have a chance... please look into the Penisula... It was all we had.</string>
<string name="56892">I... I don&apos;t know. You can&apos;t take on the whole district by yourself... can you? I guess we need a hero... I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s you.</string>
<string name="56893">If there is something you can do to help the situation in the Peninsula, I beg you, please do it.</string>
<string name="56894">Slow down. I&apos;ll hear what you have to say.</string>
<string name="56895">Okay, just slow down and me listen.</string>
<string name="56896">I may have heard of this. Give some background on the Peninsula district.</string>
<string name="56897">How did these prisoners get loose?</string>
<string name="56898">Isn&apos;t anyone in the district able to fight back?</string>
<string name="56899">Hmm, maybe me hears about this. Tell some background on Peninsula.</string>
<string name="56900">How prisoners get loose?</string>
<string name="56901">There nobody that can fight back in there?</string>
<string name="56902">Easy, then. Tell me when you are ready.</string>
<string name="56903">You relax and stuff. You can say when you ready.</string>
<string name="56904">Rounding up escapees, eh? Let&apos;s talk price.</string>
<string name="56905">Chasing escaper guys, hmm? What you pay?</string>
<string name="56906">I have no news of that. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="56907">Me got nothing to says. Bye.</string>
<string name="56908">Get lost, woman. I&apos;m not your servant.</string>
<string name="56909">You get bent. Me not slaves for yous.</string>
<string name="56910">What is it, woman? Why are you bothering me?</string>
<string name="56911">Why you gots to bug me? What you want?!</string>
<string name="56912">Hurry up and say. I&apos;m a busy &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="56913">Me busy with stuff. You tell quick or shut up and go.</string>
<string name="56914">I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t have time right now.</string>
<string name="56915">Me really sorry, but me not got time. Sorry.</string>
<string name="56916">This does not concern me. Get lost.</string>
<string name="56917">Me not care. You get lost.</string>
<string name="56918">You go back to information stuff you say before, okay?</string>
<string name="56919">I&apos;ll have to ask you to go back over some information.</string>
<string name="56920">Peninsula okay now. It all going to be normal.</string>
<string name="56921">The Peninsula is returning to normal now. Everything is fine.</string>
<string name="56922">&lt;FirstName&gt;. Thank you for asking.</string>
<string name="56923">Me &lt;FirstName&gt;. It nice that you care.</string>
<string name="56924">&lt;FullName&gt;. Remember it!</string>
<string name="56925">&lt;FullName&gt;. You better not forgets it!</string>
<string name="56926">If it&apos;s all the same, I&apos;ll keep it to myself.</string>
<string name="56927">If it okay, me want to not say. Okay?</string>
<string name="56928">None of your damn business.</string>
<string name="56929">It not your business. Me not tell you!</string>
<string name="56930">I&apos;ll see what I can do. You stay here where it&apos;s safe.</string>
<string name="56931">Me try to make Peninsula safe. You stay safe here.</string>
<string name="56932">Of course, how callous of me to ask. I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="56933">Oh yeah, me should have guessed. Me sorry.</string>
<string name="56934">Oh, that just won&apos;t do. I guess I won&apos;t help, then.</string>
<string name="56935">Tsk. That too bad. Me not help then.</string>
<string name="56936">Wrong answer, wench! You&apos;ll pay me and you&apos;ll do it now!</string>
<string name="56937">You change what you say now! Give me gold and fast, dammit!</string>
<string name="56938">I am sorry to hear that. Perhaps I can help with Peninsula.</string>
<string name="56939">Me sorry. Maybe me help Peninsula for you?</string>
<string name="56940">You&apos;ll give me gold or I&apos;ll beat you silly!</string>
<string name="56941">You pay me or me smack you down!</string>
<string name="56942">Oh please! Can you help me? You&apos;re with the city militia, aren&apos;t you? The guards at the gates said I might get help over here, but I don&apos;t know if they were serious or not.</string>
<string name="56943">What did you say? I saw you come out of where Aribeth usually is and I thought... I mean... are you smart enough to be a guard? I&apos;m sorry, I guess I can&apos;t afford to be choosy.</string>
<string name="56944">Thank you... thank you for listening. You look so right, I just had to ask you for help. You must be an officer, right? I hope you can help.</string>
<string name="56945">Thank you... I don&apos;t mean to take you away from your duties... I mean, you&apos;re a guard, right? Probably got your hands full... but this is important.</string>
<string name="56946">Are you sure you&apos;re a guard? Now that I&apos;m close you look... rough. I&apos;m sorry. I musn&apos;t be choosy; this is too important.</string>
<string name="56947">Well, it&apos;s kind of complicated. The Peninsula district houses the Neverwinter Prison. The families of the guards and such live around it. It&apos;s been safe for years... </string>
<string name="56948">I don&apos;t know. I just don&apos;t know. Captain Alaefin has always run such an efficient operation... I hope nothing has happened to him.</string>
<string name="56949">The plague has cut down on the guards in the area. It was safe while people were locked up, but now, it&apos;s just overwhelming. Some are trying though... </string>
<string name="56950">Okay... okay. I came from the Peninsula district. That&apos;s where my home is... was. Now it&apos;s too dangerous to go there. The prisoners are killing everyone. It&apos;s awful.</string>
<string name="56951">Have you heard anything? Has there been any word? Please tell me the Peninsula is safe again. I&apos;ve been scared to ask. Everyone seems so busy. I just want to be able to go home.</string>
<string name="56952">I guess I&apos;ll... wait here then. Can&apos;t do anything else until the Peninsula district is safe again.</string>
<string name="56953">But... I just... I just hoped I could get some help... anything... Well... Well fine! You just... You just go to hell! Pick one you like and you just go!</string>
<string name="56954">You just leave me alone! I&apos;ve heard enough out of you! I&apos;ll get help from... someone... anyone but you... </string>
<string name="56955">I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry, but it&apos;s just so horrible I... I thought I could find someone to help over here but... please... please listen to me.</string>
<string name="56956">It&apos;s the Peninsula district. I live in there and... oh, it&apos;s just horrible. The killing... everyone running for their lives... it&apos;s horrible... </string>
<string name="56957">But the Peninsula district is in total... I mean, the prisoners are killing everyone... Please? I&apos;ve got nowhere else to... I guess I&apos;ll just wait here then.</string>
<string name="56958">I... I guess I can wait, but there are so many people getting hurt and... the prisoners have escaped and... Please, the Peninsula district is in total chaos... please?</string>
<string name="56959">Oh... I don&apos;t know how to thank you. Really, you are just too kind. I just hope... I just hope it was in time for some of my neighbors.</string>
<string name="56960">Thank you. Really. I have nothing more to offer, but I mean it. Thank you... so much. I... I don&apos;t know your name.</string>
<string name="56961">&lt;FirstName&gt;. Thank you for telling me. I&apos;ll make sure that only good things are said of you. I promise. Thank you again. Now I can go home.</string>
<string name="56962">Well, I certainly will. I thank you again &lt;FullName&gt;. Now if you will excuse me, I must be off. I don&apos;t want my home sitting idle another moment.</string>
<string name="56963">That is your right, though I only wished to sing your praises with it. Still, I am grateful, and will tell anyone exactly that. Thank you again. Now I think I&apos;ll go home... thanks to you.</string>
<string name="56964">Well, there&apos;s no need to be rude about it. I just wanted to know who to thank. I guess I&apos;ll be going home then. I thank you for that, at least.</string>
<string name="56965">It changed a little while ago. The guards never came home from work one day... and now, the prisoners are everywhere. First the plague... now the threat of a knife in your belly.</string>
<string name="56966">I mean, I don&apos;t know him personally or anything, but I hear he&apos;s a good man. I know he would not have allowed this to happen.</string>
<string name="56967">Sedos Sebile is there. She is one of Lord Nasher&apos;s trusted, but she doesn&apos;t have many people to work with. She&apos;s mainly just guarding the gate out of the district now.</string>
<string name="56968">Thank you. I can&apos;t say how much this means to me. Do you need directions? I&apos;ll tell you, just to be sure.</string>
<string name="56969">The Peninsula district is through the gate on the southwest side of the City Core, near the Moonstone Mask. There are guards posted, but I&apos;m sure they will let you through.</string>
<string name="56970">What? I... I don&apos;t have anything... I barely got out with my life. You work for the city, don&apos;t you? It&apos;s... It&apos;s your duty... isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="56971">Might as well be asking for blood. Some cruel, cruel person already took all that I have. There&apos;s nothing left. I have nothing... no home... nothing... </string>
<string name="56972">I guess you have to ask... times are hard. I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t give anything. I really am. Will you please still help?</string>
<string name="56973">What do you mean, you won&apos;t? What kind of a guard are you? Please... no, I won&apos;t beg. I&apos;ll be here if you choose to do the decent thing... </string>
<string name="56974">I have nowhere else to go.</string>
<string name="56975">Please don&apos;t hurt me! Please! I&apos;ve got... maybe something... Please!! Here! take it all... it&apos;s all I&apos;ve got... Ilmater damn you... damn you... </string>
<string name="56976">Damn you... Leave me!</string>
<string name="56977">No!! Please!! Why is everyone (sob) why is everyone so cruel... why? I have nothing. It&apos;s all gone... They took it... please don&apos;t hurt me... please... I beg it... </string>
<string name="56978">Please... </string>
<string name="56979">Please I need your help!</string>
<string name="56980">I could get you banned from this place. You should pay me not to.</string>
<string name="56981">Maybe I get you banned out of here. Maybe you pay me not to.</string>
<string name="56982">Give me gold now now or I&apos;ll yell that you&apos;ve got the plague!</string>
<string name="56983">You give me gold nows or me yells that you sick with plague thingy!</string>
<string name="56984">Come now, why would you want to do any such thing? You&apos;d be taking away my only comfort in these dark times. Go on, you don&apos;t really mean it.</string>
<string name="56985">Sorry, friend, but you are wasting your time. I&apos;ve already been shaken down for every last gold I had. It&apos;s only the fine generosity of Lady Cheldarstorn that allows me to stay now.</string>
<string name="56986">I&apos;ll answer questions if you have them, but I&apos;m a stone as far as coin is concerned. I&apos;ve got none to give.</string>
<string name="56987">Hey... whoa, now... come on. You&apos;re kidding, right? Okay, you&apos;re not kidding. Listen, I&apos;ll give you all I got on me if you&apos;ll just leave me alone.</string>
<string name="56988">Yeesh, what kind of a jerk are you, threatening to take away the only enjoyment I have left? Get out of here. You got what you came for. Get lost.</string>
<string name="56989">Oh no, I&apos;m not wasting another moment on the likes of you. Why don&apos;t you go steal candy from someone else, big &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="56990">How it work?</string>
<string name="56991">How does it work?</string>
<string name="56992">That&apos;s handy.</string>
<string name="56993"></string>
<string name="56994"></string>
<string name="56995">To aid you in your task I will give you this Stone of Recall. You will find it to be a valuable tool in your quest.</string>
<string name="56996">You can activate the Stone of Recall at any time and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back here to the temple of Tyr.</string>
<string name="56997">Any time you go through the teleportation portal in Tyr&apos;s temple it will instantly send you and any companions back to the place your Stone was last activated.</string>
<string name="56998">There is little else I can tell you about this mission, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Whenever you need provisions come speak to me again and I can sell them to you through the store here at Tyr&apos;s temple. </string>
<string name="56999">Take this gold so you can buy the necessary supplies for your mission. Remember to stock up on healing potions before you go. They will be critical to your survival.</string>
<string name="57000">By all accounts the creatures escaped the battle at the Academy unharmed, and there are many reports of strange beasts pouring in from every district of the city.</string>
<string name="57001">You must recover the Waterdhavian creatures if we are to survive the Wailing Death. The fate of Neverwinter rests on your shoulders now.</string>
<string name="57002">Me need healing.</string>
<string name="57003">I need healing.</string>
<string name="57004">Who you be?</string>
<string name="57005">Who are you?</string>
<string name="57006">Me not understand &apos;bout Stone of Recall and teleport portal.</string>
<string name="57007">Teleportation portal? Stone of Recall? I don&apos;t understand.</string>
<string name="57008">That be big power magic!</string>
<string name="57009">That&apos;s some pretty powerful magic!</string>
<string name="57010">That&apos;s handy.</string>
<string name="57011">Me need you go over that one more time.</string>
<string name="57012">Can you explain that again?</string>
<string name="57013">Why, what yous mean by that?</string>
<string name="57014">Why, what do you mean?</string>
<string name="57015">Teleport portal? Recall Stone? What you be talking about?</string>
<string name="57016">Teleportation portal? Stone of Recall? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="57017">That&apos;s handy.</string>
<string name="57018">However, my magic is not of a healing nature. My skills are tied to the teleportation portal in this temple and the Stone of Recall in your backpack. Is there something I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="57019">You should speak to one of the other clerics. My abilities are tied strictly to the Stone of Recall in your backpack and the teleportation portal.</string>
<string name="57020">I am Sergol, a priest of Tyr. It is my duty to aid and assist those in the service of Neverwinter, though I am no healer. </string>
<string name="57021">My magic is tied to the Stone of Recall in your backpack and the teleportation portal you see in this room. Now, is there something else you need of me? </string>
<string name="57022">I thought you would be familiar with this by now. However, it is important so I will go over the use of the Stone of Recall again.</string>
<string name="57023">In your backpack you carry a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at anytime and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="57024">This will allow you to return quickly to town whenever you need to, saving precious traveling time.</string>
<string name="57025">There is more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once you have used the stone, go through the teleportation portal and it will instantly send you back to the place your stone was last activated.</string>
<string name="57026">Anyone in your service - henchmen, familiars and the like - will also be transported with you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="57027">Or perhaps you should use the teleportation portal to return to the spot where you last activated your Stone of Recall.</string>
<string name="57028">I thought Aribeth explained this to you. However, it is important so I will go over the use of the Stone of Recall again.</string>
<string name="57029">In your backpack, you carry a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at any time and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="57030">This will allow you to quickly return to town whenever you need to, saving precious travelling time.</string>
<string name="57031">There is more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once you have used the stone, go through the teleportation portal and it will instantly send you back to the place your Stone was last activated.</string>
<string name="57032">Anyone in your service - henchmen, familiars and the like - will also be transported with you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="57033">Hey! Do you need a henchman?</string>
<string name="57034">It like me drafted or something. Why me gotta care about this?</string>
<string name="57035">It seems I have been drafted into this. Why should I care about this?</string>
<string name="57036"></string>
<string name="57037">It especially dangerous between this gate and Blacklake proper. Not much besides plague-crazed thugs in that part. Dangerous as hell.</string>
<string name="57038">No worse than anywhere else, now. There was some trouble with one of the nobles keeping a cache of food away from everyone else, but he&apos;s been dealt with.</string>
<string name="57039">Be careful on the way in, though. There&apos;s a burned-out bit of the city between here and the Blacklake proper. Nothing but plague-crazed thugs in there. Blacklake is fine, but the first bit is dangerous as hell.</string>
<string name="57040">I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s that much left to do. There was some trouble with someone named Meldanen and his cache of grain, but that&apos;s over now.</string>
<string name="57041">If you&apos;ve got other business in there you are welcome to go, but I think it&apos;s pretty quiet now, for the most part.</string>
<string name="57042">We is both &lt;race&gt;. You tell me, okay?</string>
<string name="57043">We&apos;re both &lt;race&gt;. You can tell me.</string>
<string name="57044">Actually, it&apos;s pretty quiet now. There was some trouble with the Bloodsailors, but that&apos;s all over with. I don&apos;t know much about what happened, but it&apos;s done.</string>
<string name="57045">I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s much left to do. There was some trouble with a pirate group, but that&apos;s all over with. It&apos;s quiet now.</string>
<string name="57046">You and me, we &lt;race&gt; type together. You tell me, okay?</string>
<string name="57047">Come on, now. &lt;Race&gt; kin have to stick together.</string>
<string name="57048">Not so bad anymore. I&apos;m not sure what all happened, but I understand that the prisoners have been dealt with. It&apos;s pretty quiet now.</string>
<string name="57049">Hmm, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s much to do anymore. The problem in the prison has been dealt with, as far as I know.</string>
<string name="57050">Yous can tell me, okay? We &lt;race&gt; kin.</string>
<string name="57051">You can tell me. We&apos;re &lt;race&gt; kin.</string>
<string name="57052">Not anymore. There was some business with a local woman named Formosa, but that&apos;s over with. Nothing much happening here now.</string>
<string name="57053">There was something strange with the mage Meldanen and a visitor of his, but that seems to have been settled. Not much happening now.</string>
<string name="57054">Well, Meldanen had a visitor about that time, but that matter has been settled. There&apos;s not much happening here now.</string>
<string name="57055"></string>
<string name="57056">Ahh, but it doesn&apos;t matter now. I hear Meldanen got taken behind the woodshed, if you get my meaning. Nothing much happening in the Blacklake now.</string>
<string name="57057">It&apos;s not much use now. I hear Meldanen was recently told to stop his foolishness, whatever it was. Not much is happening in the Blacklake now.</string>
<string name="57058">There was some business with Formosa, but that&apos;s all over with. Nothing much happening in the Blacklake now.</string>
<string name="57059">You can&apos;t talk to him, though. I heard he got put in his place by someone. Nothing happening in the district now.</string>
<string name="57060"></string>

<string name="57081"></string>
<string name="57082"></string>
<string name="57083"></string>
<string name="57084">Maybe me gonna do that! You gives gold or you die!</string>
<string name="57085">Perhaps I will! Give me all your gold or die!</string>
<string name="57086">Me collecting tax to help me keep streets safe.</string>
<string name="57087">I&apos;m collecting a tax to help me keep the streets free of crime.</string>
<string name="57088">Me just leave nows. Sorry to bothers.</string>
<string name="57089">I&apos;ll just leave. Sorry to bother you.</string>
<string name="57090">Maybe me just go back to other questions.</string>
<string name="57091">Perhaps I should just go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="57092">You not understand. If me not get paid, you not safe. Me make sure you not safe!</string>
<string name="57093">You don&apos;t understand. If I don&apos;t get paid, you won&apos;t be safe. I&apos;ll see to it!</string>
<string name="57094">I... I can&apos;t fight you. Take what I have and go. Just go.</string>
<string name="57095">Don&apos;t... don&apos;t let me see you here again... please.</string>
<string name="57096">I&apos;m sorry to disappoint you, but if you are here to rob me you are too late. I&apos;ve nothing left. If you have other business, state it and get out.</string>
<string name="57097">I&apos;m not interested in donating today, thank you.</string>
<string name="57098">Very well. I&apos;m not sure what you were getting at, but I&apos;m glad you are leaving.</string>
<string name="57099">Very well... but make it quick. I&apos;m not sure what you are up to... </string>
<string name="57100">Ah, I see. Well, it appears I have very little choice. Take what you must. Just get the hell out afterward.</string>
<string name="57101">Hold on. If you are trying to find out if I have gold to steal, the answer is no, I don&apos;t. Someone beat you to it, so state whatever other business you have and get out.</string>
<string name="57102">There was something about a woman named Formosa, but whatever business she had seems to be concluded. This district is quite quiet now.</string>
<string name="57103">If it&apos;s all the same, I don&apos;t want to spend much time in your... charming presense. Besides, Meldanen is a fearsome man. Myself, I wouldn&apos;t mind if he turned up dead one day.</string>
<string name="57104">Ooh, aren&apos;t you a charmer. I suppose there&apos;s no harm in a friendly... chat. Well... word is that Meldanen recently accquired a young woman for his amusement.</string>
<string name="57105">No, not really. There was some trouble with a mage named Meldanen, but that is long over with. This district is pretty quiet now.</string>
<string name="57106">Meldanen done with. Yous can go nows.</string>
<string name="57107">Meldanen has been taken care of. You can get out of here now.</string>
<string name="57108">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; Yous can tell me, okay, handsome guy?</string>
<string name="57109">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, handsome. You can tell little old me. </string>
<string name="57110">Forgive me, lass, but I don&apos;t find your... interest... all that appealing. Let&apos;s discuss something else, hmm?</string>
<string name="57111">Ahh, it&apos;s not worth worrying about. He&apos;s been taken care of, I hear. He was the main problem in Blacklake, as far as I&apos;m concerned. It&apos;s pretty quiet now.</string>
<string name="57112">Are there a lot of other guards? Could they get here if I attacked you?</string>
<string name="57113">Is there lots of other guards in heres? Could they gets here if me attacked you?</string>
<string name="57114">So you&apos;d realize you are at my mercy! Give me all your gold!</string>
<string name="57115">Just so&apos;s you can&apos;t gets help! Give me all yous gold!</string>
<string name="57116">No reason. Back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="57117">Eh, no reasons. Back to other questions, okay?</string>
<string name="57118">Nevermind. Farewell for now.</string>
<string name="57119">Nothing. Bye for nows.</string>
<string name="57120">I guess there was some commotion at the Seedy Tavern or something, but it&apos;s all quiet here now. Nothing going on except the plague slowly killing us all.</string>
<string name="57121">Uh, there... there aren&apos;t a lot around, no. W-why do you ask? </string>
<string name="57122">Oh no, I know where this is going. Look, I&apos;ve got no gold left, so you might as well forget about threatening me. Just ask your questions and get out.</string>
<string name="57123">What?! No, please! Here, take what I have, just leave me in peace... I just want to get out of this whole mess alive... that&apos;s all I want... </string>
<string name="57124">Get out... get out of my sight... please... </string>
<string name="57125">If you don&apos;t care, you won&apos;t mind handing over all your gold!</string>
<string name="57126">If yous not care, then you not mind giving all yous gold!</string>
<string name="57127">Give me your gold or I&apos;ll kill you. I&apos;m a guard. I&apos;ll easily get away with it.</string>
<string name="57128">Yeah, me kill you easy, so you be safe and pay me not to.</string>
<string name="57129">You are right, of course. I apologize.</string>
<string name="57130">You right. Me sorry.</string>
<string name="57131">If you are just waiting to die, no one will miss you if I kill you for your gold.</string>
<string name="57132">If yous just waiting to die, nobody miss you if me kills you for gold!</string>
<string name="57133">That isn&apos;t my problem. You pay or you die. It&apos;s simple!</string>
<string name="57134">What me care about that? You pays or yous dies! Easy!</string>
<string name="57135">All right, all right, let&apos;s just go back to my questions.</string>
<string name="57136">Okay, okay, we just go over my questions then.</string>
<string name="57137">I maybe heard of something happening at the Jim Seedy&apos;s tavern, but it&apos;s all over now. Nothing much going on in the Docks now, except the plague, I guess.</string>
<string name="57138">You aren&apos;t serious... are you? Please, I have so little left. How will I by food? How will I survive?</string>
<string name="57139">You are wasting your breath. You can threaten all you want, but I have nothing left to give. Someone else beat you to it.</string>
<string name="57140">No! Please... I&apos;ll give you what I have... please just get out... leave me... with nothing... (sob!)</string>
<string name="57141">So, with that bit of unpleasantness out of the way, did you have questions, or are you going to leave my home?</string>
<string name="57142">Okay, then. I&apos;m not sure what you want here, but if you have something to say, do so and get out.</string>
<string name="57143">Please! T-that may be true, but I&apos;ve no gold left to give! You aren&apos;t the first evil creature to break into my home... I have nothing left to give. Nothing!</string>
<string name="57144">W-what? Please, no! I have so little... how will I eat? It is so hard to get by with the plague and all the trouble around here.</string>
<string name="57145">I can&apos;t do anything to stop you from killing me. I can only ask that you ask your questions and please leave. The plague will get us all eventually anyway.</string>
<string name="57146">Please, say what you must and get out.</string>
<string name="57147">Please! I... I&apos;ll give what I have, but it isn&apos;t much. Times are so hard... please just take it and go... I can&apos;t believe you are so cruel... </string>
<string name="57148">Just get out... </string>
<string name="57149">So you have absolutely nothing left at all?</string>
<string name="57150">So yous gots nothing left at all? Nothings?</string>
<string name="57151">Ah-HA! If you can buy a shirt, you&apos;ve got gold! Give it to me!</string>
<string name="57152">Ah-HA! So you gots gold to buy shirts! You gives it to me!</string>
<string name="57153">I won&apos;t kill you. I&apos;ll say you killed your family. You&apos;ll rot in prison for their murders!</string>
<string name="57154">Me not kill you. Me just say you killed you&apos;s family. You gonna rot in jail for murders!</string>
<string name="57155">I&apos;m sorry. I lost my head for a moment. I apologize.</string>
<string name="57156">Me sorry, me gots crazy for a bit. Me sorry.</string>
<string name="57157">Nothing. Nothing at all.</string>
<string name="57158">Well... I guess I have the shirt on my back, but I should probably burn that too. I&apos;ll have to buy another at the Twenty in a Quiver, I suppose.</string>
<string name="57159">W-what?! Is that all you want? Filthy thief! No! I say no! What are you going to do, kill me? So what! I&apos;ve got nothing to live for anyway! Go ahead!</string>
<string name="57160">Whatever. Look, why don&apos;t you just leave me alone. I don&apos;t really want to talk to anyone right now.</string>
<string name="57161">You... you monster! I&apos;d never be able to prove I didn&apos;t do it, not with a guard like you saying I did. No one would let me mourn... no one would look at me the same again... </string>
<string name="57162">Take it, you evil, evil piece of &lt;race&gt; waste. Leave me to my ashes... LEAVE ME!!</string>
<string name="57163">Get away from me, you evil sack of filth! Get away from my ashes!</string>
<string name="57164">Nothing. My last gold was stolen by some evil sack of filth. They threatened to accuse me of murdering my family... all for a few coins! Filth. FILTH!</string>
<string name="57165">There is no need. The pirates have been put down, the prize, the cockatrice, returned to where it needs to be. There is little in the Docks for you. It&apos;s a quiet place now.</string>
<string name="57166">Dangerous? No longer. The pirates are gone, and the prize, the cockatrice, is back where it needs to be. There is little to do here now. the Docks are quiet.</string>
<string name="57167">It is gone from here. The pirates are defeated and the prize, the cockatrice, is back in the proper hands. The Docks are done and quiet.</string>
<string name="57168">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="57169">Maybe yous can take me down the stream?</string>
<string name="57170">Can you take me downstream?</string>
<string name="57171">Okay, you send me down the stream.</string>
<string name="57172">Send me downstream.</string>
<string name="57173">Where these water-duck cave things go? </string>
<string name="57174">Where do these Aqueducts go?</string>
<string name="57175">You see anyone else come here? Anyone pass by yous?</string>
<string name="57176">Has anyone else passed by this point?</string>
<string name="57177">You look like you belong down here. It will be nice to have a new best friend. The sewers get lonely. Aqueducts! I meant Aqueducts!</string>
<string name="57178">There are more people in the sewers than there is sewage these days. Er... not that these are the sewers. No sir! Aqueducts! Pure and clean!</string>
<string name="57179">Well, hello your Majesty! I sure as shucks don&apos;t see personry of your distinction down here much. Come to inspect the sewers... Aqueducts! I meant Aqueducts!</string>
<string name="57180">Please pardon my confusion. I&apos;m still getting the hang of this new beautification program the city council put in place. The finer points of it seem to be giving things pretty names. </string>
<string name="57181">You know: sewers become aqueducts, waste becomes surplus resource, and my cushy job at the castle becomes tour-guide to the FREAKIN&apos; SEWERS! BUT I&apos;M NOT BITTER!</string>
<string name="57182">You sure you won&apos;t stick around? I found some hors d&apos;oeuvres. I think they&apos;re little wieners. Uh... okay, bye then.</string>
<string name="57183">Well, I can&apos;t leave my post here. An emergency might arise and my special expertise might be needed. IT COULD HAPPEN!</string>
<string name="57184">I can send you down on your own. It ain&apos;t dangerous. Leastwise, I don&apos;t think so. Just say the word and you&apos;re good to go.</string>
<string name="57185">Yes &lt;sir/madam&gt;, merrily merrily! Here you go.</string>
<string name="57186">Well, they join up with the older sewers a ways down. There used to be some old storerooms back in there, but they ain&apos;t been used by the city for years and years.</string>
<string name="57187">As the districts expanded, access to those old areas got built over. Not a lot of people know the layout of those old tunnels. I hear voices down there on occasion, though.</string>
<string name="57188">Well now, actually there were a couple groups that I saw heading downstream. I thought it was a bit odd, but they didn&apos;t bother me.</string>
<string name="57189">The first was just one man on his own. Older gent, and dressed in quite the finery. He looked like he knew where he was going.</string>
<string name="57190">After him was a rough lot, and they looked like they had blood on their minds. Seemed a bit unsure where they were going, though.</string>
<string name="57191">You&apos;re back again? Some people just can&apos;t get enough of the sewers. Aqueducts! I meant Aqueducts! Nothing sewer-ish about it! No &lt;sir/madam&gt;!</string>
<string name="57192">Boat&apos;s all ready, by and by. Shining and new. Ready for anything... (sigh) Ohhh, I&apos;ve wasted my life.</string>
<string name="57193">I guess things will be getting back to normal. Just me and the sewers. Aqueducts! I meant to say Aqueducts! Pure and clean! Yes indeed!</string>
<string name="57194">Ugh, get on with you, you&apos;re spoiling my view.</string>
<string name="57195">Whoa! I&apos;ve seen better looking faces on busted clocks!</string>
<string name="57196">You know you&apos;re hideously ugly, right? Did you know night was dark and water is wet? Seems just as obvious to me.</string>
<string name="57197">I don&apos;t know what kind of reaction you&apos;re hoping for. If you&apos;re something special, I ain&apos;t heard about it. </string>
<string name="57198">Unless you&apos;re a nymph with a mug, I&apos;m not interested in talking.</string>
<string name="57199">Sorry, friend, I&apos;m not in the mood to talk.</string>
<string name="57200">You sure you&apos;re in the right place. You look a little above the customers we usually get in here.</string>
<string name="57201">You aren&apos;t royalty, are you? Pretty dangerous for you in the docks if you are. Pretty tempting target.</string>
<string name="57202">No offence meant, but why are you slumming here? You look like Blacklake, through and through.</string>
<string name="57203">I apologize. Had I known I would be seeing such a vision as you I would have spruced myself up a bit. Ahh, like it would help. (burp)</string>
<string name="57204">I don&apos;t usually see women of your ample gifts in this place. It&apos;s pretty rough.</string>
<string name="57205">Well, aren&apos;t you a pretty lass.</string>
<string name="57206">Oh hello. Uh... some of my best friends are &lt;race&gt;. Yeah.</string>
<string name="57207">I didn&apos;t come to this tavern to sit with you &lt;race&gt; types. Skitter off, will you?</string>
<string name="57208">Now, I don&apos;t have a problem with you &lt;race&gt; types personally, but... no, really, I don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="57209">You sticking around town after this plague business is over? People are friendlier to us &lt;race&gt; types when they ain&apos;t so tense about dying.</string>
<string name="57210">Been a while since I seen someone &lt;race&gt; I didn&apos;t know. Safe travels, friend.</string>
<string name="57211">Hello there, &lt;race&gt; kin. Watch yourself. Some people here ain&apos;t that friendly to us.</string>
<string name="57212">Ahh, barbarian types always make the day more interesting. Can I dare you to eat stuff?</string>
<string name="57213">You behave yourself in here, barbarian. This is a respectable place... most days.</string>
<string name="57214">I don&apos;t want any trouble, barbarian.</string>
<string name="57215">Go away, spellchucker. I&apos;m not in the mood to talk to strangers.</string>
<string name="57216">I don&apos;t trust spellcasters. You people fiddle with some strange stuff.</string>
<string name="57217">Can&apos;t you whistle up some magic to make this plague go away, spellcaster?</string>
<string name="57218">I&apos;m done praying for the plague to end, cleric. It ain&apos;t worked yet.</string>
<string name="57219">Have you words of wisdom for these dark times, cleric?</string>
<string name="57220">I got no time for you, cleric. I like my demons just fine.</string>
<string name="57221">I hope you aren&apos;t looking for trouble. Put that weapon away.</string>
<string name="57222">You&apos;d better mean business if you are going to walk around armed like that.</string>
<string name="57223">Don&apos;t go waving that weapon at me, friend.</string>
<string name="57224">Plague will take you all the easier if you are weak from combat. Get yourself looked at.</string>
<string name="57225">You&apos;ll bleed your life out if you don&apos;t get those wounds looked at.</string>
<string name="57226">Gods, get yourself healed up, fool!</string>
<string name="57227">I don&apos;t need to see your bare necessities, thank you. I just ain&apos;t in the mood for that crap.</string>
<string name="57228">Whoa, you should go to the Moonstone Mask if you are going to prance around with your unmentionables hanging out.</string>
<string name="57229">Get some clothes on, fool. This ain&apos;t that kind of tavern!</string>
<string name="57230">Me gots to talk at you abouts gold.</string>
<string name="57231">I need to talk to you about gold.</string>
<string name="57232">Me just going to leave. Nevermind.</string>
<string name="57233">Actually, I&apos;m just going to leave now.</string>
<string name="57234">That okay, we just go back to other questions, okay?</string>
<string name="57235">Forget it. Let&apos;s just go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="57236">Just little bit of gold, 50 maybe, stops accidents from happening. REAL SOON!</string>
<string name="57237">As little as 50 gold can prevent accidents in the home. YOUR home.</string>
<string name="57238">Golds will protect yous from me. That good value. Pay or die!</string>
<string name="57239">Gold will protect you from me. A valuable service. Pay or die!</string>
<string name="57240">About... gold? W-what do you want to say?</string>
<string name="57241">Are you... threatening me? But... but you&apos;re a guard... aren&apos;t you? Aren&apos;t you supposed to protect people like me?</string>
<string name="57242">Wait! Please, don&apos;t hurt me! I&apos;ve worked so hard to survive this long! Just... okay, take it... take it all. It&apos;s not worth it... </string>
<string name="57243">Get out... leave me... you have everything of mine... just go.</string>
<string name="57244">I have an answer for you before you say another word. I have none. I have already been robbed blind, thank you very much. Have you any other questions, or will you be leaving now?</string>
<string name="57245">Get away from me! You are evil, evil filth!</string>
<string name="57246">How good is security in the district?</string>
<string name="57247">How good is guards and stuff around here?</string>
<string name="57248">Because I would like to offer you protection. You never know when evil will strike.</string>
<string name="57249">&apos;Cause me wants to give protection. Yous never can tell when evil gonna happen.</string>
<string name="57250">Actually, I&apos;ll just go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="57251">Me just go back to other questions, okay?</string>
<string name="57252">I think that would be safest. You want to be safe, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="57253">That probably safest. Yous wants to be safe, don&apos;t yous?</string>
<string name="57254">You again?! Haven&apos;t you done enough! Get out!</string>
<string name="57255">The last person to ask me that robbed me blind. If this is a roundabout way of threatening me, don&apos;t waste your time. I&apos;ve nothing to give you.</string>
<string name="57256">It&apos;s... pretty poor right now. That should be obvious, given the circumstances. W-what are you getting at? Why are you asking?</string>
<string name="57257">What do you mean? Are you... are you threatening me? Are you trying to get me to pay so you leave me alone?</string>
<string name="57258">Y-yes, I suppose I do... take it then... and get out of here... I don&apos;t want to see your face again... please... </string>
<string name="57259">Ugh... I&apos;m sorry... give me a moment. The smell of the burning corpses is getting to me... As if the plague isn&apos;t bad enough on it&apos;s own. And now the Beggar&apos;s Nest is even worse! Have you heard? </string>
<string name="57260">I&apos;m sorry, I prefer not to speak while this close to the burning pile. The smell is almost overpowering. Speak to my commander if you need information.</string>
<string name="57261"></string>
<string name="57262"></string>
<string name="57263"></string>
<string name="57264"></string>
<string name="57265"></string>
<string name="57266"></string>
<string name="57267"></string>
<string name="57268"></string>
<string name="57269"></string>
<string name="57270"></string>
<string name="57271"></string>
<string name="57272"></string>
<string name="57273"></string>
<string name="57274"></string>
<string name="57275">Yous really not gonna do nothing if me go in?</string>
<string name="57276">You really won&apos;t do anything if I go in?</string>
<string name="57277">Why it not be safe?</string>
<string name="57278">Why isn&apos;t it safe?</string>
<string name="57279"></string>
<string name="57280">Maybe me go back to other stuff me ask yous</string>
<string name="57281">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="57282">The door has already been opened anyway. You could just walk in if you wanted. I wouldn&apos;t do it, though. It&apos;s not safe.</string>
<string name="57283">I told you, I&apos;m no guard. I don&apos;t make enough gold to get in your way. I say it ain&apos;t safe, but what you do is your business.</string>
<string name="57284">The guards inside are real tough. I&apos;m not sure why Hodge didn&apos;t put them out here. Maybe he wants them as a surprise for burglars. I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="57285">They attack on sight. Nothing more than killers, really. Working as a guard just lets them hurt people legally. I don&apos;t like them much.</string>
<string name="57286">Sorry, but I can&apos;t help you there. Anything else you need?</string>
<string name="57287">So now I&apos;m standing out here, pretending that I&apos;m threatening. I don&apos;t even think I&apos;m getting paid more for this.</string>
<string name="57288">Those nobles in the Blacklake; one of them was hoarding food! I had heard they had a cure, but it was just plain old greed!</string>
<string name="57289">Did you have something to do with the prison break in he Peninsula? Sorry, I didn&apos;t mean it like that. You look rough, I guess, but you might have helped stop it, right? </string>
<string name="57290">Those nobles in the Blacklake; one of them was hoarding food! I had heard they had a cure, but it was just plain old greed!</string>
<string name="57291">You know the rumors I heard about the prison break? They were true! At least, that&apos;s what I hear. I guess it was pretty bad in the Peninsula, but it&apos;s quiet now.</string>
<string name="57292">Are you one fo the new militia recruits? Maybe you had something to do with clearing the zombies out of the Beggar&apos;s Nest? Good on you if you did.</string>
<string name="57293">Was that you that took care of the prison break in the Peninsula? I heard it was one of the new recruits, but I didn&apos;t get any names. Thanks if it was.</string>
<string name="57294">Are you one fo the new militia recruits? Maybe you had something to do with clearing the zombies out of the Beggar&apos;s Nest? Good on you if you did.</string>
<string name="57295">Those nobles in the Blacklake; one of them was hoarding food! I had heard they had a cure, but it was just plain old greed!</string>
<string name="57296">Those nobles in the Blacklake; one of them was hoarding food! I had heard they had a cure, but it was just plain old greed!</string>
<string name="57297">I guess I should apologize to the city militia. I heard the Peninsula was out of control, but now everything is back to normal there. Well, normal plus plague.</string>
<string name="57298">I heard one fo the militia went to the Blacklake and told those nobles to smarten&apos; up! Still no cure, but at least they are catching hell, too.</string>
<string name="57299">Id&apos; stay in the core, if I were you. I mean, sure, there&apos;s no more zombies in the Beggar&apos;s Nest, but the plague will get you just the same.</string>
<string name="57300">You brute. I&apos;d tell you to go to the Docks with all the other ruffians, but I heard a militia recruit cleaned it all up! I hear a lot of stuff, though.</string>
<string name="57301">There was a prison break in the Peninsula, but it&apos;s over now. I heard it was a new militia recruit that took care of it. Don&apos;t know for sure.</string>
<string name="57302">At least the Docks have calmed down a bit. I heard there were thieves everywhere, but one of the guards went in there and took care of it.</string>
<string name="57303">First I heard that the nobles in Blacklake had a cure, now I hear they don&apos;t. Can&apos;t you make your god make things clearer?</string>
<string name="57304">I suppose you&apos;re going to claim your god had something to do with the zombies leaving the Beggar&apos;s Nest? Cure the plague, then we&apos;ll talk.</string>
<string name="57305">There were rumors about a cure in the Blacklake, but I guess it isn&apos;t true. I wish it was, even if they weren&apos;t going to share.</string>
<string name="57306">At least the Beggar&apos;s Nest is clear of zombies now. Of course, the number plague-dead could still bury us all.</string>
<string name="57307">Those nobles were up to something in the Blacklake, but not any more. Rumors were they had a plague cure. I guess not... </string>
<string name="57308">I had heard the nobles in the Blacklake had a cure, but I guess it was all bluster and rumor. One of the new recruits put them in their place.</string>
<string name="57309">I heard there were lots of people dead after the prison break in the Peninsula. Glad it&apos;s over. The plague kills enough of us.</string>
<string name="57310">I heard a new recruit took care of the zombies in the Beggar&apos;s Nest. I hope we don&apos;t burn the corpses in the Core, though. It smells bad enough now... </string>
<string name="57311">I heard there were lots of people dead after the prison break in the Peninsula. Glad it&apos;s over. The plague kills enough of us.</string>
<string name="57312">You one of the new city guard? I heard someone new took care of the zombies in the Beggar&apos;s Nest. Good job, whoever it was.</string>
<string name="57313">Those nobles were up to something in the Blacklake, but not any more. Rumors were they had a plague cure. I guess not... we&apos;re still burning our dead.</string>
<string name="57314">Them nobles tried some fancy shenanigans in the Blacklake, but one of the militia put them in their place! Serves them right!</string>
<string name="57315">I heard pirates made a move on the Docks district, but they got put down by a new militia recruit. How humbling is that, huh?</string>
<string name="57316">The nobles in the Blacklake have been put in their place, I hear. I hope, anyway. They&apos;re too full of themselves at the best of times.</string>
<string name="57317">Corpses were walking the Beggar&apos;s Nest! They&apos;ve been stopped, now, but who knows what&apos;s coming next!</string>
<string name="57318">You&apos;re obviously a thug of some sort. You missed your shot, though. I hear the criminals in the Docks are on the run now.</string>
<string name="57319">I heard the prison break in the Peninsula district was put down violently. I hope the bodies don&apos;t get burned here. There&apos;s too many now.</string>
<string name="57320">I heard the Docks district is quieter now. Maybe I should go there. I really need to get away from the smell of burning flesh.</string>
<string name="57321">Did you take your teachings to the Blacklake, holy &lt;man/woman&gt;? Is that why I hear their hoarding is over?</string>
<string name="57322">I suppose you and your god will be taking credit for the zombies in the Beggar&apos;s Nest being destroyed? Stop the plague, then I&apos;ll listen.</string>
<string name="57323">I heard the Blacklake nobles were hoarding stuff, but someone went in there and did something about it. Mostly rumor, though.</string>
<string name="57324">At least the zombies in the Beggar&apos;s Nest have been dealt with. Of course, their corpses probably still carry plague... </string>
<string name="57325"></string>
<string name="57326"></string>
<string name="57327"></string>

<string name="57329"></string>
<string name="57330"></string>
<string name="57331"></string>
<string name="57332">This man looks worried. He is constantly looking out across the street, obviously hoping he will see someone.</string>
<string name="57333">A cleaning lady working for some of the Blacklake nobles. Her plain style of dress is a stark contrast to the finery of her employers.</string>
<string name="57334">This man is scared out of his mind. It would be remarkable to get anything coherent out of him.</string>
<string name="57335">This person is clearly agitated. From his haggard appearance, it is fair to surmise that the plague has turned his life upside down.</string>
<string name="57336">This woman is obviously upset. From her haggard appearance, it is fair to surmise that the plague has turned her life upside down.</string>
<string name="57337">This is one of Neverwinter&apos;s many fine purveyors of spirits. He is dressed plainly, wanting to appear friendly and unassuming to his customers.</string>
<string name="57338">This young dwarf looks nervous and uncertain. He&apos;s seen too much death recently, and apparently far too much undeath as well.</string>
<string name="57339">This undead creature looks formidable, but there&apos;s something in the way it acts that suggests inexperience, and perhaps more talk than sense.</string>
<string name="57340">This half-elf militia guard looks like he has seen better days. His captor has not been gentle.</string>
<string name="57341">Desther shifts uncomfortably, obviously displeased with those around him. He looks preoccupied and strained, as though wanting more control over the situation than he has.</string>
<string name="57342">This man looks supremely confident, like he is used to commanding during a crisis. He&apos;s a seasoned veteran of the battlefield.</string>
<string name="57343">Still wearing the tatters of his prison uniform, this escaped prisoner has the vicious look of someone with nothing to lose.</string>
<string name="57344">This is an elven member of the city militia, his face showing the strain that he and his fellow guards suffer in these troubled times.</string>
<string name="57345">This Halfling appears totally in control of himself and the situation around him. He acts like a leader, and the people around him act accordingly.</string>
<string name="57346">This man glares angrily, ready to lash out at least verbally. He looks utterly frustrated with his predicament. His armor bears the symbol of Cyric.</string>
<string name="57347">One of the city militia, this man&apos;s face shows the strain of long hours dealing with the effects of the plague.</string>
<string name="57348">A proud looking ruffian in a red and blue uniform, obviously a member of a mercenary company or a highly organized group of bandits.</string>
<string name="57349">This man&apos;s robes proudly display the symbol of Helm. He meets your gaze with suspicion, at first, but then offers a friendly smile.</string>
<string name="57350">This woman returns your gaze with a cold glance, dismissing you utterly. She appears to be in no mood for conversation.</string>
<string name="57351">This is a fast-talking auctioneer, looking very annoyed that the evening has apparently not gone as planned.</string>
<string name="57352">This woman smiles politely, but pats her sword while she does it.</string>
<string name="57353">This is the traitorous lieutenant of Vengaul Bloodsail, looking absolutely incensed that his plan has not gone as smooth as it was supposed to.</string>
<string name="57354">A large man, obviously watching the door behind him, but he doesn&apos;t really look like a properly trained guard.</string>
<string name="57355">This man is keeping to himself, but appears to be observing the room very closely. He&apos;s being carefully watched by the half-orc next to him.</string>
<string name="57356">This elven woman looks defiant, despite having been harassed by her captors. She&apos;s wearing a Bloodsailor uniform, but doesn&apos;t look like much of a fighter.</string>
<string name="57357">This amiable gnome seems oblivious to his poverty. He is bright-eyed amidst the gloom of the plague. Certainly he must be mad.</string>
<string name="57358">Gilda is an older, friendly serving wench trying to keep customers in the Golden Apple happy, despite the turmoil outside. </string>
<string name="57359">A noble, trying to maintain his dignity, but clearly out of his element. He looks lost, as though not sure what to do next.</string>
<string name="57360">A jovial half-orc in a Bloodsailor uniform. He&apos;s keeping a close eye on the man next to him... and drinking a heroic amount of ale.</string>
<string name="57361">This merchant looks secure and content, like the plague has not affected his business. Perhaps he sells to a clientele that can&apos;t go anywhere else.</string>
<string name="57362">A dignified butler, looking not at all pleased about being in the Docks.</string>
<string name="57363">This man looks accustomed to rough living. He scans the area nervously, person to person, looking close at what they are wearing and carrying.</string>
<string name="57364">This man looks haggard and ready to fight. He&apos;s obviously not friendly.</string>
<string name="57365">A Bloodsailor traitor that now follows Callik, although he looks a bit nervous, as though he was told this would all go a lot smoother.</string>
<string name="57366">A wiry old swashbuckler dressed in flashy, well-kept garments. A scoundrel that likes to twirl his moustache whilst dueling with deserving and respected rivals.</string>
<string name="57367">This man looks to be about two drinks away from being flat on his back.</string>
<string name="57368">This elf returns your gaze intently. He is almost out of place amidst the city backdrop, his manner suggesting a very personal connection to nature.</string>
<string name="57369">Lydia</string>
<string name="57370">Harris</string>
<string name="57371">Jerome</string>
<string name="57372">Maureen</string>
<string name="57373">Saulter</string>
<string name="57374">Bethany</string>
<string name="57375">Lady Aribeth is the epitome of grace and concentration, although she is obviously preoccupied with worry for those suffering from the plague.</string>
<string name="57376">This man looks serious and composed, his armor impeccably maintained. He obviously regards his duties as being of the utmost importance.</string>
<string name="57377">Fenthick looks concerned for those suffering, obviously willing to do anything if it would help the situation. His face looks weary, but hopeful.</string>
<string name="57378">This elf has been run off her feet caring for the endless number of plague victims that pass though here. She looks very tired.</string>
<string name="57379">A common man of Neverwinter, this person wears simple clothes and the harried look of someone living in the shadow of plague.</string>
<string name="57380">Elves are possessed of extraordinary beauty and grace, but the misery of the Wailing has given this woman a deeply sad expression.</string>
<string name="57381">This elf of Neverwinter carries himself proudly, although concern about the plague weighs in his eyes, like it does for everyone else.</string>
<string name="57382">Still wearing the tatters of his prison uniform, this escaped dwarf has the vicious look of someone with nothing to lose.</string>
<string name="57383">Still wearing the tatters of his prison uniform, this escaped half-orc has the vicious look of someone with nothing to lose.</string>
<string name="57384">A smartly dressed and ordered militia captain. He shares the weary look of those under him, however. The plague is a strain on everyone.</string>
<string name="57385">A simple barmaid, looking a bit tired from the strain of continuing to serve customers while the world apparently ends outside.</string>
<string name="57386">A thoroughly repugnant creature, the Waterdhavian Intellect Devourer radiates evil. You cannot read its strange features, but only a fool would think it friendly.</string>
<string name="57387">This woman appears aware of everything around her, thriving amidst the chaos. She doesn&apos;t have the tired look her militia companions suffer from.</string>
<string name="57388">A privately hired guard, this elf regards you coldly. He appears quite capable of defending himself, if need be.</string>
<string name="57389">A privately hired guard, which are usually valued for their viciousness. He regards you coldly. He appears quite capable of defending himself, if need be.</string>
<string name="57390">A privately hired guard, which are usually valued for their viciousness. She regards you coldly, appearing quite capable of defending herself, if need be.</string>
<string name="57391">Despite being caged for a number of days, this Waterdhavian creature is still eerily beautiful. She looks sad, however, and more than a little weak.</string>
<string name="57392">His clothing crisp and spotless, this elf scans the room nervously. He appears terribly preoccupied, his manner suggesting that he is greatly troubled.</string>
<string name="57393">An utterly despondent man, he looks as though he has lost everything in the world. Given the state of the city, he just may have.</string>
<string name="57394">A proud looking woman in a red and blue uniform, obviously a member of a mercenary company or a highly organized group of bandits.</string>
<string name="57395">A ragged looking elf in a red and blue uniform, obviously a member of a mercenary company or a highly organized group of bandits.</string>
<string name="57396">One of the few people not affected by the plague. Well, at least not physically affected. This person looks a bit... unsteady.</string>
<string name="57397">Charon</string>
<string name="57398">The Waterdhavian Cockatrice looks understandably skittish, given the chaotic happenings of the last few weeks. It is small, but threatened animals are doubly dangerous.</string>
<string name="57399">This dwarf looks exceptionally friendly.</string>
<string name="57400">A half-orc militia member. Stronger than many of his companions, dealing with the horrors of the plague have left him looking just as weary.</string>
<string name="57401">This halfling stares back at you with accusing eyes, obviously not trusting a soul a single step more than he has to.</string>
<string name="57402">This man looks exceptionally strong, but his manner is childlike and simple. He looks like he doesn&apos;t know what he should be doing.</string>
<string name="57403">A practical looking halfling, rolling her eyes at the absurdity of her situation.</string>
<string name="57404">This young man looks very worried and does not appear to have slept for the last day or so.</string>
<string name="57405">An animated suit of armor, obviously echanted by powerful magics.</string>
<string name="57406">The Waterdhavian Yuan-Ti appears cold and reptilian, appropriately enough. She looks well armored and armed, not at all friendly, and determined not to be captured.</string>
<string name="57407">This corpse has somehow been animated, but not actually restored to life. It wanders mindlessly, drawn to attack the living.</string>
<string name="57408">This woman appears calm and immensely sure of herself. Her clothes are impeccable, as though they repel the very dust in the air.</string>
<string name="57409">A powerful example of his kind, this half-orc appears ready for battle... any battle.</string>
<string name="57410">A large man obviously used to fighting. He&apos;s ready to fight and does not look like he plans on holding back.</string>
<string name="57411">A remarkably calm individual, this halfling gives no outward indication of what he might be thinking.</string>
<string name="57412">This woman is enthralled by combat, showing obvious admiration for anyone who can prove competent in the pit.</string>
<string name="57413">This dwarf eyes you cautiously. He appears sturdy and well groomed, his beard impeccably maintained.</string>
<string name="57414">This woman carries the tools of a healer with her, though from the look of her scars, she has seen a goodly number of battles herself.</string>
<string name="57415">Briley is a young dwarf, and looks earnest but inexperienced. He proudly wears the symbols of Tyr, the Even-Handed.</string>
<string name="57416">This woman looks nervous. Perhaps it is just the plague, but she keeps glancing around her home in an odd manner.</string>
<string name="57417">This man eyes the room carefully, making note of each person present. His cold manner is in stark contrast to the other clientele.</string>
<string name="57418">This gnome is visibly shaking, obviously terrified that you might hurt him.</string>
<string name="57419">This woman looks at you immodestly. She winks and makes an obscene gesture.</string>
<string name="57420">This halfling looks very tense and controlling. He does not look like the type to tolerate visitors in his kitchen.</string>
<string name="57421">A thoroughly unpleasant looking creature, his very manner suggests bully to the core.</string>
<string name="57422">This woman looks at you immodestly with reassuring eyes. She has an honest face.</string>
<string name="57423">This woman appears extremely confident. She watches everything with a knowing eye -- nothing escapes her notice.</string>
<string name="57424">This man looks about the room impassively, patiently waiting for his next customer.</string>
<string name="57425">This noble looks a blustery sort, used to getting his own way.</string>
<string name="57426">The construct stares straight ahead, waiting for some predetermined condition to set it in motion. It looks frighteningly strong and battle-ready.</string>
<string name="57427">This halfling male is enthralled by combat, showing obvious admiration for anyone brave enough to prove competent in the pit.</string>
<string name="57428">An indignant noble, he is a man used to getting his way no matter the cost or obstacles.</string>
<string name="57429">Obviously hostile, this elf looks like a spellcaster. He is well equipped, suggesting that he is a mercenary or an adventurer, and likely dangerous.</string>
<string name="57430">This man looks well equipped and ready to fight. He doesn&apos;t have a uniform, so he&apos;s either a mercenary or an adventurer, and likely dangerous.</string>
<string name="57431">This woman belongs to Neverwinter&apos;s lower middle-class. Her clothes are simple, but dignified. Her manner is understandably downtrodden, given that death is all around.</string>
<string name="57432">This man is ignoring the room, seeming more intent on drinking than on paying attention to what he probably thinks is none of his business.</string>
<string name="57433">This man is slowly dying, his body rotting away from the Wailing Death plague. No doubt it will have affected his mind as well.</string>
<string name="57434">This wandering spirit is obviously distraught. Such phantoms are often unable to rest until the matters of their lives are settled.</string>
<string name="57435">Peninsula: Prison Break</string>
<string name="57436">There&apos;s been a prison break in the Peninsula District. Gate Captain Kipp recommends talking to Sedos Sebile to determine the best means of getting into the Prison and helping out. She&apos;s headquartered in the district&apos;s southeast corner. </string>
<string name="57437">There has been a prison break in the Peninsula District. Aside from the chaos in the district, itself, former prisoners now patrol the prison interior while the former guards beg for rescue from the prison cells. 

On his release, a former cell block captain confirmed that the Head Gaoler, in an unexplained fit of madness, was somehow responsible for the prison break. The Head Gaoler apparently remains in the bowels of the Prison, controlling events with an unseen hand and toward an unknown purpose. </string>
<string name="57438">There has been a prison break in the Peninsula District. Aside from the chaos in the district, itself, former prisoners now patrol the prison interior, killing off the former guards within their cells. Emernik, a former guard on the second floor, has so far managed to dodge the fate of his fellows and was able to shed further light on the goings-on within the complex.

Apparently the Head Gaoler has been conducting some form of experiment on the former guards, torturing them and attempting to somehow influence their minds. Emernik and the guards dead in their cells appear to be the failed subjects of the experiment. What has become of those who succeeded remains unknown.</string>
<string name="57439">There has been a prison break in the Peninsula District. Aside from the chaos in the district, itself, former prisoners now patrol the prison interior, killing off the former guards within their cells.

The dreaded Pits sprawl out beneath the Prison&apos;s second floor. At one time, this was where the guards threw the most unruly of their prisoners. Now those prisoners have seized it for their own and it is the guards who have been thrown out... All except one - the Head Gaoler.</string>
<string name="57440">There has been a prison break in the Peninsula District. Aside from the chaos in the district, itself, former prisoners now patrol the prison interior, killing off the former guards within their cells.

The dreaded Pits sprawl out beneath the Prison&apos;s second floor. At one time, this was where the guards threw the most unruly of their prisoners. Now those prisoners have seized it for their own and it is the guards who have been thrown out.

Kurdan Fenkt, the self-proclaimed &apos;King of the Pits&apos; and second-in-command to the dreaded Head Gaoler has surrendered and told quite a tale... Apparently the Head Gaoler is already long dead, his corpse little more than the walking host of a strange, dog-like creature that lives inside his head, feeding on his brain.

The lair of this strange beast is on the Prison&apos;s fourth and final floor. According to Fenkt, the creature protects itself with a small army of former guards, their minds dominated by the creature&apos;s power. There is a chance they may be freed but the larger goal of destroying the creature must take priority.</string>
<string name="57441">With the death of the strange creature that had consumed the Head Gaoler&apos;s once-noble mind, the Peninsula District has been returned to safety, at least from this immediate threat. The Wailing Death still hangs heavily over the place, however.

The brain of the creature has been salvaged and word of it should taken to local authorites. Sedos Sebile, the ranking officer in the area, will likely offer substantial &apos;danger pay&apos; for the completion of the task.</string>
<string name="57442">Upon being told of the strange creature, Sedos Sebile declared it to be that of an Intellect Devourer, one of the missing creatures sent as part of the plague-cure.

It should be delivered to Lady Aribeth with the greatest of haste, as she would no doubt be happy to learn of its recovery.</string>
<string name="57443">There&apos;s been a prison break in the Peninsula District.</string>
<string name="57444">Peninsula: The Tanglebrook Estate</string>
<string name="57445">A tunnel beneath the Tanglebrook Estate is reputed to provide access into the Prison. The estate lies along the northern shore of the Peninsula, facing the sea, and Lady Tanglebrook apparently keeps a spare key hidden beneath her doormat.</string>
<string name="57446">A key has been found to the Tanglebrook Estate in the Peninsula District. The estate lies on the north shore of the Peninsula, with a nice view of the sea.</string>
<string name="57447">A key to the Tanglebrook Estate has been discovered. The estate rests along the north shore of the Peninsula and is said to have tunnel access into the Prison.</string>
<string name="57448">Lady Tanglebrook has been found dead, in a pool of her own blood, within the oppressing gloom of her Peninsula District tunnels. The menacing statues of an unfinished chess game loomed about her in the dark, silent witnesses to whatever transpired there.

It was no ordinary crime, that is sure. Even in the threadbare light, one could see that her skull had been shattered and the brain either eaten or removed. Whatever killed her, it wasn&apos;t the Wailing Death. Maybe that is reason enough to be thankful. Then again, maybe not... The door into the Prison is not far off.</string>
<string name="57449">Lady Tanglebrook&apos;s tunnel, for all its horrors and oppressive gloom, does indeed offer a route into the dreaded Prison. It opens into a small antechamber just off the former offices of the Head Gaoler. </string>
<string name="57450">Peninsula: The Prison Key</string>
<string name="57451">Sedos Sebile, Commander of militia operations in the Peninsula, has requested help in finding a means into the Prison. She believes that a key to the Prison&apos;s main door might be held by escapees hiding in the sewers in the southwest of the district.</string>
<string name="57452">A key to the Prison&apos;s main entrance has been found on one of the Escaped Prisoners.</string>
<string name="57453">The main door to the Prison in the Peninsula District has been unlocked.</string>
<string name="57454">Temple of Tyr: Never&apos;s Tomb</string>
<string name="57455">Judge Oleff of the Hall of Justice seeks the tomb of Neverwinter&apos;s founder, Lord Halueth Never, in the hopes that it might buoy the people&apos;s spirits and perhaps unearth some artifacts that might be of assistance against the Wailing.

He has requested that those interested in the endeavor present themselves to his assistant, Briley, who currently stands guard over the recently discovered tomb of Miaslaznia Fairblade, one of Halueth&apos;s adventuring companions. Miaslaznia&apos;s tomb can be reached via the cellars of a house on the east side of the Peninsula District.</string>
<string name="57456">Judge Oleff of the Hall of Justice seeks the tomb of Neverwinter&apos;s founder, Lord Halueth Never, in the hopes that it might buoy the people&apos;s spirits and perhaps unearth some artifacts that might be of assistance against the Wailing.

His assistant, Briley, waits by the recently discovered tomb of Miaslaznia Fairblade, one of Halueth&apos;s adventuring companions, and tells a sad tale indeed - like so many others in the city, the entire excavation team responsible for the discovery has passed away of the Wailing Death. The only known documentation of their discovery is a journal left by one of the team members. Briley has secured it in a chest outside of Miaslaznia&apos;s tomb and has encouraged interested parties to examine it in the hopes of deciphering the possible location of other tombs. Miaslaznia&apos;s tomb can be reached via the cellars of a house on the east side of the Peninsula District.</string>
<string name="57457">One of the artifacts from Lord Never&apos;s tomb has been returned to Judge Oleff at the Hall of Justice. According to the excavator&apos;s journal found in one of the early tombs, another two artifacts are believed to be still undiscovered.</string>
<string name="57458">Two of the artifacts from Lord Never&apos;s tomb have been returned to Judge Oleff at the Hall of Justice. According to the excavator&apos;s journal found in one of the early tombs, only one remains undiscovered.</string>
<string name="57459">Three of the artifacts from Lord Never&apos;s tomb have been returned to Judge Oleff at the Hall of Justice. According to the excavator&apos;s journal found in one of the early tombs, one more artifact still remains to be discovered.</string>

Walters also talked about Zelieph, Drawl&apos;s brother and the only man that Drawl was truly afraid of.

He made a deal with a creature named Gulnan, and has become a powerful undead as a result. This bargain also gave him the strength to brutally murder his brother Zelieph, the man who kept Drawl in line and the only person he truly feared. Now Zelieph&apos;s spirit haunts the Beggar&apos;s Nest, and is currently being escorted to meet with his former brother, presumeably to exact revenge. Zelieph is following a former possession of his, a link to his life and a reminder of the treachery that befell him.

<string name="57565">The estate in the northwest of the Beggar&apos;s Nest is home to a snake cult, worshippers of some reptilian creature. It is not clear yet what they might have to do with the undead infestation, and they do not seem willing to offer explanations. They attack intruders on sight. The creature&apos;s name is Gulnan, but where it found the power to infiltrate the group is unknown.</string>
<string name="57566">The estate in the northwest of the Beggar&apos;s Nest houses a cult of snake worshippers. They used to follow Cyric, but a Yuan-Ti called Gulnan converted them by force. She deposed their old leader, and she has been killing any members of the cult that do not accept her as ruler.</string>

She has created the infestation of undead using a necromantic focus that the former leader Jared created, but nobody seems to know how she got powerful enough to use it or defeat him.</string>
<string name="57568">The estate of the snake cult has been thoroughly explored, leading to the discovery of a lair beneath. Likely it is from there, in the Warrens of the Damned, that Gulnan is creating and guiding her army of undead. The infestation she has unleashed on the Beggar&apos;s Nest must be stopped.</string>
<string name="57569">The Wailing and the Waterdhavians</string>
<string name="57570">As the Wailing Death spread across Neverwinter, it was soon apparent that it was not a natural affliction. It couldn&apos;t be cured by normal means, and the holiest of clerics found their divine healing useless. To fortify the city and aid in investigating the plague, Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande called for all adventurers of promise to attend the Neverwinter Academy, and also sought help from some of the greatest wizards in the Realms, including the great archmage of Waterdeep, Khelben &quot;Blackstaff&quot; Arunsun.

Arunsun sent a collection of magical creatures to the city, with instructions on how they might be used as reagents in a potential cure. The beasts were stored at the Academy, and with the most promising recruits graduating, the site became too tempting a target for Neverwinter&apos;s unseen enemy. In the ensuing attack, all but a handful of students were killed, and the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night.

With the viciousness of the still unknown enemy proven, Lady Aribeth called for the survivors to do what they could to find the Waterdhavian creatures, and gather any information on the suspicious origins of the plague. Lady Aribeth hopes that her new recruits will return the beasts to her at the Hall of Justice, where she waits with her lover, Abbot Fenthick Moss, and her peer, Watchknight of Helm, Desther Indelayne.

1. Find the four Waterdhavian creatures and bring them back to Aribeth in any condition - dead or alive.
2. Seek clues about what has caused the plague.
3. Aribeth suggested that the investigation begin in the Peninsula district.
4. A Henchman would be helpful. Most of them are in the building called the &apos;Trade of Blades&apos; in the City Core.
5. Healing potions are invaluable. They can be found in any store.</string>
<string name="57571">Significant strides have been made in the fight against the Wailing Death and those behind it. One of the Waterdhavian creatures - sent by Khelben Arunsun and lost in the attack on the Neverwinter Academy - has been recovered, and has been delivered to Lady Aribeth in the Hall of Justice. She awaits the return of the remaining three beasts in the company of her lover, Abbot Fenthick Moss, and her peer, Watchknight of Helm, Desther Indelayne. Once all have been found, the ritual to create the cure can commence.

1. Find the three remaining Waterdhavian creatures and bring them back to Aribeth in any condition - dead or alive.
2. Seek clues about what has caused the plague.
3. A Henchman would be helpful. Most of them are in the building called the &apos;Trade of Blades&apos; in the City Core.

<string name="57573">Significant strides have been made in the fight against the Wailing Death and those behind it. Now three of the Waterdhavian creatures - sent by Khelben Arunsun and lost in the attack on the Neverwinter Academy - have been recovered, and have been delivered to Lady Aribeth in the Hall of Justice. She awaits the return of the single remaining beast in the company of her lover, Abbot Fenthick Moss, and her peer, Watchknight of Helm, Desther Indelayne. Once all have been found, the ritual to create the cure can commence.

1. Find the one remaining Waterdhavian creature and bring it back to Aribeth in any condition - dead or alive.
2. Seek clues about what has caused the plague.
3. A Henchman would be helpful. Most of them are in the building called the &apos;Trade of Blades&apos; in the City Core.
4. Healing potions are invaluable. They can be found in any store.</string>
<string name="57574">There has been great progress in the fight against the Wailing Death and those behind it. All of the Waterdhavian creatures - sent by Khelben Arunsun and lost in the attack on the Neverwinter Academy - have been recovered and delivered to Lady Aribeth in the Hall of Justice. 

Now that everything is in place, Lady Aribeth awaits her recruits at the Hall of Justice. She will take them to the ritual as soon as they are ready, where they can witness the creation of the cure.

1. Return to Lady Aribeth at the Hall of Justice to be taken to the location of the ritual. It will not be possible to return to the city after this.</string>
<string name="57575">The Great Tree: Animal Rescue</string>
<string name="57576">Nyatar, a druid beneath the great tree in the City Core, claims that animals in a Blacklake District zoo are being ill-treated and require rescue. Nyatar has provided a Teleport Via Plants scroll which is to be used on one of the trees near the zoo. Once broken from their confinement, any animals that are led to the tree will use it to teleport to safety at Nyatar&apos;s side.</string>
<string name="57577">Nyatar is pleased. All of the captive animals have been rescued from the zoo and now benefit from his druidic protection.</string>
<string name="57578">Blacklake: The Gauntlet Arena</string>
<string name="57579">There are rumors of a private warrior&apos;s club called the Gauntlet operating beneath the Board Laid Bare Inn in the Blacklake District. A pass has been obtained from a man named Graxx. Apparently anyone carrying the pass can obtain a key to the club from the bartender. It sounds like the kind of place where strong warriors could probably make a name for themselves.</string>
<string name="57580">There are rumors of a private warrior&apos;s club called the Gauntlet operating beneath the Board Laid Bare Inn in the Blacklake District.

<string name="57581">I&apos;ve been awarded the 1st Round Medal at the Gauntlet warrior&apos;s club, beneath the Blacklake District&apos;s Board Laid Bare Inn. It&apos;s not much, but I&apos;m just getting started...</string>
<string name="57582">I&apos;ve been awarded the 2nd Round Medal at the Gauntlet warrior&apos;s club, beneath the Blacklake District&apos;s Board Laid Bare Inn. There&apos;ll be more where that came from, that&apos;s for sure...</string>

<string name="57584">The Boar Laid Bare is under new managment now. Claudus lost it when he was beaten in the Gauntlet. Unfortunately, he was the driving force behind the club, and all the gladiators have left with him. There should be some profit in owning the place, however.</string>
<string name="57585">The Blacklake District&apos;s Board Laid Bare Inn has fallen under new management. Until further notice, the Gauntlet battle arena held in its basement has been suspended.</string>
<string name="57586">Moonstone Mask: Art Theft</string>
<string name="57587">Ophala Cheldarstorn of the Moonstone Mask has requested the theft of a series of art objects from people who have been critical of her establishment. One of them, a valuable urn possessed by a man named Hodge, is somewhere in the Blacklake District. Another, a portrait of the late Sir Reginald Rumbottom III, is said to be hidden in the Rumbottom estate in the Blacklake as well. The third is a statuette of the female form, reputed to be in the Docks District estate of a certain Androd Golden. Should any of these be &apos;acquired,&apos; Ophala will pay handsomely for them.</string>

<string name="57591">Cloaktower: Membership</string>
<string name="57592">I have applied for membership into the local guild of magic, the Many-Starred Cloak. In the Cloaktower, their glistening guild hall in the City Core, the guild leader, Eltoora Sarptyl, bestowed upon me a key to the guild&apos;s various laboratories throughout the city. Each is marked with a sundial and from them I am to retrieve four items: a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood. She said to mark well the order, whatever that may mean. She also warned to expect dangers along my path, as the four items do not go unguarded.

Once I have obtained all four items, I am to present myself to Eltoora for whatever other tests she may deem necessary.</string>

<string name="57594">Having passed Eltoora&apos;s test, I have now received the mantle of the Many-Starred Cloak and have become a member of the guild. Aside from the prestige and other benefits, it will also grant me more complete access to their stores of magical supplies, that I might make a better practice of my craft. </string>
<string name="57595">Blacklake: Tensions Rising</string>
<string name="57596">Emotions are running high in the Blacklake District, where a group of nobles still unaffected by the Wailing Death have sealed themselves (along with the bulk of the district&apos;s food) behind a second quarantine.</string>
<string name="57597">The tension in the Blacklake District is thick enough to cut with a knife. A warehouser by the name of Meldanen appears to be hoarding food for his wealthy friends. He&apos;s apparently holed himself up in his estate, somewhere to the northwest.</string>
<string name="57598">It turns out that Meldanen, the Blacklake sorcerer responsible for the district&apos;s recent unrest, has been keeping one of the Waterdhavian creatures for himself. He holds the dryad in a cage within his private quarters. The key to the cage has been discovered only recently.</string>
<string name="57599">It turns out that Meldanen, the Blacklake sorcerer responsible for the district&apos;s recent unrest, has been keeping one of the Waterdhavian creatures for himself. Luckily, the dryad has been found and a lock of her hair that Lady Aribeth requires to forge the cure has been taken.

While injustices may still remain within the District, Lady Aribeth will be happy to learn that the matter of most pressing concern is now resolved.</string>
<string name="57600">Blacklake: Unrest</string>
<string name="57601">There are dark rumors circulating throughout the Blacklake District regarding a rabble-rouser named Formosa. Apparently she has dared to speak out against the sorcerer, Meldanen. Judging by the tension in the district, she&apos;s managed to convince a fair number of others to do the same.</string>
<string name="57602">A noble by the name of Formosa harangues the crowd gathered in the Blacklake&apos;s central square. She claims that, from behind his well-guarded gates, the sorcerer, Meldanen, is hoarding food from the plaguestruck.

Not only has she demanded the key to the warehouse where he has secured his grain, she has also called for his death. One of the sorcerer&apos;s teeth is of pure silver and she will gladly accept it as evidence of the deed.</string>

<string name="57606">Formosa&apos;s thirst for Meldanen&apos;s blood and hunger for his grain have both been sated. His silver tooth and the key to his warehouse have been given to her.</string>
<string name="57607">Blacklake: Killing Formosa</string>
<string name="57608">Desperation is the hallmark of a good bargain. It seems the sorcerer Meldanen wants to turn the tables on the rabble-rouser, Formosa. While she&apos;s been calling publicly for his death in the district square, Meldanen has put out a more private (and also more lucrative) offer on her own life.</string>

It seems that his more surreptitious means have met with success, as the Lady Formosa is no longer counted among the living.</string>
<string name="57610">Lady Formosa is dead at the request of Meldanen the sorcerer. He has given her assassins their wage and all that remains is to sweep all further talk of it under the carpet where it belongs.</string>
<string name="57611">Blacklake: Meldanen Estate Entrance</string>
<string name="57612">Laundry women to the rich and famous have their fair share of intrigue, too, it seems. In the Blacklake District, one had an ongoing affair with the great sorcerer Meldanen, himself. More important, however, is the fact that the sorcerer built a secret passage connecting her meager house to his estate. Should I need a route in, it sounds easier than trying to get past the guards posted at his front gate. </string>
<string name="57613">The Blacklake laundry woman spoke true - The secret passage in her home does indeed lead to the Meldanen estate. Even paranoid sorcerers enjoy the luxury of a back door, it seems.</string>
<string name="57614">Blacklake: Samuel&apos;s Rescue</string>
<string name="57615">There are reports circulating that a militia member by the name of Samuel has gone missing in the Blacklake District. His head officer, Thurin, has more details about the circumstances. Thurin can be found in the Board Laid Bare tavern.</string>
<string name="57616">Thurin, a militia officer in the Blacklake District, has offered a reward for the safe return of one of his men. The lost soldier, Samuel, was a close friend of Thurin&apos;s and his failure to report back following a recent inspection assignment has caused the officer no small amount of worry.</string>
<string name="57617">Recent evidence seems to suggest that Samuel, a militia soldier previously reported as &apos;missing in action,&apos; is being held captive within Meldanen&apos;s estate in the Blacklake District. A key to his prison cell has been found, however, and hopes are high for his imminent release.
</string>
<string name="57618">Samuel, a militia soldier previously reported as &apos;missing in action,&apos; was recently freed from his captivity within Meldanen&apos;s estate in the Blacklake District. Grateful for his rescue, he will be returning to file a report with his commanding officer, Thurin, at the Board Laid Bare tavern. Those responsible for his rescue are encouraged to speak with Thurin regarding their reward. </string>
<string name="57619">Thurin, a militia officer in the Blacklake District, has rewarded the adventurers who rescued Samuel from his imprisonment in the Meldanen estate. Word of their assistance will be passed on to Lady Aribeth who will no doubt be pleased with their admirable service.</string>

<string name="57621">Adventurers are investigating the recent civil strife in the Blacklake District.</string>
<string name="57622">In their continuing effort to resolve the civil strife in the Blacklake District, adventurers have recently broken into the estate of the sorcerer, Meldanen. A wealthy warehouser, Meldanen has been accused of hoarding food from the district&apos;s starving citizens.</string>
<string name="57623">In attempting to resolve the civil strife in the Blacklake District, adventurers inadvertently managed to secure a reagent to the Wailing&apos;s cure from the Meldanen Estate. Aribeth will offer a substantial reward to any party that returns it to her.</string>
<string name="57624">This person looks to have been overwhelmed by the horde of undead that now lay around him. He must have put up quite a fight, judging by the severity of his wounds, though it did him no good in the end.

<string name="57688">The ritual can now begin. Desther, Fenthick and Aribeth have added their skill to the ritual, mixing arcane and divine energy. The cure for the Wailing Death is within Neverwinter&apos;s reach.</string>
<string name="57689">Disaster! The ritual to complete the cure for the Wailing Death has worked as planned, but Desther has proven to be a traitor and has stolen the result. He has fled through a magical portal while his False Helmites attacked, and Fenthick has followed.</string>
<string name="57690">A Devil&apos;s Deal</string>
<string name="57691">It stands there, flaunting its evil, with all the time in the world. Chaohinon of the Void is the name of it. Apparently the False Helmites summoned it to crush the Guardian Spirit that watches over Helm&apos;s Hold. The demon has done just that, but has not been set free, and now wants someone to find a Black Grimoire and finish the ritual to set it loose upon the world. It promises adequate reward, but they always do, don&apos;t they?</string>
<string name="57692">Chaohinon of the Void has been unleashed to inflict his evil upon the world, an act that will no doubt bring consequences. But who cares, so long as the reward was sufficient? It was, wasn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="57693">Chaohinon of the Void has been unleashed to inflict its evil upon the world, an act that will no doubt bring consequences. Attempting to refuse a reward for freeing it did no good. The taint of the act has already left its mark. </string>
<string name="57694">Chaohinon of the Void has been banished back to the dark hells that spawned him. In his place has risen the Guardian Spirit of Helm&apos;s Hold. The demon had thought the Spirit destroyed, but it was only suppressed beneath the invading evil. Now it is free to aid in defending against Desther and the cult that has ravaged the Hold so severely. The Spirit offered reward, but it was refused.</string>

Now it is free to aid in defending against Desther and the cult that has ravaged the Hold so severely. The Spirit offered reward, and it was gladly accepted.</string>
<string name="57696">Sins of a Traitor</string>
<string name="57697">Disaster! The ritual to complete the cure for the Wailing Death has worked as planned, but Desther has proven to be a traitor and has stolen the result. He has fled through a magical portal while his False Helmites attacked, and Fenthick has followed. The reasons for this great deception are unknown, as are Fenthick&apos;s motivations in following Desther. Aribeth now strains to maintain the magical portal in the hopes that someone can follow the two, though there is little hope that this can come to a peaceful end.</string>
<string name="57698">Emerging from the magical portal, Desther and Fenthick are nowhere to be seen. There is, however, a formidable keep immediately ahead. Even from a distance the proud symbols of Helm on its banners and stonework are easily visible. This is no temporary encampment meant to disguise Desther&apos;s False Helmites. This is, or was, a well-fortified bastion of Helmite worship, and if Desther and his foul brethren have taken it, it was with the deaths of many a good and devout true Helmite. It is doubtful that Fenthick would have had any part of such an action, but his motives for following Desther are, as yet, unknown. The oly thing that is certain, is that somewhere inside is the cure for the plague. It must be found.</string>
<string name="57699">Dumal was found in the cells beneath Helm&apos;s Hold, where he&apos;s been a prisoner since shortly after Desther and his False Helmites arrived. He says that Desther only took the Hold as a staging area, using it to launch an attack on somewhere else, presumably Neverwinter. This was after the plague began, reinforcing the idea that Desther did not start the Wailing, but he did have a vested interest in spreading and prolonging it. Whoever his cult masters are, they wanted as much death to the disease as possible.</string>
<string name="57700">Fenthick has been found in Helm&apos;s Hold. He is a broken man. His reasons for following Desther are innocent, but selfish, and may cost all of Neverwinter dearly. He desperately needed Desther to prove himself worth trusting. If Fenthick helped him one last time, or spoke up for him just a little more, there was the slimmest of hope that this would all turn out to be a mistake. In Fenthick&apos;s mind, if Desther was definitely a traitor, then he himself had helped the man kill thousands of innocent people under the guise of helping them. Rather than accept this burden, Fenthick hoped to prove it mistaken. He was not able to, and must accept his role in this crime against Neverwinter. He no longer cares about his fate, though it is certain that the people of Neverwinter will. He has been the advocate of the greatest villain they have ever known, and their vengeance will not separate the two.</string>
<string name="57701">Desther is near. He seemingly intends to make his last stand here to prove his worth to the cult that put him up to all of this. He likely still has the cure, though whether he intends to use it as bait or bargaining power is unknown. He must be brought to justice. Only then will the reasons behind this horrible attack be known. The toll has been too great to let these questions go unanswered.</string>
<string name="57702">A strange woman has delivered an unsettling message outside of Helm&apos;s Hold. She claimed that Desther had served his purpose and was no longer needed. He now struggles to fortify in the Hold, hoping to raise enough undead to protect himself. The woman claimed that he would serve as a lesson that your fate cannot be avoided, and that Neverwinter should learn from this. Then she was gone.</string>
<string name="57703">Fenthick is utterly broken, looking as though his world has been shattered. He barely acknowledges his surroundings.</string>
<string name="57704">Fenthick looks absolutely elated. He is certain that the cure for the plague is mere moments away. He is smiling broadly at Desther.</string>
<string name="57705">Desther looks strangely calm, like he has complete control of the situation. He repeatedly scans the room, taking note of every detail.</string>
<string name="57706">Lord Nasher is a regal looking man, easy to picture as an adventurer in his youth. He is showing early symptoms of the plague, however.</string>
<string name="57707">A devout of Tyr, this priest proudly wears the symbols of his faith.</string>
<string name="57708">Uskar</string>
<string name="57709">This woman appears... odd. The air around her is cold, and her features are impossible to discern. She may actually be some sort of illusion.</string>
<string name="57710">Strange Visage</string>
<string name="57711">This dwarf watches over his land, looking for anything out of the ordinary. He seems concerned, as though he is expecting something to happen.</string>
<string name="57712">Guardian Armor</string>
<string name="57713">This animated suit of armor is adorned with the markings of Helm, the Watcher, god of guardians.</string>
<string name="57714">This infernal creatures radiates evil, so much so that you begin to feel sick just looking at it.</string>
<string name="57715">This man looks like he has been imprisoned for weeks, and given barely enough food and water to survive.</string>
<string name="57716">This half-orc is raving, and looks absolutely insane.</string>
<string name="57717">This young man cowers before you, deathly afraid.</string>
<string name="57718">This fanatical underling of Desther still wears the tatters of the robe he and his cohorts used to impersonate the good followers of Helm.</string>
<string name="57719">This is one of the undead Desther is presumably raising to try and fill the ranks of his fallen False Helmites.</string>
<string name="57720">Desther is absolutely incensed, frantically attempting to complete his ritual. His plans are crumbling around him, and he does not look pleased.</string>
<string name="57721">This hastily ensorcelled collection of body parts is channeling raw magical energy. Desther is doubtless conducting some sort of ritual to fortify his position.</string>
<string name="57722">Me not who you think. You got me mixed up with some other one.</string>
<string name="57723">No, I think you have me confused with someone else.</string>
<string name="57724">Yes, me be &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="57725">Yes, I am &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="57726">Me not care &apos;bout honor! Me only here cause me want to get lots of gold and magic stuff!</string>
<string name="57727">Me got lots of talent. Me used to honors like this by now.</string>
<string name="57728">It be a big honor for me to serve Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="57729">Who cares about honor? I just came because I sense the potential for real profit.</string>
<string name="57730">Me not really interested in talking at you.</string>
<string name="57731">Tell me &apos;bout you brother.</string>
<string name="57732">What you mean &apos;bout guards not keeping order?</string>
<string name="57733">Me not actually know much &apos;bout plague.</string>
<string name="57734">I&apos;m not really interested in chatting with you.</string>
<string name="57735">Tell me about your brother.</string>
<string name="57736">What did you mean about the city guard barely able to keep order?</string>
<string name="57737">I don&apos;t actually know that much about the plague.</string>
<string name="57738">Me not care &apos;bout this. Me want to go now.</string>
<string name="57739">Sound like whole city be in big trouble.</string>
<string name="57740">You not got cleric or priest who can help?</string>
<string name="57741">There be somebody who look for cure?</string>
<string name="57742">Great story. I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="57743">Sounds like the whole city is doomed.</string>
<string name="57744">Can&apos;t the clerics and priests do anything to help?</string>
<string name="57745">Shouldn&apos;t someone be looking for a cure?</string>
<string name="57746">Me want go now.</string>
<string name="57747">You know more &apos;bout cure rumors?</string>
<string name="57748">You got other stuff you tell me &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="57749">I think it&apos;s time for me to go now.</string>
<string name="57750">Do you know anything more about these rumors of a cure?</string>
<string name="57751">Can you tell me anything else about this plague?</string>
<string name="57752">When you have as much talent and skill as I do you get used to these kind of honors.</string>
<string name="57753">It is both an honor and a privilege for me to serve Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="57754">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="57755">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="57756">I want to ask you some more questions.</string>
<string name="57757">Anything else?</string>
<string name="57758">What you know &apos;bout rumors of plague cure?</string>
<string name="57759">You tell more &apos;bout plague.</string>
<string name="57760">Anything else you can tell me?</string>
<string name="57761">Tell me more about these rumors of a plague cure.</string>
<string name="57762">Tell me more about the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="57763">My name&apos;s Pavel, I&apos;m one of the new recruits. I just arrived here at the Academy this morning. You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="57764">Oh, come on. They told me I&apos;d be bunking in your old quarters. Besides, everybody at the Academy is talking about you.</string>
<string name="57765">Is it true what they say about you? That Lady Aribeth herself ordered the Academy to send you an invitation to come here for training? </string>
<string name="57766">I&apos;ve never heard of anyone being invited to train at the Academy before. Usually people are begging to get in. It must be a great honor for you.</string>
<string name="57767">Ah, I see by your speech you are a little slow, friend. And a bit materialistic, too. But not all of us came to the Academy seeking gold.</string>
<string name="57768">Ah, I see by your speech you are a little slow, friend. Not to mention conceited. For some of us it wasn&apos;t so easy to get into the Academy.</string>
<string name="57769">You&apos;re pretty modest for someone who&apos;s got such high expectations on &lt;him/her&gt;. And you seem a little... slow, too. Strange you would have had such an easy time getting in to the Academy.</string>
<string name="57770">So you&apos;re just in it for the money, are you? Well, I guess you aren&apos;t the only one. But some of us came to the Academy for a different reason.</string>
<string name="57771">My brother Bim and I were working on one of the nearby farms outside the city when we heard Lady Aribeth had put out a call for heroes to come to the aid of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="57772">We knew the city was suffering, but we didn&apos;t realize how bad things were until we got here. We arrived just before they sealed the gates and quarantined the city.</string>
<string name="57773">Thank the Gods I got accepted into the Academy. I wouldn&apos;t want to be out there on the streets with the plague - not with the city guards barely able to keep order anymore.</string>
<string name="57774">Bim? He&apos;s here, too, over by the door. He&apos;s kind of a know-it-all, but if you ever want any advice or hints on adventuring, he&apos;s the guy to talk to. Doesn&apos;t know that much about the plague, though.</string>
<string name="57775">The Wailing Death is a plague worse than any recorded in the entire history of Neverwinter. The whole city has been quarantined; nobody is allowed in or out.</string>
<string name="57776">The Neverwinter militia do their best to enforce the quarantine, but people don&apos;t like being trapped inside the walls of a plague-infested city.</string>
<string name="57777">Every day, more bodies pile up in the streets and the citizens move one step closer to panic and open rebellion. Can&apos;t say I blame them. It&apos;s only been a few months and already the dead number in the thousands.</string>
<string name="57778">Yeah, I guess you want to get on with your training. Well, good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Who knows... maybe the next time we meet those rumors of a cure for the Wailing Death will turn out to be true.</string>
<string name="57779">Don&apos;t forget to say hi to my twin brother Bim over there by the door on your way out.</string>
<string name="57780">Most people have given up any hope of finding a cure for the Wailing Death. Potions and medicinal herbs do nothing and even the prayers of the city&apos;s most powerful clergy have been ineffective.</string>
<string name="57781">I guess that&apos;s why Lady Aribeth ordered the Academy to open its doors to new recruits. The city needs a hero - someone who can save us all from the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="57782">The word on the street is that Aribeth is actually working on a cure right here in the Academy. But that&apos;s just a rumor... probably not even true.</string>
<string name="57783">You&apos;re pretty full of yourself! Hope you have the skills to back up that confidence. But for some of us things don&apos;t come that easy.</string>
<string name="57784">You&apos;re pretty modest for someone who&apos;s got such high expectations on &lt;him/her&gt;. It wasn&apos;t quite so easy for me to get into the Academy.</string>
<string name="57785">Hello again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m surprised you&apos;re still here - I thought you&apos;d be anxious to go see Olgerd in the next room so you can finish your training.</string>
<string name="57786">Yes, I suppose you need to get on with your training. You probably need to go speak to Olgerd in the next room and get your equipment so you can take the final tests and finish your training.</string>
<string name="57787">If you want any tips or instruction on adventuring then don&apos;t forget to say hi to my brother Bim on your way out.</string>
<string name="57788">I don&apos;t know how much I can tell you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I&apos;ll do my best to help. We&apos;re all going to have to work together if we want to survive the Wailing Death... unless those rumors about a cure turn out to be true.</string>
<string name="57789">You could speak to my brother Bim over by the door if you want some tips on adventuring. Otherwise, you should go see Olgerd in the next room. He&apos;s the one in charge of equipping all us recruits for our training.</string>
<string name="57790">Other than that, I don&apos;t know what more to tell you. I&apos;m just a raw recruit here; you&apos;re the one who&apos;s almost finished &lt;his/her&gt; training.</string>
<string name="57791">I only know what people are saying on the street. Some claim Aribeth has a cure and she&apos;s going to start passing it out soon. Others claim she&apos;s keeping the cure for herself.</string>
<string name="57792">But like I said, it&apos;s just rumors. Maybe some of the people who&apos;ve been here at the Academy longer than I have would know more about the cure... if there even is one.</string>
<string name="57793">I don&apos;t know what more I can say about the plague. Everyone in the city is afraid of the Wailing Death. The bodies are piling up in the streets and the citizens are on the verge of panic and open rebellion.</string>
<string name="57794">So far there doesn&apos;t seem to be any cure, and even the priests can&apos;t help those afflicted. I just hope those rumors of a cure for the plague turn out to be true.</string>
<string name="57795">Finally, you&apos;re up. I was afraid you were going to sleep all day. I guess the instructors work you pretty hard here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="57796">Protect the Waterdhavian creatures! Don&apos;t let the attackers get them!</string>
<string name="57797">But you&apos;ve heard all this before, I&apos;m sure. Here, I&apos;ve got some equipment for you. A &lt;class&gt; like you might find it handy in completing your training.</string>
<string name="57798">Now, if you&apos;re ready I&apos;ll give you a tutorial on how to access your inventory so you can use that equipment I just gave you.</string>
<string name="57799">You stick monster in cages and do nasty experiments on them?</string>
<string name="57800">You got an arena where me can fight against them monsters?</string>
<string name="57801">So you imprison these creatures and experiment on them?</string>
<string name="57802">Is there an arena where I can I fight against these creatures?</string>
<string name="57803">Hmmm... how can I explain this so someone as simple as you can understand? Think of it this way... a menagerie is kind of like a zoo.</string>
<string name="57804">If someone was storing exotic creatures here at the Academy they&apos;d want to consult with me first, right? But I haven&apos;t heard anything about it and we haven&apos;t added any animals to the Menagerie in months.</string>
<string name="57805">We allow our students to study the creatures and their habits up close, so that they will be better prepared when they encounter such beasts in the wild.</string>
<string name="57806">Hey, we&apos;re not savages! The animals are here for us to observe, not to butcher! Every month, Yusam, the local druid, comes by to inspect the creatures and make sure they&apos;re treated right.</string>
<string name="57807">And I&apos;m always watching for signs of injury or illness. Every one of my animals is well fed and properly cared for. I look after my charges. I&apos;m like their father.</string>
<string name="57808">We&apos;ve taken every precaution - including powerful spells of binding - to make the Menagerie completely safe for both visitors and the creatures inside.</string>
<string name="57809">Just head on through the door here whenever you&apos;re ready to view the wonders of my little beasties.</string>
<string name="57810">Hello there. You must be &lt;FullName&gt;, the one I&apos;ve heard all the instructors talking about. They&apos;re mighty impressed with you, I must say.</string>
<string name="57811">It&apos;s a pleasure to finally meet you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m Ferdinand, the Academy&apos;s resident Keeper of Exotic Creatures. I was afraid you wouldn&apos;t make it by my little corner before you completed your training here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="57812">So, have you come here to view the Menagerie? Or was there something else I could do for you?</string>
<string name="57813">Me wants to get to combat trial test things.</string>
<string name="57814">I just want to get to the combat trials.</string>
<string name="57815">Me needs yous to go over basic stuff.</string>
<string name="57816">I need you to go over basic training.</string>
<string name="57817">Me finished! What nows?</string>
<string name="57818">I have completed my training. What now, sir?</string>
<string name="57819">What aspect of training did you need to cover? I can go back over the basics, or do you just want to get to the trials?</string>
<string name="57820">It&apos;s time for you to leave the Academy and face the world.</string>
<string name="57821">I don&apos;t normally do this but I like you, recruit. Here, take this gift for passing the test. Now you&apos;re ready to leave the Academy and face the world.</string>
<string name="57822">You can also cast spells without using the quickbar by right-clicking on your target before casting a spell. This brings up a menu you can use to select the spell to be cast at the creature or object you clicked on.</string>
<string name="57823">There is nothing more I can teach you. It&apos;s time for you to leave the Academy and face the world.</string>
<string name="57824">But before you go please accept this gift as a reward for completing your training. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="57825">You can also cast spells without using the quickbar by right-clicking on your target before casting a spell. This brings up a menu you can use to select the spell to be cast at the creature or object you clicked on.</string>
<string name="57826">It is time for you to leave the Academy and venture forth into the world. Before you go is there anything else you require?</string>
<string name="57827">But before you go please accept this gift as a reward for completing your training. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="57828">As a reward for completing your training let me give you this gift. After all, what&apos;s the point of doing something if you don&apos;t get a reward in the end, right?</string>
<string name="57829">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="57830">How me rest?</string>
<string name="57831">How do I rest?</string>
<string name="57832">How me access quickbar and character sheets?</string>
<string name="57833">How do I access my quickbar and character sheet?</string>
<string name="57834">How me access menu and abilities?</string>
<string name="57835">How do I access my menus and abilites?</string>
<string name="57836">Camera control.</string>
<string name="57837">Me want whole tutorial thing again. Right from start.</string>
<string name="57838">I want to hear the whole tutorial again. Right from the beginning.</string>
<string name="57839">Me not need tutorial now.</string>
<string name="57840">I&apos;m not interested in a tutorial right now.</string>
<string name="57841">Me need you say character sheet stuff again.</string>
<string name="57842">Can you repeat that stuff about the character sheet?</string>
<string name="57843">Go on.</string>
<string name="57844">Okay.</string>
<string name="57845">Go on.</string>
<string name="57846">Me not need tutorial now.</string>
<string name="57847">I&apos;m not interested in a tutorial right now.</string>
<string name="57848">Okay.</string>
<string name="57849">Okay.</string>
<string name="57850">Okay.</string>
<string name="57851">If you ever need a refresher course on this tutorial just come speak to me again.</string>
<string name="57852">In order to rest, just left-click on the rest button below your portrait in the upper right corner of the screen.</string>
<string name="57853">Remember to rest often. Resting heals you, it lets you prepare spells, and it restores any feats or special abilities you may have used up.</string>
<string name="57854">Okay, we&apos;ll start right from the beginning again.</string>
<string name="57855">Suit yourself. You should go through this door and speak to Olgerd, then. He&apos;ll get you set up with all the equipment you need to finish your training here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="57856">The character sheet displays your ability scores in a window on the screen. It also shows other important statistics for your character such as Armor Class and hit points.</string>
<string name="57857">In the top of the character sheet window are several tabs. Clicking on these tabs will bring up sheets displaying your skills, feats and spells.</string>
<string name="57858">Okay, we&apos;re almost done with the tutorial now. There&apos;s just one last thing left for me to teach you, if you&apos;re ready to go on.</string>
<string name="57859">Just to let you know, you can break out of a conversation at any time by pressing the &quot;ESC&quot; key on your keyboard or by walking away from the character you are speaking to. Now, let&apos;s begin the tutorial.</string>
<string name="57860">Whenever you left-click with your mouse on a creature or object in the game, your character performs a default action. Default left-click actions include speaking to a person, attacking a monster or opening doors and chests.</string>
<string name="57861">Suit yourself. You should go through this door and speak to Olgerd, then. He&apos;ll get you set up with all the equipment you need to finish your training here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="57862">Okay, I guess we&apos;re done with the cameras then.</string>
<string name="57863">Done. Okay, that&apos;s it for the camera tutorial recap.</string>
<string name="57864">Forget it.</string>
<string name="57865">Fine - I&apos;ll try to find my own way out of here. Thanks for nothing, &lt;FirstName&gt;!</string>
<string name="57866">So have you reconsidered? Can I join up with you now? It&apos;s the only chance I have of getting out of here alive!</string>
<string name="57867">Where are the damn creatures!</string>
<string name="57868">Don&apos;t let any of them live!</string>
<string name="57869">Kill Aribeth, she&apos;s the most dangerous!</string>
<string name="57870">We must find the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="57871">This man looks vicious and hateful. His nondescript apparel gives no indication of what group or individual he might work for.</string>
<string name="57872">This instructor looks at you critically. Everyone at the Academy must prove his or her worth, and he expects no less from you.</string>
<string name="57873">This student seems confident and able, appropriately enough given that he is graduating with you. Hopefully he&apos;ll be ready for the troubled times ahead.</string>
<string name="57874">This student seems confident and able, appropriately enough given that she is graduating with you. Hopefully she&apos;ll be ready for the troubled times ahead.</string>

<string name="57878">Academy Training</string>
<string name="57879">You have trained long at the Academy, and today is your final day. To begin your adventures in Neverwinter, speak with each of the instructors in the complex. All will be able to give you tutorial information about basic skills. You will need to complete one last lesson depending on whether your main focus is combat, rogue skills, divine magic, or arcane sorcery. Bards will be able to complete any one of these tests, while most other classes must report to the expert in their chosen field. </string>
<string name="57880">You have finished training. Proceed to Aribeth to receive your blessing and to learn what the future holds for you now that you have learned the basics of your chosen field. The guard at the south door will now let you pass to the graduation room </string>
<string name="57881">You have received your blessing from Aribeth, but the ceremony was interrupted by an attack on the Academy. It appears the mysterious assailants are after the Waterdhavian creatures. These were the beasts sent from Waterdeep as components of the great spell that was meant to cure the Wailing Death plague. Aribeth wants you to help find and protect the Waterdhavian creatures. Go through the locked door that was in the hallway leading to the Graduation Room. It leads to where the Waterdhavian creatures were being kept. Aribeth has given you the key.</string>
<string name="57882">Pavel will act as a Henchman for you, following your directions and aiding in combat. It would be wise to allow him to accompany you. The way ahead is likely dangerous, and it is very important you survive to reach the Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="57883">Though Aribeth has directed you to hurry and find out whether the Waterdhavian creatures are safe, you must level up before continuing. Geldar will direct you on how to do this.</string>
<string name="57884">Having learned how to Level Up, you may now proceed past Geldar. The Waterdhavian creatures are somewhere up ahead, and you will need a full understanding of all you have learned if you are to help protect them.</string>
<string name="57885">You have encountered Fenthick and Desther. Fenthick is an advisor to Aribeth, and is also her betrothed. Desther is a Helmite helping in the defense of the plague, and he seems unimpressed with the efforts of those involved so far. Fenthick has asked that you proceed to the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter to begin your quest for the cause and cure of the Wailing Death plague.</string>
<string name="57886">Leaving the Graduation Room, you are immediately aware of how serious and widespread the attack actually was. The Training Area is in disarray, with disciplined instruction now replaced by the chaotic noise of life or death combat. The invaders are moving through the Academy searching for the Waterdhavian creatures. You will have to move quickly if you are to find them first. The cure for the Wailing Death depends on it.</string>
<string name="57887">Rogue Skill Training</string>
<string name="57888">To complete the Rogue training test, you must return one of three keys to Ketta. To get one of the keys, you may either pick the lock on the chest, disarm the trap, or pickpocket her assistant. You may also attempt to convince the assistant to give you the key. Regardless, once you have one of the keys, return it to Ketta to complete your training.</string>
<string name="57889">You have returned one of the keys to Ketta and completed the Rogue training. You may proceed to the Graduation Room past the south exit.</string>
<string name="57890">Combat Training</string>
<string name="57891">To complete Combat training you must speak with both of Herban&apos;s assistants. Along the south wall of the room, Dendy will instruct you in the basics of melee combat. Along the west wall, Hewwet will see to the basics of ranged weaponry.</string>
<string name="57892">Having completed the basics of melee combat with Dendy, you should speak with Hewwet along the west wall of the room. He will finish your combat training with the basics of ranged weaponry.</string>
<string name="57893">Having completed the basics of ranged weaponry with Hewwet, you should speak with Dendy along the south wall of the room. He will finish your combat training with the basics of melee combat.</string>
<string name="57894">You have completed basic combat training. You should proceed to the Graduation Room past the south exit of the training area.</string>
<string name="57895">Divine Spellcaster Training</string>
<string name="57896">To pass the Divine Spellcaster test, you must use your healing spells to heal the man along the south wall of the room. Return to Elynwyd when you have done so.</string>
<string name="57897">To pass the Divine Spellcaster test, you must use your healing spells to heal the man along the south wall of the room, and also use your ability to turn undead on the skeleton along the north wall. Return to Elynwyd when you have completed both of these tasks.</string>
<string name="57898">You have completed the basic Divine Spellcasting test, and may now proceed through the south exit of the training area and into the Graduation Room.</string>
<string name="57899">Arcane Spellcaster Training</string>
<string name="57900">To complete Arcane Spellcaster training Jaroo has directed you to destroy a statue in the center of the room. If you do not have a destructive spell prepared there are two scrolls in the chest along the north wall of the room. You can scribe these scrolls to your spellbook, prepare them, and then cast the spells at the statue. Alternatively, you could just use the scrolls directly to destroy the statue. Speak with Jaroo when you have finished.</string>
<string name="57901">You have completed basic Arcane Spellcaster training. You should now proceed through the south exit of the training area and enter the Graduation Room.</string>
<string name="57902">Bim</string>
<string name="57903">This instructor looks at you critically. Everyone at the Academy must prove his or her worth, and she expects no less from you.</string>
<string name="57904">This half-orc looks friendly enough. He doesn&apos;t seem like the smartest of creatures.</string>
<string name="57905">This Academy student seems confident and able, and is likely close to finishing his training here. Hopefully he&apos;ll be ready for the troubled times ahead.</string>

<string name="57908">A simple archery target.</string>
<string name="57909">A leather-bound straw-stuffed dummy used for combat training.</string>
<string name="57910">Ferdinand</string>
<string name="57911">Ferdinand appears more relaxed than the other staff of the Academy. Likely he is here for his affinity with exotic beasts, rather than military training.</string>
<string name="57912">This elven student seems confident and able, appropriately enough given that she is graduating with you. Hopefully she&apos;ll be ready for the troubled times ahead.</string>
<string name="57913">Pavel looks very concerned about what has happened. He seems unsure of what to do next.</string>
<string name="57914">The Waterdhavian Yuan-Ti appears cold and reptilian, appropriately enough. She looks determined not to be recaptured.</string>
<string name="57915">Dryads are exquisitely beautiful tree sprites found deep in secluded woodlands. This one looks absolutely terrified.</string>

<string name="58014">I&apos;m going to try something; cover me.</string>
<string name="58015">We&apos;d better wait a minute.</string>
<string name="58016">I think I see the goddess&apos;s face. I don&apos;t want to go yet.</string>
<string name="58017">Why is everything spinning?</string>
<string name="58018">I can&apos;t cast spells with all of this going on.</string>
<string name="58019">My weapon just bounces right off.</string>
<string name="58020">This way, dear. Come on.</string>
<string name="58021">Now, what would that be?</string>
<string name="58022">We&apos;d better close ranks before we get hit.</string>
<string name="58023">Healer coming through; move out of the way people.</string>
<string name="58024">We should try to pick the lock quietly first.</string>
<string name="58025">Let&apos;s spend a little time and check this place out.</string>
<string name="58026">Hey, could we make a little less noise here please.</string>
<string name="58027">All right dear, I&apos;m getting to it.</string>
<string name="58028">Uh... I don&apos;t think I can do that. Sorry.</string>
<string name="58029">I&apos;m all done here.</string>

<string name="58032">Hey there dear, how&apos;s it going?</string>
<string name="58033">By Sehanine, I should say so!</string>
<string name="58034">I don&apos;t think so.</string>
<string name="58035">Hold on a minute.</string>
<string name="58036">On a journey there must always be time to rest.</string>
<string name="58037">Well, this is certainly one way of not getting anywhere.</string>
<string name="58038">I&apos;ll miss you, dear one.</string>
<string name="58039">Thank you. I couldn&apos;t ask for a better friend.</string>
<string name="58040">Takasi! Oh, excuse my elven.</string>
<string name="58041">Yes. All right!</string>
<string name="58042">Not feeling very talkative today, dear?</string>
<string name="58043">That makes sense to me, dear.</string>
<string name="58044">Did you think that through, or are you just grasping at straws?</string>
<string name="58045">I&apos;m going to kill you, then bring you back to life so I can kill you again.</string>
<string name="58046">Let&apos;s deal with these!</string>
<string name="58047">To battle!</string>
<string name="58048">We shall not be defeated!</string>
<string name="58049">Out of our way!</string>
<string name="58050">I need healing! Quickly!</string>
<string name="58051">I cannot keep up with this!</string>
<string name="58052">I hope you didn&apos;t invite them.</string>
<string name="58053">We&apos;ve got to get out of here!</string>
<string name="58054">Come on! Come on!</string>
<string name="58055">Watch my back!</string>
<string name="58056">Hold.</string>
<string name="58057">Blast! I won&apos;t let it end like this!</string>
<string name="58058">Bloody poison!</string>
<string name="58059">I can&apos;t get my spell off!</string>
<string name="58060">My attack does nothing!</string>
<string name="58061">Follow me for a moment.</string>

<string name="58063">Let&apos;s stay together.</string>

<string name="58069">Sorry.</string>
<string name="58070">Done and done!</string>

<string name="58073">Hello there!</string>
<string name="58074">It is.</string>
<string name="58075">Afraid not.</string>
<string name="58076">Hold!</string>
<string name="58077">I need to sit down, just for a bit.</string>
<string name="58078">Some excitement would be welcome.</string>
<string name="58079">I wish you well.</string>
<string name="58080">Thank you kindly.</string>
<string name="58081">Blast!</string>
<string name="58082">Ha ha!</string>

<string name="58084">Sounds fine to me.</string>
<string name="58085">Hmm... I don&apos;t know...</string>
<string name="58086">You better watch it!</string>
<string name="58087">Let&apos;s get them!</string>
<string name="58088">You leave me no choice!</string>
<string name="58089">Glory to the Emperor!</string>
<string name="58090">For the Empire!</string>
<string name="58091">I&apos;m afraid&#8230; I need some healing.</string>
<string name="58092">Help me!</string>
<string name="58093">I see the enemy.</string>
<string name="58094">It is time to rethink our strategy.</string>
<string name="58095">Ah! Are you afraid to face a woman?</string>
<string name="58096">Protect me!</string>
<string name="58097">Guard this position.</string>
<string name="58098">Noooo&#8230;.. I... cannot fail the Empire.</string>
<string name="58099">They must have used&#8230; poison&#8230;</string>
<string name="58100">Fool! My spell is wasted!</string>
<string name="58101">My attack is... useless?</string>
<string name="58102">Follow me, now.</string>
<string name="58103">Over here. I&apos;ve found something.</string>
<string name="58104">Get ready now.</string>
<string name="58105">You are in my way.</string>
<string name="58106">Open this lock.</string>
<string name="58107">We should search this place.</string>
<string name="58108">Move quietly now.</string>
<string name="58109">Yes, of course.</string>
<string name="58110">I cannot do this.</string>
<string name="58111">I have done as you said.</string>
<string name="58112">Am I a pack mule?</string>
<string name="58113">Yes? What is it?</string>
<string name="58114">Greetings!</string>
<string name="58115">Of course.</string>
<string name="58116">No.</string>
<string name="58117">Stop!</string>

<string name="58120">Farewell then.</string>

<string name="58125">An excellent idea.</string>

<string name="58127">You dare anger me!</string>

<string name="58140">Poison? Why didn&#8217;t I think of that?</string>
<string name="58141">I hate it when my spell fizzles!</string>
<string name="58142">I ain&apos;t doing much, here...</string>
<string name="58143">Come on! Come on!</string>
<string name="58144">Eh? What&apos;s this?</string>
<string name="58145">Err... maybe we should organize ourselves a bit?</string>
<string name="58146">Need to get by ya, mate.</string>
<string name="58147">Oh, I can pick that open easy.</string>

<string name="58164">So-ooo...</string>
<string name="58165">Wish I&apos;d thought of that.</string>
<string name="58166">Ya might want to rethink that.</string>
<string name="58167">Okay. Now yer in for it.</string>
<string name="58168">Deliver them to the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="58169">The Silent Lord take you!</string>
<string name="58170">Death comes for us all.</string>
<string name="58171">Feel the chill touch of the grave.</string>
<string name="58172">My life bleeds out - I need healing.</string>
<string name="58173">To my side! The enemy overwhelms me.</string>
<string name="58174">I see our next victims.</string>
<string name="58175">This is a battle we cannot win.</string>
<string name="58176">Your fear feeds the Silent Lord&apos;s hunger!</string>
<string name="58177">To my side.</string>
<string name="58178">Hold your positions.</string>
<string name="58179">Heal me soon or the Silent Lord will claim my soul.</string>
<string name="58180">I taste the foul taint of poison.</string>
<string name="58181">My spell has failed!</string>
<string name="58182">My attacks do nothing!</string>
<string name="58183">Follow me.</string>
<string name="58184">Over here.</string>
<string name="58185">Quickly - we must prepare for battle.</string>
<string name="58186">Clear a path so I may pass.</string>
<string name="58187">Open this lock.</string>
<string name="58188">We should investigate further.</string>
<string name="58189">Be still as the Silent Lord himself.</string>
<string name="58190">It is as certain as death itself.</string>
<string name="58191">It cannot be done.</string>
<string name="58192">The task is done.</string>
<string name="58193">I am overburdened.</string>

<string name="58198">Wait.</string>
<string name="58199">If we stop to rest I promise you won&apos;t die in your sleep... tonight. </string>
<string name="58200">If you plan on doing nothing the Silent Lord might as well claim you now.</string>
<string name="58201">We shall meet again when the Silent Lord claims us.</string>
<string name="58202">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="58203">Death and damnation!</string>
<string name="58204">Glorious!</string>
<string name="58205">We must speak.</string>
<string name="58206">Well said.</string>
<string name="58207">Are you certain?</string>
<string name="58208">Beware lest I deliver you to the Silent Lord.</string>
<string name="58209">Let&apos;s get them!</string>
<string name="58210">My magic will take care of you!</string>
<string name="58211">All evidence points to victory!</string>
<string name="58212">This is going to get messy!</string>
<string name="58213">It appears I require medical assistance.</string>
<string name="58214">I could use some aid right now.</string>
<string name="58215">I have located our foe.</string>
<string name="58216">By my calculations this is a good time to flee.</string>
<string name="58217">I&apos;ll teach you to mess with gnomes!</string>
<string name="58218">I could use some protection.</string>
<string name="58219">We should maintain our current positions.</string>
<string name="58220">The facts are quite clear - heal me or I&apos;m done for.</string>
<string name="58221">Poison? This can&apos;t be good.</string>
<string name="58222">My spell - failed? But I did everything right!</string>
<string name="58223">My attack has no noticeable effect.</string>
<string name="58224">This way. I won&apos;t lead you astray.</string>
<string name="58225">Turn your attention this way.</string>
<string name="58226">I cannot pass if you don&apos;t clear a path.</string>
<string name="58227">The logical choice would be to pick this lock.</string>
<string name="58228">We need to conduct a thorough examination here.</string>
<string name="58229">Silence seems to be the best option in this case.</string>
<string name="58230">It is easily accomplished.</string>
<string name="58231">The evidence seems to indicate that won&apos;t happen.</string>
<string name="58232">I have concluded this task.</string>
<string name="58233">Obviously you overestimate the weight I can manage.</string>
<string name="58234">You require some assistance?</string>
<string name="58235">Greetings, friend.</string>
<string name="58236">That would be correct.</string>
<string name="58237">I&apos;m afraid you are mistaken.</string>
<string name="58238">Hold on a minute.</string>
<string name="58239">Logic dictates we stop to rest sometime.</string>
<string name="58240">We aren&apos;t going to discover anything new just sitting here.</string>
<string name="58241">Until we meet again.</string>
<string name="58242">I appreciate this.</string>
<string name="58243">Chaos and confusion!</string>
<string name="58244">Spectacular!</string>
<string name="58245">I want to run a hypothesis by you.</string>

A Pitch Variation of zero means that the sound will always play at its normal pitch.

If the Pitch Variation is greater than zero, then each time the sound plays, its pitch may be higher or lower than normal. The difference between the normal pitch and actual pitch is a random value between zero and the Pitch Variation value.</string>

<string name="58399">Very well.</string>
<string name="58400">Me wants to talk &apos;bout something else.</string>
<string name="58401">I want to talk about something else.</string>
<string name="58402">What is you and Aribeth doing there?</string>
<string name="58403">What are you and Aribeth going to do in Luskan?</string>
<string name="58404">You sure that be good idea?</string>
<string name="58405">Are you sure that&apos;s a good idea?</string>
<string name="58406">How me gets into Host Tower?</string>
<string name="58407">How will I get into the Host Tower?</string>
<string name="58408">You be sure your friend lets me into city?</string>
<string name="58409">Are you sure your friend will let me into the city?</string>
<string name="58410">If not, there are other avenues for you to investigate. The city of Luskan to the north, Neverwinter Wood to the east and the wildlands of the South Road.</string>
<string name="58411">The caves are in the hills to the north of Port Llast, near the Green Griffon Inn. They have long been used by humanoid tribes of orcs, bugbears and the like. They aren&apos;t usually a concern.</string>
<string name="58412">In recent months, however, I have received word that these various humanoid creatures have been raiding the roads south of Luskan.</string>
<string name="58413">This would not be unusual... except that the creatures now seem very organized and, I hear, are being led by humans.</string>
<string name="58414">This leads me to believe the cult may be involved... that will be for you to determine. Just keep this in mind... no matter what you find there, Aribeth will wish two firm leads on the cult&apos;s location before she will act. We cannot afford a mistake.</string>
<string name="58415">Have you a question for me, then, my friend?</string>
<string name="58416">As you wish. I will certainly tell you all I know about the other places you may need to search.</string>
<string name="58417">Their gates have been sealed ever since the plague began in Neverwinter, I am afraid. The city is quite anarchic... an outbreak there would be devastating, indeed.</string>
<string name="58418">I have been attempting to pull what strings I can to convince officials in Luskan that the plague is over, but I am having little luck so far.</string>
<string name="58419">Before the gates closed, there were rumors of battles in the streets in Luskan. Who knows what transpires there? With luck I will soon arrange you a way inside to investigate.</string>
<string name="58420">We will meet you in Luskan&apos;s Temple of Tyr, my friend. When you are ready, go to the city gates and the sergeant there will let you in.</string>
<string name="58421">I understand that you have found information pinpointing the cult within Luskan. That is good... I believe I have found a way inside the city.</string>
<string name="58422">An old friend of mine is a sergeant who works the city gates. I have convinced him that the plague is no longer a threat, and as a favor he has agreed to allow my agents and I into the city.</string>
<string name="58423">I will give your description to him so he will allow you entry. Aribeth and I shall be moving our base of operations to Luskan, so we will meet you there.</string>
<string name="58424">Aribeth and I shall begin moving our base to the Temple of Tyr within Luskan. Once you get inside the city, meet us there.</string>
<string name="58425">Remember to finish up any loose ends you have and to take what companions and gear you need before going to Luskan. You will not be able to leave the city once you enter.</string>
<string name="58426">Go, then, and do what you must. I wish you success.</string>
<string name="58427">A simple caution to you, my friend: you may desire to check out the other areas of the north before you go to Luskan. The city is a dangerous place, and the experience would serve you well.</string>
<string name="58428">We can speak more in Luskan, my friend. I have much to take care of before I can meet you there.</string>
<string name="58429">I will be attempting to find you a way into the Host Tower, of course, so you can explore your lead further.</string>
<string name="58430">Aribeth insists on coming to Luskan, as well. I believe she feels a strong need to see this through, to take vengeance for what happened to Fenthick. I shall not deny her.</string>
<string name="58431">Aribeth may seem disturbed, but it is not without reason. She takes her orders from Lord Nasher, regardless, so I am in no position to deny her will.</string>
<string name="58432">I am not completely sure just yet. Seek me out in Luskan when you arrive and hopefully I will have a plan for you then.</string>
<string name="58433">I am quite confident, yes. He does not have the power to let us back out, however... once we are inside Luskan, we are inside for good and cannot return to Port Llast.</string>
<string name="58434">I have some important information for you.</string>
<string name="58435">This door is presently barred from the other side but shows signs of recent use. Perhaps it will be open later.</string>

<string name="58454">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal looks at you quizzically, sighs, and then looks elsewhere.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58455">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal hangs its head and returns to what it was doing before.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58456">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal brushes against you cheerfully and returns its attention elsewhere.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58457">&lt;StartAction&gt;You spend a few minutes trying to teach your companion another complex trick. The animal cocks an eye at you, thinking the whole matter odd, but is eager to please.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58458">&lt;StartAction&gt;You hide a piece of food on your person and your companion spends several minutes trying to sniff it out. It&apos;s nose is ticklish and before long you are on the ground, laughing hysterically.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58459">&lt;StartAction&gt;You engage in a mock tug-of-war with your companion using your bedroll. The animal obviously enjoys the game greatly.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58460">&lt;StartAction&gt;You tease your companion by tapping it on the head and then jerking your hand away as it swivels to bite at your fingers. The animal eyes your wryly but is obviously still pleased.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58461">&lt;StartAction&gt;You throw a nearby stick into the distance and the animal joyfully runs off to retrieve it for you.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58462">&lt;StartAction&gt;You laugh as you tousle the animal&apos;s head and it makes a playful effort at trying to bite at your hand.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58463">&lt;StartAction&gt;You wrestle for a few moments with the animal, which obviously pleases it greatly.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58464">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal hangs its head, unsure about exactly what you are saying but saddened by the obvious recrimination.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58465">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal tilts its head and accepts your rewarding touch gladly.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58466">&lt;StartAction&gt;At first, the animal cringes, thinking you might hit it... but then calms and allows you to pat it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58467">&lt;StartAction&gt;The companion is pleased when you pat it, brushing back against you in a friendly manner.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58468">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal is quite famished and devours the food you offer. The companion seems instantly revitalized.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58469">&lt;StartAction&gt;The animal is not particularly hungry but enjoys the attention you&apos;re providing anyway, nibbling a little on the snack provided.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58470">&lt;StartAction&gt;Your companion looks up at you, obviously willing to do as you ask.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58471">&lt;StartAction&gt;Your companion moves quickly to do as you ask, determined to please you.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="58492">&lt;StartAction&gt;Your familiar starts a game trying to get you to guess when you&apos;re next going to die. You decide you don&apos;t enjoy this game very much.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58493">&lt;StartAction&gt;You start playing a word association game with your familiar. Sometimes the familiar makes associations that make little sense, but the game is otherwise fun.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58494">&lt;StartAction&gt;You start playing a game... it involves studying nearby people and deciding what kind of animal they most look like.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58495">&lt;StartAction&gt;You and your familiar begin a twenty-questions guessing game. Most of your familiar&apos;s objects are food, unsurprisingly.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58496">&lt;StartAction&gt;Your familiar and you start playing a little rhyming game. The familiar enjoys the singing but otherwise isn&apos;t very good at it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58497">&lt;StartAction&gt;You and your familiar exchange riddles. Surprisingly, your familiar comes up with a rather good one and stumps you. Your familiar thinks this is very funny.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58498">&lt;StartAction&gt;You and your familiar begin exchanging riddles... which the familiar isn&apos;t very good at, tending to guess a lot.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58499">&lt;StartAction&gt;You and your familiar begin engaging in a rousing game of &apos;eye spy&apos;.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58500">I... shall try to do better, my &lt;master/mistress&gt;.</string>
<string name="58501">I didn&apos;t mean to do it, &lt;master/mistress&gt;! Honest, I did not!</string>
<string name="58502">Hmph. I didn&apos;t do anything bad, &lt;master/mistress&gt;, honest!</string>
<string name="58503">&lt;StartAction&gt;The familiar hangs its head in shame.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58504">&lt;StartAction&gt;The familiar gulps down the food hungrily, its wounds visibly healing.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58505">&lt;StartAction&gt;Although not hungry, the familiar is awfully pleased and gulps down the food.&lt;/Start&gt; Thank you, &lt;master/mistress&gt;!</string>
<string name="58506">&lt;StartAction&gt;The familiar coos with pleasure at the attention.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58507">&lt;StartAction&gt;Apparently your petting touches a ticklish spot, and the familiar giggles with delight and jumps away.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58508">&lt;StartAction&gt;The familiar closes its eyes, cranes its neck and looks very content.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58509">&lt;StartAction&gt;The familiar glares at you suspiciously, thinking it&apos;s about to be smacked... but allows you to pet it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58510">What would you like me to do, my &lt;master/mistress&gt;?</string>
<string name="58511">As you desire, &lt;master/mistress&gt;. I shall be watchful, though it will slow me a little.</string>
<string name="58512">I shall remain hidden whenever I can, &lt;master/mistress&gt;... though that will slow me a little.</string>
<string name="58513">I shall stay further from you, &lt;master/mistress&gt;, as you wish.</string>
<string name="58514">I shall remain closer to your side, &lt;master/mistress&gt;, as you wish.</string>
<string name="58515">Does my &lt;master/mistress&gt; desire anything else of me?</string>
<string name="58516">I&apos;ll do it, &lt;master/mistress&gt;... if you say you won&apos;t scold me again.</string>
<string name="58517">Of course! Anything for my &lt;master/mistress&gt;!</string>
<string name="58518">Err... I shall try to do whatever you wish, &lt;master/mistress&gt;.</string>
<string name="58519">Yes, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;? What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="58520">&lt;StartAction&gt;The familiar looks at you strangely and resumes what it was doing before.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="58521">You still here in temples?</string>
<string name="58522">Are you still in the temple?</string>
<string name="58523">What you doings in temple?</string>

<string name="58530">Well, the priests haven&apos;t kicked me out, yet, so I figures I&apos;m welcome. Why? You got someplace better for me to be?</string>
<string name="58531">I could ask you the same question, now, couldn&apos;t I? Well... if you hafta know the truth, I was being chased by a pack of hooligans the day before yesterday when I darted in here.</string>
<string name="58532">It seems like as good a place as any... &apos;specially considering the priests don&apos;t throw halflings out on their ears as a policy, like in Calimport... so I&apos;ve been hanging about looking for something to do.</string>
<string name="58533">Hmph. That&apos;s what they all say. Then suddenly off they go with all the treasure. Oh, fine, fine... I&apos;ll wait here for you for a little while.</string>

<string name="58620">Me should just kills you right now.</string>
<string name="58621">I should end your life right now.</string>
<string name="58622">Yous gonna be taken to get judged.</string>
<string name="58623">You will be taken back to face judgment.</string>
<string name="58624">Nasher will want me alive, fool. Speak to me so we may settle out business and then you can deliver me to the old man like a good little &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="58625">You delay in returning me to Nasher and the precious Lady Aribeth. Hurry with your looting and let this farce come to an end.</string>
<string name="58626">I am undone... take your bow, friend. You have your traitor. What now, I wonder?</string>
<string name="58627">You have questions, of course, but I don&apos;t have answers. I will not give you that satisfaction, nor will I give it to the mob that awaits in Neverwinter. Your victory shall be hollow.</string>
<string name="58628">Good! Let the plague-suffering citizens call out for blood! Let them demand the harshest penalties! What do I care!</string>
<string name="58629">Fenthick was the perfect tool, so willing to trust in the faith of another. Now he looks like a conspirator, or at the very least, dangerously negligent.</string>
<string name="58630">Tell me, &lt;FullName&gt;, what does it do to a people when they turn on the best among them? They shall see traitors everywhere now. Their spirit will weaken even further.</string>
<string name="58631">Don&apos;t rush on my account. I know what awaits me. My fate is sealed. There&apos;s comfort in that. It is better, I&apos;ll wager, than the uncertainty awaiting you.</string>
<string name="58632">Ever the mercenary. By all means, loot what you must. I am quite incapacitated. Come talk to me when you want to leave. I&apos;m sure Lord Nasher is waiting.</string>
<string name="58633">Why is anything ever attacked? To weaken it, and strengthen the attacker. Neverwinter is a shadow of its former glory - glory undeserved!</string>
<string name="58634">You will see! It was an honor to spread the great disease! It has bled you dry and now feeds your destruction! The souls of your dead will bring my masters to power!</string>
<string name="58635">I will say nothing! You are like a child, begging for explanations but understanding nothing. You are doomed, and there is nothing you can do! You will see!</string>
<string name="58636">We are the People of the Eye. We are the ones who follow. We are the servants of the Old Ones, and you are merely cattle! You cannot understand!</string>
<string name="58637">We are legion, always growing in number. In the end, all who wish to survive will become as we. Move with the tide or be drowned within it.</string>
<string name="58638">You have routed my False Helmites, but we will be replaced. Our job is finished here - our loss will not be felt.</string>
<string name="58639">Save your wrath, you will get no satisfaction from me. I cannot explain it to you. Does the ant understand the wagon rolling above? Does the boar understand the arrow piercing through?</string>
<string name="58640">You cannot comprehend my masters, and I will not speak for them. Let your saber rattle, let Nasher bring his interrogators - you will get nothing from me.</string>
<string name="58641">Of course, the cure. Don&apos;t you worry. It is here. Not that it matters. The plague would have ended soon enough without my False Helmites spreading it.</string>
<string name="58642">You may save a few of the worst cases, I suppose, but the damage is already done. The plague has sapped the strength of the city. It did what was intended.</string>
<string name="58643">I have the cure. When you return me to Lord Nasher, the cure will be delivered as well. No need to scramble about searching. I have no more reason to defy you now.</string>
<string name="58644">And what would that prove? No, Nasher will want me alive. He&apos;ll want reasons and justification. He&apos;ll want a villain to give to the mob.</string>
<string name="58645">I suppose I&apos;ll be executed eventually, if just to ease the fears of the people, but it will do nothing. There is so much more to come. So little you understand.</string>
<string name="58646">Yes, Nasher will want me alive, won&apos;t he? He&apos;ll want reasons and justification. He&apos;ll want a villain to give to the mob.</string>
<string name="58647">I... I am beaten. There is no point in continuing this fight. You... you will want me alive, anyway.</string>

<string name="58733">Oh. Is there something else you wanted, then?</string>
<string name="58734">Oh. Well... if you&apos;re looking for Alhelor, then, you missed him.</string>
<string name="58735">If you want to ask them about Urth, they live on the south side of town. Just... don&apos;t say anything about me.</string>
<string name="58736">I know it sounds silly. I... met a werewolf myself, though, and if Alhelor&apos;s goods can help fight them, then I&apos;m proud to help him.</string>
<string name="58737">I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m a bit confused. Angry, too. I can&apos;t believe Alhelor tricked us all like that! I thought he really wanted to help kill werewolves.</string>
<string name="58738">I feel so stupid. Worse, now I&apos;ve got nothing to do... my friends are all dead, and I can&apos;t help Alhelor run his shop anymore, obviously. (sigh)</string>
<string name="58739">I... I guess...</string>
<string name="58740">Ex-excuse me... maybe I should... maybe I should go...</string>
<string name="58741">Just... just a little bit. I helped him mostly for the experience.</string>
<string name="58742">What? You&apos;re... you&apos;re robbing me? Is there nobody decent in this world? F-fine! T-take it! Take it all!</string>
<string name="58743">You mean leave Port Llast? I... I guess you&apos;re right. Maybe I should, there&apos;s nothing for me here...</string>
<string name="58744">A... hundred gold? That&apos;s so generous of you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I... I can&apos;t thank you enough for your help. Bless you!</string>
<string name="58745">Thank you! Thank you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;... you&apos;ve been a great help!</string>
<string name="58746">Open my own shop...? I... I suppose I could. Alhelor must still have some of his supplies somewhere. Yes... yes, maybe I will!</string>
<string name="58747">I&apos;m sorry, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, but I really must go...</string>
<string name="58748">Get away, you. I&apos;m just here for a drink, not to be harassed by your ilk.</string>
<string name="58749">I don&apos;t have time to talk to the likes of you, sorry. You could be one of them werewolves around here, for all I know.</string>
<string name="58750">You strike me as one of those bandits you find on the road everywhere, nowadays. Hmph.</string>
<string name="58751">It&apos;s a good thing the plague in Neverwinter is over. If it went on any longer, the city would be too weak and there&apos;d be war for sure!</string>
<string name="58752">You&apos;d best be careful on the roads. We gots werewolves in these parts... and I hear there&apos;s monster bandits all over the northern routes.</string>
<string name="58753">Pleased to meet you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Don&apos;t remember seeing you in Port Llast before now.</string>
<string name="58754">I certainly hope you find the people responsible for the plague. What monster could do such a thing?!</string>
<string name="58755">You&apos;re with Lady Aribeth, aren&apos;t you? Maybe you could do something about our werewolves while you&apos;re here.</string>
<string name="58756">Are... are you that hero from Neverwinter that&apos;s here with Lady Aribeth? So wonderful to meet you!</string>
<string name="58757">I don&apos;t suppose there&apos;s a chance you&apos;d buy me a drink, handsome?</string>
<string name="58758">(sigh) I knew there had to be big, strong men like you somewhere.</string>
<string name="58759">My, my. Hello there, handsome.</string>
<string name="58760">If I knew this tavern had women like you about, I&apos;d travel this way more often.</string>
<string name="58761">My, my... didn&apos;t expect to see any fine-looking lasses like yourself in Port Llast...</string>
<string name="58762">Greetings, lass. You&apos;re a fine-lookin&apos; woman, aren&apos;t you? Care for a drink?</string>
<string name="58763">We don&apos;t see much &lt;race&gt; folk like you in Port Llast. Mostly humans, here, you see.</string>
<string name="58764">You know, I heard you &lt;race&gt; folk are what caused that plague.</string>
<string name="58765">More &lt;race&gt; folk, is it? What, did you all decide to up and leave Neverwinter, now?</string>
<string name="58766">Err... we don&apos;t get many barbarians coming through Port Llast, usually...</string>
<string name="58767">You barbarians do know how to behave in a tavern, right?</string>
<string name="58768">What&apos;s that smell? It&apos;s like... bear dung, or something...</string>
<string name="58769">Please put that away, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. It makes me nervous.</string>
<string name="58770">Isn&apos;t there a policy in the taverns against walking around with a weapon out?</string>
<string name="58771">I really wish you wouldn&apos;t wave that thing about in here.</string>
<string name="58772">Where did you get all those wounds?</string>
<string name="58773">That&apos;s quite the lot of cuts you&apos;ve got there. Must have been quite a fight.</string>
<string name="58774">Those wounds of yours don&apos;t look good. Shouldn&apos;t you get them treated?</string>
<string name="58775">Are you mad, running about without proper clothing?</string>
<string name="58776">What&apos;s this? Another half-naked refugee from Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="58777">Err... you always run around taverns without your clothes, do you?</string>
<string name="58778">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="58779">What you doings here, then?</string>
<string name="58780">What are you doing here, then?</string>
<string name="58781">You help me by give me gold maybe?</string>
<string name="58782">Maybe you can help me another way. I need gold for expenses.</string>
<string name="58783">Me gotta go now.</string>
<string name="58784">I better go.</string>
<string name="58785">You give me gold or me cut off you sick leg.</string>
<string name="58786">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Aribeth tell me to get money for search, so you give.</string>
<string name="58787">Okay, but me ask more question now.</string>
<string name="58788">You had better hand over some gold, before I have to perform surgery to remove that diseased leg.</string>
<string name="58789">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Lady Aribeth has commanded me to raise funds to assist the search.</string>
<string name="58790">All right, I would like to ask you more questions though.</string>
<string name="58791">Aye, fare ye well, &lt;lad/lass&gt;... an&apos; good luck.</string>
<string name="58792">Well, since I were ambushed along the north road, my bum knee&apos;s been keepin&apos; me grounded. I found out some, though... maybe I could be of help to ye.</string>
<string name="58793">Well, I should like to &lt;Lad/Lass&gt;, but I need all me gold to feed meself and keep a roof over me head. No income comin&apos; in with a bum leg and all.</string>
<string name="58794">Just don&apos;t forget to come back and tell me what&apos;s happenin&apos;. Maybe I can help ye make sense of it all.</string>
<string name="58795">The leg is hurt, it doesn&apos;t need... oh, I get it. Well, if it&apos;s gonna be that way, I guess I could come up with a little gold. Here&apos;s 100 gold, but that&apos;s all I have.</string>
<string name="58796">Just remember me generosity when ye come back. I want to hear what be goin&apos; on, what with me bein&apos; unable to get around proper.</string>
<string name="58797">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I be tellin&apos; ye, I can&apos;t be givin&apos; gold away when I be wounded like this.</string>
<string name="58798">I&apos;d be more than happy to help ye puzzle this quest out though. You just come back when somethin&apos; happens and I&apos;ll try to help ye out.</string>
<string name="58799">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; To help catch the cult ye say, well I suppose I could give ye 100 gold pieces. I&apos;ll find some way to feed meself.</string>
<string name="58800">What do ye want to know?</string>
<string name="58801">Me need healing.</string>
<string name="58802">I need healing.</string>
<string name="58803">Who you be?</string>
<string name="58804">Who are you?</string>
<string name="58805">Me not understand &apos;bout Stone of Recall and teleport portal.</string>
<string name="58806">Teleportation portal? Stone of Recall? I don&apos;t understand.</string>
<string name="58807">That&apos;s handy.</string>
<string name="58808">Me need you go over that one more time.</string>
<string name="58809">Can you explain that again?</string>
<string name="58810">Goodbye. </string>
<string name="58811">Me need to return to mission. Me need to go back to place where me died. </string>
<string name="58812">How me get here?</string>
<string name="58813">I need to return to my mission. I must get back to where I just was. </string>
<string name="58814">What you suggest?</string>
<string name="58815">What do you suggest?</string>
<string name="58816">Me think you&apos;re right. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="58817">I think you&apos;re right. I&apos;ll see you later. </string>
<string name="58818">Teleport portal? Recall Stone? What you be talking about?</string>
<string name="58819">Teleportation portal? Stone of Recall? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="58820">That&apos;s handy.</string>
<string name="58821">You got bad attitude. Me want go back now!</string>
<string name="58822">Save the sarcasm and just get me back there.</string>
<string name="58823">Me change my mind. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="58824">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I&apos;ll see you later. </string>
<string name="58825">Yes. Me want to go back now.</string>
<string name="58826">Yes. Transport me there now. </string>
<string name="58827">Just do it.</string>
<string name="58828">How did I get here? </string>
<string name="58829">Me no trust you Recall spell! You take spell off me now!</string>
<string name="58830">You say me be fully healed?</string>
<string name="58831">I don&apos;t want your stupid Word of Recall spell teleporting me anywhere. Cancel the spell, right now!</string>
<string name="58832">How me get back where me be before?</string>
<string name="58833">So how am I supposed to get back to where I was?</string>
<string name="58834">You mean I&apos;m fully healed?</string>
<string name="58835">Me no remember you cast spell on me.</string>
<string name="58836">How come I don&apos;t remember you casting a Recall spell on me?</string>
<string name="58837">Who you be?</string>
<string name="58838">Who are you?</string>
<string name="58839">Hello &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope your deeds in Neverwinter weren&apos;t a fluke. Aribeth has a lot of time and energy invested in you.</string>
<string name="58840">But don&apos;t expect me to go healing you or anything like that. My powers are tied to the teleportation portal and the Stone of Recall in your backpack.</string>
<string name="58841">You know, I pray to Tyr several times a day, pleading that I won&apos;t have days like this. &quot;Please Lord,&quot; I beg, &quot;don&apos;t try my patience today. Send only adventurers who are smart and understand that I don&apos;t heal them,&quot; yet it never happens.</string>
<string name="58842">Go speak to Neurik. As I already said, my abilities are tied stritctly to the Word of Recall and the teleportation portal. He&apos;s the healer. Is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="58843">My name is Caliandros, a cleric of Tyr. I serve Aribeth by aiding those who work for her. </string>
<string name="58844">You mean you haven&apos;t figured that out yet? What did they do, put a pot on your head, a stick in your hand and tell you to go save Neverwinter? I would expect more preparation, but I guess I&apos;ll tell you about it.</string>
<string name="58845">In your backpack you carry a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at anytime and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="58846">This will allow you to quickly return to town whenever you need to, saving precious travelling time.</string>
<string name="58847">There is more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once you have used the stone, go through the teleportation portal and it will instantly send you back to the place your stone was last activated.</string>
<string name="58848">Anyone in your service - henchmen, familiars and the like - will also be transported with you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="58849">You had better be more careful. I used up a lot of energy bringing you back. I wasn&apos;t even sure you were going to make it.</string>
<string name="58850">Goodbye &lt;FirstName&gt;. Tyr protect you.</string>
<string name="58851">I can send you back there, no problem, but then you&apos;ll just get chopped, chomped, or crushed again and then I have to bring you right back here.</string>
<string name="58852">Why don&apos;t you consider getting better armor, or weapons here in town first? Or maybe you could try to go a different way than you just did. Or would you like to rush right back into certain death again?</string>
<string name="58853">You could also use the teleportation portal to take you back to where you last activated the stone of recall.</string>
<string name="58854">You mean you haven&apos;t figured that out yet? What did they do, put a pot on your head, a stick in your hand and tell you to go save Neverwinter? I would expect more preparation, but I guess I&apos;ll tell you about it.</string>
<string name="58855">In your backpack you carry a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at any time and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="58856">This will allow you to return quickly to town whenever you need to, saving precious traveling time.</string>
<string name="58857">There is more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once you have used the stone, go through the teleportation portal and it will instantly send you back to the place your stone was last activated.</string>
<string name="58858">Anyone in your service - henchmen, familiars and the like - will also be transported with you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="58859">Like I should be surprised. All right, I can use a spell called Dimensional Fold. It will return you to your last battle. Are you ready? </string>
<string name="58860">Okay. Ready yourself. </string>
<string name="58861">You mean nobody told you? Fine, I guess I get to explain it to you.</string>
<string name="58862">Aribeth has been very impressed with the job you have been doing so far, so she has asked me to watch over you; to keep you alive. That&apos;s a difficult job, thank you very much.</string>
<string name="58863">I cast a Word of Recall spell upon you before you started this mission, so that every time you run around getting swords and arrows and such shot into your body, I can teleport your body back here and bring you back again.</string>
<string name="58864">Obviously you weren&apos;t being careful enough, probably stepped into a hole with big signs around it saying &apos;Don&apos;t step here&apos;, and when you broke your neck, the contingency magic swept you back here.</string>
<string name="58865">I can&apos;t even begin to express how tempting that notion is, but Aribeth&apos;s orders were very strict. You are considered too important to her mission.</string>
<string name="58866">I thought about leaving you to bleed to death, but Tyr frowns on that sort of thing, so I had the other clerics heal you. </string>
<string name="58867">You should be ready to run off and get yourself killed again in no time. The Recall spell will continue to bring you back to me, each time your body gets mangled enough.</string>
<string name="58868">I couldn&apos;t see that question coming. All I need to know is your full name, which Aribeth provided, and I can cast the spell without your presence. </string>
<string name="58869">My name is Caliandros, a cleric of Tyr. I serve Aribeth by aiding those who work for her, though I&apos;m not a healer.</string>
<string name="58870">I see you are finally awake. Well, get over here. I need to speak to you.</string>
<string name="58871">We are very disappointed in you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your slaughter of innocent people has caused much suffering in a time already overburdened with tragedy.</string>
<string name="58872">Were it up to me you would have been left to rot in your grave; however, Aribeth has ordered me to resurrect you. Despite your actions, Neverwinter still has need of you.</string>
<string name="58873">You will suffer no further consequences for your mad killing spree, but I implore you not to engage in such wholesale slaughter again. Please, focus on the mission you have been given.</string>
<string name="58874">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="58875">&apos;Nuff dumb talkin&apos;. You answer me questions.</string>
<string name="58876">Me feel terrible.</string>
<string name="58877">Me fine, thank you.</string>
<string name="58878">Enough with the chit chat, I have some questions for you.</string>
<string name="58879">We need talk &apos;bout gold.</string>
<string name="58880">What you know &apos;bout evil cult?</string>
<string name="58881">You tell me where stuff be?</string>
<string name="58882">What happen round here?</string>
<string name="58883">We need to talk about finances.</string>
<string name="58884">Give me you gold, or you farm with broken leg.</string>
<string name="58885">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Aribeth send me to get gold, so you give.</string>
<string name="58886">Give me some gold or you&apos;ll be harvesting with a broken leg.</string>
<string name="58887">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Lady Aribeth has sent me to collect a special tax to help finance the search for the cult.</string>
<string name="58888">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="58889">Um, sorry, nevermind.</string>
<string name="58890">What do you know about the cult that started the plague?</string>
<string name="58891">Can you give me directions?</string>
<string name="58892">What&apos;s going on around here?</string>
<string name="58893">No clue.</string>
<string name="58894">Uh, sure.</string>
<string name="58895">I feel terrible.</string>
<string name="58896">I&apos;m fine, thank you.</string>
<string name="58897">Me want talk &apos;bout different things.</string>
<string name="58898">Why me sad &apos;bout weather?</string>
<string name="58899">I want to talk about something else.</string>
<string name="58900">Why would I be depressed about the weather?</string>
<string name="58901">Hello there. How are you today good &lt;master/mistress&gt;? </string>
<string name="58902">Take care young &lt;man/woman&gt;. May Chauntea favor you with predictable weather.</string>
<string name="58903">What can I help you with?</string>
<string name="58904">I don&apos;t have time to talk about gold, I have to spend all my time just trying to make a little. It&apos;s getting so a man can&apos;t afford to feed his kids anymore.</string>
<string name="58905">Please no! My family depends on my farming to survive the winters. I&apos;ll give you 50 gold, just let me alone.</string>
<string name="58906">Never did trust you wandering adventurer types. Heroes... bah!</string>
<string name="58907">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, that&apos;s just too dang bad, cause I gotta be able to feed my kids and if I give you any money then they&apos;ll starve. </string>
<string name="58908">You go tell the Lady she can come talk to me in person and I&apos;ll let her see how skinny my kids are. Plague or starvation, either way we&apos;re dead.</string>
<string name="58909">Yeah, goodbye.</string>
<string name="58910">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, well, I guess I have a few moldy potatoes left in the root cellar that we can survive on until I can earn some more money. Here&apos;s fifty gold; it&apos;s all I have though. </string>
<string name="58911">Now I&apos;d better get to work. Just hope the weather doesn&apos;t kill my crop or we&apos;ll all starve this winter.</string>
<string name="58912">Somebody already took my gold, so you can just go find someone else to beg from.</string>
<string name="58913">I&apos;d like to take my scythe to them and cut &apos;em short at the bloody kneecaps, that&apos;s what I know about them. Anything else?</string>
<string name="58914">I don&apos;t have time to be a road map and this town&apos;s not really all that big. I&apos;ve got planting and feeding and milking and all sorts of jobs that need done. Don&apos;t suppose you&apos;re looking to settle down and be a farmhand?</string>
<string name="58915">No, I don&apos;t suppose. You adventuring types are always in such a rush. Anything else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="58916">There&apos;s all kinds of excitement in town with the hunt for this dang, plague-spreading cult. Adventurers wander around, trampling across crops and ruining many a good farmer&apos;s daughter.</string>
<string name="58917">Not that I don&apos;t think the cult ought be uprooted, but there&apos;s a proper way to do things, you know what I mean? </string>
<string name="58918">Well that&apos;s the problem with you young people today, running around like a chicken with its head cut off, no clue about what&apos;s going on around you.</string>
<string name="58919">I guess you probably have other questions you need answered, what with your lack of any common sense at all.</string>
<string name="58920">Then of course there&apos;s all the damage to the community that&apos;s caused when all the young folk here get it in their heads that they can be adventurers too.</string>
<string name="58921">Off they go, gettin&apos; themselves into trouble or killed, and then who&apos;s to take over when their fathers are ready to retire. No sir, I don&apos;t sit right proper with all these adventuring folk, I don&apos;t. </string>
<string name="58922">You should take a piece of advice and settle down, raise a family and make an honest living. But don&apos;t mind me, nobody else does. Any other questions?</string>
<string name="58923">Ah, now, that&apos;s the way things go. You&apos;re probably depressed about the weather and I don&apos;t blame you one bit.</string>
<string name="58924">Well, that&apos;s good to hear. I thought with the weather being the way it is, you might have been depressed. How may I help you?</string>
<string name="58925">Well, if it rains too much then we&apos;ll be flooded out, but if it doesn&apos;t rain enough then we&apos;ll have a drought. Any way you look at it, we farmers are going to suffer, and if we suffer, then there&apos;s no food. </string>
<string name="58926">That means prices of goods skyrocket in the cities. I figured that might depress you. But enough gloom and doom, how can I help you today?</string>
<string name="58927">You&apos;re the &lt;lad/lass&gt; that killed those rampaging creatures to the north of here, aren&apos;t ya? Sure enough I&apos;ve heard lots of heroic stuff about you!</string>
<string name="58928">Now, I hear tell that you went and stopped the wild attacks of the creatures from the Neverwinter Wood. Good job, I say.</string>
<string name="58929">I don&apos;t have time to speak to you anymore.</string>
<string name="58930">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="58931">Me have questions to ask you.</string>
<string name="58932">Why you say that?</string>
<string name="58933">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Me seen lots with job collecting taxes.</string>
<string name="58934">I see lots in me adventures.</string>
<string name="58935">I have some questions to ask you.</string>
<string name="58936">Me need job.</string>
<string name="58937">Me need find stuff.</string>
<string name="58938">You hear strange stuff lately?</string>
<string name="58939">I am looking for work.</string>
<string name="58940">I need directions.</string>
<string name="58941">That&apos;s it. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="58942">Me want ask different thing.</string>
<string name="58943">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="58944">Where me get healed?</string>
<string name="58945">Where me buy good stuff?</string>
<string name="58946">Where can I get healed?</string>
<string name="58947">Where can I get some equipment?</string>
<string name="58948">Path to destruction?</string>
<string name="58949">Have you heard anything unusual lately?</string>
<string name="58950">Anything else?</string>
<string name="58951">Why do you say that?</string>
<string name="58952">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; As a tax collector I get to visit with a variety of people.</string>
<string name="58953">Sorry, me mistake. Me ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="58954">You be working for cult if you no give gold to help hunt them.</string>
<string name="58955">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Me get gold to help Lady Aribeth hunt cult.</string>
<string name="58956">Sorry, nevermind. I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="58957">Only someone who is in league with the cult we are hunting would refuse to give gold to help.</string>
<string name="58958">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I work for Lady Aribeth, and I am collecting gold to help hunt down the cult that started the plague in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="58959">I have seen a lot in my adventures.</string>
<string name="58960">Good &lt;day/night&gt; to you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. You look like the kind of person who has seen many interesting things.</string>
<string name="58961">Happy travels to you &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="58962">I would love to help you out in any way I can. Some people in town might be standoffish, but I believe in a no-secrets policy.</string>
<string name="58963">You should go talk to Mayor Kendrack. He&apos;s been worried about something, though I&apos;m not sure what. He tries awfully hard to keep Port Llast running. Anything else?</string>
<string name="58964">Oh, I know where everything is in town. It&apos;s a precious little town, isn&apos;t it? Too bad we&apos;re on a path to destruction.</string>
<string name="58965">There is an underground temple to Tyr. Just find a glowing portal and enter it. The priest is a good man. He&apos;s helped a lot of people. I just wish he could lead us off of this path to destruction. Anything else?</string>
<string name="58966">The Cracked Anvil has all the best equipment an adventurer could ask for. That would probably be your best bet. I hope that one of my sons will get a job there, as soon as they can count. Anything else?</string>
<string name="58967">I certainly would say so. There is a very unusual ranger, hiding out in a grove of trees here in town. He is telling the strangest tales about animal attacks. It&apos;s a bad sign for us, I say.</string>
<string name="58968">There are tales of werewolves running around and biting people. It just goes to show, the world is going mad. I was telling my friend the other day, that the world is on a path to destruction, no doubt about it.</string>
<string name="58969">Those are the only strange things that I can think of. Is there anything else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="58970">Oh, no offense meant. I just thought you had the look of one who has traveled; just like I know everything that goes on around here.</string>
<string name="58971">Oh, a um... tax collector. I guess I should be getting back to the children now.</string>
<string name="58972">No! They would throw me in jail, or kill me and then my children would surely starve to death. </string>
<string name="58973">I guess I could give you 50 gold. Poor little Sally will just have to keep wearing those shoes that pinch her feet and Billy can make do without a birthday gift this year.</string>
<string name="58974">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I can&apos;t afford to give my gold away. I have sick, starving children that need the little bit of gold we have. Find someone else to steal from.</string>
<string name="58975">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, I guess I could give you 50 gold to help you out. Little Sally will just have to keep wearing those shoes that pinch her feet and Billy can make do without a birthday gift this year.</string>
<string name="58976">I must get back to my children. Now that I can&apos;t afford the cost of medicine for little Mary, I will just hope I can nurse her through this illness.</string>
<string name="58977">I already paid the last tax collector, so you&apos;ll have to find a different mark.</string>
<string name="58978">I bet you have, just like I have seen pretty much everything that happens in this town.</string>
<string name="58979">I guess you&apos;re one of the heroes who cleaned the monsters out of the caves to the North. Keep the good work up.</string>
<string name="58980">You must be the hero who made the Neverwinter Wood safe again. We&apos;re all proud of you around here.</string>
<string name="58981">I don&apos;t have time to speak to you. I have too many mouths to feed to stand around gossiping.</string>
<string name="58982">The sign explains that this monument was built to commemorate the founding of Port Llast. The eternally glowing lights serve to welcome visitors to the town.</string>
<string name="58983">Maybe, but me want ask &apos;nother question. </string>
<string name="58984">Me do that. Bye bye. </string>
<string name="58985">Me not need nothing.</string>
<string name="58986">I need nothing at this time.</string>
<string name="58987">Who Haljal?</string>
<string name="58988">Who is Haljal?</string>
<string name="58989">Me want see what you sell.</string>
<string name="58990">Let me see what you have.</string>
<string name="58991">Greetings, &lt;race&gt;. I be Haljal&apos;s smith. If ye need some arms or armor and cannot find what ye like in Haljal&apos;s regular stock, I may be able to help ye.</string>
<string name="58992">Haljal Throndor be the owner of this shop and me boss. The man by the counter. Do ye want arms or not? Haven&apos;t got all day.</string>
<string name="58993">As ye wish.</string>
<string name="58994">I wish you well on your quest to find the source of that horrible plague. I am sure that you will succeed and prove to be a hero once again. Goodbye!</string>
<string name="58995">Intruder! Destroy! Destroy!</string>
<string name="58996">He learned of his error shortly thereafter. Beware of trolls.</string>
<string name="58997">&lt;Race&gt;! Die!</string>
<string name="58998">Me eat your eyes!</string>
<string name="58999">As a druid, you can challenge me, but you have to talk to Jaer first.</string>
<string name="59000">Why have you come to Setara?</string>
<string name="59001">Rend your flesh and suck the marrow from your bones, will I!</string>

<string name="59308">He thinks so, yup.</string>
<string name="59309">He seemed to think so, yes.</string>
<string name="59310">What kind of help you needs?</string>
<string name="59311">What kind of help do you need?</string>
<string name="59312">As you wish, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I was only asking. If you do discover something, please do tell me.</string>
<string name="59313">I suppose so. What are you looking for?</string>
<string name="59314">Something else old Gerrol can do for you, then, &lt;lad/lass&gt;?</string>
<string name="59315">Aye. Plenty of caves in these parts, and full of creatures of all sorts. Nearest entrance is in the hills just to the north.</string>
<string name="59316">I wouldn&apos;t go wandering about the hills here, though, unless you&apos;re prepared to fight. The creatures sure will be.</string>
<string name="59317">It&apos;s not much farther to the north, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Just keep on the road an&apos; you&apos;ll find it, sure enough.</string>
<string name="59318">I can tell you right now that you&apos;re wasting your time. Luskan is shut up tight... they&apos;ll just send you to wait at the Green Griffon Inn, is all. It&apos;s up to you, though.</string>
<string name="59319">Well, the closest inn would the Alliance Arms Inn in Port Llast. That shouldn&apos;t take you too much time to get to.</string>
<string name="59320">Other than that, the only inn I can think of would be the Green Griffon Inn outside of Luskan, to the north past the hills.</string>
<string name="59321">If you&apos;re really strapped, you&apos;re more&apos;n welcome to stay here in my farm. There&apos;s not much I can offer you, however, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="59322">Aye? I&apos;ll answer whatever I can, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="59323">Fair enough. Like I said, I&apos;ll give you what reward I can, if you help me out. It&apos;s the same offer I&apos;ve made to any other adventurer that&apos;s come by.</string>
<string name="59324">I... I certainly hope so, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. It all depends on what Dergiab wants with his prisoners. I&apos;ve braced myself for the worst, to be honest.</string>
<string name="59325">A cult? You mean in connection to Dergiab and these creatures? Hmm. Can&apos;t say that I do, really... though that&apos;d explain Dergiab&apos;s sudden ambition.</string>
<string name="59326">To be honest, I always thought Dergiab fashioned himself as a bit of a god amongst them other monsters. I&apos;d be surprised if he allied with anyone else. You never know, however.</string>
<string name="59327">There&apos;s a few of them spread out in the hills. They all connect together underground in a large warren, however... be sure you don&apos;t get lost.</string>
<string name="59328">There&apos;s one entrance in the hills just north of here. Most like Dergiab&apos;s followers will find you before you find them.</string>
<string name="59329">Well, he&apos;s an ogre mage... smarter than his brutish cousins and a fair bit more powerful, too. He can become invisible and has plenty of spells, I&apos;d say.</string>
<string name="59330">Dergiab&apos;s led a lot of the other creatures for quite some time, now. Never been brave enough to really do anything drastic, however... I&apos;m not sure why he would start now.</string>
<string name="59331">I told you this already, didn&apos;t I, &lt;lad/lass&gt;? I suppose there&apos;s no harm in repeating the tale.</string>
<string name="59332">The hills in this area are home to creatures of all sorts... bugbears, goblins and the like. Normally they don&apos;t trouble us much. Since Luskan stopped patrolling the area, they&apos;ve become plenty brave.</string>
<string name="59333">For weeks, now, they&apos;ve been attacking anyone passing through these parts. Attacked the farm a few times, too... that&apos;s when they made off with my wife, Leah.</string>
<string name="59334">All of this is likely the doing of the leader of them monsters, Dergiab. No one will be safe until he&apos;s dead. You bring me word of my wife or his head... I&apos;ll reward you for either.</string>
<string name="59335">Thank you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, for bringing me a bit of peace of mind. I hope this bit of gold will suffice for the trouble you&apos;ve taken.</string>
<string name="59336">You... you are a good &lt;man/woman&gt;, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I appreciate it.</string>
<string name="59337">Hmph. I don&apos;t remember adventuring being about bullying the common man. But have it your way... here. It is all I can afford.</string>
<string name="59338">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I have little enough left to give you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. My wealth from my adventuring days is long gone.</string>
<string name="59339">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Aye, perhaps you are right. Here, &lt;lad/lass&gt;... let me give you a little more, then. It is all I have.</string>
<string name="59340">Is there something else, &lt;lad/lass&gt;?</string>
<string name="59341">Aye, do be careful if you go into the hills, then, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I wish you well.</string>
<string name="59342">Something else old Gerrol can do for you, then, &lt;lad/lass&gt;?</string>
<string name="59343">Aye. Plenty of caves in these parts, and full of creatures of all sorts. Nearest entrance is in the hills just to the north.</string>
<string name="59344">I wouldn&apos;t go wandering about the hills here, though, unless you&apos;re prepared to fight. The creatures sure will be.</string>
<string name="59345">I can tell you right now that you&apos;re wasting your time. Luskan is shut up tight... they&apos;ll just send you to wait at the Green Griffon Inn, is all. It&apos;s up to you, though.</string>
<string name="59346">If you&apos;re really strapped, you&apos;re more&apos;n welcome to stay here in my farm. There&apos;s not much I can offer you, however, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="59347">For weeks, now, they&apos;ve been attacking anyone passing through these parts. Attacked the farm a few times, too... that&apos;s when they made off with my wife.</string>
<string name="59348">I figure it&apos;s all that Dergiab&apos;s doing. Damn ogre will get what&apos;s coming to him one way or another, I swear it!</string>
<string name="59349">I would gladly head to the city until things settle down. I won&apos;t leave without my wife, Leah, however... or at least until I know for sure what happened to her.</string>
<string name="59350">And failing that, I&apos;ll make sure Dergiab pays for crossing me an&apos; mine. That&apos;s why I sent the boy to Port Llast to find adventurers... one of them folk should be able to do something.</string>
<string name="59351">You haven&apos;t heard? Since Neverwinter had its plague, that Luskan&apos;s gone and shut their walls up tight. No one goes in, no one comes out.</string>
<string name="59352">I never liked their soldiers much... like bandits, sometimes, the way they act. Since they stopped patrolling, however, it makes you realize what worse things they kept in check.</string>
<string name="59353">If Luskan was keeping order, Dergiab never would&apos;ve gotten it in his head to make his move... and my wife would still be here.</string>
<string name="59354">Dergiab is an ogre mage... a rather cunning sort who&apos;s decided he&apos;s just the critter to lead all these other monsters.</string>
<string name="59355">How he got it into his head I haven&apos;t a clue, but from what I can tell he&apos;s gone and built himself an army. What he intends to do with it scares me just a little.</string>
<string name="59356">I went and sent a warning off to my old friend Aarin Gend, but I haven&apos;t heard back from him yet. I s&apos;pose he&apos;s got more important things on his plate right now, all things considered.</string>
<string name="59357">Aye, I do. An old friend, I said. You don&apos;t think I&apos;ve spent my whole life as a farmer, do you? Ha! We all settle down some day, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="59358">If I were in my younger days, I&apos;d go into those caves and find Leah for myself. I wish I could. As it stands, I&apos;ll have to wait for some younger adventurer to take up the task for me.</string>
<string name="59359">Leah is her name. She was taken from the farm one evening when the boy and I were out scouting the hills. Nothing we could have done about it. </string>
<string name="59360">Them creatures have never shown any interest in taking folk before... I&apos;m not even sure why they should start now. Dergiab&apos;s behind it for sure, though.</string>
<string name="59361">I can only pray that she&apos;s all right, yet. I&apos;ll get her back, somehow... and then that ogre will pay for all the grief he&apos;s caused me.</string>
<string name="59362">Maybe you could, at that. I can reward you, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re keen for. I&apos;ll warn you, though... you wouldn&apos;t be the first adventurer to head into the hills.</string>
<string name="59363">If that&apos;s your wish. It&apos;s mighty dangerous, after all. If you happen across my wife... or her remains... I&apos;d be glad to know of it.</string>
<string name="59364">Same goes if you encounter that Dergiab. I&apos;d pay gold for his head. But I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve your own matters to attend to, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="59365">I&apos;d be grateful for it. Find my wife or bring me proof of what&apos;s happened to her... and bring me Dergiab&apos;s head, if you can. Either would be a great service.</string>
<string name="59366">Aye? I&apos;ll answer whatever I can, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="59367">Fair enough. Like I said, I&apos;ll give you what reward I can, if you help me out. It&apos;s the same offer I&apos;ve made to any other adventurer that&apos;s come by.</string>
<string name="59368">I... I certainly hope so, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. It all depends on what Dergiab wants with his prisoners. I&apos;ve braced myself for the worst, to be honest.</string>
<string name="59369">A cult? You mean in connection to Dergiab and these creatures? Hmm. Can&apos;t say that I do, really... though that&apos;d explain Dergiab&apos;s sudden ambition.</string>
<string name="59370">To be honest, I always thought Dergiab fashioned himself as a bit of a god amongst them other monsters. I&apos;d be surprised if he allied with anyone else. You never know, however.</string>
<string name="59371">There&apos;s a few of them spread out in the hills. They all connect together underground in a large warren, however... be sure you don&apos;t get lost.</string>
<string name="59372">There&apos;s one entrance in the hills just north of here. Most like Dergiab&apos;s followers will find you before you find them.</string>
<string name="59373">Well, he&apos;s an ogre mage... smarter than his brutish cousins and a fair bit more powerful, too. He can become invisible and has plenty of spells, I&apos;d say.</string>
<string name="59374">Dergiab&apos;s led a lot of the other creatures for quite some time, now. Never been brave enough to really do anything drastic, however... I&apos;m not sure why he would start now.</string>
<string name="59375">To be honest, I haven&apos;t much left from my adventuring days. I&apos;d be happy to offer what gold I have, though, to have some proof of what happened to my wife... or, better yet, to have her returned.</string>
<string name="59376">I&apos;d also offer gold for Dergiab&apos;s head, to know for sure that he won&apos;t be pestering anyone else in these parts. I know it&apos;s not much... chances are Dergiab will have plenty to loot, himself.</string>
<string name="59377">Aye, a few have passed this way and headed into the hills to check out the creatures for themselves. None have returned, I&apos;m afraid to say.</string>
<string name="59378">Farming, mostly. Though to be perfectly honest, there hasn&apos;t been much of that since this area became so dangerous.</string>
<string name="59379">It wasn&apos;t always this way, of course. In recent days it seems like the entire north is under siege. All us common folk can try to do is help each other as much as we can.</string>
<string name="59380">He did, did he? He&apos;s a fine lad, he is. I expect, then, that you&apos;re some manner of adventurer that he thought could help us, aye?</string>
<string name="59381">I didn&apos;t mean to imply that you&apos;d agreed to anything, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I&apos;m just pleased that you&apos;ve come. Let me explain what&apos;s been happening, here.</string>
<string name="59382">It&apos;s a dangerous thing to ask of anyone, but it might be worth your while, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Let me fill you in, in case the boy didn&apos;t.</string>
<string name="59383">Well, now, that&apos;s a bit of a tale. I&apos;m surprised the boy didn&apos;t fill you in.</string>
<string name="59384">Me think you cannot stop me! Me get through gates!</string>
<string name="59385">I&apos;m going through those gates - and you!</string>
<string name="59386">I&apos;ll tell you right now, though... you go inside the city, we ain&apos;t letting you back out. In or out, one or the other.</string>
<string name="59387">We got a live one!</string>
<string name="59388">Hmmm... by your description, I think you&apos;re the one the sergeant wants to speak to, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="59389">You not mind... me going.</string>
<string name="59390">Nevermind, I&apos;ll go.</string>
<string name="59391">You just open gates, less talk.</string>
<string name="59392">Just open the gates.</string>
<string name="59393">Maybe you is right... me comes back.</string>
<string name="59394">Maybe you&apos;re right... I&apos;ll come back.</string>
<string name="59395">You just shuts up and open gate.</string>
<string name="59396">Don&apos;t patronize me. Just open the gate.</string>
<string name="59397">Me be okays. Me wants to go in city.</string>
<string name="59398">I&apos;ll be fine. I want to go in the city.</string>
<string name="59399">Me needs to find cult.</string>
<string name="59400">I need to find the cult.</string>
<string name="59401">Why? What happens in Luskan?</string>
<string name="59402">Why? What&apos;s going on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="59403">Yeah, you lets me in.</string>
<string name="59404">Yes, let me inside.</string>
<string name="59405">Hmmm. So you&apos;re the one Aarin wants me to let in the gates. You look like trouble, if you ask me. You sure you know what you&apos;re doing?</string>
<string name="59406">So you&apos;re the one that Aarin wants to be let into the city, are you? You sure you know what you&apos;re doing?</string>
<string name="59407">Hmm. I can believe Aarin when he says you&apos;re some kind of hero, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... you do look the type.</string>
<string name="59408">Luskan&apos;s a mighty dangerous place to walk into, however. You sure you know what you&apos;re doing?</string>
<string name="59409">Oh? Well, if you change your mind, I&apos;ll still be here to let you in. A favor&apos;s a favor.</string>
<string name="59410">Oh that&apos;s the way of it, is it? Good thing for you Aarin is an old friend... a favor is a favor.</string>
<string name="59411">Hmm... maybe it ain&apos;t my place to comment, but I&apos;m not sure you&apos;re exactly ready for what&apos;s going on in there.</string>
<string name="59412">You might want to consider getting some better gear and some more experience, first, lest the city tear you apart.</string>
<string name="59413">Fair enough. When you feel more prepared, I&apos;ll still be here to let you in. A favor is a favor.</string>
<string name="59414">All right... the gates are open for you, now. Just remember: I can&apos;t let you back out once you&apos;re in. Make sure you have everything you need, you hear?</string>
<string name="59415">Aye, Aarin mentioned something along those lines. Had plenty of questions about the wizards in the tower, too.</string>
<string name="59416">Truth be told, the less I know about what you&apos;re up to, the better I&apos;ll feel. Do you want inside or not?</string>
<string name="59417">Fighting, and lots of it. The High Captains are at war... have been for weeks, now. Luskan&apos;s just about torn apart.</string>
<string name="59418">I&apos;m sure you&apos;re full of questions, but I really can&apos;t chat. I promised Aarin a favor, and I&apos;ll do it... so do you want inside or not?</string>
<string name="59419">The gate&apos;s open for you. Just remember: once you go into Luskan, you can&apos;t come back out... period. So get everything you need before you go in.</string>
<string name="59420">North: Luskan, South: Port Llast</string>
<string name="59421"></string>
<string name="59422"></string>
<string name="59423">Do not be alarmed, &lt;FirstName&gt;, in any case. I have my orders, just as you do. I will see you in Luskan.</string>
<string name="59424">Die, fleshling!</string>
<string name="59425">*chitter* *chitter*</string>
<string name="59426">*HOOOOOWL*</string>
<string name="59427">TAG! You&apos;re it!</string>
<string name="59428">Uh... I can&apos;t talk to you right now, &lt;mister/missus&gt;.</string>
<string name="59429">This man twitches with fear at the slightest sound or movement. His whole body quivers with anxiety.</string>
<string name="59430">This dwarf&apos;s arms bulge with muscles from years of hammering at the forge.</string>
<string name="59431">Blacksmith</string>
<string name="59432">This half-orc deckhand trudges around the docks, muttering under his breath as he works.</string>
<string name="59433">This human has the look of one carried away in religious fervor.</string>
<string name="59434">This old man has an air of nervousness and forgetfulness.</string>
<string name="59435">This armed and armoured fighter carries himself with assured confidence.</string>
<string name="59436">This man staggers around with the reek of cheap ale on his breath.</string>
<string name="59437">This sailor walks with a swagger as he whistles an old sea shanty.</string>
<string name="59438">This little child seems filled with boundless energy.</string>
<string name="59439">This man&apos;s facial expressions shift constantly between determined and purpose-filled, to vacant and confused looking.</string>
<string name="59440">Between the facial ticks and the wandering eyes, there is something very wrong with this person.</string>
<string name="59441">This creature is little more than a shadow, at least to look at.</string>
<string name="59442">Shadowy Figure</string>
<string name="59443">Forged from solid iron, the crafting of these mighty juggernauts often requires the expertise and master craftwork of either dwarven blacksmiths or gnomish tinkers.</string>
<string name="59444">A bitter look from this halfling is all that anyone seems to get.</string>
<string name="59445">This little gnome smirks and chuckles to himself as he works.</string>
<string name="59446">This customer waits with eager anticipation for something exciting to happen.</string>
<string name="59447">This arrogant-looking elf waits impatiently for something to happen.</string>
<string name="59448">An elderly, yet commanding man, this is plainly a wizard of immense power. Despite that, he seems a little addled.</string>
<string name="59449">This statue of a dwarf is surprisingly life-like in detail.</string>
<string name="59450">This woman looks terrified and cold.</string>
<string name="59451">This warrior looks like he is ready to battle entire hordes of orcs and goblins.</string>
<string name="59452">Goblin Archer</string>
<string name="59453">This dwarf eyes the others in the room as if gauging, then dismissing each of them.</string>
<string name="59454">This waitress looks exhausted from running around, serving the large crowd of customers who gather in here.</string>
<string name="59455">This eager elf is collecting the fees for entrants who wish to begin the contest.</string>
<string name="59456">This gnome has a pleasant, though shy smile for just about everyone.</string>
<string name="59457">Luskan Sergeant</string>
<string name="59458">There is something not quite right about this child.</string>
<string name="59459">There is something not quite right about this dwarf.</string>
<string name="59460">There is something strange about this old man.</string>
<string name="59461">This innkeeper eyes the large crowd with a mixed reaction of pleasure and distrust.</string>
<string name="59462">This half-orc, like so many before him, looks like he has a habit of cleaving others in two.</string>
<string name="59463">Orc Archer</string>
<string name="59464">This halfling looks busy, running errands for a man over in the corner of the inn.</string>
<string name="59465">This warrior looks like she is ready to battle entire hordes of orcs and goblins.</string>
<string name="59466">This halfling&apos;s eyes are blank and his face is set in an unnatural smile.</string>
<string name="59467">Aribeth looks tired, distracted, and far more guarded than she did the first time you met her.</string>
<string name="59468">This fierce-looking creature is different from anything else found in the realms. Its reptilian features are both frightening and savage.</string>
<string name="59469">Deep wrinkles surround the perpetual frown on this man&apos;s face.</string>
<string name="59470">Caliandros</string>
<string name="59471">A worried frown covers this commoner&apos;s face as she goes about her business.</string>
<string name="59472">A worried frown covers this commoner&apos;s face as he goes about his business.</string>
<string name="59473">This is a man who measures each step with the smooth grace of a stalking panther. His eyes shift around the room with an intense awareness.</string>
<string name="59474">This rough, burly-looking man has a confident, almost cocky air about him.</string>
<string name="59475">This young man appears to be rather nervous and shaken.</string>
<string name="59476">This serious-looking elf eyes everything with an intense, piercing gaze.</string>
<string name="59477">The dwarf sits at a table, rubbing one of his legs in between sips of ale.</string>
<string name="59478">An impecibly-dressed elf with silver hair, stands casually near a table. He looks like he could spring into action at a second&apos;s notice.</string>
<string name="59479">This glassy-eyed lady stares into the sky with a contemplative gaze.</string>
<string name="59480">This energetic, young child seems to have endless energy.</string>
<string name="59481">This commoner goes about her business with a capable air.</string>
<string name="59482">This lively, young child seems to have endless energy.</string>
<string name="59483">This commoner goes about his business with a capable air.</string>
<string name="59484">This man brow is wrinkled, as if he has carried the weight of the world for a long time now.</string>
<string name="59485">Revenants are vengeful spirits that have risen in a decayed version of their earlier bodies so that they can find and destroy their killers.</string>
<string name="59486">This gnome carries himself with an aura of holiness and dignity.</string>
<string name="59487">This intense looking man stares off into nothing, seemingly lost in deep contemplation.</string>
<string name="59488">This beautiful young lass sneers as she looks at other townsfolk, then smiles when she sees you.</string>
<string name="59489">This young girl looks truly miserable and frightened.</string>
<string name="59490">This woman glares around the tavern, staring down any unfortunate male who happens to look her way.</string>
<string name="59491">This is a shifty-eyed gnome who would look suspicious saying prayers in a temple, let alone here.</string>
<string name="59492">This elf exudes the extremely confident air of one who has never known defeat.</string>
<string name="59493">This man sits and stares at a woman, oblivious to the drool running down his chin.</string>
<string name="59494">There is nothing pleasant about the smile on this ranger&apos;s face. Malevolent hatred is the only description that could fit.</string>
<string name="59495">This half-orc looks and acts more intelligent than his orcish relations in the area. He obviously dominates them.</string>
<string name="59496">With grim determination, this warrior carries himself with the strain of controlled violence. You pity the cult member who runs into this soldier.</string>
<string name="59497">This cheerful lass stands in your room, eyeing you with an eager anticipation.</string>
<string name="59498">The innkeep survey&apos;s his customers with a professional eye, watching for thirsty customers with a full purse.</string>
<string name="59499">This elderly female is surrounded by some sort of glowing energy field.</string>
<string name="59500">This is a hard, angry-looking man. There is a barely controlled rage behind his eyes.</string>
<string name="59501">This frightened man looks thin and weak. His clothes are torn to shreds and he bears several wounds.</string>
<string name="59502">Despite numerous days of being a prisoner, this elf looks stunning, and she seems to know it.</string>
<string name="59503">This older gentleman has the kind of ready-to-spring look of a wild animal.</string>
<string name="59504">This vicious, little halfling looks to be seeking a fight.</string>
<string name="59505">This halfling druid looks like he could run through the bushes like a fox chasing a rabbit.</string>
<string name="59506">This ghostly figure shifts between raging anger and sad desperation as it hovers near a large tree.</string>
<string name="59507">This frustrated elf looks like he has been pacing here for a long time.</string>
<string name="59508">This man exudes a sense of great power, rooted in the primal forces of nature.</string>
<string name="59509">Though dwarven druids are rather rare, the few who choose this path can be quite imtimidating.</string>
<string name="59510">With a rough and tumble grin, this half-orc looks ready to fight an army by himself.</string>
<string name="59511">Smiling and humming a little tune to herself, this well-muscled woman has an air of quiet confidence.</string>
<string name="59512">This elven woman presents a powerful, intimidating front, that leaves no question of her authority.</string>
<string name="59513">This young druid has an eager, excited look about him.</string>
<string name="59514">This mangy-looking dwarf, wanders around, chanting strange things to himself.</string>
<string name="59515">Eyes blank and feverish, this man is obviously under some kind of charm.</string>
<string name="59516">This man has a blank but pleased look on his face.</string>
<string name="59517">This woman moves with a lack of awareness and confusion on her face.</string>
<string name="59518">This elf&apos;s calm composure could come across as arrogant if it weren&apos;t for the gentle smile on his face.</string>
<string name="59519">This beautiful woman has a proud, almost arrogant look about her, that detracts from an almost perfect face.</string>
<string name="59520">This ancient creature is almost too unbearably hideous to look at.</string>
<string name="59521">This guard wanders around with a slightly confused and dazed look on his face.</string>
<string name="59522">This spirit appears to be agitated and quite fearful.</string>
<string name="59523">This well-armed halfling looks like he takes life too seriously, or perhaps like he seriously enjoys taking lives.</string>
<string name="59524">Deadly looking halflings may not be common, but this one certainly falls into that category.</string>
<string name="59525">A brutal, cruel-looking gnome, with an eye out for trouble.</string>
<string name="59526">This barmaid looks exhausted from running around, serving the large crowd of customers who gather in here.</string>
<string name="59527">This farmer&apos;s brow is furrowed in worry and desperation.</string>
<string name="59528">Drex&apos;liggarr</string>
<string name="59529">This young woman shows concern on her face as she goes about her chores.</string>
<string name="59530">This lad has all the markings of a sullen youth.</string>
<string name="59531">This well-to-do farmer goes about his business with a brisk efficiency.</string>
<string name="59532">Worgs are powerful wolves with an evil disposition and an uncanny intelligence. They are sometimes found with goblins, whom they serve as mounts and guardians.</string>
<string name="59533">Drool dribbles off the lips of this man, who&apos;s eyes are brimming over with tears.</string>
<string name="59534">This is a small and unadorned key.</string>
<string name="59535">This katana is a fine blade... it is doubtful that it was forged by human hands, but the only hint as to its origins are the runes along its hilt. These indicate that the precious weapon was enchanted within the walls of the Host Tower of the Arcane.
Fire occasionally flares along its cruel edge... this blade has been used often by warriors of great skill in the service of their wizards.</string>
<string name="59536">This katana is a fine weapon, obviously kept well-maintained by its owner. It gleams with constant polish. There are no hints as to its origin other than the series of small runes inscribes along its handle.</string>
<string name="59537">This squishy little thing is an eyeball from an abyssal Imp.</string>
<string name="59538">This small eyeball came from one of the small baatezu Quasits.</string>
<string name="59539">This is a large, light key that would seem likely to open the gate doors to Luskan.</string>
<string name="59540">This is an official-looking document describing the bearer as an ambassador from the far-off state of Mulhorand, allowing admittance into the Host Tower of Luskan. The document is affixed with the seal of the Arcane Brotherhood.</string>
<string name="59541">A letter; the hand writing is blood stained but part of it is legible:
 
&quot;Dear Amatia: 

These caves are deep and dangerous; we&apos;ve found layers and layers of caves - but there is construction down at the bottom, and the crypts we seek. 

We tried to get Darius out, but barely escaped ourselves. We&apos;re going back tomorrow, love, to try again; I hope I&apos;ll get a chance to send this to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="59542">I find I&apos;ve grown fond of the monsters in these caves. They are savage, violent, and easily whipped into a frenzy by my puppet ogre mage Dergiab. Not entirely unlike the rest of us who have turned following Maugrim into a religion... He the puppeteer, we his willing puppets.

And to think he sent me here to search for some ancient artifact as he sent my brothers to Charwood and the Neverwinter Wood. It isn&apos;t in this place. It would have left some tell-tale sign. It would want to be found. It would call me to it. Perhaps they have had better luck in the two Woods. So, instead of being a puppet, I have become the puppeteer. Not so grand as Maugrim but, even so, look how Dergiab struts and schemes at my bidding...</string>

Belial appears quite proud of this tragic subterfuge, flaunting it readily. He does not fear Judgment, as any return to the Abyss will be a triumphal homecoming for him.

<string name="59612">Port Llast: Bounty Hunt</string>
<string name="59613">Kendrack, head of the mercenary guild and Mayor of Port Llast, has put out a reward for the death of five dangerous prisoners escaped from Waterdeep. They have separated to avoid detection but can all be identified by means of a tattoo on their left ear, marking them as inmates of the Bulwark prison. It is this tattoo that Kendrack wants as evidence of the deed.

Zor, a burly minotaur, is rumored to be hiding with friends and contacts he has in Luskan. Wyvern, an elven ranger with a taste for trickery, will likely have sought refuge in the Neverwinter Wood. Stirge, an egomaniacal gnome, was last sighted on the road south of Port Llast. Delilah, a halfling assassin who once made her home in Luskan, has probably returned there. Yesgar, the group&apos;s ring-leader and mastermind, remains elusive though Kendrack doubts that he&apos;d stray far.</string>

<string name="59623">With the Wailing&apos;s cure and subsequent removal of Neverwinter&apos;s quarantine, the wizardess Eltoora has journeyed to Port Llast to provide her services to those searching for the cult responsible. She also comes with ulterior motives, however, as she seeks a collection of ancient tomes from the lost civilization of Imaskar. The five books are said to act as recipes, providing guidance to those undertaking magical experiments. Should any of the tomes be found, she will not only reward whoever returns them but also make the tomes publicly available to all arcanists who wish to experiment with them in her library.

Through scrying attempts, she has managed to narrow down the locations of the five tomes of Imaskar. The Tome of Fire and the Tome of Death are both said to be lost in Charwood, while the Tome of Life apparently rests in the collection of Elminster in far-off Shadowdale. The Tome of Ice is housed within a tower south of Port Llast and the last, the Tome of Resonance, lies somewhere along the treacherous road to Luskan.</string>

<string name="59635">A halfling named Solomon has offered a ring to a local adventurer, apparently in gratitude. He seemed quite intent on getting rid of it.</string>
<string name="59636">It turns out that Solomon, the halfling who had been handing out rings to adventurers in the local inns, is an agent of Desther&apos;s cult. He&apos;s been threatening anyone involved in the investigations into the organization, warning them to mind their own business.</string>
<string name="59637">Solomon, a cult agent, has been killed.

Aarin warns that this is a one-way trip, however. Once inside Luskan, nobody will be able to get back out, so one should only enter Luskan fully-equipped and with no tasks left to be completed.</string>

A heavy contingent of guards and magical wards prevent unwanted visitors from crossing the bridge to the Host Tower.

Doing so will require the official pass of one of Luskan&apos;s High Captains, the city&apos;s self-proclaimed pirate kings constantly squabbling over goods and territory within the city walls. The pass has the magical seal of the Arcane Brotherhood, which Aarin Gend hopes to use to make a forgery.

There she has once again put out a call to adventurers to seek out the cult&apos;s corruption wherever it may lie. The cult&apos;s base must be discovered and its leaders brought to justice. Standing guard over Aribeth at the local temple is Aarin Gend, a Spymaster in the service of the Alliance. She has encouraged all adventurers to work closely with him in their ongoing search of the region.

Aarin Gend has explained that the best lead for locating the cult lies to the north of Port Llast, in a series of caves that lie in the hills. They are inhabited by humanoid monsters that have been performing unusual raids. Should this avenue of investigation not prove worthwhile, the spymaster suggests searching either Luskan to the north, Neverwinter Wood to the east or the wildlands of the South Road. Two separate and corroborating pieces of evidence are needed to prove the cult&apos;s location.</string>

The journal found nearby does not say where the cult is located but it does suggest that other cultists have been sent to Charwood in the south and Neverwinter Wood in the east to search for some sort of important object. These two locations would seem to be likely places to continue the search.</string>

<string name="59948">You won&apos;t get out of here in one piece!</string>
<string name="59949">I&apos;ll gut you good!</string>
<string name="59950">For the High Captain!</string>
<string name="59951">The Wink and Tickle</string>
<string name="59952">The Cutlass</string>
<string name="59953">Ehh, what you wants? Me busy! Go &apos;way!</string>
<string name="59954">Must feed</string>
<string name="59955">Must destroy</string>
<string name="59956">For the master</string>
<string name="59957"></string>
<string name="59958"></string>
<string name="59959"></string>
<string name="59960">Maybe you shoulds ask wizards, huh?</string>
<string name="59961">Perhaps you should ask your wizards, then.</string>
<string name="59962">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="59963">Good. You dies, now.</string>
<string name="59964">Me has questions.</string>
<string name="59965">Excellent. Now you die.</string>
<string name="59966">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="59967">Tells me &apos;bout tower.</string>
<string name="59968">Why is so much security?</string>
<string name="59969">You talks &apos;bout fighting...?</string>
<string name="59970">Who this new Archmage guy?</string>
<string name="59971">Tell me about the Host Tower.</string>
<string name="59972">Just how big is tower?</string>
<string name="59973">You hears &apos;bout someone named Maugrim?</string>
<string name="59974">You knows &apos;bout cult in tower, maybe?</string>
<string name="59975">Just how large is the tower?</string>
<string name="59976">Have you heard of someone named Maugrim?</string>
<string name="59977">Do you know about any cult in the tower?</string>
<string name="59978">Why all the tight security?</string>
<string name="59979">You mentioned fighting...?</string>
<string name="59980">What you means by mess?</string>
<string name="59981">What do you mean by a mess?</string>
<string name="59982">Who is this new Archmage Arcane?</string>
<string name="59983">Old archmage dead, huh?</string>
<string name="59984">The former Archmage is dead?</string>
<string name="59985"></string>
<string name="59986"></string>
<string name="59987">Hmph. The mages have been difficult to contact since the fighting ceased. Your seal is legitimate... and Tempus knows there&apos;s been enough strange visitors as of late.</string>
<string name="59988">Fare you well, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="59989">Wh-what?! To arms, men!</string>
<string name="59990">I suppose there&apos;s no harm in that. Go ahead, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="59991">Well... it&apos;s a large place, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. They say it&apos;s been here long before the city was, that it was magically made a long time ago.</string>
<string name="59992">The brotherhood made it their home about, oh, twenty years back or so. The former Archmage Arcane made Luskan what it is now.</string>
<string name="59993">I don&apos;t know much about the place. We guards don&apos;t go inside it, usually, and don&apos;t mix with the wizardly folk... which is fine by me.</string>
<string name="59994">I have no idea, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Frankly, I&apos;m not even sure the wizards do. They don&apos;t get about the tower like normal folk, with stairs and halls and such.</string>
<string name="59995">There are these lights that teleport them about to the rooms inside. Tempus knows how they figure out who&apos;s allowed where, or where they want to go.</string>
<string name="59996">If you see one of those teleporter lights inside, I wouldn&apos;t play with it. Like I said, you may end up somewhere within the tower... and that wouldn&apos;t be good.</string>
<string name="59997">Hmmm. Someone named Maugrim arrived here a long time ago. Asked to speak to the wizards. Been here ever since, but I&apos;ve never seen or heard of him in that time. Might be dead, I suppose.</string>
<string name="59998">A cult? No, I&apos;ve heard nothing like that. These wizards have never been the religious sort, in my experience.</string>
<string name="59999">The brotherhood has always had tight security, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. They prefer their business to be their own.</string>
