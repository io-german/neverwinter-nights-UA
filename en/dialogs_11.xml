<string name="6">The Puzzlers&apos; Sepulcher</string>
<string name="7">You can feel yourself getting closer to the hidden lair of the Knower of Places. In a secret chamber deep in the icy wastes of Cania, you have found the statue of a gargoyle. Etched along its base are the words &quot;Stone to stone the stone turns; Lightning to lightning, the lightning fades.&quot;</string>
<string name="8">You have killed the Scrivener, a small dog-like beast that you found whining at the entrance to a cave at the heart of town.

<string name="99">Waterdeep. One of the greatest cities in all of Faerun, it is home to a multitude of peaceful folk from all races and all walks of life.
Beneath Waterdeep, however, lies a different realm.
This is the deep dungeon known as Undermountain, built by the mad wizard Halaster long before the city was even established above.
Here Halaster tests adventurers who trespass therein with the deadliest of traps and the most dangerous of creatures.  All but the luckiest meet their deaths in its dark halls.
Regardless of this presence beneath them, the people of Waterdeep feel safe enough... for while one may enter Undermountain, it is rare that anything actually comes out...
...until now.
For there is another realm that exists beneath even Undermountain. A place of shadows and evil known only as the Underdark.
It is here that the sinister dark elves known as the Drow rule next to other subterranean horrors unknown to most on the surface world above.
And it is the Drow who now lead an army of these creatures into the streets of Waterdeep, besieging the city from below in a campaign of blood and terror.
And in their darkest hour, the Lords of Waterdeep have issued a call for a hero, someone who can face these dark elves and all of their brethren in their own land, someone who can defeat...
...  the hordes of the Underdark.</string>
<string name="100">Rogues, or other characters with high dexterity, should take the Weapon Finesse feat and use light weapons, such as short swords and daggers. They are not well suited to using strength based attacks.</string>

<string name="111">&quot;Yes, thank you, Knower.&quot;</string>
<string name="112">&quot;Why? Because my skin is too dark for your love!?&quot;</string>

Use the Default Language unless you do any of the following:

1) You need to edit a module in a language other than the language used by your game installation. For example, you have the French version of the game, but need to edit a module for German players.

2) You are a translator who is adding translated text to a module. For example, you are editing a module that was created by an English user, and you are adding translated versions of all the text so that Italian users can play the module.

<string name="124">You have acquired an amulet.</string>
<string name="125">The familiar, hooded figure of the Reaper bows as you approach, enigmatic as always. Distant flames flicker within his reflective, featureless face and you shiver in spite of yourself.</string>
<string name="126">&quot;How may I serve you, Sojourner?&quot;</string>
<string name="127">&quot;I am sorry, Sojourner,&quot; the Reaper sighs heavily. &quot;You are now barred from the world of Toril. If you are to ask me to return you there, I cannot comply.&quot;</string>
<string name="128">&quot;I am sorry, Sojourner,&quot; the Reaper sighs heavily. &quot;You are now barred from the world of Toril. I cannot comply.&quot;</string>
<string name="129">&quot;You are barred from returning to that world by the command of Mephistopheles.&quot; He bows low once again. &quot;I am sorry, Sojourner. It is Mephistopheles who rules here, and so can he command me.&quot;</string>
<string name="130">&quot;The archdevil uses me as he uses all things, such is his nature. I was not always his subject... but once he learned of my True Name I was his forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="131">&quot;Not because I desired to. As I said, the archdevil commanded me with the power of my True Name.&quot;</string>
<string name="132">&quot;Nor does he need to be. As I said, the archdevil commanded me with my True Name... I cannot choose to disobey, even if he is no longer present.&quot;</string>
<string name="133">&quot;All beings have a True Name that is the definition of their personal essence, their very existence. Should another learn your True Name and speak it to you, they then rule all that you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="134">&quot;Mephistopheles discovered my True Name long ago, though I know not how. Only he knows it, so he alone commands me despite whatever I might wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="135">&quot;Mephistopheles used you, as well, creating a devil&apos;s deal that you were unaware of. A bond was formed with him the moment you discovered his relic, and upon killing the one who held him captive you took his place and he yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="136">&quot;Through your bond, you have assumed the chains that once held Mephistopheles. So as he was once bound to the realm of Cania, so now are you. His prison has become yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="137">&quot;He traded your freedom for his chains. Once he was bound to the planar realm of Cania but, through his trickery and deceit, he has escaped through the bond he formed with you. So are you now bound to Cania as he once was.&quot;</string>
<string name="138">&quot;Cania is the Eighth Hell of Baator, the Frozen Wastes and the Dreaded Depths. Here Mephistopheles is Lord of all and prisoner both... or he was, until he slipped his chains and placed them unto you.&quot;</string>
<string name="139">&quot;You forget, Sojourner... this realm is all places as well as none. We exist in Cania just as everywhere else, part of your prison just as not.&quot;</string>
<string name="140">He gestures to the mist-shrouded door that stands alone at the far end of the chamber. &quot;That path leads to Cania as it always has, as it has been a part of you since the bond was created. It is no longer barred to your passing.&quot;</string>
<string name="141">&quot;Alas, I cannot. I have been commanded by Mephistopheles not to allow you to return to Toril, and you no longer possess his relic.&quot;</string>
<string name="142">&quot;If you learned my True Name you could command me to break the bond between you and return you to Toril. I know not how you would learn of it, however, and I cannot tell it to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="143">The Reaper nods solemnly. &quot;How may I serve you, Sojourner?&quot;</string>
<string name="144">&quot;I wish you well, Sojourner. Would that I could do more to aid you on your path.&quot;</string>
<string name="145">The Reaper pauses for a moment, gazing out into the distance as if searching before finally responding. &quot;They are dead, Sojourner. That is, however, merely a transitory state as you are well aware.&quot;</string>
<string name="146">&quot;The Spirits of the Dead can end up in many places, as their will dictates. The outer planes are infinite in their variety and who can say where a soul will go?&quot;</string>
<string name="147">&quot;That said, this realm touches all places and so can these dead companions be found. But they will agree to come or not, each according to their desire. I cannot compel them to come here in the same way I have you. Who shall I summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="148">&quot;The spirit refuses... I sense anger and hatred directed at you, Sojourner. He feels wronged by you and will not answer my summons. Is there anyone else you wish me to summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="149">&quot;Consent is given. His spirit travels the gates now, hurtling towards us, and flesh is now forming... your companion returns to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="150">Valen suddenly appears, as whole as the last time you saw him. He looks around, mildly bewildered. &quot;So I am summoned from beyond the veil once again. To stand at your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I am glad to be here with you, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="151">&quot;When Mephistopheles killed me along with so many of the rebels I thought my time was done.&quot; He turns and regards the Gatekeeper. &quot;And you, strange one... it was you I felt calling me, yes? You&apos;re the one who brought me to this... place?&quot;</string>
<string name="152">&quot;Yes, fiendish one. &lt;FullName&gt; has requested your presence here in the hells... Now, Sojourner, is there anyone else you wish me to summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="153">&quot;The spirit refuses... I sense anger and hatred directed at you, Sojourner. She feels wronged by you and will not answer my summons. Is there anyone else you wish me to summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="154">&quot;Consent is given. Her spirit travels the gates now, hurtling towards us, and flesh is now forming... your companion returns to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="155">Nathyrra suddenly appears, looking startled. She draws one of her daggers almost without thinking. &quot;What... where am I?&quot; Her eyes focus on you. &quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;? So I am... alive once more.&quot;</string>
<string name="156">Slowly she nods, comprehension coming to her. &quot;Thank you for bringing me back, then, my friend. To have died at Mephistopheles&apos;s hand along with so many others was unsettling, to say the least.&quot; She looks around. &quot;And what is this place? Are we in the planes?&quot;</string>
<string name="157">&quot;Yes, dark one. &lt;FullName&gt; has requested your presence here in the hells... Now, Sojourner, is there anyone else you wish me to summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="158">&quot;Consent is given. His spirit travels the gates now, hurtling towards us, and flesh is now forming... your companion returns to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="159">Deekin suddenly appears. Strangely, he does not seem surprised nor disturbed by his situation. &quot;There you is, boss! Deekin keeps telling angels that he gots lots to do, that he not stayings up there, but they not believes him!&quot;</string>
<string name="160">&lt;StartAction&gt;(sigh)&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Deekin be right all along, just like Deekin says. Stupid angels.&quot; He looks around a bit, taking in the chamber. &quot;Ummm... is we in hell, boss? Place needs good cleaning, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="161">&quot;Yes, little one. &lt;FullName&gt; has requested your presence here in the hells... Now, Sojourner, is there anyone else you wish me to summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="162">The Reaper nods slowly. &quot;The Sleeping Man is wise and old. He passed through the Gates of Cania when they were first formed, long before the time of my creation.&quot;</string>
<string name="163">&quot;It has been many ages since I saw him last, yet I suspect he remains there even still, asleep and waiting. Is this so?&quot;</string>
<string name="164">&quot;Carved about the dais where he sleeps were once the words &apos;She will find you by the Gates of Cania.&apos; And thus he waits for her.&quot;</string>
<string name="165">&quot;Death or a maiden fair, who can say? The words are there, in answer to a question he must have once asked. That is all I know.&quot;</string>
<string name="166">&quot;You have learned my True Name, I see... Very well, I have summoned a door that will return you to the one you know as Durnan, in Waterdeep. But, before you go, is there anything else you would have me do?&quot;</string>
<string name="167">&quot;A word of warning before you go, Sojourner... By breaking the chains Mephistopheles placed upon you and stepping through that door, you forfeit the bond that brought you to this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="168">&quot;You will not see me again nor lay your eyes upon the ice of Cania.&quot; The Reaper bows deeply. &quot;It has been a... pleasure to serve you. I wish you well, Sojourner.&quot;</string>
<string name="169">&quot;Consider the Devils of Cania unleashed, m&apos;&lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, but once set loose upon the mortal realm, they will not be easy to rein back in. Even so, I shall comply. Anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="170">&quot;If that is your wish, I shall make it so. Even death itself will no longer hold the spirits here. Is there anything else you would ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="171">&quot;As you command, Sojourner. I will return them safely to their home in Limbo. Is there anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="172">&quot;Your destination lies here in Cania, thus may I comply... Behold, a Gate has been opened unto you, leading to the place where you last died.&quot;</string>
<string name="173">&quot;Only what I have already spoken to you. Cania is the Eighth Hell of Baator, a frigid land where Mephistopheles once ruled. It is a plane of torment and evil... be wary should you step unto its icy shores.&quot;</string>
<string name="174">&quot;There was a time when I roamed free, and I knew much of the Cania that was. I know little of the frozen waste that exists now, however, and I have no power there. I cannot help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="175">&quot;Remember that you are now bound to Cania. If you knew my True Name, I could break that bond and send you from here. Otherwise even if you were to find another portal I would only retrieve you once more.&quot;</string>
<string name="176">&quot;I cannot openly betray the one who holds my True Name, Sojourner.&quot; There is almost the hint of a smile in the Reaper&apos;s featureless mirror of a face.</string>
<string name="177">&quot;Abuse it more than the archdevil himself already has?&quot; The Reaper shakes his head slowly. &quot;I think not.&quot;</string>
<string name="178">&quot;This I do not know. I cannot provide it to you willingly, Sojourner... and I have no knowledge of how Mephistopheles discovered it. If you did learn it, however, then would you be free.&quot;</string>
<string name="179">He shakes his head. &quot;I know of none. If any exist, they are well beyond your reach. It would be far easier for you to seek my True Name... though even that is a near impossible task.&quot;</string>
<string name="180">&quot;You have great power, Sojourner, but I am a part of this realm that is everywhere and nowhere. You could only destroy me if you possessed the power to destroy me in all places... which you do not.&quot;</string>
<string name="181">&quot;How may I serve you, Sojourner?&quot;</string>
<string name="182">The familiar, hooded figure of the Reaper bows as you approach, enigmatic as always. Distant flames flicker within his reflective, featureless face and you shiver in spite of yourself.</string>
<string name="183">&quot;How may I serve you, Sojourner?&quot;</string>
<string name="184">You have not visited this realm often since acquiring the Relic of the Reaper, but whenever you have it is always the same... the dire chill in the air seeps through to your bones, and the hum of ancient magic is all around you.</string>
<string name="185">The familiar, hooded figure of the Reaper bows as you approach, enigmatic as always. Distant flames flicker within his reflective, featureless face and you shiver in spite of yourself.</string>
<string name="186">The Reaper nods solemnly. &quot;How may I serve you, Sojourner?&quot;</string>
<string name="187">&quot;Much time has passed since last you walked within this hall, Sojourner. Perhaps this is indeed the moment to remind you of the nature of the relic you carry.&quot;</string>
<string name="188">The Reaper gestures to the small artifact. &quot;The relic is bound to you, and you to it. It is your key to this nexus realm, and you may use it to come here willingly... or be brought here at the moment prior to your death.&quot;</string>
<string name="189">&quot;This is a nexus realm, Sojourner, a place that touches everywhere and yet nowhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="190">&quot;If you were brought here to avoid your mortal death, the energy used by the rogue stone will allow me to mark that place and return you there if you wish. You need only ask.&quot;</string>
<string name="191">The Reaper gestures to the doors behind him. &quot;The central portal is always anchored to your realm, though it may not bring you where you wish to go. The other portals must be anchored to be used.&quot;</string>
<string name="192">&quot;The gems contain a power that, when consumed, can be felt even from the furthest planes. Think of it as a point of reference, Sojourner, that allows this plane to touch yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="193">&quot;If you are on your home plane and you possess a rogue stone, you may use its energy to anchor one of this plane&apos;s portals to that spot. After that point, you may use that door to return to that spot at will.&quot;</string>
<string name="194">&quot;That is a forbidden portal for you, Sojourner, for you yet have life within you.&quot;</string>
<string name="195">&quot;It is not yet time for you. Use the other portals here and be thankful.&quot;</string>
<string name="196">&quot;The location moves, from time to time. Always it is tied to somewhere you have been, Sojourner, as this realm is tied to you through the relic.&quot;</string>
<string name="197">&quot;Nay, Sojourner. In order for the relic to transport you here so quickly so as to avoid your death, it requires great energy... energy it can only draw from a rogue stone.&quot;</string>
<string name="198">&quot;So long as you carry such a stone in your possession you are indeed safe. Should you not have one, however, you will perish... as all mortals do.&quot;</string>
<string name="199">&quot;As you wish. How else may I serve you, Sojourner?&quot;</string>
<string name="200">&quot;As you wish, Sojourner. Should you have need of me, here I shall remain.&quot;</string>
<string name="201">&quot;Behold, Sojourner... A Gate has been opened unto you that you might join with the leader of your fellows.&quot;</string>
<string name="202">&quot;Behold, Sojourner... A Gate has been opened unto you, leading to the place where you last died.&quot;</string>
<string name="203">&quot;I am bound to it, Sojourner, as it is bound to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="204">&quot;It is, however, the only answer that I can give.&quot; The Reaper bows low, sounding almost apologetic. &quot;The relic is what it is, just as you are. Better to ask who created you, Sojourner.&quot;</string>
<string name="205">&quot;This is the Gatehouse, an entry point into the Land of the Dead,&quot; he gestures all about him. &quot;You are welcome here but I do not recommend you linger.&quot;</string>
<string name="206">&quot;I know of none, for it is not my place to know such things. I am part of this realm, and it is all of my concern.&quot;</string>
<string name="207">&quot;That is not for you, Sojourner,&quot; he interrupts. &quot;Seek it not, for it is not yet your time to pass through it.&quot;</string>
<string name="208">&quot;As I have already spoken, it is not yet your time. I can say no more.&quot;</string>
<string name="209">&quot;Have you forgotten already, Sojourner? If you wish, I can speak of the relic you carry and its relation to the nexus realm.&quot;</string>
<string name="210">&quot;Than what else would you ask of this realm?&quot;</string>
<string name="211">&quot;As I have already reminded you, they are points that may be anchored to your plane. Until then, they drift free and lead nowhere but here.&quot;</string>
<string name="212">&quot;It is nowhere, and yet everywhere. This is a nexus realm, Sojourner, that is tied to you... it touches on all places that you were, are and will be.&quot;</string>
<string name="213">&quot;Understanding is not required. The only requirement is that you carry the relic with you. Therefore the nexus is yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="214">&quot;You have asked me this many times, Sojourner, and yet I give you the only answer I can: I am the Reaper, the Gatherer of Dust, the Gatekeeper... and this is my realm.&quot;</string>
<string name="215">&quot;I rule this place only so far as any being can rule themselves. We are the same, this realm and I. I am King but never master.&quot;</string>
<string name="216">The Reaper&apos;s reflective face reveals no emotion, yet he pauses. &quot;You hold the Relic of the Reaper, Sojourner. Therefore you rule here... for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="217">&quot;I am bound to it as it is bound to you. So long as you hold it, you command this place... and therefore you command me.&quot;</string>
<string name="218">&quot;I cannot leave this place, Sojourner, for I am this place. As I am tied to the relic you carry, so do I already journey with you always.&quot;</string>
<string name="219">&quot;I am not a slave, nor am I prisoner. A place can be a prison, but cannot itself be imprisoned... though it can be commanded. Remember that.&quot;</string>
<string name="220">&quot;I have always been here. As this nexus realm was created, so was I created with it. We are the same, one an extension of the other.&quot;</string>
<string name="221">&quot;I could give you the answer to your question, Sojourner, but it would mean nothing to you. Those who created us are passed out of knowing.&quot;</string>
<string name="222">&quot;I am a being of the planes, Sojourner... no more, no less.&quot; You think there is almost a hint of a smile in the Reaper&apos;s blank features.</string>
<string name="223">&quot;Surely. And yet not a one of them is my True Name.&quot;</string>
<string name="224">&quot;All beings have a True Name, Sojourner. Even you. It defines the essence of your being and gives you power over your actions. Always it must remain secret.&quot;</string>
<string name="225">&quot;To surrender your True Name is to surrender your power, your very essence, to another. Be glad that as a mortal you are unaware of it and thus may never surrender it.&quot;</string>
<string name="226">&quot;You have not truly perished,&quot; the figure reminds you, &quot;as the relic will always pull you to this realm at the very moment of your death. From here,&quot; he gestures to the doors behind him, &quot;you may return to whence you came.&quot;</string>
<string name="227">The Reaper&apos;s emotionless face gleams at you from the darkness. It seems he has nothing left to say to you.</string>
<string name="228">&quot;I need to ask you something.&quot;</string>
<string name="229">&quot;I have died and wish to return to where I fell.&quot;</string>
<string name="230">&quot;But Toril is my home!&quot;</string>
<string name="231">&quot;You can&apos;t comply? But I command you!&quot;</string>
<string name="232">&quot;What? Who says I&apos;m barred from there?&quot;</string>
<string name="233">&quot;So you worked for Mephistopheles all along.&quot;</string>
<string name="234">&quot;I knew it! You lied to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="235">&quot;His forever? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="236">&quot;But he&apos;s not here to command you now.&quot;</string>
<string name="237">&quot;What is a True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="238">&quot;So am I stuck here forever?&quot;</string>
<string name="239">&quot;What do you mean he took my place?&quot;</string>
<string name="240">&quot;Cania? Isn&apos;t that one of the Nine Hells?&quot;</string>
<string name="241">&quot;The realm of Cania? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="242">&quot;Here? But... I&apos;m not in Cania, am I?&quot;</string>
<string name="243">&quot;Is there nothing you can do to help me?&quot;</string>
<string name="244">&quot;I have other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="245">&quot;I must go.&quot;</string>
<string name="246">&quot;What of my companions? Where are they?&quot;</string>
<string name="247">&quot;No, summon no one.&quot;</string>
<string name="248">&quot;Summon forth Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="249">&quot;Summon forth Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="250">&quot;Summon forth Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="251">&quot;I can&apos;t think of anyone else.&quot;</string>
<string name="252">&quot;I seek the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="253">&quot;Yes, it is. What is he waiting for?&quot;</string>
<string name="254">&quot;And who is &apos;she&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="255">&quot;So tell me again what I could do to return home?&quot;</string>
<string name="256">&quot;Hecugoth the Abandoned, I command you to grant me passage home!&quot;</string>
<string name="257">&quot;Thank you, Reaper. That will be all.&quot;</string>
<string name="258">&quot;Allow the Devils to wreak their havoc on the planes.&quot;</string>
<string name="259">&quot;Allow the Spirits of the Dead to haunt the Living.&quot;</string>
<string name="260">&quot;Allow the Githzerai Pilgrims to return home.&quot;</string>
<string name="261">&quot;I have died and wish to return to where I fell.&quot;</string>
<string name="262">&quot;What do you know about Cania?&quot;</string>
<string name="263">&quot;Surely there are other ways back to Toril?&quot;</string>
<string name="264">&quot;You sound as if you&apos;d prefer to betray Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="265">&quot;But aren&apos;t you worried that I might abuse your True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="266">&quot;How could I discover your True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="267">&quot;Are there any other relics?&quot;</string>
<string name="268">&quot;What is Cania?&quot;</string>
<string name="269">&quot;I should destroy you for betraying me.&quot;</string>
<string name="270">&quot;I require your assistance. Quickly.&quot;</string>
<string name="271">&quot;So we meet again.&quot;</string>
<string name="272">&quot;It is good to see you again, Reaper.&quot;</string>
<string name="273">&quot;I would like to know more about how the Relic works.&quot;</string>
<string name="274">&quot;How do I return home from here?&quot;</string>
<string name="275">&quot;Why are rogue stones so important?&quot;</string>
<string name="276">&quot;What do you mean by anchoring?&quot;</string>
<string name="277">&quot;What about the far door, the one covered in mist?&quot;</string>
<string name="278">&quot;You have to be dead to go through it?&quot;</string>
<string name="279">&quot;Where does the central portal go?&quot;</string>
<string name="280">&quot;So I am immortal? I cannot die?&quot;</string>
<string name="281">&quot;I&apos;ve heard enough about the Relic.&quot;</string>
<string name="282">&quot;I must go.&quot;</string>
<string name="283">&quot;Tell me about the Relic again.&quot;</string>
<string name="284">&quot;I must go to the leader of my adventuring party.&quot;</string>
<string name="285">&quot;I have died and wish to return to where I fell.&quot;</string>
<string name="286">&quot;But who created the relic? What is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="287">&quot;That&apos;s not an answer.&quot;</string>
<string name="288">&quot;Tell me about your realm once again.&quot;</string>
<string name="289">&quot;Are there many places like this?&quot;</string>
<string name="290">&quot;There is a door at the far end of the room, covered in mist...&quot;</string>
<string name="291">&quot;Why not?&quot;</string>
<string name="292">&quot;What are all these doors?&quot;</string>
<string name="293">&quot;No, not yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="294">&quot;Yes, do that.&quot;</string>
<string name="295">&quot;But...where is this place exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="296">&quot;I don&apos;t understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="297">&quot;I would like to know more about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="298">&quot;Enough of that, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="299">&quot;Do you rule here? Or do you serve another?&quot;</string>
<string name="300">&quot;Is that an answer?&quot;</string>
<string name="301">&quot;What is the significance of the relic?&quot;</string>
<string name="302">&quot;So could I command you to come with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="303">&quot;Is there no way to free you?&quot;</string>
<string name="304">&quot;How did you come to be here?&quot;</string>
<string name="305">&quot;Who created this realm, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="306">&quot;But... what *are* you, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="307">&quot;That is a lot of names.&quot;</string>
<string name="308">&quot;True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="309">&quot;Why must it be secret?&quot;</string>
<string name="310">&quot;It seems I died once again.&quot;</string>
<string name="311">This blade is almost as nasty as the personality that now permanently resides within it. With each hit, it draws a little bit of the life-force inside and uses some of it to heal the wielder. Whether it could potentially draw more of that life-force, or has other side effects, is unknown... even to Enserric himself. The long-dead mage has been within the weapon for quite a while but has not gotten much use, seeing as for decades the primary user was even deader than Enserric. ...hmmm. Deader? More dead? Can something be more dead? This is exactly the sort of question that makes Enserric clam up and begin muttering in pure agitation...</string>
<string name="312">&quot;I guess I could answer a few questions for you. Can&apos;t see any harm in it. Besides, it&apos;s not like the Maker&apos;s golems here on the island will tell you anything.&quot; She smiles briefly at her own joke.</string>
<string name="313">&quot;Well, the island was named after the ancient duergar mage who built his stronghold here centuries ago. They say the Maker came here so he could work in peace while perfecting his golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="314">&quot;There must be some truth to these stories. There&apos;s some ruins to the north that could have been the Maker&apos;s laboratory, though all that&apos;s left is the dungeon. And there&apos;s the golems, of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="315">&quot;The dungeon at the north end of the island is crawling with golems. At least, the first floor of it is. We don&apos;t go any deeper. We figure they&apos;re guardians left over from the Maker. &quot;</string>
<string name="316">&quot;They must have been built to protect against thieves and scavengers.&quot; She gives you a rueful look. &quot;They do a pretty good job, too. We&apos;ve lost more than a few duergar during our expeditions.&quot;</string>
<string name="317">She shakes her head. &quot;Not possible. There&apos;s some kind of scavenger golem in there that repairs and rebuilds any golems we manage to take down.&quot;  </string>
<string name="318">&quot;We&apos;ve tried to kill the scavenger, but it&apos;s got a number of magical defenses. Every time we attack it, it teleports away to safety. That damn thing makes our job a lot tougher.&quot;</string>
<string name="319">&quot;Everything I know about the Maker comes from legends and myths. They say he was a powerful duergar sorcerer who isolated himself on this island to work on his research.&quot;</string>
<string name="320">&quot;His specialty was crafting golems. According to the legends, he found a way to imbue his constructs with intelligence and free will. But the golems we&apos;ve run into seem pretty standard to me.&quot; </string>
<string name="321">&quot;Nobody really knows; he disappeared five centuries ago. Most people think he was killed off by his own creations: intelligent golems with a will of their own.&quot;</string>
<string name="322">&quot;I don&apos;t know if I really believe that, but it makes a good story. The only golems we&apos;ve run across in the dungeon don&apos;t seem all that smart to me. Damn tough to kill, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="323">This duergar female looks you up and down, gauging your strength and trying to judge if you are a threat. Satisfied that you pose no immediate harm, she seems to relax slightly.</string>
<string name="324">The duergar raise their weapons, but at a signal from their leader they hold their ground. She gives you a quick once over, evaluating you as a potential threat.</string>
<string name="325">&quot;If this is a joke, you picked the wrong group to play games with. We&apos;re not looking for a fight, but we&apos;re well armed and we will defend ourselves.&quot;</string>
<string name="326">&quot;You should&apos;ve picked an easier target! Attack!&quot;</string>
<string name="327">She nods. &quot;Fair enough. As long as you aren&apos;t here to cause trouble for us, you can keep your secrets. My name is Dahanna. I&apos;m the leader of this expedition.&quot;</string>
<string name="328">The duergar visibly relaxes, though she is still studying you carefully as she addresses you once more. &quot;My name is Dahanna. I&apos;m the leader of this expedition.&quot;</string>
<string name="329">&quot;Come and go as you please, surfacer. You don&apos;t answer to us.&quot;</string>
<string name="330">She nods thoughtfully. &quot;The Valsharess. I&apos;ve heard about her. One of the drow matron mothers, isn&apos;t she? She&apos;s made quite a name for herself recently.&quot;</string>
<string name="331">&quot;I hear she&apos;s been attacking the surface... I guess that&apos;s why you&apos;re looking to stop her. But you won&apos;t find any help against her here. If the drow don&apos;t bother us, we don&apos;t bother them.&quot;</string>
<string name="332">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna shakes her head slowly. &quot;I don&apos;t want trouble with you, surfacer. But you bullying us won&apos;t make us join you. Our minds are set; you can&apos;t change them.&quot;</string>
<string name="333">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna shrugs. &quot;Maybe. But the Valsharess isn&apos;t the first drow we&apos;ve seen rise to power. Most of them get toppled long before they ever turn their attention to us.&quot;</string>
<string name="334">&quot;We&apos;re treasure hunters. Centuries ago, this island was home to a powerful duergar wizard known as the Maker, or so the stories go. The Maker&apos;s long gone, but he left a few things behind.&quot; </string>
<string name="335">&quot;We come out here to salvage rare metal and pieces of golems from the ruins of the Maker&apos;s tower. You&apos;d be surprised what the right buyer will pay for an arm made of pure adamantine.&quot;</string>
<string name="336">She grins. &quot;But it isn&apos;t easy. Not too many expeditions come here anymore. There&apos;s still some good metal to be found, but you have to be willing to go toe-to-toe with the Maker&apos;s golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="337">&quot;As usual, the duergar are scavengers, living off the scraps of others.&quot;</string>
<string name="338">&quot;Better watch your tongue, drow! This is duergar territory. Your arrogance might have cost you more than you&apos;re willing to pay.&quot;</string>
<string name="339">Dahanna and the other duergar approach you. You notice their weapons are drawn and that they have packed up their camp. Dahanna appears uncomfortable, as if she is ashamed of what is about to happen. </string>
<string name="340">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna smiles. &quot;You&apos;re &lt;race&gt; lies don&apos;t fool me. You were in there far too long to come out empty handed. Now, give us what&apos;s rightfully ours.&quot;</string>
<string name="341">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna cocks her head to the side, considering your words. &quot;You seem sincere. I can&apos;t say for sure whether you&apos;re lying or not,&quot; she finally admits. </string>
<string name="342">There&apos;s some angry grumbling from the other soldiers, but she cuts them off with a sharp gesture. &quot;I&apos;m not going to let this come to bloodshed only to find out we were fighting over nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="343">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;We&apos;ve held our own against the Maker&apos;s golems. I think we can manage against a &lt;race&gt; surfacer like you. We&apos;ll fight for what is rightfully ours.&quot;</string>
<string name="344">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna studies you closely, then seems to come to a decision. &quot;You&apos;re probably right, surfacer. We&apos;re not willing to throw our lives away.&quot;</string>
<string name="345">&quot;You&apos;ve gone deeper into the Maker&apos;s dungeon than we ever did, and you&apos;ve come back to tell the tale. We&apos;d be foolish to go up against you, even as desperate as we are.&quot;</string>
<string name="346">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;We&apos;ve been working this island for twenty years, and we&apos;ve lost our fair share of duergar. We&apos;ve paid our dues... you owe us something!&quot;</string>
<string name="347">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Maybe... maybe you&apos;re right, surfacer. We aren&apos;t thieves, we earn our living honestly.&quot; There is some angry grumbling from the soldiers, but Dahanna cuts them off with a single gesture.</string>
<string name="348">The leader of the duergar shakes her head. &quot;I&apos;m sorry for this. But  we count on these expeditions to survive. Each time we come back, we find less and less good metal. We are growing desperate.&quot;</string>
<string name="349">Dahanna looks at you with obvious disbelief, though she takes the offered coins. &quot;You would do this for us, after what just happened? You are more forgiving than we duergar, surfacer.&quot;</string>
<string name="350">She smiles. &quot;Thank you for this gift. Our expedition here is over now, we&apos;re heading back to our homes and our families. It will be nice to return with a few extra coins.&quot;</string>
<string name="351">&quot;Our expedition here is over now, surfacer. We&apos;re heading back to our homes and our families.&quot;</string>
<string name="352">&quot;I can&apos;t honestly say whether we will come back to this island again. In any case, we wish you luck, surfacer. Remember: the Underdark is a dangerous place.&quot;</string>
<string name="353">She nods. &quot;Maybe you&apos;re right. Perhaps the rewards here are no longer worth the risks. There are other places we can go, places far less dangerous than this island.&quot;</string>
<string name="354">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna considers your counter offer carefully, calculating the chances of her group against you. Finally she shakes her head.</string>
<string name="355">&quot;One thousand gold won&apos;t go very far, split between all of us. I think we&apos;ve earned the right to at least 10,000, considering you&apos;re poaching our claim here.&quot;</string>
<string name="356">Dahanna sighs. &quot;I was hoping it wouldn&apos;t come to this, but I can see you aren&apos;t being reasonable. Attack!&quot;</string>
<string name="357">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna considers your counter offer carefully, calculating the chances of her group against you. Finally, she nods in acceptance. </string>
<string name="358">The soldiers behind Dahanna begin to murmur excitedly, but she cuts them off with a sharp hand gesture. She takes the offered coins and says, &quot;I&apos;m glad this was done without bloodshed.&quot;</string>
<string name="359">&quot;A polite thief is still a thief. Being courteous doesn&apos;t make this right.&quot;</string>
<string name="360">&quot;Well, at least you is polite... for a thief.&quot;</string>
<string name="361">&quot;Well, at least you&apos;re being courteous while you rob us. That&apos;s more than I expected from your kind.&quot;</string>
<string name="362">Nathyrra spits on the ground. &quot;You would bargain with this hargluk?&quot; </string>
<string name="363">Dahanna ignores her. &quot;If you give us 10,000 gold pieces, we&apos;ll let you go on your way without any trouble. If not, we&apos;ll take what&apos;s rightfully ours by force.&quot;</string>
<string name="364">&quot;Nothing personal? That&apos;s funny. When a pack of armed thugs points their weapons at me, I tend to take it *very* personally.&quot;</string>
<string name="365">&quot;Look, Boss! Them duergar is coming to give us a welcome back surprise party... uh, wait. Deekin not thinks this a party after all. Too bad. Deekin wants cake.&quot;</string>
<string name="366">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="367">&quot;Tell me more about the island.&quot;</string>
<string name="368">&quot;Tell me about the golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="369">&quot;I would&apos;ve thought you&apos;d cleared all the golems out by now.&quot;</string>
<string name="370">&quot;Tell me about the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="371">&quot;What happened to him?&quot;</string>
<string name="372">&quot;Friend or foe? Uh... I guess I&apos;ll pick foe!&quot;</string>
<string name="373">&quot;It&apos;s no joke. I just want to slaughter you all. I&apos;m funny that way.&quot;</string>
<string name="374">&quot;Calm down. I&apos;m not looking for a fight, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="375">&quot;My name and business are my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="376">&quot;My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. I don&apos;t mean any harm.&quot;</string>
<string name="377">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="378">&quot;Time for this to get bloody. Die, you Underdark excuse for a dwarf!&quot;</string>
<string name="379">&quot;I&apos;m looking for allies to help me against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="380">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Persuade: Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You&apos;re either with me or against me. Think about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="381">&quot;I gave you a chance. Now you&apos;ll pay the price!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="382">&quot;Fine. I want to ask you something else then.&quot;</string>
<string name="383">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Eventually the Valsharess will turn her army against the duergar, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="384">&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</string>
<string name="385">&quot;I have some other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="386">&quot;Relax. We&apos;ll just be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="387">&quot;Settle down. We just want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="388">&quot;Nobody threatens me! Death to the duergar!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="389">&quot;Is this some kind of shake down?&quot;</string>
<string name="390">&quot;Your island? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="391">&quot;I think I see where this is going...&quot;</string>
<string name="392">&quot;Maybe we could work out a deal.&quot;</string>
<string name="393">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade:Bluff&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I didn&apos;t find anything worthwhile. You&apos;ve picked this place clean.&quot;</string>
<string name="394">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade: Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Careful now. This may be more than you can handle.&quot;</string>
<string name="395">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You have no right to my stuff. I did all the work!&quot;</string>
<string name="396">&quot;Apology *not* accepted! You&apos;ll pay for this with blood!&quot;</string>
<string name="397">&quot;Sounds like times are tough. Here&apos;s a thousand gold to help you out.&quot;</string>
<string name="398">&quot;That&apos;s okay. There&apos;s no hard feelings.&quot;</string>
<string name="399">&quot;Maybe it&apos;s time you moved on to somewhere else.&quot;</string>
<string name="400">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;ll give you a thousand gold... no more.&quot;</string>
<string name="401">No deal.</string>
<string name="402">Here&apos;s the 10,000 gold.</string>
<string name="403">Staff of Sodalis</string>
<string name="404">This vile staff was wielded by Sodalis, the fearsome High Priest of Vix&apos;thra who ruled over the free-village of Drearing&apos;s Deep in the Underdark. The swirling vortex at the staff&apos;s tip is said to be a god&apos;s-eye view of the infinite layers of the Abyss.</string>
<string name="405">Deathslayer</string>
<string name="406">Rumor has it that Deathslayer was originally crafted for use by an assassin sent to eliminate a powerful lich. His fate is still unknown, but it&apos;s doubtful he would have willingly abandoned this blade.</string>
<string name="407">Unmaking</string>
<string name="408">Originally wielded by an unknown gnomish hero who single-handedly wiped out the evil wizard Tnert&apos;s legions of golems, this blade&apos;s whereabouts have become the subject of tavern gossip.</string>
<string name="409">Female Thrall</string>
<string name="410">You&apos;ve purchased a female thrall from the illithid and sent her off to the fighting pits - a truly grim fate. At least you&apos;ll be able to wager on her battles... until she dies.</string>
<string name="411">You&apos;ve purchased a female thrall from the illithid. However, once free from their mind controlling powers she attacked you. Obviously, she would rather die than live her life in servitude.</string>
<string name="412">You&apos;ve come up with a plan to gain the freedom of the female thrall you purchased from the illithid. Because of the mind flayers&apos; telepathic abilities, you can&apos;t reveal your plan to her.

You&apos;ve sent her to deliver a fake message to the Seer. Since she believes she is magically bound to you, the illithid will consider her a thrall in your service and allow her to leave their city. Once back at the rebel camp, you can explain the truth to her.</string>
<string name="413">You&apos;ve purchased a female thrall from the illithid and sent her off to the fighting pits - she fought bravely but died as a gladiator.</string>
<string name="414">The thrall you freed from the illithid managed to find her way back to the Seer&apos;s camp. Once the threat of the Valsharess is no more, the Seer has promised to help her find her way back to the surface so she can leave the Underdark behind her forever.</string>
<string name="415">The female thrall from the illithid slave market has been killed.</string>
<string name="416">Thrall Revolt</string>
<string name="417">You&apos;ve freed a group of thralls from the pens of Zorvak&apos;Mur. Though eager for freedom, you&apos;ve convinced them to wait until you reach the Elder Brain before they begin their revolt. However, you know that if their rebellion succeeds, any chance of convincing the illithid to abandon the Valsharess is likely gone.</string>
<string name="418">You&apos;ve freed a group of thralls from the pens of Zorvak&apos;Mur. Under their leader, Argosus, they&apos;ve launched a bid for freedom. The only downside is that you&apos;ve likely destroyed any chance you had of convincing the illithid to abandon the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="419">You&apos;ve betrayed Argosus and his followers in order to garner the goodwill of the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind. No doubt the thralls will suffer terribly for their attempted escape, but it&apos;s a price you&apos;re willing to pay.
</string>
<string name="420">You&apos;ve freed a group of thralls from the pens of Zorvak&apos;Mur, and they plan to start a rebellion once you&apos;ve reached the Elder Brain. Should their revolt succeed, you likely won&apos;t have any chance of gaining the support of Zorvak&apos;Mur or the illithid in your cause.</string>
<string name="421">You&apos;ve betrayed the thrall rebellion for the sake of the greater good. By denying Argosus and his followers their freedom, you still have a chance to convince the Zorvak&apos;Mur Elder Brain to help you against the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="422">Sinkhole</string>

<string name="425">Sodalis</string>
<string name="426">Sodalis&apos; Robe</string>
<string name="427">&quot;...As wise and powerful as you are, Eye Tyrant Arutha, your lack of progress on the matters we have agreed to angers me. You promised me at least a dozen beholders to help attack the rebellious drow. What I have seen from you thus far is only two beholders! I am sending some of my slaves with this letter to escort the remaining beholders. Satisfy me and I may not bind you to spend the rest of eternity in the dark. Exceed my expectations and I will give you their weight in gold as well. Disappoint me, however, and I will destroy even the memory of your pathetic little hive. The choice is yours...&quot;</string>
<string name="428">Enter</string>
<string name="429">Gatehouse</string>
<string name="430">&quot;Pike off. Gru&apos;ul declared a holiday.&quot;</string>
<string name="431">&quot;Talk all you want, berk. Gru&apos;ul declared a holiday so I&apos;ve got the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="432">&quot;Honor? Honor!? Honor, my great-aunt Ninny&apos;s soggy bum it&apos;s honor! This here is punishment, berk! If the Big M had wanted to honor me, he wouldn&apos;t have put me in charge of this lot of boot-licking incompetents!&quot;</string>
<string name="433">&quot;He named you Quarry Boss? That must be quite the honor...&quot;</string>
<string name="434">&quot;It hurts to use them, I&apos;ll have you know. &apos;Tis a good thing I take pleasure in my own suffering. What aspect of my former self would you have me tap?&quot;</string>
<string name="435">&quot;Yes, let us play at being good no more...&quot;</string>
<string name="436">&quot;Of course, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="437">&quot;I want you to use one of your special abilities.&quot;</string>
<string name="438">&quot;No, that&apos;s it.&quot;</string>
<string name="439">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="440">&quot;Back to my previous questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="441">&quot;Time seems different in the cold... Memory... seems different... All I know is that we chose this place, somehow...  Welcome to the Eighth Hell of Baator, I suppose...&quot;</string>
<string name="442">&quot;No! I will not believe it! You are but a devil sent to tempt me! If you wish me to believe it, you must bring me proof. All else is falsehood!&quot;</string>
<string name="443">&quot;Did I say yes? I meant no.&quot;</string>
<string name="444">&quot;I saw her corpse in the other room.&quot;</string>
<string name="445">&quot;In the passing of seven spokes a hole was dug and a fearsome devil freed. Had the digging been done but sixteen spokes the sooner, it would have uncovered what you need.&quot;</string>
<string name="446">&quot;I am an ancient baatorian, Planetar. With every answer, I become more like the question.&quot;</string>
<string name="447">Deekin looks at you with big, soulful eyes. &quot;You... you would miss me, boss? Then... then Deekin not goings to betray you!&quot; He suddenly turns on Mephistopheles. &quot;You may be bigger than the boss, BUT DEEKIN NOT LIKES YOU!!&quot;</string>
<string name="448">&quot;My love will go where it wishes, devil. All the promises you could make are nothing next to all this woman here can offer me. Consider your offer refused.&quot;</string>
<string name="449">Valen glares at the archdevil. &quot;It would not be worth betraying my love for &lt;FirstName&gt;, that is sure. If there is a taint to be removed today, it is yours, devil!&quot;</string>
<string name="450">&quot;But I embrace that killer in you, Nathyrra... Set aside your guilt! Be true to yourself! You are a Red Sister. Join with me, Nathyrra. As a Red Sister, who would you rather serve? &lt;FullName&gt; or myself...?&quot;</string>
<string name="451">Nathyrra ponders his words for a long moment, then smiles sadly at him. &quot;I would rather serve the one I love. I may still be a killer but let it be you I kill today, Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="452">The battle still rages on the far bank. If you have plans for this catapult, they will have to wait.</string>
<string name="453">Frost clings to this spirit&apos;s form. Her eyes bear a commanding gaze.</string>
<string name="454">The tall, grey-skinned woman appears calm before you, her countenance somber. Muscles ripple beneath her leathery skin.</string>
<string name="455">There is a dark malevolence to your newfound ally and a tension in the air when you&apos;re around her. </string>
<string name="456">There is a righteous vigor to Aribeth&apos;s ghostly form and her former reticence seems barely a memory.</string>
<string name="457">Though her impressive wings flutter, the Knower of Places makes no breeze. You wonder if she was born in this form or has somehow chosen it along the way.</string>
<string name="458">Worn by devout githzerai, these woven strappings are adorned with passages from various religious texts that they hold dear.</string>
<string name="459">Small Silver Key</string>
<string name="460">This hastily scrawled note bears Mephistopheles&apos; now-familiar script:

&quot;I am about to make my move and lay claim to Toril. Perhaps the Tanar&apos;ri have caught wind of this for I have just received word that they are launching an assault near where I have stationed you. Stray catapult fire from the battle has already melted through the ice and freed one of my treacherous generals. Make your way to the prison and fend the Tanar&apos;ri off at all costs. The last thing I need is some fool demon getting his paws on my Knower of Names. Serve me well and I may give you lordship over Waterdeep once it is mine...&quot;

It appears that this particular front of the Blood War was opened just before he left for your homeworld, Toril.</string>
<string name="461">Waterdeep</string>
<string name="462">Zorvak&apos;Mur</string>
<string name="463">Cania</string>
<string name="464">Meph Chain</string>
<string name="465">Drearing&apos;s Deep</string>
<string name="466">Followers of Eilistraee</string>
<string name="467">In speaking with the Spirits of the Dead who cluster around the Gates of Cania, you have learned that they had a leader who had stood up to Mephistopheles when he first announced that he would be devouring their souls to fuel his undead army in your homeworld of Toril. He must have done something dire to her, however, for after the confrontation, she fled to a cave in the center of the city where she now refuses to speak with anyone. The Spirits say she&apos;s becoming one of the Lost, those who have given up hope and are slowly merging with the icy essence of Cania.</string>
<string name="468">You have rescued Aribeth de Tylmarande, the ghostly leader of the Spirits of the Dead, from the icy grip of Cania. Thanks to your efforts and persistence, she has dedicated what remains of this threadbare afterlife to the cause of evil. With that, you have restored her to her former status as a fearsome Blackguard and she has offered to aid you in your quest through the Hells.</string>
<string name="469">Trapped here much like you, a group of githzerai Pilgrims have related an interesting tale regarding a certain fellow named Arden Swift who has been traveling with them for the past while. According to the prevailing gossip, Arden got into an argument with the Pilgrims&apos; leader regarding his sacriligious plans to wake the so-called Sleeping Man who the Pilgrims are here to visit. Arden&apos;s currently drowning his sorrows in the Hellbreath Tavern in the city&apos;s southeast corner.</string>
<string name="470">You have met a jester, Arden Swift, in the Hellbreath Tavern in the city&apos;s southeast corner. He seems somehow associated with the githzerai Pilgrims currently patronizing the establishment but, given his tiefling heritage and the dirty looks they occasionally slip him over their half-empty tankards, you&apos;re unsure how.</string>
<string name="471">In talking with Arden Swift, a bard traveling with the githzerai, he has told you of his rather sacriligious plans to wake their so-called Sleeping Man using a Trumpet of Pandemonium he acquired somewhere in his travels. Due to a quick intervention on the part of the Pilgrims&apos; sensei, the jester&apos;s plan never came to pass but he still carries the trumpet and it might be possible to convince him to part with it.</string>
<string name="472">Arden Swift, patron of the Hellbreath Tavern and itinerant jester currently taveling with the entourage of githzerai Pilgrims, has placed his beloved Trumpet of Pandemonium as a prize for an upcoming card game. He had intended to use the trumpet to wake the so-called Sleeping Man but had been caught red-handed by the Pilgrims&apos; sensei before he could sound its blast. If you&apos;re interested in acquiring it for yourself, you merely have to place your ante on the table and guess the card he&apos;s holding in five questions or less. You&apos;re not entirely sure if you can trust him but it might be worth a try.</string>
<string name="473">The familiar blackness of death enveloped you but the blood-red eyes of your betrayer, Mephistopheles, lingered to the end. And then you woke to find your eyes reflected in the Reaper&apos;s shimmering skin. Everything seems strangely familiar...</string>
<string name="474">The archdevil Mephistopheles has played you for a fool. He has commanded your mysterious ally, the Reaper, to bar your return to Waterdeep in your homeworld of Toril, trapping you instead in some hellish world called Cania. The Reaper seems sympathetic to your plight but claims he has no choice but to obey for Mephistopheles has commanded him by his True Name. Such names seem to have a strange power in this place and it seems the only way to break Mephistopheles&apos; prohibition will be learn the Reaper&apos;s True Name for yourself.</string>
<string name="475">Your search for the Reaper&apos;s True Name has turned up its first clue: one of the citizens of this strange city claims that an old and venerable creature known as the Sleeping Man might have the information your looking for. He sleeps in the city&apos;s northwest quarter and apparently has done so for longer than anyone can remember. Hopefully, with his help, you&apos;ll be able to return home to Waterdeep and take your vengeance on the archdevil Mephistopheles.</string>
<string name="476">The Sleeping Man was not as helpful in your quest for the Reaper&apos;s True Name as you had hoped. You did learn, however, of an ancient race called the Knowers that populated Cania before it was colonized by the legions of hell. One of them, the Knower of Names, was banished by Mephistopheles to an unknown prison deep in Cania&apos;s frozen wastelands. Unable to find the Knower of Names, the Sleeping Man instead sought out her sister, the Knower of Places, with the help of a magical ring that that served as his guide through Cania&apos;s wastes. If you can repeat his feat, perhaps she will be able to help you find her sister&apos;s hidden prison. The Sleeping Man broke the ring into three parts and hid it in a guarded vault below his chambers. It seems your journey will begin there.</string>
<string name="477">The Sleeping Man&apos;s ring that will lead you to the Knower of Places and hopefully to the Reaper&apos;s True Name is a strange artifact indeed. When you slip it onto your finger, it is as if you can see into another sort of space, another dimension. Some things are present there that are not present in the real world and some things you would expect to find have disappeared. According to the Sleeping Man, the ring will be most helpful in the out of doors where a line of glowing arrows will apparently chart a safe course for you through Cania&apos;s vast wastelands. You feel the stirrings of hope in your chest for the first time since Mephistopheles banished you to this frozen place.</string>
<string name="478">Tormented by her loneliness, the Knower of Places has agreed to help you on your quest for the Reaper&apos;s True Name. She has woven a new magic into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ring, allowing it to guide you to her sister, the Knower of Names, just as it guided you to her. She left you with a cryptic parting message that will hopefully aid you when you reach her sister&apos;s icy prison: &quot;Time is a twelve-spoked wheel and with every hour of our lives another spoke has come and gone. In the passing of seven spokes a hole was dug and a fearsome devil freed. Had the digging been done but sixteen spokes the sooner, it would have uncovered what you need.&quot; Hopefully you&apos;ll be able to compel the Reaper to return you to Waterdeep before Mephistopheles has destroyed your home forever.</string>
<string name="479">At long last you have learned the True Name of the Reaper: Hecugoth the Abandoned. You say it aloud a few times, rolling it around on your tongue. It has a sad sound to it but you are eager to put it to use. It&apos;s your ticket out of here, back to Waterdeep and your homeworld of Toril... or whatever still remains of them after the chaos that Mephistopheles has sown in your absence. The Knower of Names will take you back to the Gates of Cania but you pause to consider whether you have any pressing tasks you wish to accomplish on this plane before you go. Facing Mephistopheles won&apos;t be easy and you&apos;d better have made your peace with the world.</string>
<string name="480">Commanded by his True Name, the Reaper has opened a Planar Gate that will lead you back home to Waterdeep. Mephistopheles won&apos;t be expecting you so you&apos;ll have to take advantage of whatever element of surprise you have. It will pay to be well-prepared before you step through that gate.</string>
<string name="481">Peering into an ice crystal that thrust itself up from Cania&apos;s glacial floor, you saw a vision of Mephistopheles&apos; progress in your homeworld of Toril. It appears that he has discovered the carnage you left behind at the Rebel Camp. As he passed through the rotting carcasses, they rose in his wake, a ghostly army bound to do his bidding...</string>
<string name="482">A group of disconsolate Pilgrims are trapped in Cania much like you. Their leader, the sensei, led them here to worship at the feet of a figure they refer to as the Sleeping Man. She can be found in the Temple in the city&apos;s northwest corner.</string>
<string name="483">Dharvana, the githzerai sensei, insists that you must learn and recite the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man before she will let you into the temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum to see him. She listed the Five-Fold Mysteries as follows: Who is he? From where did he come? Why did he leave? Who did he seek? What was the answer?</string>
<string name="484">Before you may enter the Temple of the Sleeping Man&apos;s Inner Sanctum, you must learn the Five-Fold Mysteries and recite them to Dharvana, the githzerai sensei. The Five-Fold Mysteries are as follows: Who is he? From where did he come? Why did he leave? Who did he seek? What was the answer?

You have learned the answer to one of those five Mysteries.</string>

<string name="489">There, in the temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum, with the winged form of the Sleeping Man prostrate before you, you tried in vain to make use of the sensei&apos;s amulet. The crystal glowed a murky green when in his presence and you could feel its growing hum but you somehow lacked the wisdom to tap into its psionic powers. </string>
<string name="490">There, in the temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum, with the winged form of the Sleeping Man prostrate before you, you made use of the sensei&apos;s amulet. The crystal glowed a murky green when in his presence and you could feel its growing hum and then, all at once, you found yourself swept up within his dreams. </string>
<string name="491">There, in the temple&apos;s dim green light, the sensei&apos;s amulet clasped about your neck, you dreamed the dreams of the Sleeping Man. Mephistopheles was there and a woman called the Knower of Names, whom he banished. And an older woman, the Knower of Places, whom the Sleeping Man had visited in search of his one true love. Throughout his quest, he was somehow guided by a ring that now lies, buried and guarded, in a chamber below him. If you hope to find the Knowers, you will need that ring upon your finger...</string>
<string name="492">There, in the temple&apos;s dim green light, you have done the unthinkable and woken the Sleeping Man. Hopefully he will be able to tell you the Reaper&apos;s True Name.</string>
<string name="493">In waking the Sleeping Man, you unleashed the sensei&apos;s fury. Driven mad with rage, she attacked and you had no choice but to defend yourself. Now she lies dead at the feet of the Sleeping Man who she worshiped. You decide you should keep her amulet as something to remember her by.</string>
<string name="494">The Sleeping Man knows many things but, sadly, the Reaper&apos;s True Name is not one of them. Even so, he tells of a race of creatures called the Knowers who once called Cania home. One of them, the Knower of Names was banished by Mephistopheles long ago while the other, the Knower of Places, lives in hiding deep in Cania&apos;s frozen wastelands. His own quest had brought him the latter&apos;s hidden lair, long ago, a feat made possible only with the aid of an enchanted ring. The ring lies in a chamber under the temple, guarded and kept safe all these many years. He has invited you to make use of the ring, provided you can claim it, and wishes you well on your journey.</string>
<string name="495">Mephistopheles left five Guardians to block the Sleeping Man&apos;s path. The two weakest were defeated in ages past and a third and fourth killed recently by your hands. You have now killed the fifth and final guardian, a wizardly Pit Fiend who stood guard over the prison itself, perhaps there to protect it from the Blood War that raged so close at hand. With all five Guardians dead, the Knower of Names is yours and her secrets too. Now if only you can find some way to free her from the ice.</string>
<string name="496">You can feel yourself getting closer to the hidden lair of the Knower of Places. In a secret chamber deep in the icy wastes of Cania, you have found the statue of a gargoyle. Etched along its base in blue lettering are the words &quot;Stone to stone, the stone turns. Lightning to lightning, the lightning fades.&quot;</string>
<string name="497">A series of chambers run deep beneath the ice of Cania, leading to what you hope will be the hidden lair of the Knower of Places. Various obstacles have stood in your way but now a portal has appeared, leading into a third chamber that lies beyond. </string>
<string name="498">As you peer at the sensei&apos;s amulet, you notice that the light seems to play strangely off its crystalline structure. Not quite sure what to make of this strange behavior, you return it to your pack for later investigation.</string>
<string name="499">In a fortunate twist of fate, the sensei&apos;s amulet has revealed its true nature. By carefully controlling the angle at which the light strikes its crystalline structure, you find that the resulting refraction has the unexpected ability to modify your body&apos;s form. You file the knowledge away for future reference. From here on in, you decide to be more a little more mindful of your magic items, that they don&apos;t trigger again so unexpectedly.</string>
<string name="500">True Names: Reaper</string>
<string name="501">Having paid the Knower&apos;s price, you have learned the True Name of the Reaper of Cania and can finally command him to send you home to the Prime Material. He is known in the gods&apos; tongue as Hecugoth the Abandoned.</string>
<string name="502">Having paid the Knower&apos;s price, you have learned the True Name of the Reaper of Cania. He is known in the gods&apos; tongue as Hecugoth the Abandoned. You recently used this knowledge to command him to let the Githzerai Pilgrims return to their home plane of Limbo.</string>
<string name="503">Having paid the Knower&apos;s price, you have learned the True Name of the Reaper of Cania. He is known in the gods&apos; tongue as Hecugoth the Abandoned.

<string name="504">Having paid the Knower&apos;s price, you have learned the True Name of the Reaper of Cania. He is known in the gods&apos; tongue as Hecugoth the Abandoned. You recently used this knowledge to command him to loose the Devils of Cania upon the unsuspecting planes.</string>
<string name="505">Having paid the Knower&apos;s price, you have learned the True Name of the Reaper of Cania. He is known in the gods&apos; tongue as Hecugoth the Abandoned.

<string name="506">Having paid the Knower&apos;s price, you have learned the True Name of your henchman Valen. He is known in the gods&apos; tongue as Oeskathine the Demonwrestler.

Empowered by this knowledge, you recently freed him from his demonic taint.</string>
<string name="507">This hastily scrawled note bears Mephistopheles&apos; now-familiar script:

&quot;I am about to make my move and lay claim to Toril. Perhaps the Tanar&apos;ri have caught wind of this for I have just received word that they are launching an assault near where I have stationed you. Stray catapult fire from the battle has already melted through the ice and freed one of my treacherous generals. Make your way to the prison and fend the Tanar&apos;ri off at all costs. The last thing I need is some fool demon getting his paws on my Knower of Names. Serve me well and I may give you lordship over Waterdeep once it is mine...&quot;

It appears that this particular front of the Blood War was opened just before he left for your homeworld, Toril. </string>

<string name="878">This simple raft is constructed of scrap logs and improvised ropes. It seems sturdy enough.</string>
<string name="879">This simple raft was constructed of scrap logs and improvised ropes. It seemed sturdy enough until its encounter with this rock.</string>

<string name="1713">(PRESTIGE CLASS)
The famous Purple Dragons of Cormyr are regarded across Faerun as exemplars of disciplined, skilled, loyal soldiers. Their reputation is deserved partly because of the heroic actions of their leaders, the Purple Dragon Knights. Purple Dragon Knights develop uncanny skills relating to coordinating and leading soldiers. Most are fighters, rangers or paladins, but a few bards, clerics, and rogues have been known to become Purple Dragon Knights. Sorcerers and Wizards tend to join the War Wizards, Cormyr&apos;s elite brigade of fighting spellcasters, while barbarians are too undisciplined, and druids and monks too &quot;uncivilized&quot; in Cormyr to enter this career.
