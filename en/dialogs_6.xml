<resources><string name="0">I&apos;m sure that even at the height of the fighting, half of Luskan wasn&apos;t even aware of it. That&apos;s just the way it is.</string>
<string name="1">Aye, I suppose you outsiders wouldn&apos;t know much about it, would you? The wizards were killing each other in the tower up until recently.</string>
<string name="2">I don&apos;t know what started it, and I&apos;m certainly glad I wasn&apos;t involved. The important thing is that it&apos;s over, now, though the tower&apos;s a mess.</string>
<string name="3">Well... I don&apos;t mean to imply that security will be insufficient for you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. So many of the wizards died in all the fighting, though.</string>
<string name="4">It&apos;s my understanding, too, that in the fighting there was a lot of... accidents. Things that still have to cleared up, you see. That&apos;s another reason why it&apos;s dangerous for you to roam.</string>
<string name="5">Well, the Archmage used to be Arklem Greeth. He&apos;s gone, now, and while I know someone&apos;s taken his place, I don&apos;t know who that is.</string>
<string name="6">Most likely he died in the fighting, but I don&apos;t really know.</string>
<string name="7"></string>
<string name="8"></string>
<string name="9">No one enters without my leave!</string>
<string name="10">A moment of your time before you enter the tower, please.</string>
<string name="11">Why you has big golem guy?</string>
<string name="12">Why do you have a golem here?</string>
<string name="13">You knows &apos;bout cult here, maybe?</string>
<string name="14">Do you know anything about a cult here?</string>

<string name="17">You trusts traitor to lead army, huh?</string>
<string name="18">You trust a traitor to lead the army?</string>
<string name="19">How you knows that true?</string>

<string name="24">Who is this Obould you keep mentioning?</string>
<string name="25">Me ambassador, comes from Mulhorand.</string>
<string name="26">I am the ambassador from Mulhorand.</string>
<string name="27">Heh. Me likes you. You gots orc-blood, me sees that. It make you strong, huh? Me full orc, important orc, but yous okay.</string>
<string name="28">It come with room. Wizards say it to protect me. Me needs no protection, though! Me great warrior!</string>
<string name="29">Uh? Me not know nothing &apos;bout no cult. Not cares, neither. If wizards say they wants to make war, we okays with that.</string>
<string name="30">Traitor, elf, whatever. Maugrim say he has her under control real good, so me not have much worry. If it go bad, orcs kill wizards and go home.</string>
<string name="31">Maugrim tells me himself. Me gots no reason to think he lie. Why tells orc that elf going to leads him? If lie be big, dumb lie.</string>
<string name="32">Hah! Me likes you, but me not tells you that. You get own deal with wizards.</string>
<string name="33">You knows nothing. King Obould Many-Arrows be greatest chieftain of orcs. He have largest clan, he call other clans to come for war! Great army! Wizards be happy if wizards be smart.</string>
<string name="34">Huh. Me not hears of that place. Dumb wizards bring peoples from all over, when all they needs is Obould Many-Arrows. Me tells them this.</string>
<string name="35">You hears &apos;bout cult here, maybe?</string>
<string name="36">Have you heard anything of a cult here?</string>
<string name="37">What fight you speaks &apos;bout?</string>
<string name="38">What fighting is that?</string>
<string name="39">Why you gots big golem here?</string>
<string name="40">Why is there a golem in your room?</string>
<string name="41">You knows &apos;bout somebody named Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42">Have you heard of one named Maugrim?</string>
<string name="43">You trust traitor woman to leads army?</string>
<string name="44">You trust a traitor to lead an army?</string>
<string name="45">How you knows &apos;bout Aribeth? It true?</string>
<string name="46">How do you know that about Aribeth? Is it true?</string>
<string name="47">What promise he makes you?</string>
<string name="48">What promise has he made you?</string>
<string name="49">Me ambassador of Mulhorand.</string>
<string name="50">I am the ambassador from Mulhorand.</string>
<string name="51">A cult? If these wizards worship anything beyond their own power, I have never heard of it. Perhaps the cult caused the fighting, here, I do not know.</string>
<string name="52">There is one in every room, placed here by the wizards to guard us. The last mage I saw referred to it as a &apos;shield guardian&apos;.</string>
<string name="53">Do not trouble yourself, &lt;man/woman&gt;. They do little unless they are provoked.</string>
<string name="54">Of course I have. Have you not? It was he who invited me to this tower. The man is the new Archmage Arcane, after all.</string>
<string name="55">If the elven wench steps out of line, she&apos;ll not get far. I am assured by Maugrim, however, that this Aribeth is quite firmly under his control.</string>
<string name="56">I have met the elven woman once, myself. She is a fallen paladin... dark and terrible. She will be the wind that blows our blaze across the north!</string>
<string name="57">Hah! I&apos;ll suffer none of your lowlander spying. If Maugrim gets what he wants, the Elk tribe gets what we want... that is all you need to know.</string>
<string name="58">If your people chose a simpleton to represent them, then they are fools.</string>
<string name="59">I have never heard of this place you speak of. It cannot be important. If the wizards see you before me, I shall be furious indeed. I have waited almost long enough!</string>
<string name="60">By the gods! What have I summoned!</string>
<string name="61">When Maugrim comes here?</string>
<string name="62">When did Maugrim arrive?</string>
<string name="63">But I... have nothing left, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. You have taken it all.</string>
<string name="64">Arklem listened eagerly to his promises of power. Maugrim hinted that the mistress he served could bring great success to the Arcane Brotherhood.</string>
<string name="65">Who be this Valinda?</string>
<string name="66">Who is Valinda Shadowmantle?</string>
<string name="67">A young sorceress who was once one of Arklem&apos;s greatest supporters. She has much knowledge of the towers, which has no doubt been of benefit to Maugrim.</string>
<string name="68">For the Blood War! Raaaahhhh!!</string>
<string name="69">You no stand in way! Oldest of enemies be here... we must find!</string>
<string name="70">The devils and demons must fight! Must fight!!</string>
<string name="71">Always be the baatezu eternal enemies of the tanar&apos;ri!</string>
<string name="72">You get away! Blood enemies be here!</string>
<string name="73">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the brazier alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="74">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put an imp&apos;s eye in the flames.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="75">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put a quasit&apos;s eye in the flames.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="76">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put a piece of rubble in the flames.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="77">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lore]&lt;/Start&gt;&lt;StartAction&gt; Examine the brazier more closely.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="78">The flames of the brazier appear to be cold, and give off an aura that is unsettling as you draw near. The magic emanating from this device is almost palpable.</string>
<string name="79">You step back from the brazier, the chill lessening the further away you move.</string>
<string name="80">The imp&apos;s eye appears to be unaffected by the flames. It does not disappear, nor does it appear to be singed in any fashion.</string>
<string name="81">There is a bright flash as the imp&apos;s eye is swallowed by the flames. A moment later the brazier begins to quake violently...</string>
<string name="82">The quasit&apos;s eye appears to be unaffected by the flames. It does not disappear, nor does it appear to be singed in any fashion.</string>
<string name="83">There is a bright flash as the quasit&apos;s eye is swallowed by the flames. A moment later the brazier begins to quake violently...</string>
<string name="84">You pick up a small piece of stone and put it into the flames. With a small burst of light and the stench of brimstone, the stone disappears.</string>
<string name="85">You can see the faint after-image of the stone beyond the flames, but only for a moment. You likely don&apos;t want to place anything in there you intend to keep.</string>
<string name="86">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Through the flames, some other strange place can just barely be seen. You can tell nothing else from your examination.</string>
<string name="87">Wherever the flames lead, it is too small to walk into. Something small could be put into it, however.</string>
<string name="88">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; There is an image of another place just beyond the flames, making you believe that the brazier may be some manner of portal to another plane.</string>
<string name="89">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You believe that the flames form a small, permanent portal to the outer planes... either the Abyss or Baator, most likely. It is, no doubt, the conduit that the imps and quasits have been summoned through.</string>
<string name="90">The portal appears to be two-way, although anything entering from this side would have to be very small. There is no way to bodily move through it.</string>
<string name="91">The brazier is cold, the flames gutted.</string>
<string name="92">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the chamber alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="93">&lt;StartAction&gt;Destroy the chamber.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put the Golem Replication Rod into a depression.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="95">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put the Golem Control Rod into a depression.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="96">&lt;StartAction&gt;Examine the depressions.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97">This chamber has been formed of marble and complex crystals within its core, containing two depressions along its edge. It practically crackles with dormant magical energy.</string>
<string name="98">You turn away from the strange structure.</string>
<string name="99">You attempt to strike the chamber, but your blow slides harmlessly off an invisible barrier next to its surface.</string>
<string name="100">The second rod slides into place beside the first, stopping with a faint click. Both rods begin to shine brilliantly, the chamber leaping to life...</string>
<string name="101">The rod slides easily into place, stopping with a faint click. It begins to glow slightly and the chamber hums... though it does nothing as of yet.</string>
<string name="102">The second rod slides into place beside the first, stopping with a faint click. Both rods begin to shine brilliantly, the chamber leaping to life...</string>
<string name="103">The rod slides easily into place, stopping with a faint click. It begins to glow slightly and the chamber hums... though it does nothing as of yet.</string>
<string name="104">One of the depressions has been filled with a small rod. The chamber hums with activity, appearing to await something else.</string>
<string name="105">The two depressions are long and slender, very likely receptacles awaiting something to be placed within them.</string>
<string name="106">This chamber is smoking every so slightly. Both rods in its depressions are blackened, burnt-out husks. Whatever magic fueled this chamber appears to have spent itself.</string>
<string name="107">Your corpse shall join the ranks of my minions, adventurer!</string>
<string name="108">Your head shall adorn my dinner table fool.</string>
<string name="109">Hey Fred I struck a deal with the roaches and they agree we can easily tunnel out of here in under 20 years.</string>
<string name="110">You are looking rather well today Fred, I&apos;m glad to see you up and about.</string>
<string name="111">Shhh, don&apos;t talk too loud Fred this side of the cell is working for the Warden.</string>
<string name="112">Just about everything a man needs in this world he can find right here. Food, shelter and regular beatings, that&apos;s the life for me Fred!</string>
<string name="113">My oh my Fred how the time does pass when you spend it with good friends.</string>
<string name="114">Ahhh ha ha. Oh Fred you kill me, that&apos;s the best joke I ever heard.</string>
<string name="115">All of them are out to get me, they think I don&apos;t know, but I do.</string>
<string name="116">They&apos;re the ones that got me thrown in here, all them conspired to have me put away.</string>
<string name="117">Soon my revenge will come... very soon.</string>
<string name="118">Never underestimate the power of hate, it keeps a man warm inside.</string>
<string name="119">Everyone around me is a traitor and liar, they steal my thoughts to make me suffer! But I have secret thoughts they will never find!</string>
<string name="120">I see they have finally come to murder me, shut me up, make their problems go away. Well I wont let them, no I will make them swim in their own blood.</string>
<string name="121">Do not enter the portal at this time.</string>
<string name="122">Enter the portal</string>
<string name="123">The portal seems to be inactive, at its center a small hole marks the spot where a portal stone would go.</string>
<string name="124">Through the portal you see the Spine of the World and a small settlement. Do you proceed?</string>
<string name="125">I will feed on your pain and fear.</string>
<string name="126">Death awaits all who oppose us.</string>
<string name="127">Master must be protected.</string>
<string name="128">Make no selection at this time.</string>
<string name="129">A portal is already open, please be patient.</string>
<string name="130">Your soul will suffer at the hands of the master, fleshling.</string>
<string name="131">The Shield Guardian stares straight ahead and does not seem to hear you.</string>
<string name="132">Karcha will see the flesh torn from your bones puny creature.</string>
<string name="133">Baram will pleased with your head on a pike.</string>
<string name="134">Heeheehee! Me kill you manthing! Heehee!</string>
<string name="135">I shall crush you, puny manling!</string>
<string name="136">You die die die! Heehee!</string>
<string name="137">Me need healing.</string>
<string name="138">I need healing.</string>
<string name="139">Who you be?</string>
<string name="140">Who are you?</string>
<string name="141">Me not understand &apos;bout Stone of Recall and teleport portal.</string>
<string name="142">Teleportation portal? Stone of Recall? I don&apos;t understand.</string>
<string name="143">Me need you go over that one more time.</string>
<string name="144">Can you explain that again?</string>
<string name="145">Goodbye. </string>
<string name="146">Me need to return to mission. Me need to go back to place where me died. </string>
<string name="147">How me get here?</string>
<string name="148">I need to return to my mission. I must get back to where I just was. </string>
<string name="149">Send me back.</string>
<string name="150">What should me do then?</string>
<string name="151">What do you suggest I do then?</string>
<string name="152">Me think you&apos;re right. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="153">I think you&apos;re right. I&apos;ll see you later. </string>
<string name="154">Teleport portal? Recall Stone? What you be talking about?</string>
<string name="155">Teleportation portal? Stone of Recall? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="156">Me want go back now!</string>
<string name="157">Just get me back there.</string>
<string name="158">Me change my mind. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="159">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I&apos;ll see you later. </string>
<string name="160">Yes. Me want to go back now.</string>
<string name="161">Yes. Transport me there now. </string>
<string name="162">How did I get here? </string>
<string name="163">Me no trust you Recall spell! You take spell off me now!</string>
<string name="164">You say me be fully healed?</string>
<string name="165">I don&apos;t want your stupid Word of Recall spell teleporting me anywhere. Cancel the spell, right now!</string>
<string name="166">How me get back where me be before?</string>
<string name="167">So how am I supposed to get back to where I was?</string>
<string name="168">You mean I&apos;m fully healed?</string>
<string name="169">Me no remember you cast spell on me.</string>
<string name="170">How come I don&apos;t remember you casting a Recall spell on me?</string>
<string name="171">Who you be?</string>
<string name="172">Who are you?</string>
<string name="173">Greetings, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Such a hero as yourself is welcome within these halls. Aarin Gend has asked me to aid you in your cause.</string>
<string name="174">I have erected a teleportation portal here similar to the one in Port Llast, and have attuned myself to the Stone of Recall you carry.</string>
<string name="175">I would gladly help you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... but most of my power has been used to erect the portal and maintain the spell on the Stone of Recall. I am sure the other clerics here can aid you.</string>
<string name="176">I am Alaya, a cleric here at Luskan&apos;s temple of Tyr.</string>
<string name="177">Has this never been explained to you? The Stone of Recall you carry will teleport you and anyone in your service back here to this temple when it is activated.</string>
<string name="178">What is more, when you activate the Stone of Recall here, it will take you and the people with you back to the last place you used it.</string>
<string name="179">It should save you and any companions you may have considerable time in the future should you ever wish to return here quickly.</string>
<string name="180">Do you know where you are? This is the temple of Tyr in Luskan. I have returned your soul from the brink of death, though it was not an easy task.</string>
<string name="181">Farewell, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Tyr&apos;s blessing upon you.</string>
<string name="182">I can certainly do that, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... but whatever danger caused you to arrive here still remains where it was. It would be unfortunate to have you return too soon.</string>
<string name="183">Before you say you wish to return, perhaps you might consider getting more equipment? Or perhaps you might take another path that is safer?</string>
<string name="184">Alternatively, you might also wish to take the portal back to wherever you last activated the stone of recall, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="185">It is... odd that you would forget, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Has this never been explained to you? The Stone of Recall you carry will teleport you and anyone in your service back here to this temple when it is activated.</string>
<string name="186">What is more, when you activate the Stone of Recall here, it will take you and the people with you back to the last place you used it.</string>
<string name="187">Of course, if you did not know about the stone, perhaps you have never used it. It should save you considerable time in the future should you ever wish to return here quickly.</string>
<string name="188">As you wish. The Dimensional Fold spell will return you to the place where you were called from last. Are you ready? </string>
<string name="189">As you wish. Prepare yourself, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;...</string>
<string name="190">Perhaps you have lost your memory, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? I do not blame you. The transition can be disturbing, I understand.</string>
<string name="191">Aarin Gend has asked me to use my skills to keep you from meeting an untimely demise. I cast a Word of Recall upon you when you arrived in the city, which returned you here when you fell.</string>
<string name="192">I would not think of telling you your business, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, but I do urge you to be more cautious. Resurrection carries a price that I am certain you do not wish to pay more than you must.</string>
<string name="193">That... that would be foolish, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Were you to perish again, there would be no way for me to aid you, and neither of us would be able to assist your cause.</string>
<string name="194">Yes, of course. I healed you while you were still unconscious... and cast another Word of Recall upon you, should you encounter trouble once again.</string>
<string name="195">You do not need to be present for its casting, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Aarin Gend told me your name, which is enough. </string>
<string name="196">I am Alaya, a cleric here at the temple that your friend, Aarin Gend, has recruited to aid your cause. I am glad to be of service.</string>
<string name="197">You are awake, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? Please, I must speak with you.</string>
<string name="198">We are very disappointed in you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your slaughter of innocent people has caused much suffering in a time already overburdened with tragedy.</string>
<string name="199">Were it up to me you would have been left to rot in your grave; however, Aarin Gend has ordered me to resurrect you. Despite your actions, Neverwinter still has need of you.</string>
<string name="200">You will suffer no further consequences for your mad killing spree, but I implore you not to engage in such wholesale slaughter again. Please, focus on the mission you have been given.</string>
<string name="201">This innkeeper keeps a wary eye on the traffic flowing in an dout of his establishment.</string>
<string name="202">This elf seems upset about something, which in this city, really comes as no surprise.</string>
<string name="203">This noblewoman has obviously seen better times. Clothes worn thin, she appears completely despondant.</string>
<string name="204">This gnome has a wary, yet cheerful disposition that seems quite out-of-place in this city.</string>
<string name="205">With the symbol of Bane marked clearly on her armor, this priestess has a cold sneer of disdain etched permanently on her face.</string>
<string name="206">This hound looks lean and mean, trained to maul and kill any who would harm a worker here.</string>
<string name="207">Paranoia and terror seem to dominate the features of this older man.</string>
<string name="208">This noble woman carries herself with an air of superiority, yet a troubled expression clouds her features momentarily.</string>
<string name="209">Marked with the sign of the Black Knives, this patron looks as though he has partaken of the pleasures of this house numerous times in the past.</string>
<string name="210">This beautiful, young courtesan has a bored expression on her face, until she notices someone is looking, then she becomes cheerful and attentive.</string>

<string name="217">Voleron</string>
<string name="218">This dark-cowled figure moves with a silent, deadly grace, like the shadow of an owl over a moonlit forest.</string>
<string name="219">This beautiful elf has obviously been mistreated as Kurth&apos;s prisoner, as testified by the large bruises on her wrists and neck, and the tender way she moves.</string>
<string name="220">This weasel-faced man seems to command a great deal of power, though it is not clear how.</string>
<string name="221">This female has waxy, deathly-pale skin and a chilling gaze.</string>
<string name="222">This man appears to be very nervous and edgy; working in Luskan often does that to people.</string>
<string name="223">Acolyte of Tyr</string>
<string name="224">The Black Knives are quick, sneaky and dirty fighters, who use every tactic they can think of to kill others without direct confrontation. When they must fight, they show no mercy.</string>
<string name="225">This poor child doesn&apos;t look to have eaten very well, or had new clothes in a long time.</string>
<string name="226">Having lost his home in these desperate times, this man snores soundly, seeking blissful refuge from reality.</string>
<string name="227">This outlandishly dressed male, gnome prostitute smells faintly of turnips. Not the earthy, farm-like turnip smell, but like he is wearing some kind of turnip-based perfume.</string>
<string name="228">Paranoia and terror seem to dominate the features of this cringing man.</string>
<string name="229">Having given up on life in Luskan, this woman seeks the safety of oblivion in the bottom of a tankard of some foul-smelling brew.</string>
<string name="230">Tears of terror stream down the face of this small child.</string>
<string name="231">A wary paranoia of others and grim determination seem to grip this guard&apos;s demeanor.</string>
<string name="232">Cutlass Guard</string>
<string name="233">This merchant keeps a close watch on his goods; a paranoia bred of true survival instincts here in Luskan.</string>
<string name="234">The Bloody Hand warriors have seen a lot of action in their days, and they have the scars and skills to show for it.</string>
<string name="235">Bloody Hand Archer</string>
<string name="236">Paranoia and terror seem to dominate the features of this cringing woman.</string>
<string name="237">Having given up on life in Luskan, this man seeks the safety of oblivion in the bottom of a tankard of some foul-smelling brew.</string>

<string name="239">This smith has the deep scowl of one who is little impressed by the happenings going on around him.</string>
<string name="240">This gruff and muscular guard frowns as he looks around and the tower and the city.</string>
<string name="241">These guard have the nervous wariness that marks a man who&apos;s used to being attacked.</string>
<string name="242">This barbarian woman looks tired, bored and frustrated; a deadly combination in any barbarian.</string>
<string name="243">This elf has a nasty looking weapon which she obviously wields with great skill.</string>
<string name="244">Based on the blood matting his hair, this powerful minotaur looks like he enjoys his control over the prisoners in this area.</string>
<string name="245">Large bruises, cuts and other signs of torture mark this man as a prisoner.</string>
<string name="246">Aribeth stands here, with a blank, passionless, mask-like visage, like armour for her soul.</string>
<string name="247">Gorgoth</string>
<string name="248">There is something very strange about the expression on this man&apos;s face. His very presence radiates extreme evil.</string>
<string name="249">This creature radiates a cold, calculating evil presence.</string>
<string name="250">High Captain Suljack</string>
<string name="251">Whatever god this priest serves, the blood and markings on his clothes show him as clearly evil.</string>
<string name="252">This exceedingly beautiful woman looks completely out of place in this evil place.</string>
<string name="253">This large man carries himself with nervous dignity, as if afraid to show his true nature, yet unable to hide it completely.</string>
<string name="254">Zhelhund</string>
<string name="255">This man has a dark, piercing gaze that slides around as if trying to solve some kind of puzzle.</string>
<string name="256">This is a combat dummy, marked up with slashes and sewn back together many times.</string>
<string name="257">Fred</string>

&quot;Maugrim has assigned me quarters with the other ambassadors, though I don&apos;t know for how long. He tells me that he serves a greater power, and hints that I will come to revere this being far more than I ever did Tyr.

&quot;I do not know if that is true. I am not sure of anything anymore except that I have Fallen. Fallen out of love with my lord, my people and my God. I am alone in a world where there is no justice and no hope and I cannot... I cannot get these thoughts out of my mind.

&quot;They burn my every waking moment and whisper to me in my dreams. I shall go mad, I think, if I am not mad already. To do the wrong thing seems far better, however, than to do nothing at all. I am on this path now, and it goes only forward... perhaps at its end I shall find my own justice and the dreams will stop.

&quot;I can only hope.&quot;</string>

Most of the entries go into exhaustive detail. It seems the wizards have &apos;attuned&apos; several portals to the abyssal and hellish planes, attempting to research the eternal Blood War being carried on by the demons and devils.

No conclusion seems to have been drawn, but it is pointed out in several places that one curious property of the portals is that their attunement is easily disrupted by material of the opposing planes. One wizard warns that trying to actually send material from one plane through the wrong portal could be highly destructive.</string>

<string name="293">This is the journal of a minor wizard in the Arcane Brotherhood, Arteno Geth. His notes are sporadic and personal, detailing his dislike of certain tutors, his tribulations in learning certain magics, and his suspicions over Maugrim.

His most recent entry is the one of greatest relevence:

&quot;I should never have joined Rimardo. The Archmage disappeared almost as soon as Maugrim began his campaign in the tower... meaning we were left to fend for ourselves. None of us thought that the man&apos;s influence was spread so deeply.
Yet it was. After all the fighting was done, I found myself on the losing side. So now I must slave away with Rimardo on these bloody golems.

&quot;Today I finished work on the replication rod, though I surely shall receive no congratulations for it. When it is placed together with the control rod in the replication chamber, the magics start an automatic creation cycle... a golem is formed in a fraction of the time it would once have taken. It is powerful, as well... I&apos;ve told Rimardo several times that we should be careful to retain control over these golems, lest they break through the magical barrier around the inner sanctum, here.

&quot;He doesn&apos;t heed my warnings, naturally. Bah! I would do anything not to have to slave away for that fool Maugrim anymore!&quot;</string>

&quot;My dear Lady Aribeth,

&quot;Master Maugrim has told me that I must inform you on how to move about the Host Tower for when you come.

&quot;I do not know if you are aware, but much of the Host Tower is not connected in the normal fashion. We use a teleporter to move about from area to area... when you are in the ambassador&apos;s area, you can find the first teleporter in the far chamber.

&quot;You only need touch the portal and express your desired location, and it shall open the way for you. The second level anyone may reach, but beyond that you must have a runestone which allows your access (for security, of course).

&quot;The portals, once open, remain so for a mere half-minute, my Lady. Hurry on through once has been opened. Enclosed with this letter is a runestone that will allow you to reach master Maugrim&apos;s private sanctum. He awaits your arrival eagerly.

&quot;Your servant,
  Apprentice Pim.&quot;</string>

<string name="401">Who you be?</string>
<string name="402">Who are you?</string>
<string name="403">Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Aarin Gend has instructed me to provide whatever assistance I can to you in your mission to recover the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="404">However my magic is not of a healing nature. My skills are tied to the teleportation portal in this temple and the Stone of Recall in your backpack. Is there something I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="405">You should speak to Neurik in that case. My abilities are tied strictly to the Stone of Recall and the teleportation portal. Is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="406">I am Sergol, a priest of Tyr. It is my duty to aid and assist those in the service of Neverwinter, though I am no healer. </string>
<string name="407">My magic is tied to the Stone of Recall in your backpack and the teleportation portal you see in this room. Now, is there something else you need of me? </string>
<string name="408">I thought you would be familiar with this by now. However, it is important so I will go over the use of the Stone of Recall again.</string>
<string name="409">In your backpack you carry a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at anytime and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="410">This will allow you to quickly return to town whenever you need to, saving precious travelling time.</string>
<string name="411">There is more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once you have used the stone, go through the teleportation portal and it will instantly send you back to the place your stone was last activated.</string>
<string name="412">Anyone in your service - henchmen, familiars and the like - will also be transported with you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="413">You&apos;re lucky to be alive. We barely managed to bring you back; your soul had nearly departed to the afterlife. </string>
<string name="414">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. May the grace of Tyr be with you. </string>
<string name="415">I can help you return to the site of your last battle, but are you sure you want to go back so soon? </string>
<string name="416">Whatever you were fighting will still be there. It would be wiser to find a way to avoid this confrontation, or at least to arm yourself better with supplies from some of the shops in the camp.</string>
<string name="417">Or perhaps you should use the teleportation portal to return to the spot where you last activated your Stone of Recall.</string>
<string name="418">I thought you would be familiar with this by now. However, it is important so I will go over the use of the Stone of Recall again.</string>
<string name="419">In your backpack you carry a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at anytime and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="420">This will allow you to return quickly to town whenever you need to, saving precious traveling time.</string>
<string name="421">There is more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once you have used the stone, go through the teleportation portal and it will instantly send you back to the place your stone was last activated.</string>
<string name="422">Anyone in your service - henchmen, familiars and the like - will also be transported with you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="423">As you wish. I can use my magic to return you to the site you just came from. This will return you to your last battle. Are you ready? </string>
<string name="424">As you wish. Prepare yourself, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="425">Hmmm. I thought you would have been familiar with this process by now. Very well, I shall explain it to you myself.</string>
<string name="426">You are one of Aarin Gend&apos;s most important agents. After all you have done for Neverwinter he wants me to keep watch over you personally. </string>
<string name="427">Before your mission started I cast a Word of Recall spell upon you, so that whenever you become mortally wounded I can immediately teleport you here to safety. </string>
<string name="428">Just now, some enemy must have struck you a near fatal blow, and so the spell&apos;s contingency magics activated and whisked you away to safety. </string>
<string name="429">I can&apos;t do that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are too important. Neverwinter has need of your skills if we&apos;re ever to find the Words of Power. We can&apos;t risk an untimely demise.</string>
<string name="430">As soon as your battered body appeared, the other clerics here called upon the healing power of Tyr to bring you back from the brink of death. </string>
<string name="431">You are now as ready as you&apos;ll ever be to continue with your mission. The Recall spell will activate again if you are dealt another fatal blow. </string>
<string name="432">The spell doesn&apos;t require your presence. I simply needed to know your full name, which Aarin Gend provided.</string>
<string name="433">I am Sergol, a priest of Tyr. It is my duty to aid and assist those in the service of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="434">Ah. You have awakened. I need to speak with you. </string>
<string name="435">We are very disappointed in you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your slaughter of innocent people has caused much suffering in a time already overburdened with tragedy.</string>
<string name="436">Were it up to me you would have been left to rot in your grave; however, Aarin Gend has ordered me to resurrect you. Despite your actions, Neverwinter still has need of you.</string>
<string name="437">You will suffer no further consequences for your mad killing spree, but I implore you not to engage in such wholesale slaughter again. Please, focus on the mission you have been given. </string>
<string name="438">I could surely use him now. Many of the surrounding farms have come under attack from the Uthgardt raiders. Most of our neighbors have fled, but I dare not risk such a journey with my new born baby.</string>
<string name="439">Take whatever you want and go - just don&apos;t hurt me or my baby.</string>
<string name="440">I will carry my baby daughter and follow you to the safety of Fort Ilkard. Please don&apos;t abandon us - I cannot travel as quickly as you.</string>
<string name="441">I already told you, we have nothing worth stealing. I&apos;m just a poor farm wife.</string>
<string name="442">Search the house and take whatever you want, then please... just go. All I ask is you don&apos;t hurt my baby.</string>
<string name="443">Me got to go now.</string>
<string name="444">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; You room and board cost gone up. You got to give me 50 gold for pay for it.</string>
<string name="445">Me want ask you stuff.</string>
<string name="446">Me on secret mission. Me can&apos;t talk &apos;bout it.</string>
<string name="447">Gend got me looking for Power Words.</string>
<string name="448">I have to go now.</string>
<string name="449">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Room and board costs for all the soldiers have gone up. I&apos;m here to collect 50 gold pieces from you.</string>
<string name="450">It no joke. You give me 50 gold or me gonna get you demoted!</string>
<string name="451">No joke. Give me 50 gold or I&apos;ll get you demoted. I can do it, you know.</string>
<string name="452">Okay, me give you a break. You not have to give me gold.</string>
<string name="453">Okay, I&apos;ll give you a break. You don&apos;t have to contribute.</string>
<string name="454">Everyone got do their part or Luskan is gonna win the war. Then what happen to your family?</string>
<string name="455">Hey, everybody&apos;s got to do their part or Luskan will defeat us. Then what would happen to your family?</string>
<string name="456">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="457">What you think about them Uggarts that help you &apos;gainst Luskan?</string>
<string name="458">You know anything &apos;bout the places &apos;round here.</string>
<string name="459">Me need buy stuff.</string>
<string name="460">What do you think of our Uthgardt allies?</string>
<string name="461">Do you know anything about the surrounding area?</string>
<string name="462">Where can I buy some equipment?</string>
<string name="463">I can&apos;t talk about the mission I&apos;m on.</string>
<string name="464">Aarin Gend has me searching for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="465">Hey there, &lt;FullName&gt;. Glad to see you&apos;re still on our side. We don&apos;t need somebody else pulling a stunt like Aribeth did, right? </string>
<string name="466">So, what are you doing here? I thought Aarin Gend would have had you busy trying to save us all yet again.</string>
<string name="467">Yusam the druid is telling everyone that we don&apos;t have to worry about the Uthgardt Elk tribe anymore. That&apos;s a relief, &lt;FirstName&gt; - the Luskan army is big enough without the barbarians joining their cause!</string>
<string name="468">Hey there, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Good to see you again. You know, everyone&apos;s talking about how Fort Ilkard nearly fell to those Elk tribe barbarians!</string>
<string name="469">It&apos;s a good thing the siege failed. We can&apos;t afford to lose Fort Ilkard if we want to win this war against Luskan!</string>
<string name="470">Hey, I know you. You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, right? The savior of Neverwinter and all that.</string>
<string name="471">So you here to help us out with this battle against Luskan? Or does Aarin Gend have you on some secret mission?</string>
<string name="472">Oh, sure... I understand. You&apos;re a big hero and I&apos;m just a lowly soldier. You&apos;ve probably got a lot of other things on your mind. Maybe I&apos;ll see you around later.</string>
<string name="473">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; What? But that isn&apos;t... oh, wait a minute. Ha-ha. You almost got me there. I was really worried for a second. </string>
<string name="474">I&apos;ve got a family to support back in Neverwinter and fifty gold would clean me out. I didn&apos;t know you were such a joker, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="475">What!!?? You... you wouldn&apos;t! You couldn&apos;t! This isn&apos;t... I don&apos;t believe this!</string>
<string name="476">Fine - here&apos;s your stupid gold. First Aribeth betrays us and now you do this. They just don&apos;t make heroes like they used to.</string>
<string name="477">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; 50 gold? But... but I can&apos;t afford that! I&apos;ve got a family to support back in Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="478">Thanks, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You&apos;re a good &lt;man/woman&gt;, to take pity on a poor soldier like me. So, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="479">Fine - here&apos;s the gold. But this isn&apos;t fair! We can&apos;t leave or we&apos;ll get hung for desertion. They can&apos;t just suddenly start charging us for room and board when we&apos;re not allowed to leave!</string>
<string name="480">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hey, somebody already came by and collected this extra charge from me. I&apos;m not going to pay this fee twice.</string>
<string name="481">You can go check with my commanding officer if you don&apos;t believe me. So, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="482">Questions? I doubt I can tell you anything you don&apos;t already know. But ask away and I&apos;ll do my best.</string>
<string name="483">I guess we need all the help we can get, but I&apos;m glad those barbarians stay up there on the plateau. I don&apos;t want a bunch of bloodthirsty savages wandering around down here.</string>
<string name="484">Sorry, I grew up in Neverwinter. I don&apos;t know much about the lands outside the city. Anything else I can do for you? </string>
<string name="485">Well, pretty much everything you need can be found out in the camp. Just wander around a bit and you&apos;ll find all sorts of places selling equipment. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="486">Secret mission, eh? Sounds dangerous. I guess that&apos;s why you&apos;re a hero and I&apos;m just a soldier. So... anything you need from me?</string>
<string name="487">Words of Power? I&apos;ve never heard of anything like that. Must be some sort of secret weapon we can use against the Luskan army, right?</string>
<string name="488">But you probably can&apos;t talk about that to a raw recruit like me. So... is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="489">I already gave you all my gold, so leave me alone.</string>
<string name="490">Hey, no hard feelings. Bartender - a drink for my friend Lodar, please. I&apos;m buying.</string>
<string name="491">Me need &apos;nother copy of book.</string>
<string name="492">Can I get another copy of the notebook?</string>
<string name="493">Ah, &lt;FirstName&gt; - I see you are back. But... where is your trial notebook? You agreed to defend Rolgan; without that book no one will recognize you as an officer of the court!</string>
<string name="494">Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I know you have much on your mind. But if you are to participate in Rolgan&apos;s trial you must keep that notebook with you at all times.</string>
<string name="495">In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you before Rolgan&apos;s trial, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="496">Of course, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Here is another copy of the notebook. Remember, you must keep it on at all times as a symbol ofTyr&apos;s authority.</string>
<string name="497">Without it, no one will recognize you as an officer of the court. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="498">Neurik at the Temple of Tyr can explain it better than I - I do not understand the ways of your justice system.</string>
<string name="499">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Bad news. You wages got cut. You gotta give back 50 gold.</string>
<string name="500">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Bad news. Wages have been cut. You have to give back 50 gold from your salary.</string>
<string name="501">Give me you gold or me rip you sore leg right off!</string>
<string name="502">Hand over your gold or I&apos;ll rip that injured leg right off!</string>
<string name="503">You all hurt, you keep gold.</string>
<string name="504">Tell you what, since you&apos;re injured I&apos;ll let you keep your wages.</string>
<string name="505">That not me problem. You give gold now.</string>
<string name="506">Not my problem. Just hand over the gold.</string>
<string name="507">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You expect me to believe a story like that? Give me a break.</string>
<string name="508">I have a leg wound, not a head injury. Go sell your story somewhere else. I have to rest up for this trial.</string>
<string name="509">And anyway, you&apos;re too late. Someone else already came and took the last of my gold. I don&apos;t have a single coin left, so you might as well move on.</string>
<string name="510">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; 50 gold? This is outrageous! That&apos;s half a month&apos;s wages! How do they expect me to survive?</string>
<string name="511">I&apos;ve got a bad leg. I&apos;m on disability leave right now. They can&apos;t expect an injured soldier to hand over that kind of gold, can they?</string>
<string name="512">Well, that&apos;s something at least. Now maybe I can get some peace - my leg is killing me and I have to rest up for that trial.</string>
<string name="513">Fine - here&apos;s your damn gold. I don&apos;t think this is fair, though. And I&apos;m getting mighty sick of being taken advantage of!</string>
<string name="514">I guess it doesn&apos;t matter, though. Somebody already came by and took the last of my gold. You&apos;ll just have to tell them to dock my wages.</string>
<string name="515">Now maybe I can get some peace and quiet. My leg is killing me and I have to rest up for this trial.</string>
<string name="516">You again? I already gave you 50 gold - that&apos;s all I got!</string>
<string name="517">So shove off and leave me alone.</string>
<string name="518">Three squares a day and steady wages - being a soldier ain&apos;t so bad. Unless I get killed, of course.</string>
<string name="519">I heard Fort Ilkard is under siege from the Uthgardt Elk tribe! I wonder if they&apos;ll ship me up there to help defend the fort?</string>
<string name="520">Thank the gods the siege at Fort Ilkard&apos;s over, or I might have been shipped to the front to help defend the fort!</string>
<string name="521">Rolkid&apos;s a hell of a general! With his battle plan and heroes like you on our side we&apos;ll drive those Luskan dogs back!</string>
<string name="522">Them Uthgardt are a bunch of savages! One of &apos;em killed Griff, you know!</string>
<string name="523">Seen that Uthgardt&apos;s body on the spike out by the Temple? That should keep them savages in line!</string>
<string name="524">I don&apos;t trust those Uthgardt - but I guess we need their help in the war against Luskan.</string>
<string name="525">This war is my big chance! If I do something heroic, I&apos;ll be famous - maybe even as famous as you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!</string>
<string name="526">Check out this armor Rolkid gave me. I can&apos;t wait to test it out in battle!</string>
<string name="527">You heard the news? We don&apos;t have to worry about the Elk tribe fighting against us anymore. At least, that&apos;s what that druid up on the plateau is telling everyone.</string>
<string name="528">Rolkid&apos;s done a great job training me for battle! I wonder when they&apos;ll ship me up to the front?</string>
<string name="529">Hey, you&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt; - the hero of Neverwinter! I&apos;d buy you a drink if they weren&apos;t so expensive in this dive!</string>
<string name="530">Word around the camp is that Fort Ilkard is under siege by one of them renegade barbarian tribes. I reckon they&apos;ll send some of us up there to join the fighting soon enough.</string>
<string name="531">Heard the news? Fort Ilkard isn&apos;t under siege anymore! They were just about to send me up to join the fighting, too. I think I&apos;ll have a drink to celebrate my good fortune!</string>
<string name="532">There&apos;s nothing to do in this camp but drink and wait for our orders to head up to the front.</string>
<string name="533">I heard one of the Black Lion warriors was executed for murder. I sure hope the Uthgardt don&apos;t turn us because of that.</string>
<string name="534">Can you believe the price of ale in this place? It&apos;s a crime!</string>
<string name="535">What are you doing here, &lt;FullName&gt;? I thought a big hero like you wouldn&apos;t waste &lt;his/her&gt; time in a crowded dive like this.</string>
<string name="536">I don&apos;t know which is worse - the Luskan invaders, or those bloodthirsty Uthgardt savages we&apos;re forced to fight alongside.</string>
<string name="537">Heard the good news? Yusam the druid is telling everyone we don&apos;t have to worry about those Elk tribe barbarians anymore!</string>
<string name="538">I heard the war isn&apos;t going well. Seems the Uthgardt Elk tribe have joined the Luskan army. I wonder when they&apos;re going to call my unit up to the front as reinforcements?</string>
<string name="539">This tavern ain&apos;t much, but at least we got somewhere to come and unwind after a hard day of drills.</string>
<string name="540">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Me come to say you need pay war tax if you want stay friends with Neverwinter guys.</string>
<string name="541">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ve come to tell you that as our ally you have to pay a war tax to the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="542">Give me 50 gold or me kill you and you tribe need new chief!</string>
<string name="543">Hand over 50 gold or your tribe will have to find a new chieftain, old man!</string>
<string name="544">Me not mean for insult you honor. Nevermind.</string>
<string name="545">I didn&apos;t mean to insult your honor. Just forget about it.</string>
<string name="546">Me not care. Give me 50 gold or me make Neverwinter army wipe you out!</string>
<string name="547">Not my problem. Give me 50 gold or the Lords&apos; Alliance army will wipe you out!</string>
<string name="548">Me want ask question &apos;bout Rolgan.</string>
<string name="549">I want to ask you some questions about Rolgan.</string>
<string name="550">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; War tax? The Lords&apos; Alliance made no mention of such a thing during any of our councils.</string>
<string name="551">We have already given the lives of many of our warriors to this cause. Now you come here to try and deceive us in this matter? You insult my honor!</string>
<string name="552">I suspect you are trying to fool us into giving you gold, but if so you are too late. Another of your kind has already taken what little gold my tribe had.</string>
<string name="553">If you are not trying to deceive me, I apologize. In that case, you will have to simply tell the leaders of the Lords&apos; Alliance that we have no more gold to give.</string>
<string name="554">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; We have given the wisdom of our council, the use of our sacred land and the lives of our finest warriors to the cause of the Lords&apos; Alliance. You would think this would be more than enough.</string>
<string name="555">Must you strip us of the little wealth we have collected as well? This is an insult to the honor of my tribe!</string>
<string name="556">I thank you for seeing reason in this. These are difficult enough times without increasing tensions between my people and yours.</string>
<string name="557">Here is your gold. But you have shamed yourself in the eyes of our tribe. Begone - I will speak with you no more!</string>
<string name="558">However, you are not the first to demand this war tax; another of your kind has already collected it from me. I will not pay the tax twice. Return and tell this to your Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="559">Once the Elk tribe stood with the enemy, but Yusam the druid has told me we no longer need to fear the children of the Elk. Never again shall their spears threaten the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="560">There is little I can tell you of Rolgan, save that he is falsely accused of murder. Rolgan&apos;s wife could tell you more of this.</string>
<string name="561">Her name is Vanda - since Rolgan was seized she has spent all her time wandering on the sacred grounds of this plateau, praying for her husband. But I sense there was another reason you came to speak to me.</string>
<string name="562">Your greed and lust for gold has shamed you in the eyes of our tribe. Begone - I will speak with you no more!</string>
<string name="563">Yusam has told us the Elk tribes spears no longer fly against the Lords&apos; Alliance. Perhaps this will ease the hatred of the soldiers in the camp toward us.</string>
<string name="564">The Elk tribe no longer fight alongside the Luskan horde, yet the soldiers in the camp still eye us with suspicion.</string>
<string name="565">There&apos;s a lot of soldiers here. You wouldn&apos;t be selling drinks to them while they&apos;re on duty, would you?</string>
<string name="566">There be lots of soldiers in here. You not be selling them drinks when them is on duty, is you?</string>
<string name="567">Give me 50 gold or I&apos;ll tell everyone you&apos;re serving soldiers on duty and run you out of business!</string>
<string name="568">Sorry. Forget I even mentioned it.</string>
<string name="569">Me sorry. You forget me ever say anything &apos;bout this, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="570">You gotta give 50 gold or me tell everyone you give drinks to soldiers on duty and they put you out of business!</string>
<string name="571">What? No, I&apos;d never sell a drink to a soldier on duty. They&apos;d take my license if I did that - I&apos;d be ruined!</string>
<string name="572">Don&apos;t be going around spreading rumors like that now, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, even in jest. We&apos;re talking about my livelihood, after all.</string>
<string name="573">Of course, my good &lt;man/woman&gt;. It&apos;s as if it never happened. Now, can I get you a drink?</string>
<string name="574">What? You mean... this is a shakedown? I thought I&apos;d gotten away from this kind of extortion when I left Westgate! You&apos;re as bad as those damn Nightmasks!</string>
<string name="575">Fine - here&apos;s your gold. But now that I&apos;ve given my share, you&apos;ve got to leave me alone! In fact, get out of here. You&apos;re not welcome in my bar!</string>
<string name="576">Sorry, but you&apos;re too late. Somebody&apos;s already come by and put the squeeze on me here at Beorunna&apos;s well.</string>
<string name="577">I&apos;ve already paid my share to you shakedown artists and I can&apos;t afford anymore, no matter what you threaten me with. You can&apos;t get blood from a stone.</string>
<string name="578">Sorry, but that&apos;s the hard truth of the matter. But maybe you want to drown your sorrows in a nice drink?</string>
<string name="579">You again? Look, I&apos;ve already paid you off once - I can&apos;t afford to give you another 50 gold! You can&apos;t get blood from a stone.</string>
<string name="580">If I wanted to deal with these kind of constant shakedowns I would have stayed in Westgate and given my gold to the Nightmasks. So go on, you - get out of here.</string>
<string name="581">Me looking for Power Words. You know where they be?</string>
<string name="582">You wouldn&apos;t happen to know anything about some ancient artifacts known as the Words of Power, would you?</string>
<string name="583">I&apos;m just an enlisted man, they don&apos;t tell me anything. Maybe you should speak to Commander Damas about that - if that jerk will even talk to you.</string>
<string name="584">But all he cares about is his little war with the Uthgardt. He doesn&apos;t give a damn about anything else - not even the men under his command!</string>
<string name="585">Me look for Power Words. You know where they be?</string>
<string name="586">You wouldn&apos;t know anything about some ancient artifacts know as the Words of Power, would you?</string>
<string name="587">Oh, yeah - they&apos;re always telling us run of the mill soldiers about things like that. Hmph! Get serious. Commander Damas doesn&apos;t tell us anything.</string>
<string name="588">You can ask him about those Words if you want, but I don&apos;t know if he&apos;d be any help. He&apos;s nothing but a pompous, self absorbed jerk!</string>
<string name="589">My farm is down in the fields to the west of Fort Ilkard. It shouldn&apos;t be hard to recognize my wife - I don&apos;t think there are too many other gnomes living as farmers in the area.</string>
<string name="590">Me no care &apos;bout Elkies, but me want get gold from this somehow.</string>
<string name="591">I don&apos;t care about the Elk tribe, but I want to profit from this somehow!</string>
<string name="592">Me change mind. Elkies not deserve this. You give me plague cure right now!</string>
<string name="593">I&apos;ve changed my mind. The Elk tribe doesn&apos;t deseve this. Hand over that plague cure.</string>
<string name="594">You give me gold and me not tell nobody &apos;bout you plan to make all Elkies sick.</string>
<string name="595">You buy my silence and I won&apos;t tell anyone about your plan to infect the Elk tribe with the plague.</string>
<string name="596">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Make it 200.</string>
<string name="597">Forget it.</string>
<string name="598">Deal.</string>
<string name="599">You know stuff &apos;bout Power Words?</string>
<string name="600">Do you know anything about the Words of Power?</string>
<string name="601">Me already go there.</string>
<string name="602">I&apos;ve already been there.</string>
<string name="603">Ruins?</string>
<string name="604">I see you have returned, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Is there something further I can do for you?</string>
<string name="605">I admire a &lt;man/woman&gt; who would be willing to let the entire Elk tribe die from the plague in exchange for a simple payoff.</string>
<string name="606">But just because you and I think alike doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;m going to hand over my gold to you. Why would I want to do that?</string>
<string name="607">Even if you tell people what I did, it&apos;s not going to change anything. I might get a reprimand from the higher ups, but there won&apos;t be any real consequences.</string>
<string name="608">Still, a reprimand would mean a lot of paperwork I can do without. Tell you what - you give me those blankets and keep my little plan to exterminate the Elk tribe secret and I&apos;ll give you 100 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="609">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I think you underestimate how little I really care about this. I want to avoid some inconvenient questions about my activities, but I&apos;m not going to give away a fortune to do it.</string>
<string name="610">If you don&apos;t want my gold you can keep those blankets. I really don&apos;t care. So I&apos;ll give you one last chance to accept my offer. Do you want the 100 gold pieces?</string>
<string name="611">If that&apos;s the way you want to be, fine. Keep the blankets.</string>
<string name="612">A pleasure doing business with you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I&apos;ll make sure these blankets are burnt and nobody will ever have to worry about them again.</string>
<string name="613">Now is there anything else I can do for you? If not I should really get back to my work. This fort doesn&apos;t run itself, you know.</string>
<string name="614">Ah, you must be one of Aarin Gend&apos;s agents. Got you traipsing all over the countryside searching out these mysterious lost artifacts, doesn&apos;t he?</string>
<string name="615">Sounds like a fool&apos;s errand to me. This war will be won with soldiers, not these so called Words of Power.</string>
<string name="616">However, I wouldn&apos;t want anyone to think I&apos;m being uncooperative with one of Aarin&apos;s agents. Have you searched those old ruins to the south? That&apos;s your best bet.</string>
<string name="617">Really? Well, then I guess I can&apos;t be much help to you then. Those old ruins way to the south are the only place I know of that might have some kind of ancient magic.</string>
<string name="618">So, I guess you&apos;ll be going now and letting me get back to commanding this fort.</string>
<string name="619">There&apos;s some deserted ruins in the land to the south of this fort. One of my scouting parties was down there and they came across some strange columns of magical light.</string>
<string name="620">Nearby they found a glowing cave entrance, and inside were some ancient ruins. Nobody seems to know who built them, but according to my scouts they didn&apos;t look like dwarven, elven or human architecture.</string>
<string name="621">Like I said, I think these Words of Power are a waste of time. But if you&apos;re determined to search them out I&apos;d suggest you head south until you see those pillars of light. The glowing cave entrance should be just east of there.</string>
<string name="622">Enough yapping. It&apos;s time for you to die.</string>
<string name="623">Enough talk. Me just gonna kill you now.</string>
<string name="624">How dare you speak to me like that! I&apos;ll scratch your eyes out!</string>
<string name="625">Me think it be fun if me just kill you now.</string>
<string name="626">I think it might be fun to slaughter you like a hog.</string>
<string name="627">What? No - I won&apos;t die without a fight!</string>
<string name="628">Me got some questions.</string>
<string name="629">If you had a time crystal you would just use the special property of the time crystal and target the effect on the sun dial to be sucked back into the past. To come back, just use the crystal again on the sun dial and you&apos;ll be transported back to the present age.</string>
<string name="630">Of course, &lt;FirstName&gt;. What do you wish to know?</string>
<string name="631">You won&apos;t get very far if you don&apos;t know how to use the sun dials.</string>
<string name="632">Guess what - this isn&apos;t a rescue. I&apos;m just here to kill you!</string>
<string name="633">Me got surprise for you. This not be rescue. Me gonna kill you now.</string>
<string name="634">A warrior of the Golden Eagle will not die without a fight!</string>
<string name="635">I think I feel like killing you now.</string>
<string name="636">Me think me want to kill you now.</string>
<string name="637">Then you shall feel the wrath of the Golden Eagle!</string>
<string name="638">Great - another gold grabbing mercenary here to bleed Gend&apos;s coffers dry.</string>
<string name="639">Out of my way! I&apos;m shipping to the Luskan front tomorrow, I don&apos;t have time for the likes of you.</string>
<string name="640">First Aribeth betrays us, then we have to ally ourselves with the likes of you. Grim times.</string>
<string name="641">I know we need all the help we can get, but I don&apos;t trust them Uthgardt up on the plateau.</string>
<string name="642">I can&apos;t believe Aribeth betrayed us!</string>
<string name="643">I can&apos;t talk right now. I&apos;ve got to get my stuff ready - I&apos;m shipping out to the front tomorrow.</string>
<string name="644">I&apos;m sorry, I can&apos;t talk right now. I&apos;ve got to get my stuff ready - I&apos;m shipping out to the front tomorrow.</string>
<string name="645">You look like you&apos;re a cut above the usual rabble serving the Lords&apos; Alliance. Good to have someone competent on board!</string>
<string name="646">You must be one of those mercenaries Gend has hired to search for the Words of Power. I wish you luck.</string>
<string name="647">(sigh) I&apos;d take you back to my bunk, handsome, but I don&apos;t think my seargent would let me keep you.</string>
<string name="648">You look like a take charge kind of guy. You here to search for those Words of Power I heard about?</string>
<string name="649">My, my. Hello there, handsome. You come to save us from the big, bad Luskan army?</string>
<string name="650">You&apos;re a sight for a soldier&apos;s sore eyes, miss. Most of them other female mercenaries ain&apos;t got much going in the way of looks.</string>
<string name="651">Nothing like a pretty lady to remind us soldiers what we&apos;re fighting for before we ship off to the front.</string>
<string name="652">Hello there, miss. What&apos;s a pretty gal like you doing in this stinkhole of a camp?</string>
<string name="653">I&apos;m glad you&apos;re standing with us against Luskan, &lt;race&gt;. We need all the help we can get.</string>
<string name="654">Another &lt;race&gt; mercenary in camp? Gend must be paying you guys a fortune.</string>
<string name="655">Another &lt;race&gt; type wandering about? You&apos;d think after what Aribeth did they&apos;d be more careful with relying on you non-humans.</string>
<string name="656">A word of warning to a fellow &lt;race&gt; - since Aribeth&apos;s betrayal people around here ain&apos;t too fond of us non-humans.</string>
<string name="657">Good to see another &lt;race&gt; face around here. We&apos;ve got to stick together if we want to beat those Luskan dogs!</string>
<string name="658">I didn&apos;t expect to see another &lt;race&gt; in these parts. You here to look for them Words of Power.</string>
<string name="659">This place is crawling with barbarians and Uthgardt. You&apos;re probably a pagan savage, too, ain&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="660">Shouldn&apos;t you be up on the plateau with the Uthgardt? We don&apos;t much like barbarians here in the camp.</string>
<string name="661">Geez, another barbarian in our camp. As if those Uthgardt savages aren&apos;t bad enough.</string>
<string name="662">You gonna use your crystal ball to find those Words of Power for Aarin Gend? Hah!</string>
<string name="663">You spell casters ain&apos;t too popular among the soldiers&apos; barracks. They ain&apos;t forgot that Luskan is run by mages!</string>
<string name="664">Keep your distance. If we can&apos;t even trust a paladin like Aribeth, how can we trust you spellcaster types?</string>
<string name="665">You&apos;re a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;, aren&apos;t you? I&apos;m shipping to the Luskan front tomorrow - say a prayer for me.</string>
<string name="666">I know the paladin Aribeth betrayed us all, but I still have faith in you holy types.</string>
<string name="667">Good to see some holy folk around here. You gonna do something about them pagan Uthgardts on the plateau?</string>
<string name="668">Hey, what&apos;s wrong with you mercenaries? Always waving your weapons all over the place!</string>
<string name="669">Looks like you&apos;re ready to head out in search of the traitor Aribeth - you&apos;re armed and everything!</string>
<string name="670">Hey, the camp is safe. No need to wave your weapons about here. Save that for the battle front.</string>
<string name="671">So what do you think about Aribeth&apos;s betrayal of Neverwinter? Ah, why am I asking an idiot like you?</string>
<string name="672">This camp is a mess! Uthgardt savages up on the plateau and morons wandering the streets.</string>
<string name="673">Not too bright, are you? Ah well, I guess we need all the help we can get to beat those Luskan dogs.</string>
<string name="674">You&apos;re bleeding like a stuck pig. You run into some Luskan soldiers serving that traitor Aribeth?</string>
<string name="675">You&apos;re pretty banged up. You just come back from the Luskan battle lines?</string>
<string name="676">Those wounds look terrible! Better get Neurik to check them out at the temple.</string>
<string name="677">Gend must be desperate if he&apos;s hiring people who can&apos;t even dress themselves.</string>
<string name="678">You can&apos;t run around the camp with nothing on! Are you mad?</string>
<string name="679">Put some decent clothing on! You&apos;re as bad as those Uthgardt savages!</string>
<string name="680">Neverwinter can&apos;t afford to lose any more of her champions. So what&apos;s Gend paying to keep you from bolting to the other side like Aribeth did, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="681">I&apos;m shipping off to the front tomorrow, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Maybe I&apos;ll get a chance to prove myself and become a hero like you!</string>
<string name="682">So you&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, the great savior of Neverwinter. Funny... you don&apos;t look the part of a hero.</string>
<string name="683">I can&apos;t believe Aribeth betrayed us! At least we&apos;ve still got hereos like you on our side, &lt;FullName&gt;. </string>
<string name="684">I know we need all the help we can get, but I don&apos;t trust them Uthgardt up on the plateau.</string>
<string name="685">I&apos;m shipping off to the front tomorrow, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Maybe I&apos;ll get a chance to prove myself and become a hero like you!</string>
<string name="686">I&apos;m shipping off to the front tomorrow, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Maybe I&apos;ll get a chance to prove myself and become a hero like you!</string>
<string name="687">You certainly look the part of a hero, &lt;FullName&gt;. Just being around you inspires the troops with confidence!</string>
<string name="688">Word is Aarin Gend has you searching for the Words of Power, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Too bad - we could use a good &lt;man/woman&gt; like you up on the front.</string>
<string name="689">(sigh) I&apos;d take you back to my bunk, handsome, but heroes like you are too valuable to be locked away in the bedroom during times like these.</string>
<string name="690">Everyone&apos;s talking about everything you&apos;ve done for Neverwinter, &lt;FirstName&gt;... but they don&apos;t mention how handsome you are!</string>
<string name="691">My, my. Hello there, handsome. You come to save us from the big, bad Luskan army?</string>
<string name="692">Brave, attractive and gorgeous - you&apos;re almost too good to be true, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="693">Nothing like a pretty lady to remind us soldiers what we&apos;re fighting for before we ship off to the front.</string>
<string name="694">Hey, you&apos;re &lt;FirstName&gt;, right? Everyone&apos;s talking about everything you&apos;ve done for Neverwinter... but they never mentioned how pretty you are.</string>
<string name="695">I&apos;m glad you&apos;re standing with us against Luskan, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We need all the help we can get - especially from &lt;race&gt; &lt;class&gt;s like you.</string>
<string name="696">Gend must be paying you guys a fortune, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I heard you &lt;race&gt; heroes don&apos;t work cheap.</string>
<string name="697">Hey, &lt;FirstName&gt;, we appreciate everything you&apos;ve done for Neverwinter. You &lt;race&gt; types ain&apos;t so bad after all.</string>
<string name="698">A word of warning to a fellow &lt;race&gt; - since Aribeth&apos;s betrayal people around here ain&apos;t too fond of us non-humans.</string>
<string name="699">Good to see another &lt;race&gt; face around here. We&apos;ve got to stick together if we want to beat those Luskan dogs!</string>
<string name="700">I didn&apos;t expect to see another &lt;race&gt; face in these parts - especially not one as famous as yours, &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="701">I wouldn&apos;t trust those Uthgardt barbarians on the plateau if it wasn&apos;t for you saving us all from the plague and the Luskan cult, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="702">I didn&apos;t expect to see you here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I figured you be happier up there on the plateau with the Uthgardt. They&apos;re savages... uh, I mean barbarians like you.</string>

<string name="705">I hear the Luskan army is run by mages from the Arcane Brotherhood. It&apos;s a good thing we&apos;ve got a powerful spellcaster like you on our side, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="706">I know you&apos;re a big hero and all, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but if we can&apos;t even trust a paladin like Aribeth how can we trust you spellcaster types?</string>

<string name="708">I know the paladin Aribeth betrayed us all, but I still have faith in you holy types &lt;FirstName&gt;. After all, you saved us from the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="709">Good to see some holy folk around here. You gonna do something about them pagan Uthgardts on the plateau?</string>
<string name="710">You may be a famous hero and all, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but you don&apos;t need to walk around camp with your weapon drawn all the time!</string>
<string name="711">Looks like you&apos;re ready to head out in search of the traitor Aribeth - you&apos;re armed and everything!</string>
<string name="712">Hey, the camp is safe. No need to wave your weapons about here. Save that for the battle front.</string>
<string name="713">You may not be the swiftest soldier in the camp, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but you sure know how to get the job done.</string>
<string name="714">This camp is a mess! Uthgardt savages up on the plateau and morons wandering the streets. Uh... not you though, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="715">You&apos;re &lt;FirstName&gt;, right? The one who found the Luskan cult? Funny, I thought you&apos;d be... well, you know... smarter.</string>
<string name="716">You&apos;re bleeding like a stuck pig. You run into some Luskan soldiers serving that traitor Aribeth?</string>
<string name="717">You&apos;re pretty banged up. You just come back from the Luskan battle lines?</string>
<string name="718">Those wounds look terrible! Better get Neurik to check them out at the temple.</string>

<string name="765">Out of my way! I&apos;m shipping to the Luskan front tomorrow, I don&apos;t have time for the likes of you.</string>
<string name="766">First Aribeth betrays us, then we have to ally ourselves with the likes of you. Grim times.</string>
<string name="767">I know we need all the help we can get, but I don&apos;t trust them Uthgardt up on the plateau.</string>
<string name="768">I can&apos;t believe Aribeth betrayed us!</string>

<string name="770">I&apos;m sorry, I can&apos;t talk right now. I&apos;ve got to get my stuff ready - I&apos;m shipping out to the front tomorrow.</string>
<string name="771">You look like you&apos;re a cut above the usual rabble serving the Lords&apos; Alliance. Good to have someone competent on board!</string>
<string name="772">You must be one of those mercenaries Gend has hired to search for the Words of Power. I wish you luck.</string>
<string name="773">(sigh) I&apos;d take you back to my bunk, handsome, but I don&apos;t think my seargent would let me keep you.</string>
<string name="774">You look like a take charge kind of guy. You here to search for those Words of Power I heard about?</string>
<string name="775">My, my. Hello there, handsome. You come to save us from the big, bad Luskan army?</string>
<string name="776">You&apos;re a sight for a soldier&apos;s sore eyes, miss. Most of them other female mercenaries ain&apos;t got much going in the way of looks.</string>
<string name="777">Nothing like a pretty lady to remind us soldiers what we&apos;re fighting for before we ship off to the front.</string>
<string name="778">Hello there, miss. What&apos;s a pretty gal like you doing in this stinkhole of a camp?</string>
<string name="779">I&apos;m glad you &lt;race&gt; folk are standing with us against Luskan. We need all the help we can get.</string>
<string name="780">Another &lt;race&gt; mercenary in camp? Gend must be paying you guys a fortune.</string>
<string name="781">Another &lt;race&gt; type wandering about? You&apos;d think after what Aribeth did they&apos;d be more careful with relying on you non-humans.</string>
<string name="782">A word of warning to a fellow &lt;race&gt; - since Aribeth&apos;s betrayal people around here ain&apos;t too fond of us non-humans.</string>

<string name="784">I didn&apos;t expect to see another &lt;race&gt; in these parts. You here to look for them Words of Power.</string>
<string name="785">This place is crawling with barbarians and Uthgardt. You&apos;re probably a pagan savage, too, ain&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="786">Shouldn&apos;t you be up on the plateau with the Uthgardt? We don&apos;t much like barbarians here in the camp.</string>
<string name="787">Geez, another barbarian in our camp. As if those Uthgardt savages aren&apos;t bad enough.</string>
<string name="788">You gonna use your crystal ball to find those Words of Power for Aarin Gend? Hah!</string>
<string name="789">You spell casters ain&apos;t too popular among the soldiers&apos; barracks. They ain&apos;t forgot that Luskan is run by mages!</string>
<string name="790">Keep your distance. If we can&apos;t even trust a paladin like Aribeth, how can we trust you spellcaster types?</string>
<string name="791">You&apos;re a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;, aren&apos;t you? I&apos;m shipping to the Luskan front tomorrow - say a prayer for me.</string>
<string name="792">I know the paladin Aribeth betrayed us all, but I still have faith in you holy types.</string>
<string name="793">Good to see some holy folk around here. You gonna do something about them pagan Uthgardts on the plateau?</string>
<string name="794">Hey, what&apos;s wrong with you mercenaries? Always waving your weapons all over the place!</string>
<string name="795">Looks like you&apos;re ready to head out in search of the traitor Aribeth - you&apos;re armed and everything!</string>
<string name="796">Hey, the camp is safe. No need to wave your weapons about here. Save that for the battle front.</string>
<string name="797">So what do you think about Aribeth&apos;s betrayal of Neverwinter? Ah, why am I asking an idiot like you?</string>
<string name="798">This camp is a mess! Uthgardt savages up on the plateau and morons wandering the streets.</string>
<string name="799">Not too bright, are you? Ah well, I guess we need all the help we can get to beat those Luskan dogs.</string>
<string name="800">You&apos;re bleeding like a stuck pig. You run into some Luskan soldiers serving that traitor Aribeth?</string>
<string name="801">You&apos;re pretty banged up. You just come back from the Luskan battle lines?</string>
<string name="802">Those wounds look terrible! Better get Neurik to check them out at the temple.</string>
<string name="803">Gend must be desperate if he&apos;s hiring people who can&apos;t even dress themselves.</string>

<string name="856">I didn&apos;t expect to see you here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I figured you be happier up there on the plateau with the Uthgardt. They&apos;re savages... uh, I mean barbarians like you.</string>
<string name="857">I&apos;m sick of those Uthgardt barbarians running around this camp! Uh... no offense, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="858">So, &lt;FirstName&gt;... you gonna use your crystal ball to find those Words of Power for Aarin Gend? Just kidding. </string>
<string name="859">I hear the Luskan army is run by mages from the Arcane Brotherhood. It&apos;s a good thing we&apos;ve got a powerful spellcaster like you on our side, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="860">I know you&apos;re a big hero and all, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but if we can&apos;t even trust a paladin like Aribeth how can we trust you spellcaster types?</string>
<string name="861">You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt; the &lt;class&gt; aren&apos;t you? I&apos;m shipping to the Luskan front tomorrow - say a prayer for me.</string>
<string name="862">I know the paladin Aribeth betrayed us all, but I still have faith in you holy types &lt;FirstName&gt;. After all, you saved us from the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="863">You may be a famous hero and all, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but you don&apos;t need to walk around camp with your weapon drawn all the time!</string>
<string name="864">You may not be the swiftest soldier in the camp, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but you sure know how to get the job done.</string>
<string name="865">This camp is a mess! Uthgardt savages up on the plateau and morons wandering the streets. Uh... not you though, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="866">You&apos;re &lt;FirstName&gt;, right? The one who found the Luskan cult? Funny, I thought you&apos;d be... well, you know... smarter.</string>
<string name="867">You&apos;re &lt;FirstName&gt; - the one who saved Neverwinter from the plague! Uh... you do know you&apos;re naked, right?</string>
<string name="868">You can&apos;t run around the camp with nothing on, even if you are a big hero! Are you mad?</string>

<string name="877">Okay. You go now. Me not need reward.</string>
<string name="878">Fine. I guess I don&apos;t need a reward. Get out of here.</string>
<string name="879">Well, this is most awkward isn&apos;t it? You have no need of my information and I have nothing else to offer. Perhaps we should just consider this a good deed and part ways.</string>

<string name="897">Neverwinter&apos;s Spymaster is holding up remarkably well considering the grave consequences of Aribeth&apos;s unexpected betrayal.

<string name="994">Brunhilda&apos;s Diary</string>
<string name="995">This appears to be the diary of Brunhilda Orelsdottr, a frost giant princess. 

The entries are a hate-filled chronicle of the mistreatment and cruelty Brunhilda suffered at the hands of King Skrogg, the fire giant she was forced to marry nearly three months ago.

The final entry explains Brunhilda&apos;s ultimate fate:

Today in front of his court Skrogg vowed to consumate our marriage this very night. The coward will no doubt keep his entire retinue of guards in the room during our bedding for fear I may try to kill him, as I did the last time he dared to defile my bedchamber.

I will never let that pig touch me, though if I resist I know they will beat me again. I can endure the suffering and pain of this life no longer. Skrogg dares not kill me for fear of breaking the alliance with my mother, but tonight I shall take my own life and finally be free of this wretched existence. </string>
<string name="996">This soft, gelatinous orb is a powerful magical component used in numerous spells.</string>
<string name="997">The remains of these demonic, frog-like creatures contain many magical properties and are highly sought after by wizards for their experiments.</string>
<string name="998">This parchment bears a powerful enchantment and a single command word of the type used to activate a magic portal. Mages and sorcerers often employ such scrolls as &apos;keys&apos; to protect the entrances to their lairs or laboratories.

When read while standing within the area of an appropriate portal the scroll will instantly draw the reader through to the destination on the other side - wherever that may be.</string>
<string name="999">This tome details the process of capturing a dragon&apos;s essence within a dragon sphere:

The ritual is most effective when used upon a newly hatched wyrm whose growth has been accelerated using spells and enchantments; a beast whose mind is still empty and pure. Only these have the vitality and energy of youth necessary to prolong the life of the mighty Klauth. 

The creature to be absorbed must be lured or trapped within the center of the ritual room, and the dragon sphere must be placed upon the pedestal. The dragon&apos;s body will be instantly consumed even as its very life force is sucked into the sphere itself for Klauth to feed on at his leisure.

But a warning, lest you displease the master and suffer his terrible wrath: should a dead dragon&apos;s body be absorbed, the sphere must be destroyed immediately. If it is mistakenly presented to Klauth he may devour the essence of the dead wyrm, poisoning him and dealing his awesome might a crippling blow.</string>
<string name="1000">This sphere is roughly the size of an ogre&apos;s head and appears to be made of polished black stone, though it is far lighter than one would first expect. 

The sphere radiates a powerful heat, and on closer inspection there appears to be a winged shape lying motionless beneath the smooth, dark surface - the captured essence of a dead dragon.</string>

&quot;Though the secrets are known to me, the creation of the Amulet of Natural armor is not an endeavor I am likely to undertake, for reasons that at first glance should be obvious.

Fenberry, the complimentary component, presents no particular difficulty to the intrepid mage who wishes to acquire it in any substantial quantity. 

However, the primary ingredient - the tongue of a slaad - poses challenges far beyond the capabilities of most. In the unlikely event one should encounter and defeat one of these demonic beings, the casting of Mage Armor is the only further requirement to obtaining the desired amulet.

Needless to say, anyone attempting the process beyond the confines of a carefully controlled environment such as a mage&apos;s laboratory would be doomed to encounter failure and disappointment.&quot;</string>

&quot;The fashioning of the magical footwear known as Gargoyle Boots (or, as some insist on calling them, Boots of the Gargoyle) is an involved and difficult process not to be lightly undertaken.
 
Before beginning the procedure it is imperative that one perform said procedure within the confines of a proper mage&apos;s laboratory to avoid contaminations that would render the procedure ineffective.

As one might imagine, the primary ingredient is the skull of the creature that gives its name to the footwear. 
The skull must then be combined with a bodak&apos;s tooth and subjected to a stoneskin spell in order to complete the construction of said item.&quot;</string>

&quot;The Staff of Power is an item of great power that can only be created by unleashing the power of similarly powerful items.

One such item is the bodak&apos;s tooth. When paired with a like twin, the bodak&apos;s tooth (or teeth, as would perhaps be more appropriate in this instance) must be enchanted with a feeblemind spell.

If these instructions are followed within the confines of a proper wizard&apos;s laboratory, the resulting item will be the all powerful Staff in question.&quot;</string>

&quot;The Ring of Regeneration is an item eagerly sought after by both mage and warrior - not to mention priests and rogues. A perpetual fountain of healing magic constantly draining into one&apos;s own body is a boon to any man or woman, regardless of their profession.

Yet the creation of such an item is deceptively simple, if one merely possesses some fenberry and the eye of a rakshasa. (Of course acquiring said eye is another matter entirely - I have yet to meet the rakshasa that would part with one willingly.)

Once these ingredients are assembled the procedure can be completed using the equipment found in any standard mage&apos;s laboratory, supplemented with the casting of Melf&apos;s Acid Arrow on the combined ingredients.&quot;</string>

&quot;Though an item of great use and application, the Crystal Robe is not without its peculiar failings. However, those willing to accept the drawbacks will be more than happy to reap the benefits of said item if they precisely follow my instructions, as follow:

Combine the belly of a fire beetle with one flawless quartz crystal in an appropriate magic container (the like of which can be found in any respectable wizard&apos;s laboratory). 

Once the respective ingredients are in place, enchant them with an enervation spell to create the Crystal Robes.&quot;</string>
<string name="1008">This notebook identifies the bearer as an official representative of Tyr&apos;s justice in Rolgan&apos;s murder trial and explains the rules of court, including the right for defense council to question any of the participants involved before the trial begins.

To aid you in your task Neurik has included notes on the witnesses and jurors and where you might be able to locate them for questioning.

Witnesses:
Rolgan - the accused. Currently under my protection in the Temple of Tyr.
Zed - a Lords&apos; Alliance soldier. Recently has been spending most of his time in the soldiers&apos; barracks.
Lodar - a Lords&apos; Alliance soldier. Usually found in the drinking house when not on duty.
Vanda - wife of the accused. Spends her time on the plateau by Beorunna&apos;s Well.

Jurors: The jurors have been selected to ensure a fair representation to all sides in the dispute.

Edegar - my assistant, a good and honest man. He is usually to be found here helping out in the temple.
Averik - a Lords&apos; Alliance soldier. When not in the company of a female he can be found in the drinking house.
Jevon - a Lords&apos; Alliance soldier. A reliable young man who spends most of his free time in the barracks.
Dalcia - a female ranger. She spends her time living with the Uthgardt on the plateau near Beorunna&apos;s Well.

<string name="1009">Roughly the size of an ogre&apos;s fist, this crystal sphere is far heavier than it would appear. Inside the globe can be seen an exquisitely detailed miniature realm, right down to the tiny figures of dwarves and dryads populating the landscape. From time to time the position of these figures seems to shift and change, as if they were somehow moving too slowly for the naked eye to see. 

When flipped or turned drifting flakes of snow swirl and settle over the figures within the globe, covering the tiny world in a blanket of purest white. There is also a strong aura of magic surrounding the snow globe, and you sense that despite its fragile appearance it would be virtually impossible to destroy the glass casing.</string>
<string name="1010">Its size is impressive, with a unique quality and cut. This semi-precious stone has great value, particularly for those interested in the history of the Cheroux family.</string>
<string name="1011">Even in its dormant state, the magic contained within this artifact is undeniable. The surface of this heavy stone tablet tingles with raw energy and untapped potential, and the face and back are inscribed with the strange runes of a long forgotten alien tongue. The arcane symbols and unfamiliar glyphs pulsate and glow with a sinister inner light, bathing the entire stone in a warm reddish glow.

One can only imagine the unfathomable power that will be unleashed when the magic of the Word is fully awakened.</string>
<string name="1012">Blood stains the cover and many of the pages of this diary. Most of the entries are written in a firm, bold hand and describe the day-to-day activities of a settler family as they worked the fields and tilled the land. The final entry is written in a finer script:

&quot;The Uthgardt fell upon us as we were working in the fields. There was no warning and we can find no reason for the sudden attack. Father stumbled when an arrow took him in the leg, but while the savages hacked away at his fallen form Mother and I escaped to the homestead and barred the doors. 

&quot;There is no escape for us now: the barbarians have the home surrounded. The soldiers at Fort Ilkard are too far away to arrive in time to save us, and I fear our neighbors are already dead. I can only pray that when the savages break through the door our deaths are merciful and quick.&quot;</string>

<string name="1017">This note appears to be instructions from a high priest to one of his underlings describing how to enter the central vault of the complex:

As a keeper of the sacred artifacts you must understand the secrets of our inner sanctum. Only the rituals of smoke, light and sound will unbind the door - there is no other way to enter its hallowed walls. 

The enslaved fairy will guide you through the ritual of sound, for she is bound to the magic of the gongs. 

To complete the ritual of smoke you must cast the blessed powders on the sacred brazier so that their combinations match the descending order of the stones set into brazier&apos;s base.

The ritual of light can only be completed using the stones drawn from the holy pool in the center of the pillars. Begin by placing any two of the single stones in the primary color pools. The secondary pools must then be filled with the twin gems that match the corresponding color that would be created by combining the hues of the stones in the primary pool.

You may keep this letter for a fortnight, and then you will be tested on what you have learned. Master the secrets of the rituals and the Queen will be pleased with you. Fail to learn them and you shall suffer a grisly fate.</string>
<string name="1018">The text of this brief letter is written in a plain and unremarkable script:

Dearest Mathilda:

I meant to send this note to offer you words of comfort, but even in a letter I cannot lie to you, my love. In the morning I am being sent out on patrol to verify reports of a strange ruin found far to the south of Fort Ilkard - further south than even the newly settled homesteads and farmlands. The last two patrols sent out were set upon by the Uthgardt and brutally slaughtered, and I fear I may never return from this mission. 

Yet I am more troubled by the ever growing number of reports of defenseless settlers being butchered by the savages. I fear the homestead is no longer safe. You must take the children and flee Neverwinter as soon as you can.

I would come to escort you myself, but Commander Damas has a heart of stone. He has ordered anyone caught leaving their post without authorization to be hung as a deserter without trial. All I can do is send this note and pray it reaches you before the Uthgardt do.

Love, Willem</string>

<string name="1020">This note appears to have been left by Cyril, the mage who created this dungeon.

As I suspected, there are a number of natural pools in these underground chambers that can be easily converted into summoning cisterns. Once I have completed construction of my laboratory summoning a powerful elemental to do my bidding should simply require the addition of a Slaadi tongue to the pool, along with the casting of Melf&apos;s Acid Arrow.</string>
<string name="1021">This is the journal of Arwyl, leader of the snow globe dryads. The final entry is of particular interest:

The dwarves fell upon us yet again. Their savagery was terrifying, but at last I and my sisters managed to drive them off.

How many times was I slain in that battle, only to be reborn and slain yet again? Does it even matter anymore? War, death, rebirth - the cycle never ends.

In my dreams there are visions of a different world. I see dwarf and dryad working together, allied against a common and terrible foe in a bid to escape this pointless existence. And I remember the whisper of a powerful talisman, a tool to free both dryads and dwarves - the Amulet of Ages.

Is this a beautiful memory of a time long forgotten, or a promise of hope for the future? If we could only speak with the dwarves and make them understand...

But they are mad with bloodlust and attack us on sight. I fear this gruesome cycle will continue forever and this brutal existence will never end.</string>
<string name="1022">This is the journal of Hodd, leader of the snow globe dwarves. The final entry is of particular interest:

The dryads came at us again, using their foul magic. The fighting was bloody fierce, but at last we drove the tree huggers back. 

How many times did I die in that battle only to be reborn and slain again? Does it even matter anymore? Fighting, death, rebirth, fighting - it never ends.

Sometimes in my dreams I see a different world. I see dwarf and dryad working together, allied against a common and terrible foe in a bid to escape this pointless existence. And I remember the fading echoes of a powerful talisman, a tool to free both them dryads and we dwarves - the Amulet of Ages.

Is it a memory of a time lost, or a hope for the future? If the dryads would only listen to reason then maybe...

But they are mad and attack us on sight. The fighting will never end and this pointless existence will continue forever.</string>

A wise chieftain knows there is a time for war and there is a time for allegiance with and submission to a greater power. The time for petty warfare and tribal strife among the giants is over. King Skrogg has already bowed to my greatness, and has reaped the rewards for his people. Now I demand the same from you.

As proof of your allegiance I require tribute in the form of undamaged, living eggs seized from the lairs of the dragons throughout these mountains. Should you agree to my terms I will reward you with a thousand pieces of gold for each dragon egg delivered to my lair. Should you refuse I will destroy you and all your tribe. 

You may give your answer to my envoy, who will convey your message back to me with the utmost urgency.

<string name="1102">Neurik, the cleric at Tyr&apos;s temple, needs someone to defend Rolgan, an Uthgardt tribesman accused of murder.

The details of the case are included in a trial notebook, including the names of witnesses and jurors that must be spoken to in preparing an adequate case for the defense.

When you are ready to start the trial, go speak to Neurik at the Temple of Tyr.</string>
<string name="1103">[Trial will begin as soon as you enter the trial room]</string>
<string name="1104">Rolgan&apos;s trial is in progress. By law, should anything interrupt the procedings the young man will instantly be found guilty and executed. 

The justice of Tyr can be both swift and harsh.</string>
<string name="1105">Rolgan&apos;s trial is over. The unfortunate young man&apos;s decapitated head staring from atop the pike outside the Temple door is stark evidence of the poor case presented by his defense council. 

No doubt this outcome will increase tensions between the Uthgardt and the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="1106">Rolgan&apos;s trial is over. The young man owes his life to the skillful case presented by his defense council.

The Uthgardt and Neurik are pleased that Tyr&apos;s justice has been served, though there are lingering doubts among the Lords&apos; Alliance as to whether a guilty man has gone free.</string>
<string name="1107">Rolgan&apos;s trial is over. The young man undoubtably owes his life to the brilliant case presented by defense council. 

Neurik is elated with the unanimous verdict, for such an overwhelming verdict forces even the soldiers of the Lords&apos; Alliance to admit (grudgingly) that justice has been served.</string>
<string name="1108">The death of one of the participants has indefinitely postponed Rolgan&apos;s trial. It may be months before Neurik resumes the proceedings in this matter. Anyone investigating the trial would be better served searching for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="1109">Save the Supply Lines</string>
<string name="1110">Rolkid of the Mighty Lance, supply master for Beorunna&apos;s Well, wants to send a message to the raiders attacking the Lords&apos; Alliance supply lines. 

He has offered a substantial bounty to anyone who delivers him the heads of the infamous orc bandits Vaath and Guzud.</string>
<string name="1111">The head of Vaath has been delivered to Rolkid and promptly placed upon a stake outside the barracks. The reward for Guzud&apos;s head is still up for grabs.</string>
<string name="1112">The head of Guzud has been delivered to Rolkid and promptly placed upon a stake outside the barracks. The reward for Vaath&apos;s head is still up for grabs.</string>
<string name="1113">The heads of the orcish bandits Vaath and Guzud adorn the twin stakes flanking the entrance to the soldiers barracks in Beournna&apos;s Well. The infamous raiders will trouble the supply lines of the Lords&apos; Alliance no more.

Rolkid now seeks the head of Obould Many-Arrows, a powerful orcish chieftain, to complete his collection. Needless to say, he has put up a substantial reward.</string>
<string name="1114">The head of Obould Many-Arrows has been delivered to Rolkid of the Mighty lance, and the threat to the Lords&apos; Alliance supply lines has been well and truly vanquished.</string>
<string name="1115">The Snow Globe</string>
<string name="1116">Lillian Cambridge is looking for a brave adventurer to recover a valuable snow globe stolen from her by a wizard named Nax.

In exchange she has offered to reveal the location of one of the Words of Power.

She believes Nax is exploring an ancient mage&apos;s laboratory somewhere in the Coldwood - a lab accessible only by using a very special teleportation scroll.</string>
<string name="1117">The snow globe has been returned to Lillian Cambridge. As promised she has revealed the location of one of the Words of Power: a miniature world inside the snow globe itself!

The snow globe has been magically transported to its pedestal in Lillian&apos;s room, located upstairs in the drinking house of Beorunna&apos;s Well.

As long as the wine keeps flowing in the tavern she doesn&apos;t seem to care who goes into her room to access the miniature world inside the snow globe.</string>
<string name="1118">The Word of Power has been recovered from inside the snow globe, destroying the miniature world within and freeing the dwarves and dryads from their their endless torment.</string>
<string name="1119">The world inside the snow globe is populated by dryads and dwarves locked in a neverending war. Those slain in battle are instantly reborn to continue the fight.

But there are hints that once the dwarves and dryads served together as slaves under an evil master.

Maybe this master knows something about the Word of Power hidden in this world.</string>
<string name="1120">The snow globe is obviously a powerful artifact. Lillian Cambridge - the archeologist Aarin Gend mentioned could be found in the drinking house at Beorunna&apos;s Well - might be able to provide more information about it.</string>
<string name="1121">Words of Power</string>
<string name="1122">Words of Power

The Words of Power must be found before Maugrim and his cult locate them and turn the ancient artifacts against Neverwinter. Though lost for centuries, reports indicate that three of the Words can be found in the lands near Beorunna&apos;s Well.

As the Words are located, they should be brought back to Aarin Gend at Beorunna&apos;s Well so they can be delivered to the safety of Castle Never.</string>
<string name="1123">Words of Power

The first of the three Words of Power has been found and safely delivered to Aarin Gend, but the enemy is not beaten yet.

Maugrim and his cult continue to search the lands around Beorunna&apos;s Well - a sure sign there are other Words yet to be found.

As the Words are located, they should be brought back to Aarin Gend at Beorunna&apos;s Well so they can be delivered to the safety of Castle Never.</string>
<string name="1124">Words of Power

The second of the three Words of Power has been found and safely delivered to Aarin Gend, but the enemy is not beaten yet.

Maugrim and his cult continue to search the lands around Beorunna&apos;s Well - a sure sign there are other Words yet to be found.

As the Words are located, they should be brought back to Aarin Gend at Beorunna&apos;s Well so they can be delivered to the safety of Castle Never.</string>
<string name="1125">Words of Power

The third Word of Power has been found but there is no time for celebration. 

Aribeth and the Luskan army have breached the walls of Neverwinter.

Aarin Gend has made all the preparations for a quick return to Neverwinter. If Aribeth and the Luskan army are not stopped the city will surely fall.</string>
<string name="1126">The Siege of Fort Ilkard</string>
<string name="1127">With the Uthgardt catapults destroyed, Captain Damas is determined to end the siege of Fort Ilkard. 

He has promised a reward to anyone who can bring him the head of Arness, the Elk tribe sub-chieftain in charge of the forces laying siege to Fort Ilkard.</string>
<string name="1128">With the siege on Fort Ilkard ended, Captain Damas seeks to destroy the Elk tribe once and for all.

He has offered a reward to anyone who can get to their enclave in the west and bring back the head of their chieftain, Zokan Thunderer.</string>
<string name="1129">With the head of Zokan Thunderer delivered into his lap, Commander Damas and Fort Ilkard have little to fear from the Elk tribe any longer.</string>
<string name="1130">Commander Damas has promised to reward anyone who can destroy the catapults attacking Fort Ilkard.</string>
<string name="1131">Commander Damas has admitted he infected the Elk tribe with the Wailing Death. However, he feels no remorse for his actions.

A difficult moral decision lies ahead - deliver the plague cure to Zokan Thunderer and save the Elk tribe, or bring the chieftain&apos;s severed head to Commander Damas and collect the offered reward.</string>
<string name="1132">The Elk tribe have been cured of the plague they contracted from the infected blankets - a gift from Commander Damas of Fort Ilkard.</string>
<string name="1133">Bring Bret&apos;s Family to Fort Ilkard</string>
<string name="1134">Bret, a soldier at Fort Ilkard, fears for the safety of his young wife and newborn child. He has promised a reward if they are escorted from his homestead in the west to the safety of Fort Ilkard.</string>
<string name="1135">Bret&apos;s wife has agreed to follow you to the safety of Fort Ilkard.</string>
<string name="1136">Bret and his family have been reunited within the safety of Fort Ilkard&apos;s walls.</string>
<string name="1137">Bret&apos;s wife and daughter have been slain, though it might be best if the young man does not learn of their fate until after his service at Fort Ilkard is over.</string>
<string name="1138">After reaching the safety of the road leading to Fort Ilkard, Bret&apos;s wife has rushed on ahead to be reunited with her husband.</string>
<string name="1139">Deliver Eckel&apos;s Note</string>
<string name="1140">Eckel the gnome needs a note delivered to his wife in the homesteads to the west of Fort Ilkard. 

If the list of prospective buyers for his turnip crop is not delivered, Eckel is afraid he might lose his farm.</string>
<string name="1141">Eckel&apos;s list of prospective buyers for his turnip crop has been delivered to his wife, saving the farm from financial ruin.</string>
<string name="1142">Eckel&apos;s wife has been slain, though it would be best if he did not learn of her fate until after his service at Fort Ilkard has ended.</string>
<string name="1143">NON JOURNAL, Small Rewards</string>
<string name="1144">Investigate the Elk Tribe</string>
<string name="1145">Yusam is looking for someone to investigate the Uthgardt Elk tribe. The druid is convinced there must be some reason they have turned away from the Lords&apos; Alliance and joined with the Luskan army.

Yusam believes the Elk tribe and their leader, Zokan Thunderer, are in a keep to the west of Fort Ilkard.</string>
<string name="1146">Zokan Thunderer, leader of the Elk tribe, is no more. Upon hearing the news Yusam, Druid of the North, was saddened, though he understood the necessity of the Elk tribe&apos;s destruction.</string>
<string name="1147">The Elk tribe have been cured of the plague given to them by Commander Damas of Fort Ilkard, and will no longer aid the Luskan army in its battle against Neverwinter.

Yusam the Druid was pleased to learn the children of the Elk will once more welcome his counsel.</string>
<string name="1148">Free Nax</string>
<string name="1149">A wizard named Nax has become trapped behind an impassable wall of fire while exploring a long deserted mage&apos;s laboratory. 

He has offered a reward of a magical snow globe if he is released from his prison.</string>
<string name="1150">Nax has been freed, but he did not deliver the snow globe as promised.

Nax did say the key to finding the snow globe was a series of magical gongs struck in the proper order, which seems to have something to do with the creatures summoned during an ancient battle between the mage Cyril Lyricus and the Mountain Hag Nebacha.

The animals summoned were a cat, dog, bear and dragon.</string>
<string name="1151">Nax has been freed from his prison.</string>
<string name="1152">Recover the Star Sapphire</string>
<string name="1153">Husher Clay of the adventuring gear shop is looking for someone to bring him the Star Sapphire.

The gem was buried with the mage Layenne Cheroux, whose trap-infested tomb is believed to be hidden somewhere in the Coldwood.</string>
<string name="1154">The Star Sapphire has been delivered to Husher Clay.</string>
<string name="1155">Working for Akulatraxas</string>
<string name="1156">The green dragon Akulatraxas has been under attack from hill giants seeking to steal her eggs.

She has offered treasure from her hoard to anyone who brings her the hill giant chieftain&apos;s head, telling them to seek out the hill giants&apos; lair west of her cave.</string>
<string name="1157">The head of the hill giant chieftain has been given to the green dragon Akulatraxas, ending the threat to her eggs.</string>
<string name="1158">The green dragon Akulatraxas has been slain.</string>
<string name="1159">Gorgotha the Gold Dragon</string>
<string name="1160">The servants of Klauth, an ancient red wyrm, have been attacking the lair of the gold dragon Gorgotha.

In exchange for Klauth&apos;s head Gorgotha has offered a share of her treasure hoard. </string>
<string name="1161">The head of the wyrm Klauth has been delivered to the dragon Gorgotha, assuring her of the continued survival of her eggs.</string>
<string name="1162">The gold dragon Gorgotha has been slain.</string>
<string name="1163">Klauth the Ancient Red Wyrm</string>
<string name="1164">Klauth, the great red wyrm of the North, has admitted to having one of the Words of Power in his possession.

He has offered to exchange the Word of Power for the eggs of another dragon.</string>
<string name="1165">Klauth has traded the Word of Power he possessed for the dragon&apos;s eggs he needs to perform his dark rituals.</string>
<string name="1166">Klauth, ancient red wyrm of the North, is dead.</string>
<string name="1167">Plant the Ultarg Tree Seeds</string>
<string name="1168">A wild mage named Sapphira needs someone to travel back in time 10,000 years to plant the seeds of the rare Ultarg Tree so that she can harvest the fruit here in the present. The seeds must be planted beneath the red warding rune in the garden of the ancient past.

Sapphira explained that using the power of a time crystal on one of the sundials in the Creator Race ruins will draw a person back into the past, and using it in the same manner in the past will bring them back to the present.

She also mentioned that one of the Words of Power might be found in the vault at the center of the Creator Race ruins.</string>
<string name="1169">The seeds have been planted in the past and a magnificent Ultarg Tree has sprouted up in the present day.

Now Sapphira will be able to harvest the fruit she has so eagerly been waiting for. </string>
<string name="1170">Sapphira, the time travelling wild mage, is dead. With her passing it is unlikely anyone else in Faerun will care whether the Ultarg Tree ever bears fruit.</string>

<string name="1199">This is the journal of Arwyl, leader of the snow globe dryads. The final entry is of particular interest:

The dwarves fell upon us yet again. There savagery was terrifying, but at last I and my sisters managed to drive them off.

How many times was I slain in that battle, only to be reborn and slain yet again? Does it even matter anymore? War, death, rebirth - the cycle never ends.

In my dreams there are visions of a different world. I see dwarf and dryad working together, allied against a common and terrible foe in a bid to escape this pointless existence.

Is this a beautiful memory of a time long forgotten, or a promise of hope for the future? If we could only speak with the dwarves and make them understand...

But they are mad with bloodlust and attack us on sight. I fear this gruesome cycle will continue forever and this brutal existence will never end.</string>

<string name="1208">There is an evil glint of desperate cunning in the eye of this emerald scaled wyrm. </string>
<string name="1209">By the look of this brass dragon&apos;s scarred corpse it had recently laid a clutch of eggs; the fragments of shell still linger in the dragon&apos;s dead claws.</string>
<string name="1210">From the great claw wounds on this corpse it is obvious this fire giant was slain during a fearsome battle with a dragon.</string>
<string name="1211">This elf is a prisoner of the Fire Giants.</string>
<string name="1212">This woman is a prisoner of the Fire Giants.</string>
<string name="1213">East to Fire Giant Domain</string>
<string name="1214">The aura of true majesty one would expect in an adult blue dragon is undercut by the vapid, mindless expression on this beast&apos;s face. </string>
<string name="1215">Intruder! Destroy! Destroy!</string>
<string name="1216">Me got Word of Power number four right here!</string>
<string name="1217">I have the fourth Word of Power right here!</string>
<string name="1218">You move or me make sure you be one in jail!</string>
<string name="1219">Out of my way or you&apos;ll be the one rotting in a cell!</string>
<string name="1220">You&apos;re the one Nasher sent to check on the prisoner, ain&apos;t you? Go on in.</string>
<string name="1221">Now don&apos;t be gettin&apos; all upset now! I&apos;m just doin&apos; me job! You can&apos;t just waltz in here and... oh, wait a minute!</string>
<string name="1222">You&apos;re that &lt;man/woman&gt; Nasher sent to check on the prisoner, ain&apos;t you? Go on in.</string>
<string name="1223">The soldiers won&apos;t be able to hold the City Core much longer. Soon the enemy will break through and slaughter us all!</string>
<string name="1224">You&apos;re the hero who saved us from the Wailing Death! Have you come here to save the city one last time, or are you trapped here like the rest of us?</string>
<string name="1225">I used to admire Aribeth, but her betrayal has doomed us all! I hope she burns in the Nine Hells for what she&apos;s done!</string>
<string name="1226">Have you heard the stories about what the Luskan soldiers do to the civilians they capture? Maybe it would have been better if I had died from the plague!</string>
<string name="1227">Look at all the wounded in this place. I heard most of them fell trying to defend the southern section of the city.</string>
<string name="1228">I know you - you saved us from the Wailing Death! You gonna save us all from these Luskan invaders, too?</string>
<string name="1229">I used to look down on everyone who worked here, but maybe I was wrong. Ophala and her girls seem to bring some comfort to the dying soldiers, at least.</string>
<string name="1230">I never thought I&apos;d come to a place like this, but when the Luskanites burned my home I had nowhere else to go. And that young Tanith who works here sure is handsome...</string>
<string name="1231">The soldiers here are saying the Luskan army doesn&apos;t take prisoners. They&apos;ll kill us all if they breach the south gates!</string>
<string name="1232">Hey, I know you! You&apos;re that hero who saved us from the Wailing Death! Have you come to save the city, or are you trapped here with the rest of us? </string>
<string name="1233">I pray to Tyr every day for the sake of the soldiers who fall at the South Gate.</string>
<string name="1234">I barely escaped with my life when the Luskan army burned my home. I came here because I had nowhere else to go.</string>
<string name="1235">Impudent slave, you will die!</string>
<string name="1236">The soldiers won&apos;t be able to hold the city core much longer. Soon the enemy will break through and slaughter us all!</string>
<string name="1237">You&apos;re the hero who saved us from the Wailing Death! Have you come here to save the city one last time, or are you trapped here like the rest of us?</string>
<string name="1238">The soldiers who survived the fighting in the southern section of the city are saying the Luskanites don&apos;t take prisoners! They&apos;ll kill us all when they get here!</string>
<string name="1239">First the Wailing Death and now the Luskan invaders... it seems like Neverwinter is cursed!</string>
<string name="1240">Look at all the wounded in this place. Most of them fell trying to defend the southern districts of the city, or so I heard.</string>
<string name="1241">How come a hero like you is here at the Moonstone Mask instead of fighting the Luskan army in the southern section of the city?</string>
<string name="1242">Ophala and her girls are angels, I tell you. Beautiful angels who look after all the sick and dying in this place.</string>
<string name="1243">I figure the city is doomed, so I want to spend my last days here in the Moonstone Mask... I&apos;ve got a lot of happy memories from this place.</string>
<string name="1244">The soldiers here are saying the Luskan army doesn&apos;t take prisoners. They&apos;ll kill us all if they breach the south gates!</string>
<string name="1245">Hey, I know you! You&apos;re that hero who saved us from the Wailing Death! Have you come to save the city, or are you trapped here with the rest of us? </string>
<string name="1246">I thought this temple would be a good place to come when the Luskans burned my house, but maybe I should have gone to the Moonstone Mask. The girls there were always so kind to me.</string>
<string name="1247">This place is already too crowded, but Oleff won&apos;t turn anyone away. And now that the southern section of the city has fallen the refugees will just keep coming.</string>
<string name="1248">I wish I could help you, but I have to get back to the patients.</string>
<string name="1249">Please step back; the patients need their sleep.</string>
<string name="1250">Talk to the priest; I&apos;m busy right now, I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="1251">This man is bleeding; I can&apos;t help you, I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="1252">Half the soldiers in my platoon fell when the enemy breached the walls. Damn that traitor Aribeth - I hope when this is all over she pays for what she&apos;s done!</string>
<string name="1253">The entire south section of the city is overrun by the enemy. The city core is the last safe place in Neverwinter... for now.</string>
<string name="1254">Thank the gods you&apos;re here! Maybe you can save us from these Luskan invaders!</string>
<string name="1255">We&apos;re trying to keep civilians off the streets - but you can go wherever you want.</string>
<string name="1256">Those Luskan dogs are merciless. I hear they don&apos;t even take prisoners - if you try to surrender they just cut you down where you stand! </string>
<string name="1257">We&apos;re trapped here in the city core - there&apos;s no escape for any of us. Soon the enemy will break through the south gates and slaughter us all.</string>
<string name="1258">You may have saved us from the Wailing Death, but I don&apos;t think even you can defeat a whole army. This city is doomed.</string>
<string name="1259">We lost a lot of good men and women trying to hold the area south of the city core, but the invaders overwhelmed us. There were just too many of them!</string>
<string name="1260">Version 8.7</string>
<string name="1261">Those Luskan dogs are merciless. I hear they don&apos;t even take prisoners - if you try to surrender they just cut you down where you stand! </string>
<string name="1262">You&apos;re the hero who saved us from the Wailing Death! Have you come here to save the city one last time, or are you trapped here like the rest of us?</string>
<string name="1263">My wounds are bad, but at least I&apos;m still alive. That&apos;s more than most of my company can say.</string>
<string name="1264">Between the catapults and war golems we didn&apos;t stand a chance against the invaders. They took the south section of the city.</string>
<string name="1265">I am too busy to talk right now.</string>
<string name="1266">With the latest setbacks in the war to save the city, all hope seems to have drained from Aarin Gend&apos;s features. Yet blazing in his eyes is a grim determination to fight for Neverwinter to his dying breath.</string>
<string name="1267">The leader of the Word Slaves holds the wisdom of ten thousand years in her eyes - along with a terrible understanding of what will happen should Morag be reborn into the Realms.</string>
<string name="1268">The suffering of his city weighs heavily upon Lord Nasher, though his features are set in a grim determination to see this latest crisis through to the end... whatever the outcome.</string>
<string name="1269">Though more attuned to nature, it is obvious the suffering of the city weighs heavily upon the druid.</string>
<string name="1270">Luce shows no signs of moving from the small corner she is in.</string>
<string name="1271">The matron of the Moonstone Mask looks as though she has hardly slept in days.</string>
<string name="1272">The suffering of the wounded soldiers has been greatly alleved by the cheerful bedside manner of this attractive gnome.</string>
<string name="1273">The bloodstains on this handsome young man&apos;s clothes attest to his willingness to tend to the wounded with no regard for his appearance.</string>
<string name="1274">This man is one of the many soldiers still fighting to save Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="1275">This is one of the many brave Neverwinter soldiers who still stands against the Luskan horde.</string>
<string name="1276">There is a grace and fluidity in the movements of this elf that hint at her skill with a blade.</string>
<string name="1277">The grim expression on this half-orc storekeeper&apos;s face reveals that he knows all too well what will happen to the citizens of Neverwinter should the City Core fall.</string>
<string name="1278">Captain Aethelred</string>
<string name="1279">This man stands rigidly at attention, intent on fulfilling his guard duties until the gates to the City Core have fallen.</string>
<string name="1280">This little girl seems strangely out of place in this war ravaged city.</string>
<string name="1281">This old man is obviously blind.</string>
<string name="1282">The body of the man who unleashed the plague on Neverwinter has been ravaged by death and decay as the evil power he serves consumes him from within.</string>
<string name="1283">An insatiable lust for knowledge gives a twinkle to the eye of this aged archeologist, though beneath the gleam there is a hint of a dark and sinister shadow.</string>
<string name="1284">This young woman&apos;s eyes are quick and intelligent, though something is obviously troubling her.</string>
<string name="1285">The haughty arrogance with which this young gnome carries himself is obviously a false front hiding deep seated insecurities about his own worth.</string>
<string name="1286">Gedry has been your best friend and closest ally in your efforts to free the slaves from the tyranny of the Old Ones.</string>
<string name="1287">The Keeper of the Ravens has been a valuable ally to the slave underground, yet you cannot help but feel something is amiss when you look at him.</string>
<string name="1288">There is a cruel arrogance in this reptilian humanoid&apos;s bearing.</string>
<string name="1289">Though only a projection there is no denying the imperious cruelty of Morag, Queen of the Old Ones.</string>
<string name="1290">The Queen of the Old Ones embodies all the royal majesty, ancient power and evil cruelty of the Creator Race. </string>
<string name="1291">From his strictly rigid posture it is obvious this gnome takes his guard duties very seriously.</string>
<string name="1292">The representative of the guild of the Many Starred Cloak is doing her best to put on a brave front in the face of impending doom for the city she loves.</string>
<string name="1293">The cleric of Tyr does his best to keep his spirits up for the sake of those seeking refuge in his church.</string>
<string name="1294">This is one of the Luskan war wizards intent on destroying the city.</string>
<string name="1295">The evil shadow has lifted from Aribeth&apos;s face, though there is still sadness upon her features. However, for the first time since Fenthick&apos;s death there is a peaceful acceptance in her eyes.</string>
<string name="1296">Though dressed in clothing from a strange and unfamiliar land, the physical resemblance between this elven paladin and Aribeth is uncanny.</string>
<string name="1297">These elite guards are chosen from among the largest and strongest of the Creator Race.</string>
<string name="1298">This cleric of the Old Ones calls upon ancient evil Gods for its powers.</string>
<string name="1299">This cleric is in deep meditation, completely focused on maintaining one of the spells that shields Morag from harm.</string>
<string name="1300">The evokers of the Old Ones know dark secrets of the arcane.</string>
<string name="1301">This man is one of the invading Luskan soldiers.</string>
<string name="1302">This soldier is one of the Luskan invaders.</string>
<string name="1303">This woman is one of the many refugees fleeing the advancing Luskan horde.</string>

<string name="1317">Tansey</string>

<string name="1341">Key of Music</string>
<string name="1342">The surface of this key seems to shimmer and glow one moment, then become dull and dark the next.</string>
<string name="1343">Key of Light and Darkness</string>
<string name="1344">This key is unremarkable in design, yet each time you gaze upon it you get the distinct feeling you have seen it somewhere before.</string>
<string name="1345">Past Life Key</string>
<string name="1346">Adventurer&apos;s Diary</string>
<string name="1347">This appears to be a set of notes, written carefully:

The puzzle of light and dark haunts me; I know there&apos;s a key in here somewhere. But where? It is a strange labyrinth, and half the time I end up back where I began. 

I do know that carrying the torch is part of the light. But the light only goes so far; eventually, you have to enter the dark.</string>

<string name="1366">A Leader of the Slave Resistance</string>
<string name="1367">Part of you wants to flee this place, but you know to do so would be certain death, for that is the punishment of a slave caught in the streets breaking curfew.

Perhaps you are just nervous, as the Creator Race are growing ever closer to discovering this place - the headquarters of the slave reistance. Yet you know there is something more to these strange feelings.

Perhaps the notebook you always keep in your inventory can help make things more clear.</string>
<string name="1368">You have escaped the Past Life Trap by proving the world around you was not real, thereby dispelling the illusion.</string>
<string name="1369">The Final Battle</string>
<string name="1370">Led by Aribeth and Maugrim the Luskan forces have all but overrun Neverwinter. Even slaying the leaders might not be enough to turn the tide of battle at this point.

Aarin Gend feels Haedraline, the mysterious lizard creature now languishing in the dungeons of Castle Never, might know a way to save the city. 

Only she can reveal the secrets of the Words of Power and the recently discovered Source Stone, although there is hope that Master Ford - presently studying the Source Stone in the caverns beneath the dungeon of Castle Never - might have some information to share as well.</string>
<string name="1371">Haedraline has revealed that the fourth and final Word of Power is in the hands of Maugrim. The mad prophet plans to use its power to awaken Morag and the Old Ones from their hibernation within the Source Stone so they may once again enslave all of Faerun.

The only way to stop the Old Ones&apos; return is to find the fourth Word of Power and bring it to Haedraline before Queen Morag grows strong enough to awaken her people.

There is word that Maugrim is hiding out in the war zone south of the city, protected by the Luskan forces.</string>
<string name="1372">The fourth Word of Power has been recovered and brought to Haedraline... but perhaps it is already too late.

Morag&apos;s strength has grown too powerful, her return is inevitable. The only way to stop her now is to use the Words of Power to enter the Source Stone beneath Castle Never&apos;s dungeons and destroy Morag once and for all.</string>
<string name="1373">Somewhere in the extra-planar world within the Source Stone Morag prepares the rituals that will release her people from their 10,000 year imprisonment.

If she is not stopped before the ritual is complete the brutal Creator Race will once again conquer all of Faerun, and the world as it now exists will be utterly destroyed.</string>
<string name="1374">Morag has been destroyed. And with the Queen&apos;s death, the threat of the Old Ones return is no more. 

Without Morag&apos;s power to sustain them spirit of the Luskan horde is broken and the invaders are quickly routed by the newly inspired Neverwinter forces.</string>
<string name="1375">Aribeth&apos;s Fate</string>
<string name="1376">Aribeth&apos;s tragic tale of grief and betrayal is finally over. She has been united with Fenthick in death.

Perhaps now she has found the peace she could not in life.</string>
<string name="1377">Aribeth has abandoned Morag&apos;s cause and surrendered herself to Lord Nasher to accept judgment for her betrayal of the city. 

Once an instrument of vengeance and destruction, Aribeth seems to have found peace at last. 

She is now willing to accept whatever fate awaits her: execution, banishment... or perhaps even forgiveness and redemption.</string>
<string name="1378">Rescue Leesa</string>
<string name="1379">Luce, one of the working girls at the Moonstone Mask, is desperate for someone to find her little sister, Leesa.

The girl was last seen in the Luskan controlled area of the city.</string>
<string name="1380">Leesa has agreed to return to the Moonstone Mask, where she can be reunited with her sister Luce.</string>
<string name="1381">Leesa and Luce have been reunited in the relative safety of the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="1382">Leesa, the young sister of Luce at the Moonstone Mask, is dead - another casualty of this terrible war.</string>
<string name="1383">Neverwinter Under Siege</string>
<string name="1384">Between the catapult fire and the unstoppable war golems of the enemy, the soldiers of Neverwinter can do little to stop the Luskan advance.

If the catapults could be destroyed and the wizards controlling the war golems stopped then at least the brave defenders might have a faint hope of turning back the invaders.</string>
<string name="1385">The war golems are defeated, but the catapults continue to rain death down upon the heads of the Neverwinter soldiers.

Perhaps if the catapults could be destroyed the defenders might have some slim hope of saving the city.</string>
<string name="1386">The catapults have been destroyed, but the unstoppable war golems continue to wreak havoc in the streets. 

Perhaps if the wizards controlling the war golems could be found and slain the defenders might have some slim hope of saving the city.</string>
<string name="1387">With the catapults destroyed and the war golems vanquished the defenders of Neverwinter have been given some small hope of resisting the Luskan invasion. </string>
<string name="1388">This young woman&apos;s face is haggard and drawn from her constant tending to the needs of the wounded.</string>

<string name="1520">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="1521">Tell me about yourself, Olgerd.</string>
<string name="1522">I want to see what you have for sale.</string>
<string name="1523">Okay.</string>
<string name="1524">Welcome back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. So what can old Olgerd do for you? You want to take a peek inside my shop, or is there something else?</string>
<string name="1525">Of course you do, my simple minded friend.</string>
<string name="1526"></string>
<string name="1527"></string>
<string name="1528"></string>
<string name="1529"></string>
<string name="1530"></string>
<string name="1531"></string>
<string name="1532"></string>
<string name="1533"></string>
<string name="1534"></string>
<string name="1535"></string>
<string name="1536"></string>
<string name="1537"></string>
<string name="1538">As long as you&apos;re here at the Academy, feel free to come back and speak to me anytime you need to purchase more equipment.</string>
<string name="1539"></string>
<string name="1540"></string>
<string name="1541"></string>
<string name="1542"></string>
<string name="1543"></string>
<string name="1544"></string>
<string name="1545"></string>
<string name="1546"></string>
<string name="1547"></string>
<string name="1548"></string>
<string name="1549"></string>
<string name="1550"></string>
<string name="1551"></string>
<string name="1552"></string>
<string name="1553"></string>
<string name="1554"></string>
<string name="1555"></string>
<string name="1556">I&apos;ll do my best to answer your questions, though I don&apos;t know much. I haven&apos;t left the Academy since the plague hit.</string>
<string name="1557">All I know about that is the rumors going around the barracks. They say Khelben &quot;Blackstaff&quot; Arunsun, the famous mage, has discovered that a cure can be made using reagents gathered from rare and exotic beasts.</string>
<string name="1558">Supposedly these creatures have been brought from Waterdeep to the Academy for safekeeping. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s true, but why else would Lady Aribeth be here?</string>
<string name="1559">Surely you&apos;ve heard of Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, the Elven paladin of Tyr. Nasher Alagondar, Lord of Neverwinter, has appointed her to find a cure for the Wailing Death. </string>
<string name="1560">Officially she&apos;s here at the Academy to inspire and motivate the new recurits with the blessings of Tyr. But the whispered word is she&apos;s also here to keep an eye on those Waterdhavian creatures they hope to turn into a cure.</string>
<string name="1561">So would I. Her beauty is only surpassed by her ability and her devotion to Tyr, or so they say. She&apos;s young, but she&apos;s already a legend here in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="1562">Maybe when my shift is done I&apos;ll get a chance to go see her. She&apos;s giving out blessings in the south assembly chamber. It&apos;s just through these doors and down the hall.</string>
<string name="1563">Is there anything else you want to ask me?</string>
<string name="1564">A foul business, the Wailing Death. The bodies just keep piling up in the street and healers, clerics and priests are powerless to help. That&apos;s mighty suspicious if you ask me.</string>
<string name="1565">This ain&apos;t no natural plague, mark my words! The instructors here at the Academy don&apos;t like to talk about it, but I think somebody or something brought the Wailing Death upon us for some fell purpose.</string>
<string name="1566">I guess the authorities don&apos;t want to speculate about that, though. There&apos;s enough panic in the streets as it is. Or maybe they&apos;re just focusing on the cure before they start worrying about what was behind all this. </string>
<string name="1567">Huh? It&apos;s rare anyone asks about me. Not much to tell, really. As a young man I came to the Academy so I could join the Neverwinter militia and serve my city.</string>
<string name="1568">I served nearly a hundred and forty years, until my hair grew gray, my eyes grew dim and my back bent with age. But I had no family, no wife or kids, and I didn&apos;t want to retire.</string>
<string name="1569">So they were kind enough to give me this job here at the Academy, helping out you new recruits by giving you quality equipment at a reasonable price. So that&apos;s it, my life in a nutshell. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="1570">Certainly. As long as you&apos;re here at the Academy my store is at your service.</string>
<string name="1571">All stores are accessed through dialog. Just talk to a shopkeeper and tell him you want to see what he has for sale. This will bring up the store inventory menu on the left of the screen, and your own inventory will appear on the right.</string>
<string name="1572">Okay. To access your inventory, simply press &quot;i&quot; on your keyboard or left-click on the inventory icon below your portrait in the upper right corner of the screen. We&apos;ve highlighted the icon for you.</string>
<string name="1573">No. Me need you say that last stuff again.</string>
<string name="1574">No. Can you repeat that last part about the journal again?</string>
<string name="1575">Yes.</string>
<string name="1576">Go ahead and close your journal now. You can do this by hitting the &quot;J&quot; on your keyboard or by clicking the journal icon under your character portrait.</string>
<string name="1577">Now I&apos;m going to update your journal. Open your journal again. You&apos;ll see the &quot;Speaking to Berna&quot; entry has been moved. It&apos;s now in the Completed Quests section of your journal.</string>
<string name="1578">Notice that on the top of the journal are tabs for your quests, your completed quests and a section where you can make your own notes. As I already mentioned, the &quot;Speaking To Berna&quot; entry is now under the completed quests tab.</string>
<string name="1579">Click on the entry. Notice how it&apos;s changed to tell you the quest is now over. That&apos;s about it for the journal. Do you want me to go on to the map tutorial now?</string>
<string name="1580">I&apos;m Ferdinand, the Academy&apos;s resident Keeper of Exotic Creatures. I&apos;m in charge of the Menagerie here. We&apos;ve met before... but I guess you&apos;ve been busy with your training so you must have forgotten.</string>
<string name="1581">This Academy was founded with the purpose of training adventurers, so it only makes sense that we would collect strange and exotic monsters - the kind adventurers might encounter during their explorations.</string>
<string name="1582">Well, looks like you&apos;re ready to go and complete your training. Just head on through the door and you&apos;ll find Olgerd waiting for you.</string>
<string name="1583">Well, looks like you&apos;re ready to go and complete your training. Just head on through the door and you&apos;ll find Olgerd waiting for you.</string>
<string name="1584">You can right-click on any object or creature in the game, including yourself. This is VERY important to remember, as right-clicking will bring up a menu that lets you access most of your abilities and actions.</string>
<string name="1585">Try right-clicking on me to bring up the menu, then select the attack icon on the right of the menu to punch me. The attack icon is at the 3 o&apos;clock position on the menu.</string>

<string name="1589">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1590">Some got what it takes. Some don&apos;t got it.</string>
<string name="1591">Some people have what it takes, some don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="1592">You just got to stick with it.</string>
<string name="1593">You just have to stick with it, Pavel.</string>
<string name="1594">I need to speak to you.</string>
<string name="1595">I owe you my life, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Without you, I wouldn&apos;t have made it out of here. I... I could have died, just like my brother.</string>
<string name="1596">You&apos;ve got what it takes to be a great hero, &lt;FirstName&gt;, maybe even a legend. But this life isn&apos;t for me. I know that now.</string>
<string name="1597">Thank you once more for saving me. I know you&apos;ll be a great hero someday. But I don&apos;t want to risk my neck for fame and fortune.</string>
<string name="1598">I&apos;m no hero. I just want a nice, quiet life. I doubt our paths will cross again anytime soon. Goodbye, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and good luck.</string>
<string name="1599">Your words are truer than you know. Heroes are born, not made.</string>
<string name="1600">All I could think about in there was how afraid I was of dying. I wanted to curl up in a corner and just close my eyes to everything. Those aren&apos;t the thoughts of a hero.</string>
<string name="1601">I&apos;m no hero. I just want a nice, quiet life. I doubt our paths will cross again anytime soon. Goodbye and good luck.</string>
<string name="1602">Ahhhh! Monster! Kill it. I&apos;m too old for this sort of thing.</string>
<string name="1603">This goblin looks much tougher than those you have faced thus far.</string>

<string name="1639">Hmm... I recognize you. You are one of the new recruits under Aribeth, are you not? I&apos;m sorry, but this is the spellcasters&apos; guild. It will not interest you.</string>
<string name="1640">Hello, again. Are you back to continue on with our next round of challenges? Or did you have something else in mind?</string>
<string name="1641">Well, hello. I had heard there was a new magic adept in service to the city. The guild of the Many-Starred Cloak welcomes you.</string>
<string name="1642">Welcome to this rather temporary branch of the guild of the Many Starred Cloak. Rest assured that even here your membership cloak will grant you all the priveliges you have come to expect from our guild.</string>
<string name="1643"></string>
<string name="1644">Welcome to this rather temporary branch of the guild of the Many Starred Cloak. Normally the arcane knowledge of our guild is restricted to members, but Aarin Gend has asked me to forego that formality under these circumstances.</string>
<string name="1645">Greetings. Normally I don&apos;t deal with those who have no experience in the arcane arts, but Aarin Gend has asked me to make my inventory available to everyone if it will help the war effort.</string>
<string name="1646">I, Andar Heartfood of the Red Tiger tribe, greet you. Your name is well known among us, for it was you who stood forth to defend Rolgan at his trial. You bring honor to yourself and your ancestors.</string>
<string name="1647">You are not welcome among this tribe. You promised to defend Rolgan, yet he is dead. You have broken your vow, you have dishonored yourself and your ancestors!</string>
<string name="1648">You are a good person to defend Rolgan. I, Andar Heartfood of the Red Tiger tribe, greet you with honor.</string>
<string name="1649">Hail and well met. I will need to see your pass, if you would be so kind.</string>
<string name="1650">I wish ye good luck. Hopefully ye finds what ye&apos;re searching for.</string>
<string name="1651">Leave me be. We have nothing to talk about.</string>
<string name="1652">Eh? I suppose you&apos;re here to sign up, are ye? I&apos;ve no time for a new apprentice, however, so off ye go.</string>
<string name="1653">Aye? Something I can do for ye? Has ye business with the guild?</string>
<string name="1654">Tis good to see ye again. Have ye had any luck tracking down the bounties?</string>
<string name="1655">Hmm... do I know you? You wear the uniform, but I don&apos;t recognize your face. How long you been a Bloodsailor?</string>
<string name="1656">Greetings. Ye&apos;re one o&apos; the heroes Lady Aribeth brought here along with that other one I talked to, aye? Have ye had any luck with the bounties?</string>
<string name="1657">You&apos;re with that other one, aren&apos;t you? I tell you, that was one tough nut. Damndest thing I ever saw. Right, Christov?</string>
<string name="1658">You have heard my sorry tale, is that not enough?</string>
<string name="1659">Please forgive me, but I am in no mood to speak. I am sure others here will accomodate you.</string>
<string name="1660">I beg you to leave me be. I have nothing to say and nothing left to steal, I assure you.</string>
<string name="1661">Please leave me alone. I do not wish to speak and I have nothing left to steal, I assure you.</string>
<string name="1662">Welcome back. It&apos;s my pleasure, as always, to welcome you to Tyr&apos;s temple, now that things are as they belong in Port Llast.</string>
<string name="1663">Greetings - once more I must thank you for planting the Ultarg seed trees for me. Or is this the first time I am thanking you? No matter - I am grateful in any case.</string>
<string name="1664">How... how do things progress? Is Alhelor - the Black Wolf - dead? I don&apos;t think a single soul within Port Llast has stopped to take breath.</string>
<string name="1665">Back again, &lt;FirstName&gt;? You need to buy some equipment, or is there something else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="1666">Well, if it isn&apos;t Too Damn Stuck Up To Give Me Their Name! What do you need this time?</string>
<string name="1667">Hello there. Is there something the matter? Did you have something to ask of me?</string>
<string name="1668">Word has come to us that you have found the knight, Sir Karathis. Tell me, how did this meeting go? What have you learned?</string>
<string name="1669">As for you... you did your part. You freed me, and the reward is yours by right. Take this item and go.</string>
<string name="1670">I will not be questioned any further. I am sure you know more than enough... now destroy the brazier before I grow impatient.</string>
<string name="1671">Port Llast is seeing its mysteries resolved - the werewolf forms of Urth, Bran, and Geth are no longer. But still - there&apos;s no news on Karathis or the Black Wolf. Is there anything you know?</string>
<string name="1672">Mmmm... a rather delicious looking &lt;race&gt; man, is it? What a treat. Please don&apos;t tell me you&apos;re one of the fools toadying after Maugrim.</string>
<string name="1673">Greetings to you. I was just getting packed up in the hopes of leaving soon. How may I assist you?</string>
<string name="1674">You&apos;ve returned! You have been more successful, already, than we have right to hope for, but hope we do. Now, what word do you bring?</string>
<string name="1675">Back again, &lt;FullName&gt;? Is there something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="1676">I have not forgotten how you threatened me! I have told no one, but you shall receive no services from me!</string>
<string name="1677">Greetings, I am Master Ford, head archeologist of Neverwinter. Lord Nasher mentioned someone might be coming to investigate the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="1678">How do you do? Have you had any luck acquiring the gems? Or is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="1679">You are an evil person and you are not welcome here! Get out of my sight!</string>
<string name="1680">Greetings, to you. It is rare we see new faces come to drink with us at the Alliance Inn.</string>
<string name="1681">You were called upon to do your duty in administering the justice of Tyr&apos;s Court. The church is grateful you answered the call.</string>
<string name="1682">Ahh, you must be with that other person. Will you need me to repeat what they asked me about?</string>
<string name="1683">It&apos;s about time you showed up, recruit! My name is Herban - but as far as your worthless hide is concerned you can just call me Sir! </string>
<string name="1684">Oh! Greetings. It&apos;s me, Neurik. Remember? I was serving in Tyr&apos;s church in Port Llast until Aarin Gend asked me to come and oversee this temple here at Beorunna&apos;s Well.</string>
<string name="1685">Thank you. Thank you for bringing me back my little Leesa.</string>
<string name="1686">Greetings again. Nature welcomes you. I hope the day has held you in better health than those poor creatures in the Blacklake zoo.</string>
<string name="1687">Please, I beg of you, help my sister. Leesa&apos;s just a little girl.</string>
<string name="1688">Greetings. Are you with the person I spoke with previously? The fight against the zoo in the Blacklake could use whatever help is available. The animals suffer so.</string>
<string name="1689">I&apos;m sorry, but I can&apos;t speak with you right now. I have to keep an eye on my little sister.</string>
<string name="1690">Greetings to you again. It is good to see you return to this house of Tyr.</string>
<string name="1691">You training here is complete. You should proceed to the south assembly hall to receive blessings and congratulations from Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="1692">Greetings. Are you with the one I spoke to previously? I am curious as to how the search for Halueth Never&apos;s tomb is going.</string>
<string name="1693">I hope there is nothing amiss. I see you have not completed the trials of faith. Would you like me to describe the tests once more?</string>
<string name="1694">You have returned. Are you prepared to face the trials of faith? By completing them your training here at the Academy will be at an end.</string>
<string name="1695">Hail! You have provided a great service to all of Neverwinter in these trying times.</string>
<string name="1696">Greetings once more. I am surprised to see you back, although you are always welcome. How may I be of aid to you?</string>
<string name="1697">Please try to keep this conversation short. There are more dead and dying here than I could cure in a lifetime...</string>
<string name="1698">Greetings and well met. I am Elynwyd, faithful servant of Tyr and devotional leader here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="1699">Ahhh, h-hello there.</string>
<string name="1700">Ah... Greetings to you. You are... with the other person I spoke to, yes?
</string>
<string name="1701">Someone has had the Moonstone Mask shut sown. I would suggest you finish your business here and leave.</string>
<string name="1702">You training is done. You should go to the south assembly hall to receive a blessing and congratulations from Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="1703">Is something wrong? I see you haven&apos;t finished the Mage&apos;s Challenge. Do you need me to go over it one more time?</string>
<string name="1704">Greetings to you again. Have you come to sample the delights of our company in the backroom, or is this about... business?</string>
<string name="1705">Well, have you decided to take the Mage&apos;s Challenge? It&apos;s the final step in your training here at the Academy, after all.</string>
<string name="1706">Greetings. Are you with... What was the name...? They were the only other new person I&apos;ve spent much time with lately. Is this visit for pleasure or business?</string>
<string name="1707">Hey there, welcome to my little corner of the Academy. I&apos;m Jaroo, resident Master of the Arcane. It&apos;s more a ceremonial title than anything else. I&apos;m really just your run of the mill wizard.</string>
<string name="1708">Ah, I didn&apos;t expect you to come back. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="1709">My, oh my! I can&apos;t remember the last time I saw another one like me in these parts! So good to meet you! Come, now... I haven&apos;t my full selection available, but what wares I have will still dazzle you!</string>
<string name="1710">These are strange times. The beds in the Moonstone Mask being filled by wounded soldiers - who could have imagined?</string>
<string name="1711">Ah... er, hello there! Most of my finer items have already been stolen, but you&apos;re certainly welcome to try your hand at stealing what remains! That is... if you&apos;re here to steal at all.</string>
<string name="1712">Your face is a frightful mess! Those Luskanites really did a number on... Oh! I&apos;m so sorry, I thought you were one of the wounded.</string>
<string name="1713">Hello there. Come to get yourself some supplies from old Olger, have you? Good idea - can&apos;t have you wandering about the streets naked. Might give the Academy a bad name.</string>
<string name="1714">Welcome back. So what can old Olger do for you? You want to take a peek inside my shop, or is there something else?</string>
<string name="1715">Home! This town means everything to me! Thank you for saving me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will never do anything so foolish again!
</string>
<string name="1716">What are you doing back here? You&apos;re done, it&apos;s over, you made it! You better get down to the south assembly hall if you want to get that blessing from Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="1717">I&apos;m on the prowl. Stay out of the way.</string>
<string name="1718">I see you&apos;ve got the key on you. Well done! Let me be the first to congratulate you. Your work here at the Academy is all but done.</string>
<string name="1719">Back again? So, you ready to test your mettle against one of my challenges? If you can pull off this job you&apos;re finally free, and your sentence here at the Academy will be at an end.</string>
<string name="1720">Keep your hands where they belong.</string>
<string name="1721">Is there a problem? You having a little trouble with the challenge? You want me to go over it one more time? </string>
<string name="1722">I, Zokan Thunderer, thank you for saving my people from the Wailing Death. You are a hero to us.</string>
<string name="1723">Back again? Not sure what you need. You&apos;re no rogue, so there&apos;s not much I can teach you in that department. So what do you need?</string>
<string name="1724">Hi there. My name&apos;s Ketta - head of Security, Espionage and Intrigue here at the Academy. No need to tell me who you are - my sources are way ahead of you.</string>
<string name="1725">The plague that ravaged my people is no more. The people of the Elk Tribe owe our lives to the one who brought us the cure.</string>
<string name="1726">I bid you welcome once again.</string>
<string name="1727">I am Arwyl, leader of the dryads. I bid you welcome. Your kind is strange to us - we are used to seeing only the dwarves who attack us on sight.</string>
<string name="1728">I have prayed to the great oak for a savior! Are you to be it? Shall I be freed at last to rejoin my tree?</string>
<string name="1729">And I thank you. You are a true friend of the Uthgardt people, and the Red Tiger Tribe speaks your name with reverence.</string>
<string name="1730">Oh, please let this servant of the oak be free at last! Are you kind, or but another captor come to torment me?</string>
<string name="1731">You...have a fearsome countenance... have you come to free this servant of the oak? I beg you not to harm me!</string>
<string name="1732">You are a companion of the other one I spoke to, then? Yes, so it must be.</string>
<string name="1733">Oh, my! You don&apos;t strike me as the type to be one of Maugrim&apos;s followers. You&apos;re not, are you?</string>
<string name="1734">Welcome to my home. Is there something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="1735">Help! Attack! What? Who? Er... oh... um... you don&apos;t look like... nevermind. </string>
<string name="1736">Who are you? One of the city guard, I suppose. What do you say? Don&apos;t you think Meldanen should be forced to stop his hoarding and give up his stores?</string>
<string name="1737">Ah, yes...you are with that other person I spoke to, correct? I&apos;m glad that more could join on this quest.</string>
<string name="1738">So you&apos;re back, are you? Have you changed your mind? Will you help me get the key and end Meldanen&apos;s life?</string>
<string name="1739">So you have returned. Do you have news?</string>
<string name="1740">Not bad. But since you are a different class type than I&apos;m used to, you should be training elsewhere.</string>
<string name="1741">Once more you return to speak to me. I have given you the Word of Power - what more do you desire of Klauth?</string>
<string name="1742">Well, I was going to give you additional lessons on how to Level Up, but you have already managed just fion. I have nothing more I can teach you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1743">Why do you come to speak to me? You are too late to gain the Word of Power - I have already given it to another in exchange for the eggs of another dragon.</string>
<string name="1744">Greetings once more. I see you have not yet leveled up. You must do this before you can pass through the south door.</string>
<string name="1745">As director of the Academy let me offer you congratulations on completing your training.</string>
<string name="1746">So at last you have come. I assume my fire giant servants are dead. No matter, they are of little consequence to me. I can find other servants. Perhaps even you will serve.</string>
<string name="1747">Please... spare my life! I shall give you whatever you like...</string>
<string name="1748">Hey, this is the Commander&apos;s quarters! I don&apos;t want you enlisted men trapsing through... oh, sorry. I thought you were one of my soldiers.</string>
<string name="1749">I really must file my report with Lord Nasher. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="1750">So you return.</string>
<string name="1751">Hey, there. You&apos;re one of the students here at the Academy, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="1752">Back again? You want me to go over the tutorial on how to use your map and journal? </string>
<string name="1753"></string>
<string name="1754">You are not one of my slaves. It is strange for me to see one who does not cower and flee in terror at my presence. I find your courage... intriguing.</string>
<string name="1755">Welcome back. I hope your search for my missing snow globe is going better than my search for a decent glass of wine in this place. </string>
<string name="1756">Yes? Are you ready to enter the dungeon?</string>
<string name="1757">You hads your chance, fool! Now Ebrax shows you what&apos;s what! We calls Elminster. Ebrax says you better start running now!</string>
<string name="1758">Well, you must be the one Aribeth has told me of. I must say that I appreciate what you have done.</string>
<string name="1759">Yes, it is best that we commence with the ritual. Ready yourself, the plague ends with this.</string>
<string name="1760">Farewell. Once again, I am grateful for your service to Neverwinter. There are very few who could have done what you did.</string>
<string name="1761">Hello there to you. My name is Ballard. I am looking for someone interested in a dangerous mission. Might you be interested?</string>
<string name="1762">Thank you, but that will be handled by Aribeth, Fenthick, and Desther. The details of it need not concern you.</string>
<string name="1763">Vengaul? Yes, I had reports of his activity in the Docks. We used to clash during my adventuring youth but... things have changed.</string>
<string name="1764">Well met. Have you had any progress? Have you found Neva yet?</string>
<string name="1765">I&apos;ve had some association with the scoundrel, but this is not the time to discuss it. The plague is not his style. He would be disgusted by it.</string>
<string name="1766">Hello, are you with that other one I spoke to?</string>
<string name="1767">Greetings. I can spare a moment, but I don&apos;t have much to say. You should speak with everyone else so we can begin the ceremony.</string>
<string name="1768">You must bring Desther to justice. We must find him and demand his explanation! Fenthick&apos;s as well!</string>
<string name="1769">Neverwinter is a fair city, but tragedy like this can change much. The citizens will demand justice. They will want the head of their enemy on a pike. </string>
<string name="1770">What&apos;s this? I was expecting Aribeth, not some wet behind the ears whelp!
</string>
<string name="1771">These are strange times. My city is in ruins and all but overrun by Luskan forces, and yet Aribeth, the leader of our enemy, sits in our dungeons awaiting my judgment.</string>
<string name="1772">Were things not so grim I might laught at the absurdity of it all. **sigh** What is it you need of me?</string>
<string name="1773">Well met. Have you had any progress? Have you found Neva yet?
</string>
<string name="1774">I&apos;m sorry, I assumed you would have heard the news by now. Aribeth has surrendered herself to us - she seeks atonement for her crimes against Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="1775">We meet again. As you know, I am Nasher Alagondar, Lord of Neverwinter. I was once an adventurer like you - though that was long ago.</string>
<string name="1776">Enough, Aarin. Now, if you want to speak to Haedraline you are free to do so. But I will not release her from the dungeon while an enemy is within our city gates.</string>
<string name="1777">After all you have done for the city, the least I can do is answer your questons, although Gend probably knows more than I do.</string>
<string name="1778">I&apos;m sorry, but I won&apos;t do that. Not while there&apos;s an enemy inside the city. She might be an ally, but it&apos;s just as likely she&apos;s a spy.</string>
<string name="1779">Hello, are you with that other person I spoke to?
</string>
<string name="1780">That is what I tell myself over and over, but the words are hollow to my own ears.</string>
<string name="1781">And so she shall have it, &lt;FirstName&gt; - but now is not the time. We are fighting a war, and Aribeth can give us much information about our enemy.</string>
<string name="1782">Hello there. I&apos;d warn you to be careful of danger near these roads. You look like you can handle yourself but better safe than sorry. Listen to old Gerrol, then and watch out.
</string>
<string name="1783">Rest assured, justice will be served when the time comes. Is that all?</string>
<string name="1784">Aribeth&apos;s crimes cannot simply be forgiven with a wave of the hand, and yet... there is truth in your words.</string>
<string name="1785">Hello there. You best be careful treadin&apos; the road &apos;round these parts. A dangerous place, these days. Listen to old Gerrol.
</string>
<string name="1786">I fear it is too late for that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Fenthick is dead and Aribeth... Perhaps if I were given the chance to pass judgment again I would act differently. More mercifully. </string>
<string name="1787">Welcome again. I will always be grateful to you for your aid in the difficult matter of the Elk tribe.
</string>
<string name="1788">I understand you have an interest in her fate, and I see you will not be satisfied until I answer your question.</string>
<string name="1789">I... I do not wish to discuss this anymore. Aribeth&apos;s fate is not ours to decide, and I have no time for philosophical debates. Is there more I can do for you?</string>
<string name="1790">Once I was an adventurer like you... Were the situation not so desperate I would call upon the court bards to sing you tales of my exploits. </string>
<string name="1791">I am Fenthick Moss, priest of Tyr and companion of the Lady Aribeth. You must be the student Aribeth told me about.
</string>
<string name="1792">I miss those days of glory and heroism, but I gave them up to serve the city I love. Alas, my sacrifice was all in vain. Neverwinter will fall and I can do nothing about it.</string>
<string name="1793">You were quick to answer the summons. Allow me to be the first to welcome you to the Halls of Justice.
</string>
<string name="1794">Of course, of course. But before you go... maybe Gend is right. Maybe you should go speak to this Haedraline creature.</string>
<string name="1795"></string>
<string name="1796">Come and go as you please. You&apos;ve earned that right. Perhaps if Neverwinter had more people like you things wouldn&apos;t look so bleak. </string>
<string name="1797">Greetings. I must congratulate you on capturing the first Waterdhavian creature.
</string>
<string name="1798">You should quit wasting Gend&apos;s time. Go speak with Haedraline if you think the Word is any use.</string>
<string name="1799">You must be with that other person I talked to. Do you need a recap of what I told them, or have you something to report?</string>
<string name="1800">Have you heard? The first of the Waterdhavian creatures has been recovered by another recruit.
</string>
<string name="1801">Spare me your sarcasm! **hiss** You are as big a fool as Maugrim!</string>
<string name="1802">Thanks to you we have now recovered two of the Waterdhavian creatures, and are halfway to a cure for the Wailing Death!
</string>
<string name="1803">There is only one name that mattersss to me among your kind - Maugrim. **hiss** Tell me - do you serve Maugrim?</string>
<string name="1804">I have good news to report! The second Waterdhavian creature has been recovered by another recruit. We are halfway to a cure!
</string>
<string name="1805">I see you speak the truth. This is good.</string>
<string name="1806">Your lies are known to me! **hiss** I sense that you seek Maugrim&apos;s defeat! This is good.</string>
<string name="1807">Well done. I heard you found the third of the creatures from Waterdeep. A cure is all but within our grasp now!
</string>
<string name="1808">Foolish one! **hiss** You cannot slay a projection!</string>
<string name="1809">The fourth Word was recovered by another like yourself from Maugrim. **hiss** All four are necessary to enter the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="1810">Well met. Have you heard? The third Waterdhavian creature has been found. A cure is all but in our hand!
</string>
<string name="1811">If this is your choice, then I can do nothing. But it is a foolish choice. **hiss** Speak to me again if you come to your senses.</string>
<string name="1812">Hello again, and well met as always. Is there something I may do for you?
</string>
<string name="1813">**hiss** I have been waiting for you. These other warm bloods are weak. **hiss** I do not trust them.</string>
<string name="1814">You must hurry. **hiss** With each passing hour Morag&apos;s power grows. Soon I will not be strong enough to stop my Queen from awakening her people. </string>
<string name="1815">You must trust me. **hiss** If not, Morag will awaken the Old Ones and Neverwinter will be destroyed.</string>
<string name="1816">We hears you is wise for your kind, so accept offers of surrender from goblin, yes? You comes to talk with us, works out deal, maybe?
</string>
<string name="1817">Your kind are ever curious. A curse of your warm blood, perhaps. **hiss** Our time grows short, but I will answer your questions.</string>
<string name="1818">Chief of goblin sees you. What you want now? You gots news for us?
</string>
<string name="1819">The other warm bloods are weak in spirit and will - I do not trust them. **hiss** If you come to your senses, come and speak to me again. **hiss** Only you can stop Morag.</string>
<string name="1820">Most pleased to see you, we are. You make goblin king of caves, you have! We not fights no more with bugbears and orcs!
</string>
<string name="1821">You have returned. You must listen to my words if Morag&apos;s rebirth is to be stopped.</string>
<string name="1822">You are back. **hiss** But I do not feel the presence of the final Word of Power. </string>
<string name="1823">I sense you have the Word of Power. **hiss** But you have come too late - Morag has grown too strong.</string>
<string name="1824">I am only a Word Slave, I can do nothing against the growing power of my Queen. **hiss** But where I have failed, you may yet succeed.</string>
<string name="1825">Fool! **hiss** Morag&apos;s return means slavery and torments for me beyond any you can imagine. This is no betrayal on my part. </string>

</string>
<string name="1955">Hello! I had hoped that you would show up here, my friend. I heard that Aribeth recruited you to stamp out the evil cult that was responsible for the plague.
</string>
<string name="1956">Greetings and well met. I know you, don&apos;t I? You saved the city of Neverwinter. I heard the tales of your deeds as they were sung by a bard. It&apos;s wonderful to meet you in person.
</string>
<string name="1957">Hello again. I do hope you remember me. I&apos;m Linu La&apos;neral, cleric of Sehanine Moonblade.
</string>
<string name="1958">My dear friend. It warms my heart to see your face again. Aarin Gend must have brought you here to help search for the Words of Power.
</string>
<string name="1959">Hello there. The bards sing of your exploits in the taverns these days. It&apos;s a thrill to finally meet you.
</string>
<string name="1960">I see we meet again. Would you be looking for a powerful healer? I would gladly join in the search for the Words of Power.
</string>
<string name="1961">I can still feel my death, hanging on me, cold and eerie. I am glad to be back in this mortal realm again. Now that I know how it feels, I will struggle even harder to keep you from that fate. May I join you again?
</string>
<string name="1962">Yes? Is there something you need?
</string>
<string name="1963">So we meet again. The others had told me Aribeth had recruited you to find the cultists... I can&apos;t say I&apos;m surprised. You&apos;ve acquired quite the reputation for yourself, haven&apos;t you?
</string>
<string name="1964">Well, well, well... you must be the one I&apos;ve heard of, correct? The legendary savior of Neverwinter? I&apos;ve heard a couple of ballads written about you, already.
</string>
<string name="1965">Hello again. I trust you remember me, yes? The bard, Sharwyn?
</string>
<string name="1966">Hah! Somehow I knew you couldn&apos;t be far. As soon as Aarin Gend mentioned why we were brought here, I began wondering when you would pop up.
</string>
<string name="1967">Greetings. You&apos;re the hero, correct? I&apos;ve heard much about you. Savior of Neverwinter, hero who routed the cult... all of that, if it&apos;s true. Is it true?
</string>
<string name="1968">Hello again. Have you need of my skills? I&apos;d rather not stand around this place any longer than I must.
</string>
<string name="1969">Greetings. I see you are not yet infected by the plague that ravages Neverwinter. Among such suffering and misery, we who are not yet afflicted must be grateful for our health.
</string>
<string name="1970">I see you have returned. What brings you back to the Trade of Blades?
</string>
<string name="1971">It is a pleasure to see you again, though not altogether unexpected. I had heard that Aribeth recruited you to stamp out the foul cult that was responsible for the plague.
</string>
<string name="1972">Greetings and well met. You are the one I heard of, aren&apos;t you? The one responsible for saving the city of Neverwinter. Your deeds have become something of a legend.
</string>
<string name="1973">Greetings once more. It is I, Daelan Red Tiger, warrior of the Uthgardt Red Tiger tribe. Remember?
</string>
<string name="1974">Greetings and well met. It is good to look upon you once more. No doubt Aarin Gend has brought you here to aid in the search for the Words of Power.
</string>
<string name="1975">I bid you welcome. I have heard many tales of your exploits in Neverwinter and Luskan. You are truly a person of great honor.
</string>
<string name="1976">I bid you welcome once more. Have you need of a skilled warrior? I am eager to join in the search for the Words of Power.
</string>
<string name="1977">I found passing from this world unsettling - as was my return to life. Yet I sense there has been no permanent harm done. Do you need me to join you once more?
</string>
<string name="1978">The Frozen North: the name given to the stark and unforgiving frontier that lies beyond the High Moor of Faerun... A bleak wilderness where barbarian clans and tribes of giants roam the land and fierce dragons rule the skies. 
</string>
<string name="1979">But amidst the frozen savagery stands a bastion of civilization: the city of Neverwinter, jewel of the North. 
</string>
<string name="1980">Behind the city&#8217;s high walls those both hardy and brave carve out an existence from this bleak land under the guidance and protection of the legendary hero Lord Nasher Alagondar... Yet there are some things that all the courage in the world cannot stand against.
</string>
<string name="1981">A virulent plague swept the city, a terrible affliction that began in the Beggar&#8217;s Nest. Soon all of Neverwinter would feel the touch of the Wailing Death.
</string>
<string name="1982">The disease could not be cured. Panic ensued; the streets erupted into violence. The Jewel of the North was brought to its knees.
</string>
<string name="1983">To save Never Winter, Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, Paladin of Tyr and Lord Nasher&#8217;s right hand, put forth a call for a champion.
</string>
<string name="1984">A rush of would-be heroes answered her call: some drawn by promises of grandeur and glory, others by the lure of gold.
</string>
<string name="1985">Why, hullo there! You have the smell of a prospective employer about you. Not that it&apos;s easy to smell anything with all the burning corpses in this city, mind you. Never seen this many flies outside of a Calimshite alehouse.
</string>
<string name="1986">So you&apos;ve come back! Looking for a short lad to tickle your feet? Or did ya change your mind about needing a rogue at your side?
</string>
<string name="1987">Well, now, if it isn&apos;t you! Glad I am to see you! Isn&apos;t the country wonderful this time of year? So much better than the city with all that... umm... burning and dying. You know.
</string>
<string name="1988">Those with the greatest potential were initiated into the Academy to train and study under the greatest minds of Neverwinter, all in the hopes a champion might emerge to save the city from the Wailing Death... and whatever sinister force might be behind it. 
</string>
<string name="1989">In one brutal attack the promise of those at the Academy had been all but snuffed out. Hope disappeared with the Waterdhavian creatures, and the weight of the terrible sickness pressed down on the city once more.
</string>
<string name="1990">Even more chilling, the whispered rumors of enemies seeking to destroy Neverwinter from within had proved true, but the identity of those responsible for the slaughter was as yet unknown. 
</string>
<string name="1991">Still, a flicker of hope yet remained. From the bloody carnage at the Academy a survivor had stepped forward, a champion to carry the torch in this darkest hour...
</string>
<string name="1992">Desther&#8217;s punishment was brutal, but his death brought little satisfaction. The horrors of the Wailing Death could not be undone with his execution. Those that had suffered now turned on each other.
</string>
<string name="1993">They looked for someone to blame, and found it in Desther&#8217;s closest friend &#8211; Fenthick. The letter of the law found him negligent and he was hanged as a sacrifice to appease the bloodthirsty mob.
</string>
<string name="1994">If any thought the sentence unjust, they remained silent. Duty required all to act as one-- it was not the time for divided loyalties. The cult behind Desther&#8217;s treachery still had to be found.
</string>
<string name="1995">The hunt led to the city of Port Llast on the shore of the Sea of Swords. From this coastal town the heroes of Neverwinter would continue the search for those behind the Wailing Death... and vengeance would be taken.
</string>
<string name="1996">The hunt led to the coastal town of Port Llast. From here the heroes of Neverwinter would continue the search for those behind the Wailing Death... and vengeance would be taken.
</string>
<string name="1997">Within the Host Tower of the Arcane the enemy was finally revealed: Maugrim Korothir; madman, prophet, the one responsible for the Wailing Death. And with this revelation, a second betrayal...
</string>
<string name="1998">Aribeth, driven mad by her lover&#8217;s execution, sought vengeance by joining Maugrim&#8217;s cause. Together they roused a fearsome army and prepared to descend upon Neverwinter. 
</string>
<string name="1999">But an even greater evil threatened the city: the Words of Power, remnants of ancient magic long forgotten, were being sought by Maugrim&#8217;s followers to bring devastation to the North.
</string>
<string name="2000">Neverwinter&#8217;s champions were sent to the northern wastes of the Uthgardt tribes to unearth these lost artifacts. For if Maugrim were to find the Words of Power first, the city of the North would surely fall.
</string>
<string name="2001">The Words of Power, the tools of a Creator race; Haedraline spoke of them as though they could shape worlds, and perhaps they had. With these in hand, victory would not be far behind... or so it was thought.
</string>
<string name="2002">While Aarin Gend searched for the ancient relics, Maugrim&#8217;s army pressed their attacks against Neverwinter. Their dark magics and sheer numbers soon overwhelmed the defenders. 
</string>
<string name="2003">The betrayer -Aribeth- was at the forefront when the walls were breached. The Words of Power, once thought safe within Castle Never, were in danger of falling to the enemy.
</string>
<string name="2004">And behind the invasion an even greater evil: Morag, Queen of the Old Ones had awoken.
</string>
<string name="2005">In the end... victory. Without Morag, the Source Stone crumbled, and the great empire of the Old Ones was finally laid to rest.
</string>
<string name="2006">The deaths of these ancients could be felt throughout Neverwinter. Deprived of Morag&#8217;s influence, the invading army faltered. The siege was soon turned.
</string>
<string name="2007">The toll of the battle had been high, but Neverwinter would not be consumed by grief or regret. Too many had already made that mistake. The city would rebuild and move forward.
</string>
<string name="2008">And what of the honored champion who had fought so hard while others fell? Their story does not end here. For this is a world of infinite tales...
</string>
<string name="2009">New Adventures still await and new Legends are yet to be forged.
</string>
<string name="2010">Hullo there! Wow... the savior of Neverwinter! Would you sign my napkin? It&apos;s a bit greasy... and mind the chicken...
</string>
<string name="2011">Heya! Decided to wander back to Tomi Undergallows once again, did ya?
</string>
<string name="2012">Nice to see ya again. That cheerful Gend fellow brought you here, too, huh? Looking for some Words of Power or sommat?
</string>
<string name="2013">Heya. You&apos;re that champion, ain&apos;t ya? Mister Gend told me you&apos;re some kind of hero, the savior of Neverwinter or sommat.
</string>
<string name="2014">Hullo again. Decided you gots need for a sneak-thief to accompany you now, huh?
</string>
<string name="2015">It was so strange, ya know... there was this bright tunnel, and my mother was there... and then it was like &apos;yoink! Not yet, stupid!&apos; and I was back here. Weird, huh? So do ya need my help again?
</string>
<string name="2016">I figured they&apos;d drag your carcass back here eventually. You need me to come with ya again?
</string>
<string name="2017">You are back. The blood from those slaughtered at the Academy may be washed away, but I still recognize the mark of Death upon you.
</string>
<string name="2018">Sound</string>
<string name="2019">Door</string>
<string name="2020">Store</string>
<string name="2021">We meet again. I taste a storm of slaughter on the air; I&apos;m not surprised to find you here at the center of the whirlwind.
</string>
<string name="2022">I know you. You are the one who emerged from the corpse clogged streets of Neverwinter to save the city from the horrors of the Wailing Death.
</string>
<string name="2023">We meet again. It is I, Grimgnaw of the Order of the Long Death. Surely you must remember me.
</string>
<string name="2024">The fires of war are burning on horizon. Why am I not surprised to see you here to forge your blood drenched legacy in the furnace of slaughter?
</string>
<string name="2025">I know you. I know of your deeds. I know how many thousands of people hail you as a hero - and I know how many more have died screaming at your feet.
</string>
<string name="2026">You have returned. Are you looking to join with a servant of the Long Death?
</string>
<string name="2027">To be torn from the embrace of the Silent Lord is... unsettling. Yet my time to bow down before him for all eternity is not yet here. Do you need me to join you once more.
</string>
<string name="2028">Is there something you need?
</string>
<string name="2029">Hello there. You don&apos;t have the look of one of those Neverwinter soldiers about you, neither do you show any evidence of having contracted the plague.
</string>
<string name="2030">You are back. That would lead me to conclude that you require some assistance from me. How can I be of service to you?
</string>
<string name="2031">Good to see you again, though in actual fact I cannot say I am really surprised.
</string>
<string name="2032">Greetings to you. Forgive me for being so bold, but you are the one being called the Champion of Neverwinter, aren&apos;t you?
</string>
<string name="2033">Well met. It is I, Boddyknock Glinckle from the island of Lantan. I trust you remember me from our last meeting.
</string>
<string name="2034">Hello, it is I, Boddyknock Glinckle. It is good to see a friendly face in these unfamiliar surroundings.
</string>
<string name="2035">Greetings to you. Forgive me for being so bold, but you are the one being called the Champion of Neverwinter, aren&apos;t you?
</string>
<string name="2036">You&apos;re back. Obviously there must be something you need. Dare I speculate and suggest you are seeking aid in recovering those Words of Power for Aarin Gend?
</string>
<string name="2037">Yes? Is there something you need?
</string>
<string name="2038">Thank the Gods you&apos;re here. I thought those goblins were going to be the death of me!
</string>
<string name="2039">Okay then. You&apos;ve had a chance to try all three camera modes now. You can choose between them by selecting &quot;Controls&quot; from the &quot;Options&quot; menu.
</string>
<string name="2040">I saw you talking to my brother, Pavel. My name is Bim. If you want, I can give you a short tutorial on adventuring.
</string>
<string name="2041">Hello again. I&apos;m surprised you&apos;re still here - I thought you&apos;d be anxious to go see Olgerd in the next room so you can finish your training.
</string>
<string name="2042">I&apos;m no hero. I just want a nice, quiet life. I doubt our paths will cross again anytime soon. Goodbye and good luck.
</string>
<string name="2043">This fine powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A creature touched by the dust becomes invisible.  Dust of appearance reveals people made invisible by dust of disappearance.  Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection.</string>
<string name="2044">You are powerful, for a slave. You have slain Maugrim, the prophet who heralded my coming.
</string>
<string name="2045">I see Morag was right - Aribeth was not strong enough to defeat you, but she has served her purpose.
</string>
<string name="2046">This is a mistake, Fenthick. We know nothing about this whelp! How can you so blindly trust them?
</string>
<string name="2047">I can spare no time for your idle chatter. I must coordinate the search of my Helmites as they try to recover the missing Waterdhavian creatures - thanks to Aribeth!
</string>
<string name="2048">The results of her actions are plain for all to see, yet even now she would rather trust a whelp such as you than rely on my Helmites!
</string>
<string name="2049">You should spend your time more productively. Instead of speaking with me you should be out looking for the missing Waterdhavian creatures.
</string>
<string name="2050">I suspect my Helmite brethren will prove far more useful in this task than a mere hireling. But who am I to defy the desires of Lady Aribeth?
</string>
<string name="2051">Well, hello. I imagine you are well pleased with yourself? This is your doing, after all.
</string>
<string name="2052">Nasher will want me alive, fool. Speak to me so we may settle out business, and then you can deliver me to the old man like a good little servant.
</string>
<string name="2053"></string>
<string name="2054">(sigh) As you wish, my friend...though I&apos;ll not be held responsible should you nod off during the telling of it.
</string>
<string name="2055">Let me see... perhaps it is best if I ask you a question, first. You are a person of nature and the wild, are you not?
</string>
<string name="2056">I am not proud of what I did. It is very easy to say that the man deserved it. Deserved it more than my mother did, at the very least.
</string>
<string name="2057">And thank you for listening. As I said, it is not a tale I tell often.
</string>
<string name="2058">Let me see... perhaps it is best if I ask you a question, first. You are a person of your god, are you not?
</string>
<string name="2059">Let me see...perhaps it is best if I ask you a question, first. You are a person possessed of wondrous magics, are you not?
</string>
<string name="2060">Let me see... perhaps it is best if I ask you a question, first. You are a person of great fighting prowess, are you not?
</string>
<string name="2061">Let me see... perhaps it is best if I ask you a question, first. You are a person of great skill, are you not?
</string>
<string name="2062">No, I do not think so, my friend. You have far more important things to focus on other than I. Ask me another time, perhaps.
</string>
<string name="2063">I am no longer in the mood for tales. It is enough for you to know that I came to serve Lord Nasher after that.
</string>
<string name="2064">Randall was no true friend. He made use of me, and I had needed him. It was a choice I had to make, and it was no easy one.
</string>
<string name="2065">I am not here to amuse you, nor are you here to amuse me. Ask me of something other than myself.
</string>
<string name="2066">(sigh) I suppose one cannot leave the story unfinished. As you wish, then, my friend.
</string>
<string name="2067">Thank you. I have...never told another that tale.
</string>
<string name="2068">You do not have the proficiencies required to equip that item.</string>
<string name="2069">Perhaps in time we might get to know one another better. As...as good friends. Would you...would you care at all for that?
</string>
<string name="2070">There are few that I would call friend. I would be pleased to name you amongst them.
</string>
<string name="2071">No, I...have no desire to speak of her. It is no fault of yours. Perhaps another time.
</string>
<string name="2072">You are too small to equip that item.</string>
<string name="2073">I appreciate your kindness. Perhaps another time I will be more willing to speak of it.
</string>
<string name="2074">Do I seem uncomfortable to your eyes? I shall amend my stance, then, for I do not wish you to feel ill at ease.
</string>
<string name="2075">Weapon equipped as a one-handed weapon.</string>
<string name="2076">Weapon equipped as a two-handed weapon.</string>
<string name="2077">Take this. It was given to me by my mother long ago, so that she knew I would always find my way out of the shadows. Take it and be reminded that there is one who prays for your safe return.
</string>
<string name="2078">Then say nothing. Take it in the spirit with which it is meant.
</string>
<string name="2079">Equipped item swapped out.</string>
<string name="2080">Now you make fun of me. So be it, I shall speak plainly.
</string>
<string name="2081">Aye? What would you have of me?
</string>
<string name="2082">I...would not normally speak of this, but I am told that you and the lady paladin have formed a bond of friendship.
</string>
<string name="2083">I had full confidence in your ability to do so. Bring the information to Aribeth quickly...she will be eager to see it.
</string>
<string name="2084">I shall await your return, then. Be safe, and godspeed.
</string>
<string name="2085">So impatient to get on with business? You are obviously a in need of action and are courage. Only one such person is needed to change the world.
</string>
<string name="2086">I must admit, I was glad when Lord Nasher informed me you would be coming on this mission as well. The thought of being apart from you was... unpleasant.
</string>
<string name="2087">Neverwinter has need of me - and of you. We must all do our part if this latest threat to the city is to be thwarted.
</string>
<string name="2088">Neverwinter has need of all her allies now - whether they serve for honor, duty or gold.
</string>
<string name="2089">But Aribeth and the Luskan army are best left to the generals in the field. You have a much more important mission.
</string>
<string name="2090">It has not been easy to gather information on Maugrim&apos;s cult - but we know they are frantically searching for the ancient artifacts known as the Words of Power.
</string>
<string name="2091">You must find these ancient Words before Maugrim does. If you do not, then I fear any victory by the Lords&apos; Alliance will prove meaningless.
</string>
<string name="2092">I wish I had more guidance for you. Perhaps you can learn mroe from Lillian Cambridge, an expert on ancient artifacts who claims to have some knowledge of the Words of Power.
</string>
<string name="2093">I know this may seem an impossible task, but I can think of no other person I would rather have undertaking this mission than you.
</string>
<string name="2094">Good luck, and be careful. I would hate to lose you.
</string>
<string name="2095">I wish you luck in your mission. The very survival of Neverwinter may depend on it.
</string>
<string name="2096">Of course. I shall get right to the point.
</string>
<string name="2097">It is a pleasure to see you again, as always. It is unfortunate we cannot spend more time together.
</string>
<string name="2098">Is there anything I can do for you? Uh... to help you in your quest, I mean.
</string>
<string name="2099">You are back. Have you something to report?
</string>
<string name="2100">You are truly a remarkable woman, though I knew this already. On behalf of Lord Nasher and Neverwinter, please accept this reward of 3000 gold pieces.
</string>
<string name="2101">Neverwinter could use more people like you. I am honored to offer you this reward of 3000 gold pieces in exchange for the Word of Power.
</string>
<string name="2102">If my sources are correct, there are still several more Words of Power yet to be found. I hope your success at locating the Words continues.
</string>
<string name="2103">This must be that Haedraline you mentioned. I will need to consider this new information carefully. But this is not your concern. You must focus on finding the Words.
</string>
<string name="2104">I wish you luck in your mission. Return to me once you have another of the Words.
</string>
<string name="2105">I thought I knew you. I see now you are not the woman I thought you were. Very well.
</string>
<string name="2106">Your point is well taken - and you surely know I could never refuse a woman such as you.
</string>
<string name="2107">I think I take the real meaning behind your words. The Lord&apos;s Alliance has given me an emergency fund to be spent in the defense of Neverwinter.
</string>
<string name="2108">Times are difficult - I know this better than anyone. But the resources given me by the Lord&apos;s Alliance cannot be squandered recklessly.
</string>
<string name="2109">No doubt you are here to aid us in our mission. I have already given out the information my reconnaisance operatives have acquired. 
</string>
<string name="2110">The city of Neverwinter is forever in your debt for recovering the first Word of Power. We hope you will have continued success on your mission to thwart Maugrim and his followers.
</string>
<string name="2111">I... I&apos;m sorry. I wanted you to have the amulet. It was special to me - as are you. But after I gave it to you, I didn&apos;t know what to do next. 
</string>
<string name="2112">And even my relationship with Calli began as part of my service to Neverwinter. You are different. I... I want to be with you.
</string>
<string name="2113">I suppose you are right. I do not want to throw away what we share.
</string>
<string name="2114">Promise me... promise me that we will be there for each other, no matter what happens. Promise me we will see this challenge through to the end.
</string>
<string name="2115">If it were possible, I would go with you on your journeys. But my skills are in information and analyzing reconnaisance. I am needed here.
</string>
<string name="2116">But even though I cannot go with you in your quest for the Words, know that whatever trials you face my spirit is by your side.
Strref: 43096</string>
<string name="2117">I&apos;m sorry, I had no right to make such a demand of you. I suppose all we can do is wait and see what fate will bring us.
</string>
<string name="2118">You&apos;re right, I guess I am so used to being alone, to relying on myself, that I have forgotten how to ask for help.
</string>
<string name="2119">The Lords&apos; Alliance is grateful to those who provide a shining example in these dark times, and Neverwinter is generous to her champions. I have been authorized to grant a reward of 3500 gold pieces to you for this task.
</string>
<string name="2120">You have done well. The Lords&apos; Alliance and Neverwinter are grateful for your efforts, and on their behalf I would like to give you this reward of 3000 gold coins.
</string>
<string name="2121">Despite my initial unfavorable impressions of you, you have proven yourself worthy of my respect. Allow me to express the gratitude of Neverwinter by giving you a reward of 2500 gold pieces.
</string>
<string name="2122">How can I say no to one as beautiful and talented as you? And you do have a good point.
</string>
<string name="2123">I suppose you have a point. If we expect you to succeed in recovering the remaining Words of Power it might be a good idea to equip you for the mission.
</string>
<string name="2124">I wish I had something to spare, but the few magical items donated by the retired heroes of the Lords&apos; Alliance are required in the defense of Neverwinter. I have nothing to spare, I&apos;m sorry.
</string>
<string name="2125">But I would wager my life on the fact that whatever they are up to will spell disaster for Neverwinter. We are counting on you to stop them.
</string>
<string name="2126">The city itself still stands undaunted - for now. However, if you fail in your mission, I fear our cause will be lost.
</string>
<string name="2127">Do not judge her too harshly. Love and hate are two sides of the same coin; both are emotions we have little control over.
</string>
<string name="2128">I know what it is to have someone you can not bear to lose. If Lord Nasher had executed *you,* perhaps I would have fallen under the same madness as Aribeth.
</string>
<string name="2129">The first Word of Power has been taken to the safety of Castle Never, thanks to the efforts of one of your fellow adventurers in the service of the Lord&apos;s Alliance. I hope this small victory is the first of many such successes.
</string>
<string name="2130">Take this reward of 5000 gold coins - along with my thanks. And know that whatever awaits us, I am glad that we will face it together.
</string>
<string name="2131">Whatever awaits us, I just want to tell you that I have been proud to serve at your side. I have 5000 gold pieces here - take it. You have truly earned it.
</string>
<string name="2132">And there is more where that came from, if you accompany me to Neverwinter to aid in defending the city. The Lords&apos; Alliance desperatly needs someone such as you.
</string>
<string name="2133">All our weapons and armor have been sent to the battle fronts, unfortunately. The only thing I have left are these potions.
</string>
<string name="2134">I wish I had something to give you, but all such items have been sent to the battle fronts to aid in the war effort.
</string>
<string name="2135">You have done well. Take this reward of 4500 gold coins. You have earned it.
</string>
<string name="2136">I will admit that I never had much faith in you. But you have proved me wrong. Take these 4000 gold pieces as a reward. You have earned it.
</string>
<string name="2137">Have you heard the bards practicing their snippets of song about the legend of how our champion recovered the second Word of Power? I only hope we all live long enough to hear the finished product.
</string>
<string name="2138">As a spy master I normally pride myself on keeping my feelings well hidden. Do you know me so well you can already see through my emotionless facade?
</string>
<string name="2139">I... I suppose I could blame it on the failing war effort. However, I feel I must speak freely with you. I owe you that much, at least.
</string>
<string name="2140">I... I care for you. But I also have a sworn duty to Neverwinter, and in my experience you cannot mix love and duty.
</string>
<string name="2141">I&apos;m... I&apos;m afraid to love you. I am afraid to let myself love you, because of the consequences when I must choose between love and duty.
</string>
<string name="2142">Is this what awaits me? The choice of murder in the name of duty, or betrayal in the name of love? I do not know if I can bear to make such a choice again.
</string>
<string name="2143">I know you are right... but I am still afraid. I don&apos;t know if I can bring myself to say the words I want to say to you.
</string>
<string name="2144">Your words... you words give me strength. They sound **right**. I was a fool to hide from my true feelings.
</string>
<string name="2145">You&apos;re right. Only a fool would refuse to build a house for fear it might burn down!
</string>
<string name="2146">I love you. I love you with all my heart. I was afraid to admit it before, but you have given me the courage to open my heart.
</string>
<string name="2147">I... I&apos;m sorry. I can&apos;t promise you will always be first in my life. I wish I could, but... I just can&apos;t.
</string>
<string name="2148">You want what I cannot give, and I am afraid to take what you offer. Perhaps... perhaps it would be best if we did not pursue this further. 
</string>
<string name="2149">I will not trouble you with by bringing this up again. We have a job to do. We must stay focused on saving Neverwinter.
</string>
<string name="2150">And what of Aribeth? She chose duty over love, and it destroyed her. Look what she has become now--a traitorous creature of hate.
</string>
<string name="2151">Just friends? Oh... I... forgive me. I just thought... I thought we were more.
</string>
<string name="2152">Damn it, Aarin - you&apos;re a bloody fool! I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry. I won&apos;t embarass either of us by bringing this up again.
</string>
<string name="2153">The bards among our camp are already composing tales about how you recovered the second Word of Power. I only hope we all live long enough to hear the finished product.
</string>
<string name="2154">Perhaps Haedraline will speak to our champion. She has spoken with them before.
</string>
<string name="2155">I normally consider myself well informed, particularly when it comes to matters directly concerning the defense of Neverwinter.
</string>
<string name="2156">Organizing our remaing troops to withstand the next Luskan assault requires all my attention. If the enemy breaches the City Core we are lost.
</string>
<string name="2157">Some of my operatives reported that you had recovered the fourth Word of Power. I wasn&apos;t surprised, given all your previous accomplishments.
</string>
<string name="2158">No - but I suspect Haedraline understands their mysteries. She might be willing to share her secrets with our champion.
</string>
<string name="2159">I am afraid Lord Nasher is right - you should speak to Haedraline about this. Is there anything else you need?
</string>
<string name="2160">Is there something else you need? If not, I should get back to my reconnaisance reports.
</string>
<string name="2161">I am more than just a spymaster now. I am responsible for coordinating the entire defense of Neverwinter. I will not risk alienating a potential ally in Haedraline.
</string>
<string name="2162">I trust you, and I suspect that whatever information Haedraline has shared is something I cannot help you with in any case.
</string>
<string name="2163">You will have to act on Haedraline&apos;s information on your own, I&apos;m afraid. Is there anything else I can help you with?
</string>
<string name="2164">Why is life so unfair? We have only just found each other, and now events seem as if they might tear us apart.
</string>
<string name="2165">I am glad you stand with me in this. But if we are to save Neverwinter we cannot let our feelings for each other distract us. We must stay focused on the task at hand.
</string>
<string name="2166">When this is over maybe we can finally be together, but until then we each have our part to play. I must stay here with Lord Nasher to oversee the defenses of the city.
</string>
<string name="2167">These are indeed dark times, though not so dark as Lord Nasher portrays them. The people of Neverwinter are made of sterner stuff than any of us imagine.
</string>
<string name="2168">Surely you must feel it? There is a shadow over Neverwinter, a curse that drags down morale and inspires our enemy. 
</string>
<string name="2169">It&apos;s one thing to say the law is always right, but there are exceptions to every rule.
</string>
<string name="2170">You cannot let your emotions get the better of you. Aribeth has detailed information about the enemy that we need.
</string>
<string name="2171">I agree with you... but it is not as simple as that. Aribeth&apos;s crimes cannot simply be ignored. Be glad we are not the ones who must decide her fate.
</string>
<string name="2172">For all our sakes, I hope he is given that chance. Is there something else I might do for you?
</string>
<string name="2173">I understand your concern for her, but I do not know what to tell you. Her fate has yet to be decided.
</string>
<string name="2174">Heavy is the head that wears the crown, they say. There is little we can do for him, other than trying to save the city. Is there anything else?
</string>
<string name="2175">You should speak to Haedraline before you go. Maybe she will tell you something about the Source Stone or the Words of Power.
</string>
<string name="2176">Yes, there is still much that must be done if Neverwinter is to be saved.
</string>
<string name="2177">You must speak with Lord Nasher first.
</string>
<string name="2178">Welcome to you. I regret I did not get a chance to introduce myself properly to you while you were training at the Academy.</string>
<string name="2179">I have been following your progress since your early training at the Academy. Neverwinter has need of one like you if we are to survive the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="2180">The attack on the Academy doused the one faint spark of hope the city had. I need you to help recover that which we have lost.</string>
<string name="2181">I knew I could count on you. There are many rumors about the plague, but if you are to aid me in this it is important you know the truth about the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="2182">You were there. You saw the slaughter. The attack caught us unprepared. You are one of only a handful of survivers from the carnage of the Academy.</string>
<string name="2183">Your task in this is twofold. First, find the Waterdhavian creatures and bring them back to me - at any cost. We need to harvest components from these creatures if we are to concoct a cure for the Wailing Death. This is your most important duty.</string>
<string name="2184">You proved yourself during the attack on the Academy. Your bravery and skill are obvious, and I know you are not in league with those who seek to destroy Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="2185">I ask for your discretion in this matter. News of the attack and strange creatures roaming the city will only add to the panic and chaos already in the streets.</string>
<string name="2186">Farewell. May Tyr guide your steps.</string>
<string name="2187">I will do my best to answer what questions I may.</string>
<string name="2188">Is there something else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="2189">I will do my best to answer your questions.</string>
<string name="2190">There are many rumors and I would not like to give you any false leads. However, there is something that seems reliable.</string>
<string name="2191">I am not one to boast of my accomplishments. Suffice to say that I am a Paladin of Tyr and I am honored Lord Nasher has placed me in charge of finding a cure for the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="2192">Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="2193">You will answer only to me - and I will give you free reign in your tasks.</string>
<string name="2194">Ah, dear Fenthick, the love of my life. He has been my rock during these troubled times. But even he cannot help me with this.</string>
<string name="2195">Welcome. Do you have news of the missing Waterdhavian creatures? Or is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="2196">Of course. I will do my best to help with whatever you need to know.</string>
<string name="2197">Well done! I knew you wouldn&apos;t let me down!</string>
<string name="2198">Where others have found only failure you have discovered shining success. Neverwinter is in your debt.</string>
<string name="2199">Is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="2200">Your charity and selflessness are an example to us all. I only wish more were as noble as you.</string>
<string name="2201">Were it up to me, you would have a king&apos;s ransom for all you have done. However, the coffers are all but bare. The quarantine has been costly for all within the city.</string>
<string name="2202">But you must hurry - Neverwinter has suffered long enough. Return and speak to me when you are ready to go on.</string>
<string name="2203">You truly are remarkable. If nothing else you prove that wit is no match for courage and skill!</string>
<string name="2204">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="2205">Welcome back. You have done a great thing in recovering the first of the reagents for us.</string>
<string name="2206">Have you heard? Another recruit has recovered the first of the missing Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="2207">One of the bards here in Castle Never is composing a song to honor your adventures during the recovery of the second reagent.</string>
<string name="2208">I believe I heard Lord Nasher himself humming the tune in the halls. People are beginning to take notice of you.</string>
<string name="2209">I have glad tidings to report. Another recruit found the second of the Waterdhavian creatures. We now have two of the four components - we are halfway to a cure!</string>
<string name="2210">You are a welcome sight, as always. Is this visit in regards to the fourth Waterdhavian creature?</string>
<string name="2211">Truly the heart of a hero beats within your chest! Of all who have sought the creatures, you have proven yourself above everyone else!</string>
<string name="2212">We are but one reagent away from our salvation! Thanks to another recruit we only need to find the fourth and final reagent from the missing Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="2213">We have all four reagents now. Quickly, time grows short.</string>
<string name="2214">There is little else I can tell you about this mission. Whenever you need provisions come speak to me again and I can sell them to you through the store here at Tyr&apos;s temple.</string>
<string name="2215">Greetings to you. Preparations are well under way for the ritual. If all goes well, we will have the cure in just a few moments.</string>
<string name="2216">I must say, I knew you would be instrumental in this cause. You&apos;ve always presented the confident look of a person called to action.</string>
<string name="2217">Oh sure, the container we&apos;ve provided is nice and shiny. Now, have you any more brilliant questions to ask?</string>
<string name="2218">We are very near our goal but... I can&apos;t help but worry about the effects of the plague. There is a great scar across Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="2219">It&apos;s not really appropriate to speak of these things right now. It&apos;s not important. We will deal with everything as it comes.</string>
<string name="2220">Hello again. I have a moment to talk, but as soon as you have finished speaking with everyone we can begin the ceremony.</string>
<string name="2221">The fate of Neverwinter depends on you. This key will open the door. May Tyr be with you!</string>
<string name="2222">Listen to me, there is not much time. I fear this is no random attack we have suffered.</string>
<string name="2223">You must protect the Waterdhavian creatures! They must not be allowed to fall into the enemy&apos;s hands!</string>
<string name="2224">You must do this alone. Go back through the hallway leading to this room and take the corridor to the east. It leads to the chambers where the Waterdhavian beasts are being kept.</string>
<string name="2225">Take this key - it will open the locked east door back in the hallway leading to this room. I will stay here; hopefully my presence will draw the enemy away from the creatures they seek.</string>
<string name="2226">I have been looking forward to meeting you. The instructors here at the Academy speak very highly of your skills. I am Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande.</string>
<string name="2227">Perhaps after the graduation ceremonies we can speak in private. Neverwinter can use someone like you.</string>
<string name="2228">Perhaps after the graduation ceremonies we can speak in private. Neverwinter can use someone like you.</string>
<string name="2229">We should arrange... wait! What was that? Did you feel it? Brace yourself - we are under attack!</string>
<string name="2230">It is possible that the cult may be behind some of these activities, allowing us to track them down and mete out the justice they deserve. Your aid in this will prove invaluable.</string>
<string name="2231">Of course. Ask what you will of me.</string>
<string name="2232">Regardless, we will do all that we can to help you. Do not think your efforts go unrecognized.</string>
<string name="2233">The search does continue within the city. Indeed, Lord Nasher is having Neverwinter scoured thoroughly for more traces of the cult.</string>
<string name="2234">You have? Excellent work. You have justified Lord Nasher&apos;s faith in you, and more.</string>
<string name="2235">Both Aarin and I will join you in Luskan, of course. Aarin will be there to help you enter the tower. As for me, I have... other plans.</string>
<string name="2236">I wish I could tell you, but I cannot. I have... little choice in the matter. Please just... do as you are asked to.</string>
<string name="2237">I am sorry, but I... cannot tell you. Please do not ask me to.</string>
<string name="2238">My plans are my own. You have your own mission to worry about.</string>
<string name="2239">Go, then, and speak to Aarin. I hope that... I wish... no, nevermind. Be safe.</string>
<string name="2240">Very well. Go and speak to Aarin, then. May... Tyr watch your path. May Tyr watch over us all.</string>
<string name="2241">It... ah, but I should not be distracting you from your task. My own problems are unimportant and of no interest to you, I am sure. Please forgive me.</string>
<string name="2242">It... it is just that Fenthick&apos;s fate could have been mine. Or yours. Or anyone&apos;s. How do you know that the path you walk is the correct one?</string>
<string name="2243">I have never questioned my faith or my duty before. But neither did Fenthick. I feel... doubt, and I am ashamed to admit it.</string>
<string name="2244">Yes, I... I suppose you are correct, this is getting me nowhere. I should put these questions out of my mind for the time being.</string>
<string name="2245">No. No, it is selfish of me to dwell on my own concerns. Let us return to the subject of your task, please.</string>
<string name="2246">That is a relief. What else did you wish of me, then?</string>
<string name="2247">Let us return to the matter at hand... namely, your task. That is far more important and I will not distract you from it further.</string>
<string name="2248">I... thank you. That is kind of you to say. My own loss seems insignificant, however, compared to Fenthick&apos;s disgrace.</string>
<string name="2249">Naive, am I? I am a paladin, and my duty is part of who I am, not some trivial preoccupation!</string>
<string name="2250">I am not blinded. If anything, my eyes have been opened. You judge Fenthick just as everyone else has.</string>
<string name="2251">Is it I who am blind? If I am, to which truth am I blind about? Fenthick was hanged for treason, but I know there was no treason in his heart.</string>
<string name="2252">No, of course not. Nor would I expect you to. Please forgive me... I have a duty of my own to attend to, and I should remain focussed on it.</string>
<string name="2253">My strain should not surprise you. My only love lies dead, and while it was my lawful Lord who executed him, his true murderers remain beyond my reach.</string>
<string name="2254">Would you not feel the same? I remained passive while my love was executed, and this wretched cult remains invisible and impervious to my wrath.</string>
<string name="2255">Why do you ask me that? The spymaster put you up to this, didn&apos;t he?</string>
<string name="2256">After all that has happened with the plague and... and Fenthick, I think a disturbing dream or two is not so surprising, wouldn&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="2257">Let us return to the topic of your mission, and speak of this no more.</string>
<string name="2258">(sigh) Perhaps you are right. Having the perspective of another on these dreams may not be a bad idea.</string>
<string name="2259">These... these are my dreams. Perhaps now you can understand why I have not wished to discuss them. I am... frightened... of what they may mean.</string>
<string name="2260">That&apos;s kind of you to say. I am glad I told you, at least... it makes the dreams seem a bit smaller, now.</string>
<string name="2261">No... I&apos;m sorry. I should not be so... quick to find my temper. I do want you to be honest, and it is good to talk about the dreams, at least.</string>
<string name="2262">It&apos;s all right. There isn&apos;t much that can be said, is there? But... I am glad I told you. It makes the dreams seem a bit smaller, somehow.</string>
<string name="2263">No. I appreciate the offer, but I would not feel... comfortable... discussing such a personal matter with you. I am sorry.</string>
<string name="2264">I did say that, didn&apos;t I? Are you sure you wish to hear the tale? It is not an exciting one, and I would not wish to bore you.</string>
<string name="2265">No, I... thank you. Thank you for listening to my tale. You have been a great comfort to me.</string>
<string name="2266">I would be glad to call you a... a friend. Tyr only knows that finding a friend in times like these is difficult enough. I hope you feel the same.</string>
<string name="2267">Oh, I meant no... no disrespect! I was suggesting only... that is, I only was... oh, do not mind me. Let us forget I said anything, please.</string>
<string name="2268">I do not know. Not yet. But... I thank you for listening to my tale. You have been a great comfort.</string>
<string name="2269">(sigh) You did ask to hear this. Do you want me to stop?</string>
<string name="2270">Shush. I have barely begun my tale. Control your attention span for a moment.</string>
<string name="2271"></string>
<string name="2272">Discarded. Discarded by his liege lord to appease the witless masses, discarded by his god for one foolish mistake. Tell me why I shouldn&apos;t be angry!</string>
<string name="2273">I... I don&apos;t know. Tyr brought me here, put me on this path. I want to know why. Why teach me true justice and then throw it in my face?</string>
<string name="2274">Perhaps it is just... the dreams. They continue to come, and get worse each night. I hear voices crying out, so many voices...</string>
<string name="2275">Promise me... promise me as my dearest friend that you will find this cult and visit upon them the vengeance that I cannot!</string>
<string name="2276">You have been a fine friend. Here... take this. It is a ring that belonged to my father. I want you to have it.</string>
<string name="2277">Let us speak more later. Go... find where the heart of this cult resides and return to me. I wish you luck with all my heart.</string>
<string name="2278">Leave me be, then, and return to your mission. We need discuss my feelings no further.</string>
<string name="2279">And what *is* like me? Tyr brought me to this place and put me on this path and taught me the meaning of justice... only to throw it in my face. I want to know why!</string>
<string name="2280">I wish there were better leads we could send you on to track down the cult... but Aarin&apos;s information is the best we have.</string>
<string name="2281">Go with Tyr&apos;s blessing, then... and be safe.</string>
<string name="2282">Then I wish you luck.</string>
<string name="2283">How I feel is... unimportant, next to the mission we have been given. Please, allow me to explain what is required of us.</string>
<string name="2284">It is of vital importance that you complete Lord Nasher&apos;s mission. Much depends on you discovering what else Desther&apos;s allies have planned.</string>
<string name="2285">It is good to see you again. At times I worry that you have taken on too much responsibility yourself, yet always you surprise me with your resourcefulness and success.</string>
<string name="2286">It is good to see you again. When I surrendered to Lord Nasher I was certain my execution would be swift.</string>
<string name="2287">Please, we have both made our feelings toward each other clear. But Morag still lives; now is not the time for this discussion.</string>
<string name="2288">I am at peace, for the first time since Fenthick&apos;s death. And I have you to thank. You saved me.</string>
<string name="2289">I no longer fear my fate. When Fenthick... when Fenthick was executed I thought I had lost everything. But now I see this is not true.</string>
<string name="2290">I have you. You were there when I was in my darkest hour, you were there when I needed you - but I was too blind to see.</string>
<string name="2291">But you never gave up on me. I have found myself again. And I finally see how... how special you are to me.</string>
<string name="2292">They say it is better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all. I never used to believe that... until now.</string>
<string name="2293">Forgive me for speaking so frankly about this. My heart could not stay silent, but I should not have burdened you with this - not while you still must face Morag.</string>
<string name="2294">I understand, you have every right to feel that way. I only wanted to tell you the truth that is within my own heart.</string>
<string name="2295">I have you to thank for this. Without your intervention I would never have found this peace.</string>
<string name="2296">I may yet be given the chance to make amends for all I have done, though I know I will never be able to fully atone for what I have done.</string>
<string name="2297">I am ready to meet my fate. There is a great peace upon me now.</string>
<string name="2298">I understand. There is still much that must be done if Morag is to be defeated. I wish you luck.</string>
<string name="2299">This I cannot do. Even if Lord Nasher chose to release me from this cell, I would have to refuse your request.</string>
<string name="2300">You... I am not surprised to see you here. You have become quite the thorn in Maugrim&apos;s side. Though he would never admit it, I believe you have impressed him with your accomplishments.</string>
<string name="2301">I, however, am not too proud to admit my respect for you. You have thwarted us at almost every turn. Yet in the end Morag&apos;s will cannot be denied.</string>
<string name="2302">You have already lost. My troops control the city; soon even Castle Never will fall. The streets will run red with the blood of Neverwinter&apos;s children.</string>
<string name="2303">I was about to make you the same offer, though I suspect Maugrim would rather sacrifice you to his new Queen.</string>
<string name="2304">His blood is on their hands. We are all guilty here, and we are all deserving of death.</string>
<string name="2305">My position at the head of the armies only hastened the inevitable end. Neverwinter was doomed as soon as Maugrim unleashed the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="2306">There is nothing more to say. It is too late for words. We must settle this in blood.</string>
<string name="2307">You have come far since our first meeting. I can no longer stand against you.</string>
<string name="2308">Tell me how can you go on, knowing you fight for a city that is doomed to fall when the Old Ones return?</string>
<string name="2309">I have seen the future in my dreams. Neverwinter will vanish in a blaze of flame when the Old Ones are reborn - it is inevitable.</string>
<string name="2310">I am at your mercy. Ask your questions and I will answer them.</string>
<string name="2311">Maugrim has the Word of Power in his room - through the door to the south. We knew you were coming. That is why I am here rather than leading Luskan&apos;s army.</string>
<string name="2312">I... I am simply telling you what happened. How I... how I came to break my vows and betray all that I stood for.</string>
<string name="2313">Look around you. Look at the death and destruction I have brought to Neverwinter. I can never make up for this.</string>
<string name="2314">Do you think I am a fool? I know Lord Nasher too well to believe such tripe!</string>
<string name="2315">I should sacrifice myself for the sake of the people who demanded Fenthick&apos;s blood? Do you really believe me capable of so selfless an act?</string>
<string name="2316">Once I would have gladly sacrificed myself for this city. But I have changed. I am no longer the Aribeth you knew. Now I walk a different path.</string>
<string name="2317">I... I am not who I once was. I... I cannot... it would not be possible... I cannot go back. Not after what I have done.</string>
<string name="2318">Your words are... wise. Perhaps... perhaps I can set aside my hatred.</string>
<string name="2319">There... there is a part of me that still weeps when I see the destruction of Neverwinter. Perhaps... perhaps you are right.</string>
<string name="2320">Your words are... wise. Perhaps... perhaps I can set aside my hatred.</string>
<string name="2321">But you... you will have to trust me in this. Maugrim waits for you behind this door, you must face him now - time is of the essence.</string>
<string name="2322">I am grateful to you for this... this chance to... to do what is right. I wanted you to know that before I go, in case... in case Lord Nasher has me executed before you return.</string>
<string name="2323">Lady Aribeth? It has been a long time since anyone called me that. Thank you.</string>
<string name="2324">Your words are kind, but I am ready for whatever awaits.</string>
<string name="2325">No, If I run away it will mean I have learned nothing. I am ready to accept the consequences of what I have done - whatever those consequences may be.</string>
<string name="2326">I... I must go to Lord Nasher now, while my resolve is still strong. You must face Maugrim without me. Goodbye... and good luck.</string>
<string name="2327">You are wasting your time. I am beyond your power to save.</string>
<string name="2328">There... there is a part of me that still weeps when I see the destruction of Neverwinter. Perhaps... perhaps you are right.</string>
<string name="2329">Perhaps... perhaps you are right. Perhaps, had I acted differently... but it is too late for me now.</string>
<string name="2330">I know this. And yet, I would speak with you before you end my life. So you might understand why I did what I did.</string>
<string name="2331">Let me live? You can do no such thing. You serve Neverwinter, you have no choice but to end my existence.</string>
<string name="2332">Come then, deliver me to the fate I have brought upon myself.</string>
<string name="2333">Lead on, Asheera of the Shining Order will follow you as long as she draws breath!</string>

<string name="2541">Ring of the Rogue +1</string>
<string name="2542">This plain-looking ring pulsates with a faint glow and is warm to the touch. While not alive in any sense of the word, it does seem likely that this ring takes time to adjust to its wearer, and over time its abilities may grow. Tomi Undergallows, its previous owner, stated that he &apos;couldn&apos;t get it to work&apos;... no doubt he discarded it after first placing it on his finger and was unaware of its unique properties.</string>

<string name="2549">This small document dictates that the bard, Sharwyn, currently works for you in the capacity of a henchman. You are not sure why she insisted on such a formality.</string>

<string name="2611">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="2612">I don&apos;t want any trouble, but I guess what I want doesn&apos;t really matter. It&apos;s not like there&apos;s anything I can do...</string>
<string name="2613">Can I help you? No, what am I thinking... I can&apos;t even help myself. I can&apos;t even huddle in my own home... </string>
<string name="2614">Hell, your &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;ship. Can you help? I don&apos;t know if I should dare to ask... probably not. I&apos;m not worth the time of someone like you.</string>
<string name="2615">Can&apos;t go home to the Beggar&apos;s Nest because of zombies, can&apos;t get out of the city because of the quarantine... what&apos;s a guy supposed to do? Just choke on stink of the corpse-fires, I guess.</string>
<string name="2616">Farewell, then. I&apos;ll just stay here... nowhere else to go...</string>
<string name="2617">I don&apos;t know how you could. I don&apos;t know anyone that can take on an army of zombies by themselves. The Beggar&apos;s Nest is completely overrun... my home is overrun...</string>
<string name="2618">I-I&apos;m sorry, I don&apos;t mean to be rude, but if you think I&apos;ve had any time to think about any of this, then you just aren&apos;t very bright.</string>
<string name="2619">No, please, I don&apos;t want to think about this anymore than I have to.</string>
<string name="2620">It&apos;s over? I mean, the plague is still going, sure, but at least I can go home. The zombies in the Beggar&apos;s Nest were just a nightmare I didn&apos;t need. Thank you.</string>
<string name="2621">I just want to go home, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="2622">I never thought I&apos;d be happy to be going back to the Beggar&apos;s Nest.</string>
<string name="2623">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2624">Maybe somethings me can do?</string>
<string name="2625">Is there anything I can do?</string>
<string name="2626">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="2627">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="2628">You one of those damned thieves? I wouldn&apos;t put it past them to come out here and start the same crap in the City Core that put me out of the Docks.</string>
<string name="2629">What, you trapped out here too? Ain&apos;t it just like the working stiffs to get the worst of everything. It&apos;s rough, isn&apos;t it.</string>
<string name="2630">You some sort of noble or officer? Can&apos;t you throw some highfalutin influence around and take care of the crap that&apos;s keeping me from my job?</string>
<string name="2631">See, I just want to go back to work in the Docks district. There&apos;s not much to do under the quarantine, but at least I&apos;d be away from the stink of the corpse-fires.</string>
<string name="2632">Can&apos;t do squat with all the thieves everywhere. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s got into them, but it&apos;s made the Docks district unlivable. I can&apos;t go home for all the muggers.</string>
<string name="2633">Bye then. Guess I&apos;ll just wait here. Nothing I can do. Why doesn&apos;t someone step up and be a damn hero?</string>
<string name="2634">I ain&apos;t looking for charity. I just want to be able to get back in the docks. Someone needs to get in there and raise hell.</string>
<string name="2635">I swear, if my back was in better shape, I&apos;d be in there, but I can&apos;t take on an army of thieves. No way.</string>
<string name="2636">I ain&apos;t gonna waste my time explaining something so simple. I just want to get back to work in the Docks. I ain&apos;t used to running from thieves.</string>
<string name="2637">Ah, I don&apos;t know anything you can&apos;t learn from better talkers than me. I ain&apos;t had time to see anything except them thieves nipping at my heels as I ran. </string>
<string name="2638">I just want to get back to work, but until someone kicks some heads in the Docks district, I&apos;m stuck out here. That&apos;s all there is to it.</string>
<string name="2639">Glad that somebody was willing to take those thieves to the woodshed. I gotta thank you. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;m gonna get back to work in there.</string>
<string name="2640">I hate this. Someone should lay down the law.</string>
<string name="2641">That&apos;s the way things get done! Yes indeed!</string>

<string name="2653">I ask that you heal me.</string>
<string name="2654">Very well. Mind that you hold still a moment. There, that should do it.</string>
<string name="2655">Stand away from me, you, before I call the tavern guards!</string>
<string name="2656">More plague-waifs cluttering up the place, I see. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="2657">Go on, you&apos;re fouling my air.</string>
<string name="2658">If it weren&apos;t for this place, I wouldn&apos;t go out at all. Plague has closed all my old haunts.</string>
<string name="2659">The quarantine has really hurt trade. I wonder how long this place will stay open.</string>
<string name="2660">I don&apos;t mind being sealed in the Blacklake. I hardly go to the rest of the city, anyway.</string>
<string name="2661">The place is a bit rough, but until the barricades are down, this is the best place for us to gather.</string>
<string name="2662">You seen pretty friendly for this type of place.</string>
<string name="2663">Careful around here. You won&apos;t want to ruin that pretty face of yours.</string>
<string name="2664">Been a while since we had a fresh barbarian face around here. You&apos;ll spice things up, I bet.</string>
<string name="2665">You&apos;ll like this place, I&apos;ll wager. You look a little rough around the edges.</string>
<string name="2666">Oh, I&apos;ll enjoy watching you battle in the pit. You look ready for rough-and-tumble.</string>
<string name="2667">Not much of interest for you around here, magic user.</string>
<string name="2668">I doubt you&apos;ll find this place to your liking, caster.</string>
<string name="2669">A spellslinger? This isn&apos;t really your type of place, is it?</string>
<string name="2670">I take it you are the new owner. Luck be with you in these hard times.</string>
<string name="2671">I am not interested in battling you. Put your weapon away until you need to use it.</string>
<string name="2672">Yes, yes, I see your fine weapon. Now get it out of my face.</string>
<string name="2673">Weapons should not be brandished on the main floor. You&apos;ll bring unwanted attention.</string>
<string name="2674">Wherever you fought, it must have been an impressive battle. You are a mess!</string>
<string name="2675">Look at you. You are in no shape to fight. You need rest.</string>
<string name="2676">You look horrible! Isn&apos;t the healer doing her job?</string>
<string name="2677">Present yourself properly, &lt;man/woman&gt;! Dress yourself!</string>
<string name="2678">Kindly cover yourself. You&apos;ll bring unwanted attention to the tavern.</string>
<string name="2679">This is hardly the place to risk such behavior. Dress yourself - if not for decency, then at least for battle.</string>
<string name="2680">Me gots hurts that need to be healed.</string>
<string name="2681">I am injured. Can you heal my wounds?</string>
<string name="2682">Me am hurts. Yous got healing, please?</string>
<string name="2683">I am injured. Could you heal me?</string>
<string name="2684">&lt;StartAction&gt;Aribeth looks you over, then raises her hands in praise of the Even-Handed, Tyr. You begin to feel better.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2685">&lt;StartAction&gt;Aribeth looks you over, then raises her hands in praise of the Even-Handed, Tyr. You begin to feel better.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="2686">Remember, you can always rest here in the Temple of Tyr. It is safe, free from plague, and Aribeth can see to any wounds you might have.</string>
<string name="2687">We are very disappointed in you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your slaughter of innocent people has caused much suffering in a time already overburdened with tragedy.</string>
<string name="2688">Were it up to me you would have been left to rot in your grave; however, Aribeth has ordered me to resurrect you. Despite your actions, Neverwinter still has need of you.</string>
<string name="2689">You will suffer no further consequences for your mad killing spree, but I implore you not to engage in such wholesale slaughter again. Please, focus on the mission you have been given.</string>
<string name="2690">If yous can&apos;t do this, why could me?</string>
<string name="2691">If you can&apos;t do it, how would I?</string>
<string name="2692">Look, if I had the manpower I might be able to get it done, but we are tapped out. The prisoners are organized, running the prison like a fortress. Their raiding parties always retreat back inside</string>
<string name="2693">I heard that it was the Waterdhavian intellect devourer behind it, and that the remains of the creature have been turned in to Aribeth already.</string>
<string name="2694">Now I just have to reward the proper person. I will give the payment I earmarked for this task to the person that returned the creature to Aribeth.</string>
<string name="2695">If you see them, tell them I will be waiting here with their well-deserved wages.</string>
<string name="2696">Yes, I heard that it was the Waterdhavian intellect devourer. I also heard that you turned the remains of it in to Aribeth. Good work.</string>
<string name="2697">Her word is good enough proof that you did the job. I assume that 300 gold danger pay is sufficient?</string>
<string name="2698">Mizzenmast Mercantile</string>
<string name="2699">At last I can unleash my magic again. Feel my power!</string>
<string name="2700">This is my territory now and I&apos;m not going down without a fight!</string>
<string name="2701">Me thought only nobles in Blacklake.</string>
<string name="2702">I keep quite a few houses clean too. Not every house, but close enough.</string>
<string name="2703">I don&apos;t really have anything worth stealing in there, but you look like a guard anyway, so I don&apos;t think I need to worry about you. Just use the key and go on in.</string>
<string name="2704">I already gave out my key. You&apos;ll have to find it if you want to be going in there. My home be in the north end o&apos; the district</string>
<string name="2705">Me is going, now.</string>
<string name="2706">I was just leaving.</string>
<string name="2707">You get out of way! Me goes where me wants!!</string>
<string name="2708">Get out of my way! I&apos;ll go where I please!</string>
<string name="2709">Maybe me gonna do that! You gives gold or you die!</string>
<string name="2710">Perhaps I will! Give me all your gold or die!</string>
<string name="2711">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me city guard. Mean no harm.</string>
<string name="2712">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m with the city guard, I don&apos;t mean any harm.</string>
<string name="2713">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2714">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="2715">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="2716">Me collects gold to protect nobles. See, nobles die in they own homes all the time.</string>
<string name="2717">I&apos;m collecting gold to protect nobles. Many are killed in their own homes everyday.</string>
<string name="2718">Me just leave nows. Sorry to bothers.</string>
<string name="2719">I&apos;ll just leave. Sorry to bother you.</string>
<string name="2720">Maybe me just go back to other questions.</string>
<string name="2721">Perhaps I should just go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="2722">Hypotemi... hippo...uh, yes! Unless you donate, you could die! AT ANY SECOND!</string>
<string name="2723">Hypothetically? Yes. Unless you &quot;donate,&quot; you could die. Maybe even RIGHT NOW! Or NOW!</string>
<string name="2724">Me need directions.</string>
<string name="2725">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="2726">No, me have other question.</string>
<string name="2727">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="2728">Me need place to buy stuff. Is there one here somewheres?</string>
<string name="2729">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="2730">Me look for temple.</string>
<string name="2731">Where is the nearest temple?</string>
<string name="2732">Me look for place to sleep.</string>
<string name="2733">Where is the nearest inn?</string>
<string name="2734">You know &apos;bout any weird stuff here in Blacklake place?</string>
<string name="2735">Do you know of anything interesting going on in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="2736">Places in Blacklake I should go to?</string>
<string name="2737">Any places in Blacklake you think I should visit?</string>
<string name="2738">Me want work.</string>
<string name="2739">I&apos;d be interested in work, if you know of anything.</string>
<string name="2740">Any weird stuff at all?</string>
<string name="2741">Anything peculiar that you can think of?</string>
<string name="2742">Ooooo, come on handsome guy, talks about it.</string>
<string name="2743">Are you sure you couldn&apos;t say, handsome?</string>
<string name="2744">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="2745">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="2746">Me look into plague. Maybe you help?</string>
<string name="2747">I&apos;m investigating the plague. Perhaps you can help me?</string>
<string name="2748">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="2749">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="2750">You hear plague rumors, maybe?</string>
<string name="2751">Have you heard any rumors concerning the plague?</string>
<string name="2752">You know &apos;bout strange creatures around?</string>
<string name="2753">Are you aware of any strange creatures in the area?</string>
<string name="2754">Nothing weird about zoo?</string>
<string name="2755">So there&apos;s been nothing odd about the zoo, then?</string>
<string name="2756">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is it possible that some creatures might have gained access to the zoo, somehow?</string>
<string name="2757">Villain, why are you here? This is private property!</string>
<string name="2758">Why are you in my home? What business do you have here? None lawful, I&apos;ll wager.</string>
<string name="2759">The sheer nerve! Why have you come into my home, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="2760">Get out of here, before I call the watch on you!</string>
<string name="2761">I suppose that makes you a burglar of some sort? Come to rob me, have you?</string>
<string name="2762">I thought so. Fine, take your bloody gold and get out! I don&apos;t have time to be listening to your evil posturing. Take it and go!</string>
<string name="2763">And don&apos;t return! Animal! Dog!</string>
<string name="2764">What is this? Another lout pushing through my home? Well, let me save you some time. If you were going to rob me, someone already beat you to it!</string>
<string name="2765">So state whatever your other business is and then get out. I&apos;ve nothing more to take!</string>
<string name="2766">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t trust the look of you, villain! Just because there&apos;s a plague, you think you can walk in anywhere? Get out this instant!</string>
<string name="2767">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh. I suppose you don&apos;t look like such a bad sort. You just startled me by barging in here uninvited, is all.</string>
<string name="2768">What was it you wanted, then, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="2769">Ruffians back again, hmm? Something you need?</string>
<string name="2770">Yes, leave me be.</string>
<string name="2771">I&apos;m sure you know the way out.</string>
<string name="2772">Fare you well, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="2773">If you must. I will make no promises that I will answer, though.</string>
<string name="2774">Very well, but keep your distance. I don&apos;t recognize you, so you likely slipped past the barricade and may have brought the plague with you.</string>
<string name="2775">Well... make it quick, if you will. I do have things I should be attending to.</string>
<string name="2776">You don&apos;t say? Nobles dying in (gulp) their own homes? Hypothetically, would you mean nobles like me... in my home?</string>
<string name="2777">All right then. Whatever you were up to, I don&apos;t want to see you back.</string>
<string name="2778">Very well... but make it quick. I&apos;m not sure what you are up to...</string>
<string name="2779">I understand. Take your damn gold and get out. Out! Criminal! Dog!</string>
<string name="2780">Stop right there! I&apos;ve already given out the last of my gold and there isn&apos;t any more! Now, ask your questions and get out!</string>
<string name="2781">As you will. Make your questions short, I cannot bear your halting speech.</string>
<string name="2782">What were you looking for, then?</string>
<string name="2783">Unless you are asking for the way out of my home, I doubt I can help you.</string>
<string name="2784">I imagine they sell supplies at the Board Laid Bare, but I have not been there myself. It is by the south gate.</string>
<string name="2785">We have no such establishment. Those that need such a place used to travel to the City Core.</string>
<string name="2786">The Board Laid Bare, I believe. A tavern mostly. I can&apos;t tell you any more. Not my sort of place. It is by the south gate.</string>
<string name="2787">Is there something else?</string>
<string name="2788">I&apos;m certain that I am above anything you would consider &quot;interesting.&quot;</string>
<string name="2789">I don&apos;t know. That tavern, the Board Laid Bare? It has quite a scandalous reputation, I hear.</string>
<string name="2790">I have no information on employment. I have people for that.</string>
<string name="2791">Well, that girl Formosa is looking for people who will listen to her. She&apos;s down in the southeast square trying to stir up folks against Meldanen.</string>
<string name="2792">I don&apos;t pay attention to troublemakers like her. Everyone should be left to their own affairs. Whatever Meldanen is up to, it&apos;s no business of hers or mine.</string>
<string name="2793">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="2794">Mmm, nothing comes to mind. At least, nothing now that Formosa and Meldanen are no longer at each other&apos;s throats.</string>
<string name="2795">Lord Meldanen has been stirring up trouble, but I do not wish to speak of it.</string>
<string name="2796">Er... No, I don&apos;t think I shall go into the subject in detail. I don&apos;t find your manner... eh... entreating. Besides, Meldanen is a dangerous man to gossip about.</string>
<string name="2797">Well now, I wouldn&apos;t mind spending a few more moments in your delightful company. Lean in close, now. From what I&apos;ve heard, Meldanen recently accquired a young woman for his amusement.</string>
<string name="2798">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t spread rumors. Besides, Meldanen is not known for his patience or gentle business acumen. I do not wish to be on his bad side.</string>
<string name="2799">His mansion is in the northwest part of the district if you wish to visit him yourself. I would advise against it, however.</string>
<string name="2800">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose there&apos;s no way for the wizard to know, is there? Well... word is that Meldanen recently accquired a young woman for his amusement.</string>
<string name="2801">He won&apos;t let her out, and the rumors say that she&apos;s rather strange...perhaps not quite human. The gods only know what he wants with her. Rather sordid business, no?</string>
<string name="2802">At any rate, if you want you can see for yourself. Meldanen&apos;s estate is in the northwest. I wouldn&apos;t advise going there, though...he won&apos;t see you.</string>
<string name="2803">Nothing. Well, there was some sort of affair with Lord Meldanen, but it has apparently been resolved. I assume it was some sort of scandal.</string>
<string name="2804">I heard he was hoarding food or some such, but all is quiet now.</string>
<string name="2805">I have paid close attention to what has been said of the plague, but there is little real information. I don&apos;t know if I can help you.</string>
<string name="2806">As you will. Try to speak a little faster, I don&apos;t have all day.</string>
<string name="2807">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="2808">I pay no attention to the ramblings of the lower classes, and I assure you that Blacklake nobles do not spread rumors. I cannot help you.</string>
<string name="2809">Certainly not. The Blacklake maintains strict control on all animals. There is even a zoo, but there is hardly anything there I would call strange.</string>
<string name="2810">I have no idea what you are looking for, or would consider &quot;odd.&quot; The zoo&apos;s in the northeast if you want to see for yourself.</string>
<string name="2811">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="2812">I couldn&apos;t say. Lord Montgomery &quot;Sureshot&quot; is the proprietor. You will have to speak with him if you wish a definitive answer.</string>
<string name="2813">The zoo&apos;s in the northeast part of the district if you haven&apos;t already been.</string>
<string name="2814">Why have you intruded? Get out! Out! Filthy evil beast!</string>
<string name="2815">Very little. I have been imprisoned and Meldanen refused to explain much of anything. He lived somewhere below, but I heard some sort of commotion... is he still a threat?</string>
<string name="2816">Of course, that may all be old news to you. I heard some sort of commotion? Is Meldanen still a threat?</string>
<string name="2817">Samuel said he was rescued by one of the new recruits. I&apos;ll wager it was you, hmm? Good work. I set aside 300 gold for his rescue. It&apos;s yours.</string>
<string name="2818">Meldanen is that you? No! You&apos;re an intruder!</string>
<string name="2819">My master will reward me well for your head!</string>
<string name="2820">I kill you for master!</string>
<string name="2821">Who disturbs Loxar! You going to pay!</string>
<string name="2822">Oh, the gate is already open. Just head on through.</string>
<string name="2823">Patrolling the tavern, that is. The Board Laid Bare is where Thurin spends his off-hours.</string>
<string name="2824">But, he&apos;s no longer a concern. I heard someone put him in his place, or something. The Blacklake is really quiet now.</string>
<string name="2825">Greetings to you. I swear, I&apos;ve seen more traffic just recently than since the plague began.</string>
<string name="2826">You are here on militia business, I assume? Nobody else comes through this area except us guards.</string>
<string name="2827">The gate is already open if you need to enter.</string>
<string name="2828">Not much reason for you to be here, though. I hear the Blacklake is quiet now. There was some trouble with some nobles stealing food or something, but that&apos;s over with.</string>
<string name="2829">Maybe you had something to do with that? Good on you, if you did.</string>
<string name="2830">Citizen, what&apos;s your business in the Blacklake district?</string>
<string name="2831">This wagon is filled with sacks of grain.</string>
<string name="2832">Why me gotta care about you? What you want?</string>
<string name="2833">What do you want and why should I care?</string>
<string name="2834">Slow down and me listen. What wrong?</string>
<string name="2835">Slow down, just tell me what&apos;s wrong.</string>
<string name="2836">Me not got time for this. Bye.</string>
<string name="2837">I don&apos;t have time for this. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2838">Me thought this was Blacklake. Tell me about this place.</string>
<string name="2839">This isn&apos;t the Blacklake? Tell me about this area, then.</string>
<string name="2840">Plague-thugs? What you mean? Sick guys?</string>
<string name="2841">Plague-thugs? Explain what you mean by that.</string>
<string name="2842">So how me gets to Blacklake place, then?</string>
<string name="2843">So how do I get to the Blacklake district?</string>
<string name="2844">Monster? What yous mean?</string>
<string name="2845">Monster? What monster do you mean?</string>
<string name="2846">What happen here? Why this place so wrecked up?</string>
<string name="2847">What happened here? Why is this area in such bad shape?</string>
<string name="2848">Me gots to ask yous something else.</string>
<string name="2849">I&apos;m going to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="2850">Loxar? He a big half-orc? Me gots his head here.</string>
<string name="2851">Loxar? Big half-orc? I&apos;ve got his head right here.</string>
<string name="2852">You tells me about this Loxar guy.</string>
<string name="2853">Tell me about this &quot;Loxar.&quot;</string>
<string name="2854">You gets no helps from Blacklake guards?</string>
<string name="2855">You couldn&apos;t get any help from the Blacklake guards?</string>
<string name="2856">What me gets paid if me do this?</string>
<string name="2857">What will I be paid to kill him?</string>
<string name="2858">Me see what me can do.</string>
<string name="2859">I will see what I can do.</string>
<string name="2860">You tell what yous need, again.</string>
<string name="2861">Tell me again what you need.</string>
<string name="2862">Me killed guy that kill everyone here.</string>
<string name="2863">I killed the villain that was killing everyone.</string>
<string name="2864">Me gots head of guy who killed all the peoples.</string>
<string name="2865">I have the head of the villain that was killing everyone.</string>
<string name="2866">Please, can you help me? I don&apos;t know what to do.</string>
<string name="2867">Why? Aren&apos;t you a guard? I thought you had come to save me... please say you did. I need your help.</string>
<string name="2868">Could you understand my answers? You seem a bit slow.</string>
<string name="2869">M-my name is Cendran, and everything has gone wrong... this whole area is overun, and those bastards in the Blacklake don&apos;t care. They&apos;ve locked themselves away, abandoning the whole place.</string>
<string name="2870">Please, I don&apos;t have anywere else to turn...</string>
<string name="2871">No, no, this ain&apos;t the Blacklake district. The Blacklake is up ahead, past the gate and the guard. The nobles barricaded themselves in just after the plague started.</string>
<string name="2872">This area... this is where the servant community lives... lived. We would work for the nobles all day and return here to our homes at night.</string>
<string name="2873">I guess they thought it wasn&apos;t worth the risk trying to protect us from the plague too. Left us to the plague-thugs... now everything is gone.</string>
<string name="2874">Well, you would just go on ahead and past the gate at the opposite end as you entered from the City Core.</string>
<string name="2875">But... you&apos;ll stay and help first, right? Won&apos;t you? Please, I&apos;ve got nowhere else to turn. I just want the monster responsible for this to get what&apos;s coming to him...</string>
<string name="2876">After the Wailing began we got caught between the quarantine and the Blacklake barricades. We were at the mercy of the plague-thugs.</string>
<string name="2877">Some of them used to be friends, but the plague took their minds... drove them mad. They became like animals. Then, Loxar showed up.</string>
<string name="2878">I suppose. What do you need to know?</string>
<string name="2879">You... you do! I knew someone would make him pay! I knew there had to be some justice left somewhere! Thank you! Thank you so very much!</string>
<string name="2880">I wish I had something to give you, but I have nothing except my gratitude. I... I thank you.</string>
<string name="2881">Loxar is a big half-orc. Not sure where he came from. He showed up after the first few plague-thugs started going mad. Loxar looted in their wake.</string>
<string name="2882">After a while, when the place was disrupted, Loxar just started killing people and taking whatever he wanted. I think he realized the guards don&apos;t care about us in here.</string>
<string name="2883">I think I&apos;m one of the last survivors. I&apos;ve no reason to stay-he&apos;s killed my family, taken everthing. I just want to know he&apos;s dead before I try and get to the City Core.</string>
<string name="2884">Nobody cares about us servants here. The Blacklake nobles barricaded themselves up. As long as nobody gets near the barricade, they don&apos;t care.</string>
<string name="2885">What do they care if some peasants lose their lives. Bah, I ain&apos;t working for them ever again. </string>
<string name="2886">I... I have nothing. Nothing at all. All I can do is hope you will help me. Please?</string>
<string name="2887">You... you will? Thank you. Loxar is in this... no-man&apos;s-land somewhere. He&apos;s pretty much taken whatever houses he&apos;s wanted. There are still plague-mad thugs around too.</string>
<string name="2888">Please, be careful. You&apos;re the first person to give a damn about anything that has happened here. Thank you.</string>
<string name="2889">Nothing left... I&apos;ve nothing. Please, if you can help, will you destroy the beast that has taken all I had?</string>
<string name="2890">I wish I could believe that, but he was so strong, I won&apos;t think he&apos;s dead until I can see his head for myself.</string>
<string name="2891">If you have killed him, I thank you, but I just can&apos;t leave this place until I know for sure. Show me his head, if you can.</string>
<string name="2892">You there! Please! Oh, please won&apos;t you help me!</string>
<string name="2893">At least I know the beast is dead. I guess that&apos;s something.</string>
<string name="2894">Neverwinter Zoo</string>
<string name="2895">Me knows stuff about why this place so bad.</string>
<string name="2896">I have information about what is going on.</string>
<string name="2897">That probably it. Bye for nows.</string>
<string name="2898">Fair enough. Goodbye for now.</string>
<string name="2899">All the peoples wants gold for this auction. That why they steal.</string>
<string name="2900">Everyone is scrambling to get gold for an auction, stealing all they can.</string>
<string name="2901">You already knowed? Why you not do stuff about it?</string>
<string name="2902">You knew about it? Why don&apos;t you do anything?</string>
<string name="2903">You pretty close-headed. Not even give thems a chance?</string>
<string name="2904">That is very closed-minded. Shouldn&apos;t people all get a chance to prove themselves?</string>
<string name="2905">What is there to know? The district is full of nothing but animals. The plague was all it took to let everything go to hell.</string>
<string name="2906">Ah, that auction is a load of crap. I&apos;d bet it&apos;s all just a plan to get people into the Seedy Tavern and mug them.</string>
<string name="2907">Of course I knew. The first thug we put down had a notice on him. It&apos;s just one more reason for these dogs to slaughter each other.</string>
<string name="2908">And they won&apos;t stop at that, either! Did you know that one of these mongrels had the gall to think I would try to get Lord Nasher himself to come here?</string>
<string name="2909">As if I would waste my time. No, this lot can go to hell if they like. I&apos;m just going to keep them from getting loose. Plague take them all!</string>
<string name="2910">Every animal in here has already proved themselves worthless in my eyes. You want to play babysitter to a pack of wolves, you go right ahead.</string>
<string name="2911">The grate appears to be locked from the inside.</string>
<string name="2912">You&apos;ll be shark-bait, chum!</string>
<string name="2913">This is the place to be, yes indeed... (hic). Drinkin&apos; the day... night... away. Whatever.</string>
<string name="2914">Who wants to sing! Well, go ahead, I ain&apos;t gonna. (hic) Hahaaaaa...</string>
<string name="2915">To all my friends! Yeah, that&apos;s all of you... (hic) I love you guys...</string>
<string name="2916">Who&apos;s gonna be my friend? The one that buy-sh me another drink, that&apos;s who. Hahaaaaa!</string>
<string name="2917">The Golden Apple</string>
<string name="2918">Twenty in a Quiver</string>
<string name="2919">Bad enough, though the man I thought I had lost made it back. Thanks to you if you had anything to do with it. He&apos;ll help us pick off the undead from here.</string>
<string name="2920">Don&apos;t even have to worry about my missing man. Walters made it back in one piece! Thanks to you if you had anything to do with that.</string>
<string name="2921">That just too bad, me guess. Tough luck, girly.</string>
<string name="2922">That&apos;s some pretty tough luck. Too bad for you.</string>
<string name="2923">Maybe me leads you to safety?</string>
<string name="2924">I could lead you to safety.</string>
<string name="2925"></string>
<string name="2926"></string>
<string name="2927"></string>
<string name="2928"></string>
<string name="2929">You know Aldo? Me bring Hector guy, because he look for Aldo.</string>
<string name="2930">Your husband was Aldo? I brought Hector. He was looking for Aldo.</string>
<string name="2931">Who you? Why you here?</string>
<string name="2932">Who are you? Why are you out here?</string>
<string name="2933"></string>
<string name="2934">Not nice enough to make up for my husband Aldo being dead and zombies crawling out of everywhere, but you know how it goes.</string>
<string name="2935">Take your insults somewhere else. I&apos;ve watched undead slaughter my husband - don&apos;t think I&apos;ll get scared of little old you. I don&apos;t need your help.</string>
<string name="2936">Well, since you&apos;ve got Hector with you, there&apos;s less than nothing keeping me here. I mean, I&apos;d hate to leave the beloved cart behind... so many conflicting emotions...</string>
<string name="2937">That was a joke. Thanks for the offer, but Hector and I can find our own way out from here. I appreciate your help, though. Do me a favor? Spit on the cart before you go. There&apos;s a good &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="2938">As much as I&apos;d like you to, my husband was waiting for Hector and... well, I&apos;d like to know he&apos;s safe before I go running off. He&apos;s a family friend, and more important than the cart, if you ask me.</string>
<string name="2939"></string>
<string name="2940"></string>
<string name="2941">I see that. Well, he can look all he wants, he&apos;s not going to find him. Aldo died fighting for his beloved cart. The idiot.</string>
<string name="2942">I am Mattily, and that cart is why I&apos;ve waited here, and why my husband is dead. Frankly, I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m here now. Zombies everywhere else, maybe.</string>
<string name="2943">Of course, if my husband would get us the heck out of here, it would be even nicer.</string>
<string name="2944">&lt;StartAction&gt;(Hold up staff)&lt;/Start&gt; You know staff? Me finds it on his body.</string>
<string name="2945">&lt;StartAction&gt;(Hold up staff)&lt;/Start&gt; Do you recognize this staff? I found it on his body.</string>
<string name="2946">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;(Hold up Journal)&lt;/Start&gt; Me find body of his. Look, his book he write. </string>
<string name="2947">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;(Hold up Journal)&lt;/Start&gt; I found his body. Look, I found his journal. </string>
<string name="2948">Me gots staff stick. Yous gonna have to pay lots.</string>
<string name="2949">I have his staff. You will pay well for it, I think.</string>
<string name="2950">You gots to pay more. Gimmie.</string>
<string name="2951">That&apos;s not enough. I demand more.</string>
<string name="2952">That okay. You take staff.</string>
<string name="2953">That will do nicely. Take the staff.</string>
<string name="2954">Me gots staff he had. You just have it. Me give.</string>
<string name="2955">I have his staff. You can simply have it.</string>
<string name="2956">Me wants pay for book he wroted.</string>
<string name="2957">I demand payment for his journal.</string>
<string name="2958">No, that not enough.</string>
<string name="2959">No, that&apos;s not enough.</string>
<string name="2960">That good. Take dumb book.</string>
<string name="2961">That will do nicely. Take the lousy journal.</string>
<string name="2962">Then you gets nothing.</string>
<string name="2963">Well, then you get nothing.</string>
<string name="2964">Me gots book. What me need book for? You just takes it.</string>
<string name="2965">I have his journal. I will give it to you.</string>
<string name="2966">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; No, there nothing else me find.</string>
<string name="2967">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; No, there was nothing else that I found.</string>
<string name="2968">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me see him dead. Honest. You believe because it true.</string>
<string name="2969">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I swear to you, I saw his body. You will have to accept my word.</string>
<string name="2970">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; No, there nothing. Me sorry.</string>
<string name="2971">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I&apos;m sorry. There was nothing.</string>
<string name="2972">Me got&apos;s nothing more to says to you.</string>
<string name="2973">I have nothing more to say to you.</string>
<string name="2974">That... that staff is an heirloom of our family... he would not abandon it. He must be dead. I have to believe you. I have to...</string>
<string name="2975">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I will not accept this. Perhaps he had a journal, but I have never seen it. No, this could be anyone&apos;s. I will not even look at it.</string>
<string name="2976">If you wish to convince me of his death, bring me the family staff he carried as an heirloom. He would never abandon it. Until then, I will maintain my vigil.</string>
<string name="2977">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You hold that book with no doubt in your eyes. I... I have to believe you. I... I did not even know he wrote. </string>
<string name="2978">And you... what is your intention, then? You have his journal... was there anything else? He had a family heirloom that I would request be returned.</string>
<string name="2979">Price? Let me get this straight... you want me me to pay for the possessions of my dead brother? What kind of opportunist are you?</string>
<string name="2980">Well, I guess I have no choice. If I want my family heirloom that my brother carried to his DYING DAY, I guess I have to pay.</string>
<string name="2981">Well, so be it. Here is my offer then. I have 400 gold. No more, no less. I assume it will be enough?</string>
<string name="2982">Listen, I have nothing more! That&apos;s it! I&apos;m not going to waste time bargaining! I have 400! Take it or don&apos;t, but don&apos;t taunt me further!</string>
<string name="2983">I simply can&apos;t. I have already paid for his journal. I simply have no more gold to give.</string>
<string name="2984">I see. Well, it would appear that if I want these last written words of my brother, I have no choice.</string>
<string name="2985">Very well, then. I have 400 gold, no more, no less. I assume it will be enough?</string>
<string name="2986">It has to be! I have nothing more! No nonsense bargaining! Whether you take it or don&apos;t, just stop taunting me!</string>
<string name="2987">And you take your dirty, filthy gold! I hope you choke on it! Now, was there anything else, or are you done bleeding me?</string>
<string name="2988">You can demand all you want, but it won&apos;t happen. I have paid for the heirloom staff my brother carried already. I have nothing else to give. Nothing.</string>
<string name="2989">Walk away then, dog. You are despicable. I hope the spirit of my brother haunts your dreams!</string>
<string name="2990">I have been given his Journal. You must have found his staff. Must I be forced to purchase a treasured family heirloom?</string>
<string name="2991">His staff was freely given. Dare you viloate the spirit of that gift by demanding payment for whatever else my brother carried?</string>
<string name="2992">I am continually beset by the worst of our society. Isn&apos;t it enough that I have already had to purchase his journal? I can pay no more!</string>
<string name="2993">I have had to purchase the family staff already. I have nothing left to give for the return of anything else of his. There is simply nothing I can offer.</string>
<string name="2994">This is a cruel jest. Leave me to my mourning. I don&apos;t have the patience for this sort of thing right now.</string>
<string name="2995">I thank you. I tell you, this has been a trying night. Having to pay for something that should be respected... horrible. At least your gift is my last memory.</string>
<string name="2996">I have no gold left to give as a reward, but I thank you. Now please, leave me to my thoughts</string>
<string name="2997">Are you quite certain? You had the strangest look on your face when you said that. I am very perceptive of such things.</string>
<string name="2998">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You seem to be speaking the truth. I will trust you, though I am certain he carried more. I doubt I will be able to put it out of my mind. . .</string>
<string name="2999">If you find anything else... well, I guess there&apos;s no real point in looking. Thank you anyway.</string>
<string name="3000">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I require solid proof! Produce his possessions and I will believe. Until then, I will trust him to return!</string>
<string name="3001">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You say that with no signs of a lie. None at all. I have to believe you. Damn it all, I have to. He&apos;s dead...</string>
<string name="3002">What is your intention, then? Did he have anything on him? There was an heirloom that he carried... a staff. I would dearly love to have it returned.</string>
<string name="3003">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Your eyes shift... almost imperceptibly... but I see the movement. You dog... you convince me of my brother&apos;s death and then try to steal his things!</string>
<string name="3004">What did you find, then? I demand to know! I demand it!</string>
<string name="3005">Thief! Scoundrel! Walk away then, but know that you take a piece of my brother with you! I hope it haunts you!</string>
<string name="3006">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I see... then I have nothing left of him. If you don&apos;t mind, I don&apos;t really feel like talking right now. Please leave me.</string>
<string name="3007">It is strange, yes? The evil that grows within people when others are weak? I am glad my brother did not live to see what people are capable of.</string>
<string name="3008">Hello there... I gave that magic key-thing to you, didn&apos;t I? Oh, I&apos;m just so worried about my brother that I don&apos;t know which way is up.</string>
<string name="3009">Please, investigate that cult estate north of here. Please find my brother. I wish I could help... I&apos;m not much use when things get dangerous. I know they are up to something in there, though.</string>

<string name="3021">Me? Oh, I&apos;m nobody, really. Folks around here kind of look to me as a representative of the militia, but I&apos;m no guard. Unofficial rank, I guess you&apos;d call it.</string>
<string name="3022">Still, they like me well enough that I can get things done. That&apos;s valuable, you know? More so than uniforms and whatnot. So, what&apos;s on your mind?</string>
<string name="3023">Me? Harben Ashensmith. I just have a bit of unofficial rank because the people around here respect me. I did some things in the old days and made a few friends.</string>

<string name="3040">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="3041">Me just wants to axe some questions.</string>
<string name="3042">I just want to ask some simple questions.</string>
<string name="3043">Why me not go in big house?</string>
<string name="3044">Why can&apos;t I enter the estate?</string>
<string name="3045">Yous really not gonna do nothing if me go in?</string>
<string name="3046">You really won&apos;t do anything if I go in?</string>
<string name="3047">Why it not be safe?</string>
<string name="3048">Why isn&apos;t it safe?</string>
<string name="3049">You knows Docks places real good?</string>
<string name="3050">Do you know the Docks district very well?</string>
<string name="3051">Maybe me go back to other stuff me ask yous</string>
<string name="3052">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="3053">Me look for work.</string>
<string name="3054">I&apos;m looking for work.</string>
<string name="3055">You know stuff &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="3056">Do you know anything about the Wailing Death?</string>
<string name="3057">Who be you?</string>
<string name="3058">Who are you?</string>
<string name="3059">What do yous want? I knows by the look of yous that yous ain&apos;t no friend of Mr. Androd. Why yous got to bother me?</string>
<string name="3060">Hmm? What yous want? Yous ain&apos;t no friend of Mr. Androd, so yous shouldn&apos;t be bothering me.</string>
<string name="3061">Hey yous! Why yous gotta bother me? Sure, yous look like a noble-type, but only friends of Mr. Androd is supposed to come here. </string>
<string name="3062">Fare yous well... just don&apos;t cause me trouble.</string>
<string name="3063">Ahh, I don&apos;t answer questions good. If&apos;n I could, I wouldn&apos;t be standing in front of some stupid noble-type home.</string>
<string name="3064">Why would yous want to? There&apos;s guys in there that will kill yous real bad. I don&apos;t want to fight anyone, but they loves it.</string>
<string name="3065">Bah, if yous can crack the door, what do I care? I don&apos;t even want this job, and I sure ain&apos;t spoiling for a fight.</string>
<string name="3066">I don&apos;t really care much. This ain&apos;t my house, so why should I try to stop people from going in? If they are stupid enough to risk it... not my business.</string>
<string name="3067">It&apos;s not like I&apos;m a good guard, too. I mean, the door is already open. Yous could just walk in. I&apos;m telling yous, it just ain&apos;t safe, though.</string>
<string name="3068">Look, it ain&apos;t my house, so why should I care? I mean, I guess I get paid to protect it, but not enough to risk my neck.</string>
<string name="3069">Why do yous think? Why would Mr. Androd leave a nobody like me out here if&apos;n he didn&apos;t have bloodthirsty *real* guards inside? They are rough!</string>
<string name="3070">Hired mercenaries, I think. I&apos;ll just stay out here, thank yous very much. Yous wanna go in, that&apos;s yous business.</string>
<string name="3071">Thought I used to, but it&apos;s goin&apos; crazy now. Thieves is everywhere! I seen people getting mugged all over the place.</string>
<string name="3072">I just lay low. I don&apos;t want to know why people are so crazy, and I for sure don&apos;t want to get involved. I just stay out of the way.</string>
<string name="3073">If people with sense ain&apos;t getting hired, I imagine yous gonna have an even worse time. Not that I&apos;m looking to insult yous or anything.</string>
<string name="3074">Good luck, that&apos;s all I got to say. Nobody hiring. I took this job and I don&apos;t even want it. It&apos;s all there was, though.</string>
<string name="3075">What I know I wish I didn&apos;t. I seen people die of it. They go out screaming... crazy... like they would attack their own mothers at the end.</string>
<string name="3076">I hopes I don&apos;t get it, but I guess that ain&apos;t up to me. Ain&apos;t up to anyone, seems like.</string>
<string name="3077">Name is Burt. I&apos;m just the guard here. Don&apos;t like it none, but times is rough, eh? I hate this guy, though. Hate him.</string>
<string name="3078">This Mr. Androd, he&apos;s fussy and too bloody rich for his own good. Talks to me like I don&apos;t know the job. I know it... I just don&apos;t want to do it.</string>
<string name="3079">Besides, he don&apos;t even need me. he&apos;s got guys inside that&apos;ll kill yous twice over. I&apos;m just taking up space. Bah!</string>
<string name="3080">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="3081">Me got question me want ask.</string>
<string name="3082">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="3083">Why me not go in big house?</string>
<string name="3084">Why can&apos;t I enter the estate?</string>
<string name="3085">Yous really not gonna do nothing if me go in?</string>
<string name="3086">You really won&apos;t do anything if I go in?</string>
<string name="3087">Why it not be safe?</string>
<string name="3088">Why isn&apos;t it safe?</string>
<string name="3089">There be interesting stuff happen here in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="3090">Anything interesting going on here in Blacklake?</string>
<string name="3091">Maybe me go back to other stuff me ask yous</string>
<string name="3092">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="3093">Me look for work.</string>
<string name="3094">I&apos;m looking for work.</string>
<string name="3095">You know stuff &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="3096">Do you know anything about the Wailing Death?</string>
<string name="3097">Who be you?</string>
<string name="3098">Who are you?</string>
<string name="3099">Get lost! Only guests of Mr. Rumbottom are allowed in. Please, I&apos;m just doing my job.</string>
<string name="3100">You better step back. Mr. Rumbottom does not permit strangers to enter his estate.</string>
<string name="3101">I&apos;m sorry, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Only guests of Mr. Rumbottom are permitted past this point. The guards inside deal harshly with anyone that enters the estate.</string>
<string name="3102">Goodbye, then. Don&apos;t mind me.</string>
<string name="3103">I... I don&apos;t get the chance to speak with people all that often. I&apos;m usually caring for Mr. Rumbottom&apos;s horse, but he claims to have... lost it. Now I&apos;m a guard. </string>
<string name="3104">I&apos;m sorry, I do tend to ramble. What is it you wanted?</string>
<string name="3105">I don&apos;t mean to suggest you are not being smart, but have I not mentioned the guards inside? I know I&apos;m no threat...</string>
<string name="3106">I don&apos;t really care if you go in or not. This isn&apos;t my proper job, and I don&apos;t feel like losing my life over it. I&apos;m not really much of a fighter.</string>
<string name="3107">I&apos;m just a stable-hand, really. This seems like pretty dangerous stuff for what I make. Especially since I would expect to lose any fight I started.</string>
<string name="3108">The door is already open anyway. You could just walk in. I wouldn&apos;t do it, though. It&apos;s not safe. There are guards - real ones, not like me.</string>
<string name="3109">I told you, I&apos;m no guard. I don&apos;t make enough gold to get in your way. I say it ain&apos;t safe, but what you do is your business.</string>
<string name="3110">The guards inside are real tough. I&apos;m not sure why Mr. Rumbottom didn&apos;t put them out here. Maybe he wants them as a surprise for burglars. I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="3111">They attack on sight. Nothing more than killers, really. Working as a guard just lets them hurt people legally. I don&apos;t like them much.</string>
<string name="3112">I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m not familiar with this area at all. I usually just tend to the horses, trying to stay out of the way.</string>
<string name="3113">Old Worthington in the stables used to know a lot about politics and such, but he died last week. Anything else you need?</string>
<string name="3114">Eh, I think most of the nobles are looking for... quicker help. Not that you&apos;re slow, I meant no offence.</string>
<string name="3115">Sorry, if I knew of any work worth having I&apos;d probably take the job myself. Anything to get away from guarding this bloody door.</string>
<string name="3116">I wish I did. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m supposed to do - worse, I don&apos;t know what *not* to do. People just seem to get it without warning.</string>
<string name="3117">But, that&apos;s nothing you haven&apos;t heard before, I&apos;m sure. Was there anything else?</string>
<string name="3118">Oh, I&apos;m just watching the door, though I&apos;m not sure why. This isn&apos;t my proper job. I care for animals. I&apos;m no fighter. The pay ain&apos;t worth it.</string>
<string name="3119">Mr. Rumbottom has become concerned that his security is not up to snuff, so he&apos;s thrown a bunch of people at the problem. You should see the brutes inside. Vicious lot.</string>
<string name="3120">But who am I to question the oh-so-important merchant nobility. Mr. Rumbottom does as he wishes, though I swear I&apos;ve never swung a sword in my life.</string>
<string name="3121">Tough loss, that one. Fashi is good. You did your best... though I couldn&apos;t tell from looking.</string>
<string name="3122">Tough break. Better luck next time. My gold will be on Agar, of course, but good luck anyway.</string>

&quot;The plague spreads more quickly than we could possibly have hoped; the streets are thick with corpses and the citizens are on the verge of open rebellion. Soon Neverwinter will be brought to its knees and the next phase can begin!

&quot;But this will not happen if a cure for the Wailing Death is discovered. You must do everything in your power to prevent Aribeth and her agents from ending the plague.&quot;

This note should be shown to someone in authority.</string>
<string name="3151">In place of a signature, this letter bears the mark of a stylized, reptilian eye. Other than this marking, there is nothing to indicate who the author may be: 

&quot;Our agent within Neverwinter has informed us that several of the Waterdhavian Creatures have been delivered to Aribeth and are now stored in the safety of Castle Never. If all of the creatures are recovered a cure for the Wailing Death will be discovered, and our efforts will be for naught.

&quot;It will not be possible for our agent to orchestrate an attack upon
Castle Never, as was done with the Academy. Those who serve Lady Aribeth must be stopped before they deliver the creatures to the safety of the castle, at any cost.

&quot;Should you succeed in this your rewards will surpass your grandest imaginings. Should you fail, you will feel pain and suffering such as no mortal was meant to bear. &quot;Long live the People of the Eye.&quot;

Excerpt:
The old fool has to be somewhere! Even Vengaul can&apos;t disappear into thin air. I want patrols by the ship, and I want someone to get a hold of that damn wench he favors. She&apos;s usually around the Seedy Tavern somewhere. Take her downstairs and find out where Vengaul would hide himself. Shut down all his plans, boys, and when we find that fool we&apos;ll be rich as kings! I won&apos;t let him give up the chance at the largest ransom we&apos;ve ever seen! We&apos;re doing things MY way now.

<string name="3191">Trouble in No-Man&apos;s-Land</string>
<string name="3192">A man name Cendran is wandering the plague-ravaged no-man&apos;s-land between the City Core and the Blacklake district. He claims that after the nobles put up their barricade to keep the plague out, a half-orc named Loxar took advantage of the chaos caused by plague-maddened thugs and eventually killed everyone. Now this community of servants is all but destroyed, and Cendran hopes someone will kill the beast.</string>
<string name="3193">A huge half-orc named Loxar put up quite a fight in the no-man&apos;s-land between the Blacklake and the City Core. Likely, he had taken advantage of the chaos of the plague and killed and looted as he saw fit. Doubtless there would be someone around there that wanted him dead.</string>
<string name="3194">The huge half-orc that Cendran spoke of is dead, his head cleanly cut from his shoulders. Cendran will likely want to see proof of the deed before his fears are finally put to rest.</string>
<string name="3195">Cendran has been told that the half-orc Loxar is dead. It will not bring his fellows back, but any justice in this difficult time is probably welcome.</string>

<string name="3847">&lt;StartAction&gt;Tell Aarin about the Words of Power.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="3848">Let me see what you have. Hmmm... this is excellent work, my friend. It does not, however, tell us where the cult is headquartered, only where other cultists may be found.</string>
<string name="3849">If you find these other cultists, perhaps they will have information on where to find their base and their leader, this... Maugrim.</string>
<string name="3850">We need something that tells us where their base is... as well as a second piece that backs up the first, so we know it to be true. We cannot afford to be deceived.</string>
<string name="3851">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I... have no desire to speak of her, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is no fault of yours. Perhaps another time.</string>
<string name="3852">Let us return to your questions and speak no more of me.</string>
<string name="3853">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I do not think so, my friend. You have far more important things to focus on other than I. Ask me another time, perhaps.</string>
<string name="3854">Well done, my friend. I knew Lord Nasher&apos;s faith in you was well-justified. Come, then... tell me what you have learned.</string>
<string name="3855">I see. This enemy is far more elusive than I suspected, even, for the name of this Maugrim is unfamiliar to me... as is this creature you describe as his mistress.</string>
<string name="3856">That Lady Aribeth has fallen to become a blackguard and even lead their gathering army is... is far worse than anything I had feared. Dire, dire news indeed.</string>
<string name="3857">But... what of this Maugrim&apos;s purpose, my friend? Were you able to discover anything of the reasoning behind all this madness?</string>
<string name="3858">This is perhaps the first good news I have heard so far. It shows us that we are ignorant of much and must catch up quickly if we are to survive... but at least you have brought us hope.</string>
<string name="3859">Come then... let us return to Lord Nasher quickly and relate what you have discovered. Then perhaps we will see what must be done next.</string>
<string name="3860">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask how to possess the familiar.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="3861">To possess your familiar, access your radial menu and select your Special Abilities. If your familiar has already been summoned, an option to Possess Familiar should appear in your Wizard or Sorcerer sub-menu.</string>
<string name="3862">When the Possess Familiar option is selected, you will now control the familiar directly. Your character remains where you left &lt;him/her&gt;, uncontrolled.</string>
<string name="3863">When you are finished, access the familiar&apos;s radial menu. At the bottom should be an option to Unpossess Familiar. This will return you to the direct control of your character.</string>
<string name="3864">Me too busy for this now, gnome boy!</string>
<string name="3865">Not now, Boddyknock! I&apos;m kind of busy here!</string>
<string name="3866">Me not want to hear it. We got big fight ahead.</string>
<string name="3867">Good, keep quiet. We&apos;ve got business to take care of!</string>
<string name="3868">Me sorry. You tell me what you got to say.</string>
<string name="3869">I&apos;m sorry. Please go on.</string>
<string name="3870">What you want, little gnome friend?</string>
<string name="3871">Yes, Boddyknock - what is it?</string>
<string name="3872">What you point, gnome?</string>
<string name="3873">Get to the point, Boddyknock.</string>
<string name="3874">Enough talk, gnome! Morag not be dead yet! We still got work to do!</string>
<string name="3875">Save it, gnome. Our work here isn&apos;t done.</string>
<string name="3876">Thanks. That mean a lot to me, Boddyknock.</string>
<string name="3877">Thank you, Boddyknock. That means a lot to me.</string>
<string name="3878">*Sigh* Me big hero now, so me guess lots of people gonna be in awe when me come around.</string>
<string name="3879">*Sigh* I guess people holding me in awe is the burden of being a hero.</string>
<string name="3880">Me not do it alone. You help me lots, Daelan.</string>
<string name="3881">I didn&apos;t do it alone. You have been a valuable ally throughout my adventures.</string>
<string name="3882">&lt;FirstName&gt;, a moment if I may. I have something to say to you, and I&apos;m afraid that if I don&apos;t say it now I may not get the chance.</string>
<string name="3883">Yes, I understand. All evidence points to the conclusion that our final confrontation is near at hand. If you don&apos;t want to hear what I have to say then I&apos;ll keep my observations to myself.</string>
<string name="3884">Onward, then. I&apos;ll follow you as I always do.</string>
<string name="3885">All evidence points to the logical conclusion that our final confrontation with Morag is near at hand, and there&apos;s something you should know.</string>
<string name="3886">I left my home of Lantan on a journey of discovery, eager to experience all the world had to offer. In our time together I have seen wonders I could not have imagined and experienced adventures I can barely believe myself.</string>
<string name="3887">But what still amazes me most through all of this, &lt;FirstName&gt;, is you yourself. The legend you have forged in the North, all the great deeds you have accomplished - I admit that at times I am somewhat in awe of you.</string>
<string name="3888">I want you to know that I&apos;m proud to have been a part of this, even if it&apos;s only a small part. It&apos;s not often a simple gnome from a tiny island like mine gets to be a part of a legend in the making.</string>
<string name="3889">If we get out of this alive I&apos;ll be able to return to Lantan with marvelous tales; stories that will be the envy of everyone on my island home. I&apos;ve got you to thank for that, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="3890">I don&apos;t know what fate has in store for us, or if we even have a chance in this coming battle. But I&apos;m with you to the end, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You can count on me.</string>
<string name="3891">You&apos;re right, of course. I just... I just felt it needed to be said before... well, before we go up against Morag.</string>
<string name="3892">Yes, well... I know this wasn&apos;t really the best time for this. Hardly logical for me to get all sentimental on you now, is it? But I just felt it needed to be said before - well, before we go up against Morag.</string>
<string name="3893">I may have had some small hand in this, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but make no mistake: you are the true hero here, not me. Yours is the name the history chronicles will remember... if we survive the coming battle.</string>
<string name="3894">Me too busy for this now, orcy-boy!</string>
<string name="3895">Me not want to hear it. We got big fight ahead.</string>
<string name="3896">Good, keep quiet. We&apos;ve got business to take care of!</string>
<string name="3897">Me sorry. You tell me what you got to say.</string>
<string name="3898">I&apos;m sorry. Please go on.</string>
<string name="3899">Not now, Daelan! I&apos;m kind of busy here!</string>
<string name="3900">What you want, Daelan friend?</string>
<string name="3901">Yes, Daelan - what is it?</string>
<string name="3902">Me not no hero - me only in this for the money!</string>
<string name="3903">Don&apos;t paint me as something I&apos;m not - I&apos;m only in this for the money!</string>
<string name="3904">*Sigh* Me big hero now, so me guess lots of people gonna be in awe when me come around.</string>
<string name="3905">*Sigh* I guess people holding me in awe is the burden of being a hero.</string>
<string name="3906">Me not do it alone. You help me lots, Daelan.</string>
<string name="3907">I didn&apos;t do it alone. You have been a valuable ally throughout my adventures.</string>
<string name="3908">Enough talk, ocry-boy! Morag not be dead yet! We still got work to do!</string>
<string name="3909">Save it, Daelan. Our work here isn&apos;t done.</string>
<string name="3910">Thanks. That mean a lot to me, Daelan.</string>
<string name="3911">Thank you, Daelan. That means a lot to me.</string>
<string name="3912">&lt;FirstName&gt;, I have something I wish to say, and I fear if I do not say it now I may never again have the chance.</string>
<string name="3913">I understand, of course. We march toward a great battle; if you do not wish to hear my words I shall keep them to myself. </string>
<string name="3914">Let us press forward, then, to meet our fate with the courage of our ancestors.</string>
<string name="3915">The signs are clear, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We march toward a great battle against a foe we may not be able to defeat. If I am to face my possible death with honor there are words I must say to you.</string>
<string name="3916">I am born of the Red Tiger but I left my tribe to prove myself worthy; to prove the spirit of the Uthgardt was within me. I left to earn my honor and prove myself a hero.</string>
<string name="3917">I have fought many battles by your side, &lt;FirstName&gt; and now I see what a true hero is. You are a &lt;man/woman&gt; of great honor, &lt;FirstName&gt; and I am humbled in your presence.</string>
<string name="3918">I judge you on your deeds and not your motives, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Whatever your reasons, you are the savior of Neverwinter. You have forged a legend throughout the North.</string>
<string name="3919">My axe and bow are joined to your cause, but you are the one who deserves the glory, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are the savior of Neverwinter, you are the one who has forged a legend throughout the North.</string>
<string name="3920">I am proud to have served by your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You have brought honor to me and allowed me to prove myself worthy of my tribe.</string>
<string name="3921">If we survive the coming battle I shall return to the people born of the Red Tiger. They will know of our deeds together and they will welcome me into the tribe, because I have proven the spirit of the Uthgardt is strong within me.</string>
<string name="3922">For this I thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know not what fate awaits us, or if the coming battle shall be my last. But I swear on the honor of my people that I will stand with you to the end.</string>
<string name="3923">You speak the truth, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The enemy yet lies before us, and the battle yet awaits.</string>
<string name="3924">I only speak what I know in my heart to be true, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But our enemy yet lies before us and the battle yet awaits.</string>
<string name="3925">Me not haves time for stupid stuff.</string>
<string name="3926">You makes it quick, runt.</string>
<string name="3927">What you wants, Tomi?</string>
<string name="3928">I don&apos;t have time for your nonsense.</string>
<string name="3929">Me say forget it!</string>
<string name="3930">You asking me laters, then.</string>
<string name="3931">Huh. That be new. Okay, you spits it out.</string>
<string name="3932">I said forget it.</string>
<string name="3933">Ask me later, then.</string>
<string name="3934">Well, that&apos;s new. Spit it out.</string>
<string name="3935">Make it quick, halfling.</string>
<string name="3936">What is it, Tomi?</string>
<string name="3937">The be no time to talk &apos;bout that stuff.</string>
<string name="3938">Me not intends to die.</string>
<string name="3939">You be scareds of dying, huh?</string>
<string name="3940">You knows good. You tells me.</string>
<string name="3941">This is not the time for a philosophical discussion.</string>
<string name="3942">I don&apos;t intend to die.</string>
<string name="3943">Are you afraid of dying, Tomi?</string>
<string name="3944">You should know. You tell me.</string>
<string name="3945">You pulls together!</string>
<string name="3946">You thinks of better way to die, maybe?</string>
<string name="3947">You no worry, Tomi. You is too lucky to die.</string>
<string name="3948">You not backs out on me, is you?</string>
<string name="3949">Pull yourself together, already.</string>
<string name="3950">Look at it this way: can you think of a better way to go?</string>
<string name="3951">Don&apos;t worry, Tomi. You&apos;re too lucky to die.</string>
<string name="3952">Are you backing out on me, then?</string>
<string name="3953">We goes, now...</string>
<string name="3954">You watches it, or me kills you myself.</string>
<string name="3955">Me so glad you approves.</string>
<string name="3956">Let&apos;s just move on...</string>
<string name="3957">Watch it, or I kill you myself.</string>
<string name="3958">So glad you approve.</string>
<string name="3959">Eh. Not really, nah. You know what to do, don&apos;t ya?</string>
<string name="3960">Huh. So all this is finally gettin&apos; close to the end, is it? You can hear that fat lady clearin&apos; her throat already. Mind if I ask ya a question, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="3961">It&apos;s not nonsense! It&apos;s a, umm... what do ya call it? It&apos;s a serious question.</string>
<string name="3962">Whoa! A bit touchy, ain&apos;t we? Somebody steal your oatmeal? I bet it&apos;s just nerves... I know what ya mean.</string>
<string name="3963">O-oookay. If there IS a later, you know what I&apos;m saying? Not that I want to make ya nervous or anything, champ.</string>
<string name="3964">I gotta admit, though, I&apos;ve been lookin&apos; forward to this all day. Let&apos;s go teach the lizard bitch to stay dead! Woot!</string>
<string name="3965">Well... what are your thoughts on death? You know... the permanent kind.</string>
<string name="3966">Really? Seems like the perfect time, if ya ask me. As a matter of fact, I could sit here and talk about it alllll day...</string>
<string name="3967">Well that&apos;s easy for YOU to say. I&apos;m the sidekick, remember? The sidekicks ALWAYS die.</string>
<string name="3968">I dunno. I&apos;ve never given it much thought. There seems to be major potential here for me to wet my breeches over, ya know.</string>
<string name="3969">That&apos;s different. When a halfling&apos;s time is up, his time is up. The gods don&apos;t play around with that stuff, ya know.</string>
<string name="3970">You know just the thing to say every time, don&apos;t ya? Ahhh, it&apos;s the Undergallows charm at work. You want me, it&apos;s obvious. But that&apos;s okay.</string>
<string name="3971">You know just the thing to say every time, don&apos;t ya? You sweet-talker, you. Ha ha!</string>
<string name="3972">Hmm... well, how about that? I can&apos;t. I really can&apos;t. Wow, ya make a great case, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. </string>
<string name="3973">You know... you&apos;re right! I am too lucky to die! It&apos;s the Undergallows destiny to be rich and adored by halfling lasses throughout Faerun, after all.</string>
<string name="3974">Back out? Are you kidding? Miss the fight of the century? Miss all that glory and riches, the chance to be adored by halfling lasses everywhere?</string>
<string name="3975">I guess if I do kick the bucket, I&apos;ll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there! And if I don&apos;t die: I&apos;m a hero! It&apos;s all good!</string>
<string name="3976">Ya know, you aren&apos;t so bad, yourself. You&apos;ll make some lad a fine wife some day, I bet.</string>
<string name="3977">Ya know, you aren&apos;t so bad, yourself. You&apos;ll make a fine hero one day, if I don&apos;t miss my guess.</string>
<string name="3978">I hear ya. Now let&apos;s go teach that lizard bitch to stay dead! Woot!</string>
<string name="3979">Me too busy for this now, monk!</string>
<string name="3980">Not now, Grimgnaw! I&apos;m kind of busy here!</string>
<string name="3981">Me not want to hear it. We got big fight ahead.</string>
<string name="3982">Good, keep quiet. We&apos;ve got business to take care of!</string>
<string name="3983">No, you tell me what you got to say.</string>
<string name="3984">No, tell me what you have to say.</string>
<string name="3985">What you want, Grimgnaw?</string>
<string name="3986">Yes, Grimgnaw - what is it?</string>
<string name="3987">Me only kill when me got no other choice.</string>
<string name="3988">I only kill when I have to, Grimgnaw.</string>
<string name="3989">*Sigh* Me big hero now, so me guess lots of people gonna be in awe when me come around.</string>
<string name="3990">*Sigh* I guess people holding me in awe is the burden of being a hero.</string>
<string name="3991">You not worry, Grimgnaw. You good at killing people, too.</string>
<string name="3992">Don&apos;t sell yourself short, Grimgnaw. You spread as much bloodshed as I do.</string>
<string name="3993">Enough talk, dwarf! Morag not be dead yet! We still got work to do!</string>
<string name="3994">Save it, dwarf. Our work here isn&apos;t done.</string>
<string name="3995">You talk like you think you gonna die in this fight!</string>
<string name="3996">Are you saying you expect to die in this battle?</string>
<string name="3997">&lt;FirstName&gt;, there is something I must tell you, something I would say now, before the Silent Lord claims me and forever stills my breath.</string>
<string name="3998">I understand, &lt;FirstName&gt;. A great slaughter is coming. If you care nothing for my words, I shall not deny you the pleasure of savoring the impending death and destruction.</string>
<string name="3999">Let us deliver Morag into the hands of my master, that Death may finally claim her!</string>
<string name="4000">A great slaughter is coming, a magnificent feast of bloodshed and death has been laid before the Silent Lord. But before my master gorges himself, there is something you must hear. </string>
<string name="4001">I have devoted myself to the worship and service of the Silent Lord, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I exist only to deliver others into the grasp of my master; I am an instrument of Death.</string>
<string name="4002">To serve my master I have fought at your side. I have seen the mark of the Silent Lord upon you, and I am humbled in your presence. You have been touched by Death, and all living creatures tremble at your approach.</string>
<string name="4003">You still refuse to see admit the truth. But I have seen with my own eyes the gruesome fate of those who oppose you.</string>
<string name="4004">I have delivered many into the service of the Silent Lord in our time together, but you have always been the catalyst of my actions. It is only at your side that my potential has been fully realized.</string>
<string name="4005">Since joining you in your quest I have seen Death in all its glory, and I have at last achieved an enlightened understanding of the Silent Lord that surpasses even the teachings of my Order.</string>
<string name="4006">It may be my time to bow down to the Silent Lord in this coming battle; but at last I am truly ready to accept his claim upon me. For this I thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4007">Your words are true. The maw of the Silent Lord gapes wide, eager to feast upon the Old Ones who cheated him of his just due through their hibernation within the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="4008">The maw of the Silent Lord gapes wide, eager to feast upon the Old Ones who have cheated him of his just due with their hibernation within the Source Stone. I would willingly sacrifice my own life to feed my master&apos;s hunger.</string>
<string name="4009">Me too busy, you quiet now, Linu.</string>
<string name="4010">I&apos;m too busy right now, Linu.</string>
<string name="4011">Me gots no time for you whining. We go now. </string>
<string name="4012">I have no time for your chatter. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="4013">*Sigh* Okay. What you want say? </string>
<string name="4014">*Sigh* All right. What did you want to say? </string>
<string name="4015">What you want talk &apos;bout, Linu?</string>
<string name="4016">Yes Linu, what did you want to talk about?</string>
<string name="4017">Ya big deal. We go now, right?</string>
<string name="4018">What ever. Let&apos;s just get going, okay?</string>
<string name="4019">That be part of hero job. Me must make others be strong too.</string>
<string name="4020">That&apos;s the job of a hero. We inspire others to greatness.</string>
<string name="4021">You be hero like me, Linu. We be team.</string>
<string name="4022">We have been a team, Linu. You too are a hero.</string>
<string name="4023">Okay, Linu, me get point.</string>
<string name="4024">Okay Linu, I get the point.</string>
<string name="4025">&apos;Nuff talk. We go fight now.</string>
<string name="4026">Enough speeches, we need to get going now.</string>
<string name="4027">Thank you, Linu.</string>
<string name="4028">Linu, me not see you do clumsy things whole time we be team. Maybe you just be nervous lots?</string>
<string name="4029">Linu, in all the time we have been together, you have never done any of these clumsy things. Maybe it&apos;s just a lack of confidence.</string>
<string name="4030">Dear &lt;FirstName&gt;, I would like to talk to you for a moment.</string>
<string name="4031">Of... of course you are. It was foolish of me to interrupt you; I had just wanted to share something with you, but it is of no matter.</string>
<string name="4032">Then we face our destiny together.</string>
<string name="4033">We are about to go into a desperate battle, where we might lose our lives &lt;FullName&gt;. I feel that I need to share something with you.</string>
<string name="4034">This battle that we face with Morag frightens me desperately. I didn&apos;t think I would ever be able to face this day, though I have known it would come for some time now.</string>
<string name="4035">Yet now that the time has come at last, I find that I have mastered my fear, and it is all because of you. I have drawn courage from following the greatest hero of our time - &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4036">All right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I won&apos;t waste any more of your time with my boring thoughts.</string>
<string name="4037">Well, I need all the inspiration I can get. If it weren&apos;t for you I would still be trapped or dead in a plague-ridden NeverWinter.</string>
<string name="4038">Thank you for the compliment, but I would still be trapped or dead in a plague-ridden NeverWinter if it weren&apos;t for you.</string>
<string name="4039">That&apos;s if I hadn&apos;t managed to burn the entire city down around me. I can&apos;t tell you the number of nightmares I&apos;ve had about this coming battle, where I would slip in some blood and knock you into a huge chasm.</string>
<string name="4040">Or I would start to cast a healing spell and it would go wrong and you&apos;d be turned inside out. Or you would be just about to kill Morag and I&apos;d lean against a giant boulder that would fall over and crush you.</string>
<string name="4041">I have learned from your confidence and skill, and I truly believe that, no matter what happens next, I am a stronger, better person than I was when we first met.</string>
<string name="4042">I know now that I can have all the grace and elegance of my elven ancestors. I just have to believe in myself.</string>
<string name="4043">That is a lesson I don&apos;t think I would have learned without you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4044">I couldn&apos;t agree more.</string>
<string name="4045">Now let&apos;s go show them what legends are made of and kick some scaly-ass!</string>
<string name="4046">I was just about to say that.</string>
<string name="4047">Only that me brings your loud mouth along.</string>
<string name="4048">Me regret we not kissed. That counts?</string>
<string name="4049">No. Me has no regrets.</string>
<string name="4050">A few, maybes.</string>
<string name="4051">Only that I brought your loud mouth along.</string>
<string name="4052">I regret we&apos;ve never kissed. Does that count?</string>
<string name="4053">No. No regrets.</string>
<string name="4054">A few, perhaps.</string>
<string name="4055">Me not only hero, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="4056">Me like being hero. Is good.</string>
<string name="4057">You not be such big fool. Me does this because coin is good.</string>
<string name="4058">Me doing this because it be right... not to be hero.</string>
<string name="4059">I won&apos;t be the only hero, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="4060">Nothing wrong with being a hero, I suppose.</string>
<string name="4061">Don&apos;t be a fool. I do this because the money is good.</string>
<string name="4062">I&apos;m doing this because it&apos;s right, not to be a hero.</string>
<string name="4063">Bah. Is all foolish business.</string>
<string name="4064">Hmph. They writes what they likes. Me want royalties.</string>
<string name="4065">Me not be any legend...</string>
<string name="4066">Me be happy if things be normal after this.</string>
<string name="4067">Bah. It&apos;s a foolish business.</string>
<string name="4068">They can write what they like, so long as I get the royalties.</string>
<string name="4069">I don&apos;t think I&apos;m a legend...</string>
<string name="4070">I&apos;ll just be happy if things go back to normal after this.</string>
<string name="4071">You gets ahead of things, no?</string>
<string name="4072">Ha! You is on own after this.</string>
<string name="4073">Who know what happens?</string>
<string name="4074">Me too, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="4075">Aren&apos;t you being a bit premature?</string>
<string name="4076">Ha! You&apos;re on your own after this.</string>
<string name="4077">Who knows what will happen?</string>
<string name="4078">So would I, Sharwyn.</string>
<string name="4079">Not really. You&apos;re a grown &lt;man/woman&gt;. I&apos;m sure you can handle yourself and even lead little old me, no?</string>
<string name="4080">So the end draws near, does it? I suppose all tales must end sooner or later. Any regrets, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="4081">Hah! Say what you like, &lt;FirstName&gt;... my own legend is being written right alongside yours, whether you like it or not. I&apos;m glad to play my part.</string>
<string name="4082">But I needn&apos;t speak more and ruffle your feathers. Let&apos;s finish this tale as it should be finished. Shall we?</string>
<string name="4083">Ha ha! Well, I guess some regrets are meant to be, then, aren&apos;t they? Nice try, though.</string>
<string name="4084">It&apos;s not as if you&apos;ll be lacking for company should we succeed, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You&apos;ll be a hero throughout Faerun with women falling at your feet. You know that, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="4085">I don&apos;t know. Maybe. I suspect I could be talked into it... especially since both our deaths could literally be around the next corner.</string>
<string name="4086">I didn&apos;t think so. After all... when this is finally over all of Faerun will celebrate you as a true hero. You know that, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="4087">Truly? Perhaps you will forget them once this is finally over. All of Faerun will celebrate you as a true hero after this. You know that, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="4088">That&apos;s kind of you to say, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Regardless, you will be the one the bards write of when they tell your legend.</string>
<string name="4089">Indeed. You will have earned your place, I think. They will be writing of your legend for an age to come, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4090">I didn&apos;t suggest that all heroes are altruistic paladins... but that&apos;s how they end up somehow, isn&apos;t it? I wonder how bards will write your legend?</string>
<string name="4091">You know, that&apos;s what I like about you. I&apos;ll have to make sure your tale is penned properly. I&apos;m sure I won&apos;t be the only bard eager to write of your legend.</string>
<string name="4092">Well said. I&apos;ll have to remember to quote you on that one.</string>
<string name="4093">Ha! Deny it if you wish, &lt;FirstName&gt;, your fate is sealed.</string>
<string name="4094">I doubt things will ever be truly normal for you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I envy you.</string>
<string name="4095">As for me... I suppose I&apos;ve you to thank for taking me this far. If I live, I think I&apos;ll have my own great tale to find in the years to come. If I&apos;m lucky.</string>
<string name="4096">Of course... that doesn&apos;t mean we need part ways, necessarily. I&apos;ve grown rather fond of our pairing. I&apos;d enjoy continuing our travels, if you would.</string>
<string name="4097">I suppose that&apos;s how it has to be. Too bad. At any rate... we&apos;ve one tale to finish before I go writing the next.</string>
<string name="4098">True enough. I suppose we&apos;ve one tale to finish, first, before I start writing the next, anyway.</string>
<string name="4099">Good. Of course... we&apos;ve one tale to finish, first, before we start writing the next, don&apos;t we?</string>
<string name="4100">Lead away, then, &lt;FirstName&gt;... let&apos;s finish this like it was meant to be.</string>
<string name="4101">The drow are an evil subrace of elves, living deep underground in the dangerous Underdark.</string>
<string name="4102">Baelnorns are elven spellcasters that have used their magic to extend their lives, usually to become a protector to family and friends or as a mentor and teacher to new generations.</string>
<string name="4103">This elixir smells sweet, similar to honeysuckle, and contains a small amount of liquid inside that bubbles faintly. It&apos;s use is unknown, though it is likely a curative of some form.</string>
<string name="4104">Pale imitations of true Bags of Holding, these lesser creations bear only a tenuous connection to the distant planes. Items held within still exist (and therefore retain some portion of their mass) on the Prime Material. The degree to which this is true varies according to the bag&apos;s craftsmanship.

These magic containers are essential for inventory management, and can hold many items, both large and small. The weight of the items within will still be a factor, however, especially when added to that of the container itself.</string>
<string name="4105">Prized by pack rats far and wide, Bags of Holding originated among the mischievous kender in the far-off world of Krynn. According to popular folklore, one enterprising kender actually founded a utopian village inside his Bag of Holding. It apparently continues to thrive to this very day.

<string name="4109">The enchantment on a Wand of Summoning owes much to the ancient magics crafted by followers of forgotten beast totems, though the modern example can hardly be called a divinely inspired tool. Sorcerers and wizards take inspiration from many places, and the resulting mix of incantations can bear little resemblance to the rituals they might have once been a part of.</string>

<string name="4115">Well, I had hoped to give more, but disturbing news has reached me. There were others searching for the tombs as well and... some of what we sought now rests in evil hands.</string>
<string name="4116">I don&apos;t understand how this could have happened, but representatives of Talona have begin taunting us in a most unfriendly fashion... flaunting their theft in our faces.</string>
<string name="4117">You&apos;ll understand if I forgo further reward, won&apos;t you? We will need our resources to try and puzzle out what happened in this search.</string>
<string name="4118">I must apologize, however, if my mood seems somber. I have received word that... that the followers of Talona have laid claim to the artifacts in the tombs we were searching.</string>
<string name="4119">There are no more artifacts for you to find... they have been delivered into the hands of evil. I cannot fathom what has made this possible.</string>
<string name="4120">Needless to say, you are no longer needed for this task. I am sorry...</string>
<string name="4121">Oh dear... you seem to have contracted some form of sickness. You are lucky that it doesn&apos;t appear to be the plague, but I cannot certify you as disease-free until you rid yourself of it.</string>
<string name="4122">I would you suggest you go at once to Aribeth. She will be able to cure this affliction.</string>
<string name="4123">Forgive me. You are still investigating the plague, and I must be thankful for that.</string>
<string name="4124">It is despicable... imagine, our holy relics that we sought... in the hands of evil! We were searching for the ancient tombs... but now there is little point.</string>
<string name="4125">Bye then.</string>
<string name="4126">Farewell.</string>
<string name="4127">Me ask you some stuff?</string>
<string name="4128">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="4129">Yeah, yous too busy scaring animals and kids.</string>
<string name="4130">Yes, I see. Too busy scaring the animals and your children.</string>
<string name="4131">No, no, me think you right. Kids should know they is better than beasts.</string>
<string name="4132">No, You misunderstand. I approve. The children should know where they stand.</string>
<string name="4133">You said it. Me leave now.</string>
<string name="4134">Well said. Sorry to have bothered you.</string>
<string name="4135">Oh yeah, and yelling at animals in stinky cages is best way to show that.</string>
<string name="4136">Of course. And taunting the animals while they huddle in cages is the perfect way to show that.</string>
<string name="4137">Yeah, no hurt. But yous let them rot in there because you better than them.</string>
<string name="4138">Oh, no pain, of course. Just let them rot in there as a symbol of your superiority.</string>
<string name="4139">Me sorry. Bye.</string>
<string name="4140">Forgive my jest. Farewell.</string>
<string name="4141">I know. Yous do a good job of looking like a jerk by youself.</string>
<string name="4142">I know you don&apos;t. You make enough of an ass of yourself alone.</string>
<string name="4143">Bah, me not waste time with yous.</string>
<string name="4144">Don&apos;t worry. I won&apos;t waste my time on you.</string>
<string name="4145">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; I would guess you are afraid of the plague. At least here you still think you have control.</string>
<string name="4146">Yes, yes, just go.</string>
<string name="4147">Most certainly not. I don&apos;t waste my time with guards or other rabble. Go protect some wench. I don&apos;t need you here.</string>
<string name="4148">What did you say to me? Listen, &lt;boy/girl&gt;, I am important. I don&apos;t need to take that kind of abuse from the likes of you.</string>
<string name="4149">Er... yes... yes, that is what I intended. Especially in these strained times. The beasts are below and we are above. Remembering that gives us strength.</string>
<string name="4150">Well... you don&apos;t want to cause the beast too much discomfort... I don&apos;t mean...</string>
<string name="4151">Now see here, I don&apos;t need your veiled insults!</string>
<string name="4152">That is quite the proclamation. Right out of the blue you thought of that, hmm? Or perhaps you&apos;ve been saving it for just such an occasion as this?</string>
<string name="4153">You sound worse than that fool of a druid, Nyatar, talking all high and mighty, not considering commerce or tradition. That kind of... of... &quot;do-goodery&quot; just makes me sick.</string>
<string name="4154">Go on, leave me be. I don&apos;t need this... this preaching from you. Not now. Not in times like this.</string>
<string name="4155">No. I am in no mood. Take a walk.</string>
<string name="4156">Bye bye.</string>
<string name="4157">Farewell.</string>
<string name="4158">Maybe me ask you some things?</string>
<string name="4159">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="4160">Hey, you hear me at all?</string>
<string name="4161">Uh, hello? Can you hear me?</string>
<string name="4162">Times sure have changed, I think.</string>
<string name="4163">Yes, sir, not like the old days. Not at all.</string>
<string name="4164">(cough) Things used to be very different. Very different.</string>
<string name="4165">&apos;Scuse me, me gots to go.</string>
<string name="4166">Excuse me, I must be leaving.</string>
<string name="4167">Me gots to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="4168">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="4169">What yous know of this place?</string>
<string name="4170">What do you know of this place?</string>
<string name="4171">Back to other questions, okay?</string>
<string name="4172">Let&apos;s go back to my other questions.</string>
<string name="4173">You knows him at all?</string>
<string name="4174">Are you acquainted with him?</string>
<string name="4175">Who Bill? Why he want kids to come heres?</string>
<string name="4176">Who is Billiam? Why does he insist these children come here?</string>
<string name="4177">If yous not like this place, why yous let it keep going?</string>
<string name="4178">If you don&apos;t like this place, why do you permit it to continue?</string>
<string name="4179">Well, me gonna shut this place up tight!</string>
<string name="4180">I will see this place shut down!</string>
<string name="4181">Who is yous?</string>
<string name="4182">Who are you?</string>
<string name="4183">Fare you well in this difficult time.</string>
<string name="4184">Oh, please no. I&apos;m not in any mood to talk. It&apos;s bad enough I&apos;m even here, but Billiam, he insists the children come.</string>
<string name="4185">I know we are here all too often. All hours of the day, it seems. Billiam looks at the animals and thinks of old conquests. I suppose we all have our retreats in hard times.</string>
<string name="4186">I don&apos;t care for the conditions the beasts are kept in, but I have no say in that. Montgomery Weatherson directs the place.</string>
<string name="4187">No, and I don&apos;t really care to. I am tolerant of my Billiam&apos;s rough edges, but I see no reason to go looking for others with a similar bent.</string>
<string name="4188">Billiam is my husband. He&apos;s not adjusting well to the plague. I imagine he feels helpless, and doesn&apos;t want the children to feel the same way.</string>
<string name="4189">He means well, but I question his methods. I don&apos;t much care for this place.</string>
<string name="4190">I&apos;m not sure who you think I am, but I don&apos;t have that kind of influence. Many people support the zoo. Many would oppose closing it down.</string>
<string name="4191">The druid Nyatar had begun talks to make changes, but now that the plague has everyone&apos;s attention I guess the animals don&apos;t seem that important.</string>
<string name="4192">Will you, now? I won&apos;t be particularly sad to see it go. I won&apos;t get involved, however. I have enough to worry about, as it is.</string>
<string name="4193">My name is Lady Zemeria. I am just a citizen of the Blacklake. You&apos;ll forgive me if I don&apos;t feel like going into more detail? The troubles of the day weigh heavily on my mind.</string>
<string name="4194">How you knows about artifact stuff to start?</string>
<string name="4195">How did you know of the artifacts to begin with?</string>
<string name="4196">You was there and didn&apos;t help the dying guys?</string>
<string name="4197">You were there and didn&apos;t help the dying?</string>
<string name="4198">You evil dumb-head! Give me Jacob&apos;s write-y thing NOW!</string>
<string name="4199">That&apos;s despicable! Give me Jacob&apos;s quill NOW!</string>
<string name="4200">What in the Hells do you want? What reason would I have to speak with you?</string>
<string name="4201">Someone, after all, has already delivered the remainder of those disgustingly pure Tyrran artifacts to Oleff. Oh yes, I have spies even there!</string>
<string name="4202">Did you think you could return to me and expect accolades for allowing this to happen? Are you a fool? Bah! Get out of my sight!</string>
<string name="4203">I visited the dig in the Peninsula district. They need to hire outsiders like you. Their own brethren are falling like flies.</string>
<string name="4204">Well, I helped myself to some of their belongings. Got a fine quill off one of them. Jacob was his name, I think.</string>
<string name="4205">He won&apos;t be needing it. I assume he&apos;s dead. He didn&apos;t react much when I rolled him over to go through his pockets.</string>
<string name="4206">Someone else has already seen to the retrieval of the remaining Tyrran artifacts. The followers of Talona are joyous today.</string>
<string name="4207">You have served well, but the followers of Talona are done with you. Leave me be.</string>
<string name="4208">That is, if you deserved it! You allowed other of these artifacts to be returned to Oleff! Perhaps you were trying to spare your conscience, but it will do no good.</string>
<string name="4209">I will see that the followers of Talona use what we have already been given to torment the fools of Tyr. Get out of my sight.</string>
<string name="4210">Here, I am giving you a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at any time and it will instantly transport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="4211">Here, I am giving you a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at any time and it will instantly transport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="4212">If he snuck yous in, maybe backdoor thingy still work?</string>
<string name="4213">It is, after all, the duty of the people to watch over their own. What say you?</string>
<string name="4214">Wait... haven&apos;t I already pleaded my case to you? Certainly you see the need to act in this instance?</string>
<string name="4215">Oh, and you&apos;ll probably want to deliver the key to Formosa as well. Besides the Dryad&apos;s cage, it also opens my warehouses. Now go. Get out.</string>
<string name="4216">I don&apos;t welcome strangers in my estate! </string>
<string name="4217">You were not invited. Get out!</string>
<string name="4218">A very good choice. Something else as well, perhaps?</string>
<string name="4219">Sorry, but you don&apos;t have enough Smugglers&apos; Coins for that. Something else, perhaps?</string>
<string name="4220">Very good. Would you care for anything else?</string>
<string name="4221">Excellent choice. Something else as well, perhaps?</string>
<string name="4222">You don&apos;t have enough Smugglers&apos; Coins for that. Can I interest you in something else?</string>
<string name="4223">Very good. Something else for you?</string>
<string name="4224">Fine, fine. Is there something else as well?</string>
<string name="4225">You don&apos;t have enough Smugglers&apos; Coins to purchase that. Is there anything else that you want?</string>
<string name="4226">Go talk to Vengual. He&apos;s the boss.</string>
<string name="4227">Can you do something? Can you? I don&apos;t see how...</string>
<string name="4228">Where do we go now? Plague... zombies... where?</string>
<string name="4229">I guess I should have tried to get to the City Core. There&apos;s certainly no help coming to us here.</string>
<string name="4230">How long before they get in here? Zombies are mindless, but they&apos;ll smell us... they&apos;ll throw themselves at the doors. We&apos;re all going to die...</string>
<string name="4231">My neighbor... he died of the plague. Then he came back as a zombie. That&apos;s not going to happen to me... is it? IS IT!</string>
<string name="4232">Where are the guards? Where is Lord Nasher? They left us to die! To die!</string>
<string name="4233">Is there anything anyone can do? Anything? It&apos;s the damned walking dead out there, for crying out loud!</string>
<string name="4234">What is wrong with this city? Plague... zombies... did we kick the Fates&apos; dog or something?</string>
<string name="4235">You&apos;d think the guards could have done something... but no... nothing... they stood on the wall...</string>
<string name="4236">Lost everyone. We all just ran... don&apos;t know where the family is. No clue...</string>
<string name="4237">Gotta look at the good side, you know? Zombies don&apos;t loot. I might have a home to go back to when this is over.</string>
<string name="4238">Zombies chased me the whole way here. I&apos;m lucky to be alive.</string>
<string name="4239">I&apos;m glad this place is here. I could have tried to get to the Helmite sanctuary, but I really needed a drink.</string>
<string name="4240">Whew... lucky to have made it here. They killed everything... and then those dead got up... I barely got here.</string>
<string name="4241">I don&apos;t believe it. We can leave? The undead are gone? Thank you... thank you if you did this...</string>
<string name="4242">These are the last days... I&apos;m sure of it. Plague, undead... all we need is a plague of vermin and I&apos;m calling it quits.</string>
<string name="4243">What is left... nothing. The living fear the plague... the dead can&apos;t rest. Why go on?</string>
<string name="4244">Slow death to plague or quick death to zombies... maybe the undead are the merciful way out after all.</string>
<string name="4245">I heard some people tried to get to the City Core but the guards wouldn&apos;t let them out past the gate. They didn&apos;t want the plague to spread...</string>
<string name="4246">Where do we go now... there&apos;s nowhere. We just wait for the zombies to get us here, I guess...</string>
<string name="4247">At least you can outrun zombies for a while, but the plague... I don&apos;t have a clue how to avoid that.</string>
<string name="4248">I guess I could have tried to go to the Helmite sanctuary... but they are always treating plague victims there. I don&apos;t want to get sick...</string>
<string name="4249">What can you trust if you can&apos;t trust the dead to stay down? How can anything be normal after that?</string>
<string name="4250">So this is where I will die... great. They can&apos;t keep the zombies out forever...</string>
<string name="4251">Can you understand having nothing? Having to leave everything or die? Can anyone understand...</string>
<string name="4252">I hate this place. Fools trying to act like everything will be okay. Well, nothing is okay... we&apos;re all doomed.</string>
<string name="4253">What do you want? I&apos;ve nothing for you... I had to leave everyting to flee the zombies... I&apos;ve nothing...</string>
<string name="4254">Is there nothing the guards can do? Burn down the Great Graveyard? Something? Anything...</string>
<string name="4255">I&apos;m... I&apos;m at the bottom. Things can&apos;t get worse. Who&apos;d have thought this was how it would end?</string>
<string name="4256">I am so grateful. I... I&apos;m just stunned that someone would bother to help us... thank you.</string>
<string name="4257">The Great Graveyard is in the north. It was barricaded until recently. I understand that all is quiet there now. Good. Perhaps now the dead can rest.</string>
<string name="4258">Well, as I understand it, the Beggar&apos;s Nest is no longer infested with undead, so it is fairly safe to venture outside.</string>
<string name="4259">Of course, I still welcome all that would seek the word of Helm. The plague still rages. We are far from true safety.</string>
<string name="4260">I understand it was one of the Waterdhavian creatures... a yuan-ti. Such horrid creatures. I do not know why it did what it did.</string>
<string name="4261">Ultimately, it doesn&apos;t matter. She is dead and the zombie threat is over. Of course, people should still come here. The plague still rages.</string>
<string name="4262">Thanks for getting rid of Drawl. Jerks like him are exactly why I quit the gang to become a guard. He got what he deserved for what he did to the others.</string>

<string name="4285">Moonstone Mask: An Evil Offer</string>
<string name="4286">Gilles, an unquestionably evil character in the Moonstone Mask, has made an offer. He has heard that Oleff seeks the tombs of Halueth Never and the artifacts within. Gilles would like these artifacts to be delivered to him, instead of Oleff. He will pay well, though it is obvious he intends to defile and misuse the items.</string>
<string name="4287">One of the Tyrran artifacts associated with Halueth Never has been given to Gilles, the evil representative of the rival church of Talona. Gilles eagerly waits for the last two items in the Moonstone Mask, hoping that he will soon be able to exploit this triumph over Oleff and the followers of Tyr.</string>
<string name="4288">Two of the Tyrran artifacts associated with Halueth Never have been given to Gilles, the evil representative of the rival church of Talona. Gilles eagerly waits for the last item in the Moonstone Mask, hoping that he will soon be able to exploit this triumph over Oleff and the followers of Tyr.</string>
<string name="4289">Gilles is triumphant. With gold and guile he has secured all of the Tyrran artifacts relating to Halueth Never. This will be a great blow to the morale of Oleff and the other followers of Tyr. A very selfish act has taken place today.</string>
<string name="4290">Gilles is partially satisfied that not all of the Tyrran artifacts made it to Oleff in the Hall of Justice. Those delivered to Gilles, will be used by the followers of Talona to torment the Tyrrans. It will cause years of tension between the two groups.</string>
<string name="4291">Gilles has had his evil mischief foiled. He wanted to sabatage the Tyrran search for the artifacts in the tombs of Halueth Never, but all were given to Oleff at the Hall of Justice. The followers of Talona will have to find some other way to amuse themselves now.</string>
<string name="4292">Gilles has been told to leave, taking whatever plans he has for the Tyrran artifacts with him. Oleff will likely be interested in the quill that Gilles had stolen.</string>
<string name="4293">A key has been found on Meldanen. The mage did not seem a reasonable sort, so perhaps he has an enemy that would be interested in it. His personal records may reveal a likely candidate.</string>
<string name="4294">A tooth has been taken from the mouth of Meldanen. The mage did not seem a reasonable sort, so perhaps he has an enemy that would be interested in it. His personal records may reveal a likely candidate.</string>
<string name="4295">A key has been found on Meldanen. The mage did not seem a reasonable sort, so perhaps he has an enemy that would be interested in it. He mentioned someone named Formosa, so she is as likely a candidate as any.</string>
<string name="4296">A tooth has been taken from the mouth of Meldanen. The mage did not seem a reasonable sort, so perhaps he has an enemy that would be interested in it. He mentioned someone named Formosa, so she is as likely a candidate as any.</string>
<string name="4297">A silver tooth has been taken from the mouth of Meldanen, and a key was found as well. The mage did not seem a reasonable sort, so perhaps he has an enemy that would be interested in these items. His personal records may reveal a likely candidate.</string>
<string name="4298">A silver tooth has been taken from the mouth of Meldanen, and a key was found as well. The mage did not seem a reasonable sort, so perhaps he has an enemy that would be interested in these items. He mentioned someone named Formosa, so she is as likely a candidate as any.</string>
<string name="4299">Any task that Formosa might have wanted completed has been indefinitely postponed. She is now dead.</string>
<string name="4300">The key to Meldanen&apos;s warehouse has been delivered to Formosa, but she has been told in no uncertain terms that Meldanen will not be killed. She will have to be content that half her goal has been achieved.</string>
<string name="4301">Hints of Conspiracy</string>
<string name="4302">An odd note was found after an attack by an apparently fanatical group of assassins. It suggested that an unknown group is helping spread the plague, and is actively working against a cure. The note should be taken to someone in authority.</string>
<string name="4303">A troubling note was found after an attack by a fanatical group of assassins. If it is to be believed, there may be a cult of some sort working against the city of Neverwinter and opposing a cure for the plague. The note should be taken to someone in authority.</string>
<string name="4304">A disturbing note was found after an attack by a fanatical group of assassins. It appeared to suggest that there is a traitor amongst the people of Neverwinter responsible for the attack on the Academy, and who is working against the city even now. The note should be taken to someone in authority.</string>
<string name="4305">Fenthick was given the odd note that suggested an unknown group is spreading the plague and working against a cure. He is uncertain how important the information is, a feeling reinforced by Desther&apos;s skepticism. Nevertheless, he will consider it and make what sense of it he can. All effort is appreciated in the current crisis.</string>
<string name="4306">Fenthick was given the troubling note that suggested a fanatical cult may be operating in Neverwinter and actively opposing the efforts to cure the plague. While the information is alarming, he is not certain if it is to be believed, or how it should impact the search for the cure. Desther encouraged him to dismiss it as hearsay. Nevertheless, he will consider it and make what sense of it he can. All effort is appreciated in the current crisis.</string>
<string name="4307">Fenthick was given the disturbing note that suggested a traitor may have been responsible for the attack on the Academy, and may still be working against the city. Fenthick appeared reluctant to act on the information, echoing Desther&apos;s concern that such potentially unfounded accusations could do more harm than good right now. Nevertheless, he will consider it and make what sense of it he can. All effort is appreciated in the current crisis.</string>
<string name="4308">The salvaged brain of the Waterdhavian intellect devourer has been delivered to Aribeth. She was understandably glad to see it. Although the item has been given to Aribeth, Sedos Sebile, the ranking officer in the Peninsula, would likely still give a reward for the discovery as well.</string>
<string name="4309">The uprising at the Peninsula district prison has been quelled and the brain of the Waterdhavian intellect devourer behind it has been delivered to Aribeth. Sedos also gave a reward for the task.</string>
<string name="4310">All of the artifacts to be found in the tombs of Halueth Never and his companions have been accounted for. Unfortunately, some of them are now in the hands of a rival church. Oleff was understandably disturbed by this, though there is little he, or anyone, can do. For whatever reason, an evil hand had a part in this quest.</string>

Oleff was understandably disturbed by this, but there is little he, or anyone, can do. For whatever reason, an evil hand had a part in this quest.</string>
<string name="4312">As the Wailing Death spread across Neverwinter, it was soon apparent that it was not a natural affliction. It couldn&apos;t be cured by normal means, and the holiest of clerics found their divine healing useless. To fortify the city and aid in investigating the plague, Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande called for all adventurers of promise to attend the Neverwinter Academy, and also sought help from some of the greatest wizards in the Realms, including the great archmage of Waterdeep, Khelben &quot;Blackstaff&quot; Arunsun.

Arunsun sent a collection of magical creatures to the city, with instructions on how they might be used as reagents in a potential cure. The beasts were stored at the Academy, and with the most promising recruits graduating, the site became too tempting a target for Neverwinter&apos;s unseen enemy. In the ensuing attack, all but a handful of students were killed, and the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night.

Fenthick, Desther, and especially Lady Aribeth should be sought out. They will know what course of action should be taken in this troubling time.</string>

<string name="4350">That&apos;s handy.</string>
<string name="4351">Me want go back to spot where me almost die! Me want go right now!</string>
<string name="4352">I want to go back to the place where I nearly died, and I want to go now!</string>
<string name="4353">Me change my mind. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="4354">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I&apos;ll see you later. </string>

<string name="4356">Yes. Transport me there now. </string>

<string name="4362">Me not like that! But me accept it. Can you get me back to where me just was?</string>
<string name="4363">Fine then! I still need to get back to where I was. Can you help with that? </string>
<string name="4364">I don&apos;t feel hurt at all. How was I healed?</string>
<string name="4365">When you cast Recall spell on me?</string>
<string name="4366">Ummm...when did you cast this Word of Recall spell on me? </string>
<string name="4367">Who you be?</string>
<string name="4368">Who are you?</string>
<string name="4369">Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Aribeth has instructed me to provide whatever assistance I can to you in your mission.</string>
<string name="4370">However my magic is not of a healing nature. My skills are tied to the teleportation portal in this temple and the Stone of Recall in your backpack. Is there something I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="4371">I am Sergol, a priest of Tyr. It is my duty to aid and assist those in the service of Neverwinter, though I am no healer. </string>
<string name="4372">My magic is tied to the Stone of Recall in your backpack and the teleportation portal you see in this room. </string>
<string name="4373">Here, I am giving you a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at any time and it will instantly transport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="4374">I thought you would be familiar with this by now. However, it is important so I will go over the use of the Stone of Recall again.</string>
<string name="4375">In your backpack you carry a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at anytime and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="4376">You will arrive at the teleportation portal in the next room. This will allow you to return quickly if the need arises, saving precious travelling time.</string>
<string name="4377">There is more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once you have used the stone to return, go through the teleportation portal and it will instantly send you back to the place your stone was last activated.</string>
<string name="4378">Anyone in your service - henchmen, familiars and the like - will also be transported with you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="4379">You&apos;re lucky to be alive. We barely managed to bring you back; your soul had nearly departed to the afterlife. </string>
<string name="4380">Hurry back to your mission, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Desther must not be allowed to escape judgment.</string>
<string name="4381">I can help you return to the site of your last battle, but are you sure you want to go back so soon? </string>
<string name="4382">Whatever you were fighting will still be there. It would be wiser to prepare yourself before returning to that encounter.</string>
<string name="4383">Or perhaps you should use the teleportation portal to return to the spot where you last activated your Stone of Recall.</string>
<string name="4384">Here, I am giving you a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at any time and it will instantly transport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="4385">I thought you would be familiar with this by now. However, it is important so I will go over the use of the Stone of Recall again.</string>
<string name="4386">In your backpack you carry a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at anytime and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back to the ritual room You will appear in the teleportation portal in the next room.</string>
<string name="4387">This will allow you to return quickly to this temple whenever you need to, saving precious travelling time.</string>
<string name="4388">There is more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once you have used the stone, go through the teleportation portal at any time and it will instantly send you back to the place your stone was last activated.</string>
<string name="4389">Anyone in your service - henchmen, familiars and the like - will also be transported with you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="4390">As you wish. I can use my magic to return you to the site you just came from. This will return you to your last battle. Are you ready? </string>
<string name="4391">As you wish. Prepare yourself, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="4392">Hmmm. I thought you would have been familiar with this process by now. Very well, I shall explain it to you myself.</string>
<string name="4393">You are one of Aribeth&apos;s most important agents. After all you have done for Neverwinter she wants me to keep watch over you personally. </string>
<string name="4394">Before your mission started I cast a Word of Recall spell upon you, so that whenever you become mortally wounded I can immediately teleport you here to safety. </string>
<string name="4395">Just now, some enemy must have struck you a near fatal blow, and so the spell&apos;s contingency magics activated and whisked you away to safety. </string>
<string name="4396">I can&apos;t do that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are too important. Neverwinter has need of your skills now more than ever. We can&apos;t risk an untimely demise.</string>
<string name="4397">As soon as your battered body appeared, the other clerics here called upon the healing power of Tyr to bring you back from the brink of death. </string>
<string name="4398">You are now as ready as you&apos;ll ever be to continue with your mission. The Recall spell will activate again if you are dealt another fatal blow. </string>
<string name="4399">The spell doesn&apos;t require your presence. I simply needed to know your full name, which Aribeth provided.</string>
<string name="4400">I am Sergol, a priest of Tyr. It is my duty to aid and assist those in the service of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="4401">Ah. You have awakened. I need to speak with you. </string>
<string name="4402">We are very disappointed in you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your slaughter of innocent people has caused much suffering in a time already overburdened with tragedy.</string>
<string name="4403">Were it up to me you would have been left to rot in your grave; however, Aribeth has ordered me to resurrect you. Despite your actions, Neverwinter still has need of you.</string>
<string name="4404">You will suffer no further consequences for your mad killing spree, but I implore you not to engage in such wholesale slaughter again. Please, focus on the mission you have been given. </string>
<string name="4405">He say what &quot;People of the Eye&quot; supposed to do?</string>
<string name="4406">Has he shed any light on the purpose of the &quot;People of the Eye?&quot;</string>
<string name="4407">He rants about everything, but I can&apos;t make sense of it. They are fanatics... insane... they must be. Why else would all this have happened?</string>
<string name="4408">*sob*</string>
<string name="4409">Yes... I knew you would come...</string>
<string name="4410">Who this Dumal guy?</string>
<string name="4411">Who is Dumal?</string>
<string name="4412">I don&apos;t wanna die... I don&apos;t. When&apos;s this nightmare gonna end?</string>
<string name="4413">Dumal? He used to be in charge, or at least close to it. I&apos;m sorry, I really didn&apos;t know a lot about how the Hold was run. Dad kept up on all that.</string>
<string name="4414">He was nice, though. He might still be alive somewhere. I think he was kept alive so they could know how to act. Not sure, though.</string>
<string name="4415">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="4416">&lt;StartAction&gt;Smash the lock and seal it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="4417">&lt;StartAction&gt;Open it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="4418">This door has been sealed forever.</string>
<string name="4419">The locking mechanism on the door would allow you to open it or jam it closed permanently.</string>
<string name="4420">A wall of force has been erected that blocks your path.</string>
<string name="4421">With the proper tome you could activate the power of this altar.</string>
<string name="4422">The evil force binding this altar has been banished and the guardian spirit reinstated.</string>
<string name="4423">This altar has been permanently despoiled by the release of a demon. Whatever guardian spirit might have been here is gone forever.</string>
<string name="4424">You are too late to stop our plan from reaching fruition!</string>
<string name="4425">Uhhnnn... Kill... for... cult... eye...</string>
<string name="4426">False Helmite Elite</string>
<string name="4427">Despite its size, this well-maintained tome is exceptionally light. The pages also seem to have a strange, almost warming glow. Inside is revealed the methods by which the Guardian Spirit of Helm&apos;s Hold may be restored, should an evil entity have displaced it, though the taint must first be banished by other means. Simply having this book in one&apos;s backpack will allow the use of a properly prepared altar.</string>

<string name="4553">Is... is this about my encounter with the Black Wolf? I really shouldn&apos;t talk about it, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, I&apos;m sorry. You could ask Neurik about the beast, I&apos;m sure. Uh... unless you want something else?</string>
<string name="4554">He is the priest at the temple of Tyr. He knows a lot about the Black Wolf. Well... he knows a lot about everything, really.</string>
<string name="4555">Well... it&apos;s not that I can&apos;t. Neurik says I shouldn&apos;t talk about it if I want to... to stop thinking about it. If he said it was okay, though, I guess I could...</string>
<string name="4556">I... I know Alhelor likes to, but I really shouldn&apos;t talk about it, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, I&apos;m sorry. You could ask Neurik about the beast, though, if you wanted.</string>

<string name="4559">Oh. He lives near the pond of water at the town&apos;s center. It&apos;s a fairly small house. Modest, you know? Alhelor&apos;s usually here, but he said he was tired.</string>
<string name="4560">Wh-what? That can&apos;t be right. Are you joking with me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="4561">I... that&apos;s so... I don&apos;t doubt your word, though. Alhelor was always a bit odd, somehow. I just never suspected... what a fool I&apos;ve been!</string>
<string name="4562">Thank you for telling me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I&apos;ll definitely watch out for him. I haven&apos;t seen Alhelor since he went back to his home by the pond. If you hurry, you can catch him there and kill him once and for all!</string>

<string name="4583">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; You pay, or me close you place down. Aribeth and Nasher say so.</string>
<string name="4584">Ha! Me fool you good.</string>
<string name="4585">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;ll pay, or this tavern will be shut down on the orders of Lady Aribeth and Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="4586">Calm down man, it was only a joke.</string>
<string name="4587">A tax on taverns? That&apos;s outrageous! Lord Nasher must be out of his mind. Forget it, I&apos;ll never pay.</string>
<string name="4588">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Lady Aribeth wants to come down here and ask for more taxes in person, then I&apos;ll talk to her.</string>
<string name="4589">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Fine, here&apos;s 50 gold. It&apos;s a real shame when a ruler thinks he can just tax his subjects for every little thing.</string>
<string name="4590">Now what do you want?</string>
<string name="4591">A joke? You can&apos;t even begin to know how not funny that kind of joke is to an innkeep. Well... no harm done... I suppose. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="4592">I already paid that tax to another person, so just forget about it. Now what do you want.</string>
<string name="4593">You&apos;re one of them folks from Neverwinter, aren&apos;t ya?</string>
<string name="4594">I can&apos;t believe Luskan&apos;s port has been closed up. No entry, they says. That was one of our major stops!</string>
<string name="4595">Wonder if they&apos;ll be opening the Luskan port soon.</string>
<string name="4596">Hope you&apos;re not itching for a ride on the ship. We barely got room for the cargo an&apos; crew.</string>
<string name="4597">I wonder if them soldiers will ever catch that cult? I hate to think they&apos;d get away with it.</string>
<string name="4598">Supplies to Neverwinter - supplies to Neverwinter, back and forth; we&apos;ll never match their needs for years.</string>
<string name="4599">I heard them talking about werewolves in the bar. I&apos;d better not see &apos;em, or I&apos;ll never make port here again.</string>
<string name="4600">Wanna race?</string>
<string name="4601">You&apos;re funny!</string>
<string name="4602">Want to play plague? I&apos;ll die this time.</string>
<string name="4603">Go away!</string>
<string name="4604">I&apos;m not allowed outside of town.</string>
<string name="4605">My brother says there are criminals and werewolves about.</string>
<string name="4606">You want to play werewolf?</string>
<string name="4607">Hee hee!</string>
<string name="4608">That was fun!</string>
<string name="4609">I&apos;m beat. Let&apos;s play again tomorrow.</string>
<string name="4610">The werewolf&apos;s gonna come getcha!</string>
<string name="4611">I&apos;m hungry.</string>
<string name="4612">I&apos;m bored.</string>
<string name="4613">I&apos;m Karathis the Werewolf! Rooaar!</string>
<string name="4614">North: North Road, Green Griffon Inn, Luskan, and Port Llast. East: Neverwinter Wood. South: South Road and Charwood.</string>
<string name="4615">Thank you so much for helping us out. I was afraid we&apos;d never get to leave. Good luck, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="4616">I kill da trolls, so you be safe to leave now.</string>
<string name="4617">You no need help find way out?</string>
<string name="4618">The way back is cleared of trolls; find your own way out.</string>
<string name="4619">Don&apos;t you need help getting back to Revat?</string>
<string name="4620">What do you think I am, senile? Of course I know the way is clear. I can make it back on my own, and I don&apos;t need you to tell me so.</string>
<string name="4621">What do I look like, somebody&apos;s weak, old granny? I&apos;m a powerful mage and I can make my own way back, now that the spell is broken.</string>
<string name="4622">Not that I don&apos;t appreciate what you did, but you could have been a little faster about it. See you on the surface.</string>
<string name="4623">Aawill is the Archdruid. He takes care of things around here and makes sure everything runs smoothly. Jaer is second-in-command, in charge of circle challenges. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4624">Aawill is the Archdruid. He&apos;s the one to go to if you want to assist the grove with something like the troubles we&apos;re having right now. Jaer is second-in-command, in charge of circle challenges.</string>
<string name="4625">Sorry, but it&apos;s a druid thing. A &lt;class&gt; like you wouldn&apos;t understand it, so that&apos;s all I&apos;m gonna tell ya.</string>
<string name="4626">Only druids can enter the challenges, sorry.</string>
<string name="4627">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4628">No.</string>
<string name="4629">Yes.</string>
<string name="4630">I am in charge of the druid circle challenges. When a druid wants to become a member of our grove, he or she must challenge one of our members to gain entry to the first circle.</string>
<string name="4631">Do you understand so far?</string>
<string name="4632">We are all creatures of nature, and just as some of nature&apos;s children hunt alone, while others hunt in packs, we too have our individual preferences.</string>
<string name="4633">Each of the defenders in our circle has an animal companion who fights at his or her side. You too will enter combat with an animal companion, and a human follower, if you have one.</string>
<string name="4634">Everyone is working hard to recover from the death of the Spirit. It will be a long haul, but it&apos;s a battle worth fighting. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4635">Well, because of you, everything has pretty much returned to normal around here. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4636">There is nothing more I can do for you, Champion of the Grove. I am proud to have witnessed your ascension.</string>
<string name="4637">Jaer, the very serious young woman over there, meets with druids who wish to either join, or improve their standing in the circle of druids. She organizes challenge fights between the druid seeking improvement and the defender of the appropriate circle.</string>
<string name="4638">Are there any other questions you have for me &lt;lad/lass&gt;?</string>
<string name="4639">Not that the animals in this wood are fighting with intelligence, but that&apos;s another subject entirely. Do you have questions you would like to ask about anything else?</string>
<string name="4640">If a druid comes to the grove and wants to join, then he or she must talk Jaer into setting up a challenge with the defender of the fourth circle. If the challenger wins, he or she is allowed to join the fourth circle. Jaer has just recently promoted me to defender.</string>
<string name="4641">The forest has returned to its natural state.</string>
<string name="4642">You tell me all you know, and no time waste me. </string>
<string name="4643">Just tell me everything you know and stop wasting my time! </string>
<string name="4644">What you mean others? Tell me, please. </string>
<string name="4645">What do you mean, most of the others? This is important.</string>
<string name="4646">Dwarf be in pool?</string>
<string name="4647">Was the dwarf&apos;s body in the pool?</string>
<string name="4648">Me needs the dagger. You gots it?</string>
<string name="4649">I need that dagger. Do you have it?</string>
<string name="4650">Now you are mine!</string>
<string name="4651">You were here to kill me. That was what I thought the moment I felt your presence near my tree. I... I just wanted to stop you. Could you ever forgive me?</string>
<string name="4652">Just barely. My ability to control them has been weakening for a while now.</string>
<string name="4653">Nevermind. I&apos;m sorry I lost control. Should I continue?</string>
<string name="4654">A dwarf came here a few weeks ago. He was fierce and mean and seemed immune to my charms. He asked me about the dagger that the druid had used to kill himself.</string>
<string name="4655">I don&apos;t know how he knew about the druid, but I had kept the dagger as a keepsake of the druid. When he threatened me, I gave it to him. </string>
<string name="4656">I never saw the dwarf again, but shortly before everything started going wrong in the forest, I found the dagger in front of the altar.</string>
<string name="4657">No, now that you mention it, his corpse wasn&apos;t there.</string>
<string name="4658">I brought it back here, but I don&apos;t remember where I put it, because the pain hit me before I made it back here.</string>
<string name="4659">I&apos;m sure it&apos;s somewhere in my house though. If you look around, you should be able to find it, but you shouldn&apos;t use it! I don&apos;t want another death on my hands; they are so bloody already.</string>
<string name="4660">Leave the altar.</string>
<string name="4661">Draw forth the dagger and plunge it into your chest and have your henchman do the same.</string>
<string name="4662">Draw forth the dagger and plunge it into your chest.</string>
<string name="4663">There is nothing you can do here at this time.</string>
<string name="4664">The ceremonial dagger has disappeared, it seems that portal has been closed for good.</string>
<string name="4665">An ancient altar, covered in grotesque carvings, bloodstains (some fairly recent) and surrounded by bones, looms ominously beneath the waterfall.</string>
<string name="4666">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Your senses are blasted with all colors, all sounds, all feelings, all tastes and all scents imaginable.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="4667">No.</string>
<string name="4668">Yes.</string>
<string name="4669">You can catch glimpses of the Neverwinter Wood in this swirling portal. Do you wish to enter?</string>
<string name="4670">Kill for the mistress!</string>
<string name="4671">What has happened to me? Where am I? I must find my family!</string>
<string name="4672">Me cure Spirit of Wood, so you rest easy.</string>
<string name="4673">I have cured the Spirit of the Wood. You no longer need to worry about that problem.</string>
<string name="4674"></string>
<string name="4675">Spirit be dead. Me need kill it, so me did.</string>
<string name="4676">The Spirit is dead. I&apos;m afraid I had to kill it.</string>
<string name="4677">Me not sure if there be other way, but this be fast way.</string>
<string name="4678">Well, there might have been another way, but this was the quickest.</string>
<string name="4679">Me not have choice. Me be sad that Spirit dead.</string>
<string name="4680">I had no other choice. If I could have done it some other way, I would have.</string>
<string name="4681">You must be the kind of hero that legends are born of. How is it that you accomplished such a deed? No, don&apos;t tell me now, you have much more to do I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="4682">When you are famous and all of the bards spread tales of your heroic deeds, I hope you will return to these woods and walk these paths in peace.</string>
<string name="4683">Maybe then we can share stories and maybe become friends. Until then I must go.</string>
<string name="4684">That is horrible news. The forest will suffer for generations. I desperately hope that you tried everything possible before going to such lengths.</string>
<string name="4685">Such a callous attitude toward nature is a sign of a troubled soul. Believe me when I tell you that what you do will come back on you someday.</string>
<string name="4686">Evil begets evil and is its own downfall. I would say more, but I suppose you are hardly interested in a sermon from me. I will leave you in the hands of nature now.</string>
<string name="4687">I&apos;m sure that you did your best. I just hope the woods survives this loss. I should get going now.</string>
<string name="4688">Ah, another dominated slave</string>
<string name="4689">Me cure Spirit, so you be safe now.</string>
<string name="4690">I have cured the Spirit of the Wood. You may return to the other druids in peace.</string>
<string name="4691">Be safe.</string>
<string name="4692">Take care of yourself. </string>
<string name="4693">Me kill Spirit. You not need worry no more.</string>
<string name="4694">I had to kill the Spirit of the Wood, so the problem is resolved.</string>
<string name="4695">You watch what say or maybe you not be rescued after all.</string>
<string name="4696">Watch your insults. Nobody else knows I found you... if you take my meaning.</string>
<string name="4697">Me must go now. You fine on own?</string>
<string name="4698">Time to get moving. You can make it out on your own?</string>
<string name="4699">Me do what need be done!</string>
<string name="4700">I did what I had to do!</string>
<string name="4701">Me be sad that Spirit dead, but you not know how bad it be. </string>
<string name="4702">I am terribly sorry for the damage I have done, but you don&apos;t know what it was like. </string>
<string name="4703">You not there, so you not know nothin&apos;. </string>
<string name="4704">You weren&apos;t there, so why don&apos;t you keep your judgments to yourself.</string>
<string name="4705">Praise be! What a marvelous thing. Surely your name will be sung on the wind for such a heroic deed.</string>
<string name="4706">I shall be sure that others hear of your deed, good &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Now if you will excuse me, I should be off.</string>
<string name="4707">You did what? Why would... how could... you idiot! Without the Spirit, the Wood will never truly recover.</string>
<string name="4708">I... I&apos;m sorry. You did free me, so I guess I should be grateful. I just don&apos;t think you realize how much damage has been done.</string>
<string name="4709">I&apos;m sure you think you did, but there had to be another path. Probably a harder path, but nothing worth doing is ever easy.</string>
<string name="4710">I... I guess I wasn&apos;t at that. </string>
<string name="4711">Me cure Spirit. You be safe now.</string>
<string name="4712">I cured the Spirit of the Wood, so you can rest easy now.</string>
<string name="4713">Me kill Spirit, so you no need worry no more.</string>
<string name="4714">I had to kill the Spirit of the Wood, so you don&apos;t have to worry about it now.</string>
<string name="4715">What mean you think that?</string>
<string name="4716">What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="4717">Me glad you think like me.</string>
<string name="4718">I&apos;m glad you see it my way.</string>
<string name="4719">So, you no be mad at me?</string>
<string name="4720">So, you&apos;re not mad at me?</string>
<string name="4721">You... you cured it? I must admit that I am shocked. You are quite the &lt;man/woman&gt;, to have accomplished such a deed.</string>
<string name="4722">You really are a hero, even if you&apos;re not as beautiful as I am.</string>
<string name="4723">It&apos;s dead? Oh, I was afraid that something like that would have to be done.</string>
<string name="4724">The other druids didn&apos;t want to admit it, but nobody knew how to stop the Spirit. It was only a matter of time before someone would realize that it had to die.</string>
<string name="4725">Hmm, well, that&apos;s a bitter thought. </string>
<string name="4726">Sometimes the only way to solve a problem is to make the unpopular choice. Don&apos;t worry about what anybody else says, you did what you had to do.</string>
<string name="4727">I must be going now. Take care, and thank you for all your help.</string>
<string name="4728">Me look for gem you gots.</string>
<string name="4729">I was sent here to collect a gem you have.</string>
<string name="4730">If me has to. </string>
<string name="4731">That&apos;s a distinct possibility.</string>
<string name="4732">No, me want you let me have it. </string>
<string name="4733">No, I was just hoping to convince you to let me have it.</string>
<string name="4734">What me do to help?</string>
<string name="4735">What can I do to help you?</string>
<string name="4736">What you give me if me help you? </string>
<string name="4737">What will you give me to get this mirror for you? </string>
<string name="4738">You keep yell at me, me bash you like servants. </string>
<string name="4739">If you keep yelling at me like that, I&apos;ll show you exactly what I did to your servants.</string>
<string name="4740">Me sorry, but you monsters... er, servants, them attack me first. </string>
<string name="4741">I&apos;m sorry, but your creatures, or servants as you call them, attacked me first.</string>
<string name="4742">That greedy elf sent you here? Did he tell you to kill me and take steal my gem?</string>
<string name="4743">I don&apos;t appreciate threats, nor do I enjoy people barging into my house and killing my servants. I think you underestimate my powers.</string>
<string name="4744">I certainly don&apos;t think that you improved your chances by busting in here and killing all my servants. Not exactly tactful, is it?</string>
<string name="4745">But, I might have a use for you, since you are so interested in... acquiring objects for others. We might be able to make a deal.</string>
<string name="4746">The only thing that holds true value for me is my beauty. There is a nymph who lives in this forest who has a mirror that can return my beauty. I overheard two dryads talking about it, just before all this trouble started.</string>
<string name="4747">The nymph lives to the northeast of here. I would get it myself, but I can&apos;t go anywhere near her. The unearthly beauty of her face physically hurts me, and she shuns me because I am ugly. Please, please get me the mirror!</string>
<string name="4748">I think you underestimate me, but that&apos;s beside the point. There has been enough fighting here today.</string>
<string name="4749">You were an intruder in my home. My servants were merely trying to protect me, as good servants should.</string>
<string name="4750">So why would you think that there would be anything in my house that could help you save the forest? </string>
<string name="4751">You can find a druid locked in the southwest most room. Here is a key for the cell door. Don&apos;t worry, she has not been harmed.</string>
<string name="4752">Oh, I am so very beautiful.</string>
<string name="4753">A portal has been activated.</string>
<string name="4754">The paint has all but peeled from the dry and brittle wood. You can almost make out what it used to say:

 Da f rd Q obl y
 ay r of Cha woo 
  Si e 11 2</string>
<string name="4755">Fire licks the base of this sign and the paint blisters and scorches in the heat. You can almost make out what it used to say:

 Da f rd Q obl y
 ay r of Cha woo 
  Si e 11 2</string>
<string name="4756">West: Port Llast. East: South Farms and Charwood. North: Neverwinter Wood.</string>
<string name="4757">You be safer if you no ask questions.</string>
<string name="4758">Probably safer for you if you don&apos;t ask that question again.</string>
<string name="4759">Me just lookin&apos; round.</string>
<string name="4760">I was just exploring.</string>
<string name="4761">You dad say you need cheer up.</string>
<string name="4762">Your father told me you could use some cheering up.</string>
<string name="4763">Me not do favor; me only do stuff for pay.</string>
<string name="4764">I don&apos;t do favors; I do jobs. You want to pay me for this, then you should tell me about it.</string>
<string name="4765">So, what you want do now me here?</string>
<string name="4766">So, what do you propose to do about it?</string>
<string name="4767">Why not?</string>
<string name="4768">You gots to be jokin&apos;. Me no want you for that!</string>
<string name="4769">Slow down there boy. I&apos;m not here for that.</string>
<string name="4770">What you talkin&apos; bout?</string>
<string name="4771">What do you mean by that?</string>
<string name="4772">Threats? Great, just what I need. You must be one of those adventurer types.</string>
<string name="4773">An adventurer are ya? Well go explore somewhere else will ya?</string>
<string name="4774">I should have known dad sent ya. He&apos;s always worried about me.</string>
<string name="4775">Whatever your reason for being here, you can turn around and leave, unless you have something important you want.</string>
<string name="4776">What? Oh, sure, I suppose I could do that. I&apos;ll pay ya, if you can do it.</string>
<string name="4777">Hmm... an interesting situation. I&apos;ve never had a woman break into my room before.</string>
<string name="4778">I... um... er... oh, nothing. I can&apos;t do anything right now.</string>
<string name="4779">It&apos;s none of your business. What do you want from me?</string>
<string name="4780">Well, that hardly comes as a surprise. Nobody wants me!</string>
<string name="4781">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4782">You always talk like that?</string>
<string name="4783">Are you always this forward?</string>
<string name="4784">Me ask questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="4785">Could I ask you some questions?</string>

<string name="4795">Where da west road go?</string>
<string name="4796">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="4797">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="4798">Where does the east road lead?</string>
<string name="4799">Where does the west road lead?</string>
<string name="4800">Anything interesting going on in these parts?</string>
<string name="4801">You know good places to go &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="4802">Me want work.</string>
<string name="4803">Adventures? What adventures you speak of?</string>
<string name="4804">Are there any places of interest around here that I should visit?</string>
<string name="4805">I&apos;d be interested in work, if you know of anything.</string>
<string name="4806">What sorts of adventures?</string>
<string name="4807">Me not like milk cows. What he want for help?</string>

<string name="4850">Slow down, I need to ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="4851">How&apos;d you like me to pry it from your cold, dead hands?</string>
<string name="4852">Be reasonable. Ingo treasures that brooch, because it reminds him of his wife.</string>
<string name="4853">Uh... tell me &apos;bout Erik.</string>
<string name="4854">All right, tell me a little about Erik.</string>
<string name="4855">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; But he love you Constance. Be good to him.</string>
<string name="4856">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; He loves you Constance. Don&apos;t betray that.</string>
<string name="4857">Why dis &apos;erd be so important?</string>
<string name="4858">Why is the herd so important?</string>
<string name="4859">Why dis &apos;erd be so important?</string>
<string name="4860">Why is the herd so important?</string>
<string name="4861">Money? Dat be all dis mean to you?</string>
<string name="4862">Money? That&apos;s all this means to you?</string>
<string name="4863">Gimme da li&apos;l brooch an&apos; you have my heart, li&apos;l lady...</string>
<string name="4864">Uh, well maybe me buy it off you, den.</string>
<string name="4865">For but a peasant&apos;s brooch, you&apos;ll have my undying love.</string>
<string name="4866">Maybe I can buy it off you...</string>
<string name="4867">You give brooch or me slit stomachs, yuh?!</string>
<string name="4868">Me not got that much gold for spend on this.</string>
<string name="4869">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Dat too much for peasant&apos;s doodad. Me give 250.</string>
<string name="4870">Hand the brooch over or I&apos;ll gut you like a fish!</string>
<string name="4871">Me not argue no more. Now me kill you!!</string>
<string name="4872">I&apos;m done haggling. Time to kill you and take it for free!</string>
<string name="4873">Me not afford that much for this.</string>
<string name="4874">I can&apos;t afford to spend that much on this.</string>
<string name="4875">250? Deal.</string>
<string name="4876">I can&apos;t afford to spend that much gold on this.</string>
<string name="4877">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s a simple peasant&apos;s brooch, worth 250 at most!</string>
<string name="4878">Me no got 400 gold to spend on this.</string>
<string name="4879">I don&apos;t have 400 gold to spend on this.</string>
<string name="4880">400 gold? Deal.</string>
<string name="4881">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Take the 250. The next fool Erik sends might not be so happy to negotiate.</string>
<string name="4882">1,000 gold? Deal.</string>
<string name="4883">Yuh? Me guess me go now, den.</string>
<string name="4884">What you mean you be robbed?</string>
<string name="4885">Hey - you no give item. Me want me money back!</string>
<string name="4886">Me no believe you - you give item now!</string>
<string name="4887">Really? I guess I&apos;ll be going then.</string>
<string name="4888">What do you mean you&apos;ve been robbed?</string>
<string name="4889">Hey - if you don&apos;t have the item, I want my money back!</string>
<string name="4890">I don&apos;t believe you - hand over the brooch... now!</string>
<string name="4891">Fine, you keep money.</string>
<string name="4892">You give me money back, or me kill you!</string>
<string name="4893">That not fair!</string>
<string name="4894">Fine, keep the money.</string>
<string name="4895">Give my money back or I&apos;ll slit your throat!</string>
<string name="4896">That&apos;s not fair!</string>
<string name="4897">Why so much money?</string>
<string name="4898">Did Ma let you in here? This is a bedroom, not a bar table, I&apos;ll have you know.</string>
<string name="4899">Well... a handsome stranger in the bedroom of the farmer&apos;s daughter. I wonder where such an encounter could lead?</string>
<string name="4900">At long last and good riddance.</string>
<string name="4901">Yes, yes. On your way.</string>
<string name="4902">Fare you well, then. Perhaps we&apos;ll speak again.</string>
<string name="4903">Oh... I&apos;m sorry. I shouldn&apos;t act that way. It&apos;s just that being one of the only young people for miles around... well, it gets so dull.</string>
<string name="4904">I see. A little on the slow side, are we?</string>
<string name="4905">I&apos;ll answer your questions if you don&apos;t take too long...</string>
<string name="4906">I suppose I can answer a question for you. What might it be?</string>
<string name="4907">I&apos;d be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="4908">Yes, I suppose a village idiot might be lost without a village, wouldn&apos;t &lt;he/she&gt;?</string>
<string name="4909">Er... um... me?</string>
<string name="4910">Where do you need to go?</string>
<string name="4911">(sigh) Make it quick.</string>
<string name="4912">Around here? Don&apos;t hold your breath. If we can&apos;t grow it or make it ourselves, we have to trek all the way into Port Llast to find it.</string>
<string name="4913">Nowhere really. Just into Charwood and I haven&apos;t seen anyone head that way in years. It&apos;s funny how the road never seems to grow over, though.</string>
<string name="4914">Follow it long enough and you&apos;ll make it all the way to Port Llast. That&apos;s the route we take on market day.</string>
<string name="4915">Is there something else?</string>
<string name="4916">Well there&apos;s always some sort of adventure to be had when you&apos;re this far from the rest of the world.</string>
<string name="4917">Well I suppose that&apos;s about as direct as one can get.</string>
<string name="4918">I&apos;m not sure what you would find interesting. There&apos;s our farm and then the one Erik works with his pa. Not much more than that.</string>
<string name="4919">You should talk to me pa. He&apos;s out watching over the cattle I&apos;m sure. A helping hand is always welcome, what with the wolves and all.</string>
<string name="4920">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="4921">You could help my pa out. I don&apos;t know if you would consider that interesting or not.</string>
<string name="4922">Nothing like that, he&apos;s just had some problems with wolves lately. </string>
<string name="4923">You should go talk to him about it. He&apos;s probably somewhere outside doing chores. </string>
<string name="4924">I might. What events are you referring to?</string>
<string name="4925">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="4926">Oh, that&apos;s the den of those wretched wolves!</string>
<string name="4927">They&apos;ve killed two cows already this season. You can ask me pa about it if you&apos;re really interested - he&apos;s been watching them like a hawk!</string>
<string name="4928">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="4929">No. My pa won&apos;t let me. He says it&apos;s because they&apos;re strange, though he won&apos;t say why. I think it&apos;s because he doesn&apos;t want me meeting a boy and running off with him.</string>
<string name="4930">Well, just that as kids, me and Erik used to tell each other the woods were haunted. Just children&apos;s stories, though - little harm can come of them.</string>
<string name="4931">Do you have more questions?</string>
<string name="4932">Maybe that cretin Erik&apos;s pa, Ingo. Before his wife passed away, he used to have a tinkering wagon that traveled from hamlet to hamlet around the area.</string>
<string name="4933">On our last trip to Port Llast, I heard a woman telling how awful the plague had been. Don&apos;t know much about the cult but they sound horrible.</string>
<string name="4934">It gets pretty isolated out here. A girl will do just about anything for a bit of excitement, but any news there is is usually about the weather, a new calf, or a good harvest.</string>
<string name="4935">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="4936">That&apos;s certainly an interesting thought. (Sigh) But mother&apos;s been keeping a rather close eye on me lately, ever since Erik... nevermind.</string>
<string name="4937">What else?</string>
<string name="4938">Erik has an infatuation with me; not terribly surprising considering the lack of choices around here.</string>
<string name="4939">One day I let him kiss me, just a little, but mom walked in on us. Since then... well, I&apos;m surprised she hasn&apos;t walked in here yet.</string>
<string name="4940">The only other people around here for miles are Erik and his pa but Erik&apos;s blind to everything these days, so I doubt he&apos;d be of any use.</string>
<string name="4941">If you want to speak to his pa, just take the north fork and the road will take you right to their front door. You&apos;ll know it by the corn fields and such.</string>
<string name="4942">Anything else?</string>
<string name="4943">Erik and I had a relationship, but it&apos;s over now and I have no interest in him. </string>
<string name="4944">I tried to hint that we were over, then I tried telling him, but he thinks we&apos;re *destined* to be together.</string>
<string name="4945">I had to do something drastic to get him to leave me alone.</string>
<string name="4946">I... I would rather not talk about. It really doesn&apos;t matter now. It&apos;s Erik&apos;s problem, not mine.</string>
<string name="4947">Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="4948">I&apos;m Constance O&apos;Deel, the prettiest girl for miles around... Also the *only* girl for miles around, but that&apos;s another story. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="4949">Surely you know the story of the farmer&apos;s daughter and... oh, nevermind. Why must I always be surrounded by simpletons?</string>
<string name="4950">Forget it. The mood is gone now. What did you want?</string>
<string name="4951">Took you a while to think that one up, didn&apos;t it? Nevermind. We could trade insults all day, but what&apos;s the use? What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="4952">Oh... how embarassing. Sorry about that. So how can I help you?</string>
<string name="4953">Look, are we going to go over this again? I already told you this before, but I guess I have to repeat myself.</string>
<string name="4954">He told you about that, huh? Well, I tried to get him to leave me alone but he persisted. I told him there was never going to be a relationship between us, but he wouldn&apos;t listen.</string>
<string name="4955">I was going to give it back to him, if he promised to leave me alone, but now I need it. The gold I can get for selling it might help pa replace the cows killed by the wolves.</string>
<string name="4956">Whoa, where did that come from? Erik may want his brooch back but I know for a fact that he wouldn&apos;t have sent someone to kill me!</string>
<string name="4957">Look, if this stupid brooch means that much to you maybe we could work out a deal. 1,000 gold and it&apos;s yours, all right?</string>
<string name="4958">That may be so but it will also fetch a fine price in Port Llast - enough to by a couple head of cattle to replace those killed by the wolves, of late...</string>
<string name="4959">I know, I know - &quot;He&apos;s a nice boy.&quot; That&apos;s what my ma always says and I can&apos;t say I entirely disagree...</string>
<string name="4960">But if he was a really nice boy, he&apos;d spend more time helping out my pa and less time picking wildflowers, and that&apos;s all there is to it.</string>
<string name="4961">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; He loves me? He would love a good romp in the hay is all and you&apos;ll not convince me otherwise!</string>
<string name="4962">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well he&apos;s a fool to do so - All the love in the world won&apos;t buy a head of cattle! *Sigh* But I know you&apos;re right...</string>
<string name="4963">Look, 400 gold buys us a couple of good jersey milkers to replace what we&apos;ve lost to the wolves. Give me that much and you can have the stupid brooch.</string>
<string name="4964">My pa&apos;s a cattle rancher and a good one, too. Without a proper herd, though, we&apos;ve got nothing. There wouldn&apos;t even be food on the table...</string>
<string name="4965">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well he&apos;s a fool to do so - All the love in the world won&apos;t buy a head of cattle! *Sigh* But I know you&apos;re right...</string>
<string name="4966">Look, 250 gold would buy us a healthy bull, let us rebuild the herd. Give me that much and you may do what you wish with the brooch.</string>
<string name="4967">My pa&apos;s a cattle rancher and a good one, too. Without a proper herd, though, we&apos;ve got nothing. There wouldn&apos;t even be food on the table...</string>
<string name="4968">Look, my ma and his ma were best friends before she passed on! If she would have known we were struggling, she&apos;d have been happy to give it!</string>
<string name="4969">All the love in the world won&apos;t buy a head of cattle... but you sure are a sweet talker, but I&apos;m the one who used that trick on Erik, remember?</string>
<string name="4970">Look, 250 gold would buy us a healthy bull, let us rebuild the herd. If you have any pity in you, you&apos;ll give at least that. Please?</string>
<string name="4971">Really? Okay - You may have it for... 1,000 gold!</string>
<string name="4972">Well, then I guess you&apos;re out of luck. 1,000 gold seems a perfectly reasonable price for memories of one&apos;s mother, wouldn&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="4973">Hey, hey, hey! Let&apos;s settle down. I&apos;m sure Erik didn&apos;t send you to kill me! Look, I&apos;ll go as low as 250 then but no more threats from you...</string>
<string name="4974">No! Someone help me, please!</string>
<string name="4975">Hey, if you don&apos;t have 250 on you, what use are you? One way or another, my family needs that money.</string>
<string name="4976">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Well you&apos;re the one who seems to want it so much! 1,000 gold seems like a fair enough price for memories of one&apos;s mother.</string>
<string name="4977">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Okay, maybe I couldn&apos;t get 1,000 for it but I sure could get 400!</string>
<string name="4978">Well if you don&apos;t even have 400 gold to spare, what good are you? Haggle all you want, but that&apos;s as low as I&apos;ll go.</string>
<string name="4979">*Sigh* Bargaining with Erik would have been a lot simpler, I&apos;ll have you know. Fine, then: 250...</string>
<string name="4980">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *Sigh* Bargaining with Erik would have been a lot simpler, I&apos;ll have you know. Fine, then: 250...</string>
<string name="4981">1,000 gold? We... We could buy another half herd with this! Thank you so much, you can&apos;t know how much this means to my family!</string>
<string name="4982">Give me a second, I have the brooch right here in my pocket...</string>
<string name="4983">What the -? Where is it? It&apos;s gone! Somebody must have picked my pocket! I&apos;ve been robbed!!!</string>
<string name="4984">You! You were involved in this, weren&apos;t you? Erik sent you to distract me so someone else could pick my pocket! I&apos;m not stupid, you know!</string>
<string name="4985">Well my family and I aren&apos;t going to come out on the short end of this mess! I&apos;m keeping your money!</string>
<string name="4986">How dare you threaten me after all this! You&apos;re a cruel and evil &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="4987">Hmph. I&apos;m glad we could reach an understanding. I guess we can consider this matter settled, then. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="4988">Fair? Don&apos;t talk to me about fair! I&apos;ve just been robbed - and I know you were involved somehow! So I&apos;m keeping your money, end of story.</string>
<string name="4989">Here it is and I hope that fool Erik has learned not to give his heart so freely. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="4990">Me pa&apos;s a cattle rancher and a good one, too. Without a proper herd, though, we&apos;ve got nothing. There wouldn&apos;t even be food on the table...</string>
<string name="4991">Those stupid wolves have almost been the death of us, even if all they ever preyed on was the cattle!</string>
<string name="4992">Don&apos;t think I enjoyed doing this to poor Erik - I like him, honest. But sometimes things get desperate, all right? I need the 1,000 gold.</string>
<string name="4993">What is this, a joke? I already gave it to you, don&apos;t you remember? </string>
<string name="4994">Now, if there&apos;s something else I can do for you...</string>
<string name="4995">It&apos;s a little late for that, I&apos;m afraid, as I&apos;ve long since given it away. Honestly, you didn&apos;t really expect me to wear the gaudy thing, did you?</string>
<string name="4996">Is there something else I can help you with, maybe?</string>
<string name="4997">Back again, are you?</string>
<string name="4998">Look, I have a lot of work to do, so please leave me be.</string>
<string name="4999">What bad stuff happen to dis place?</string>
<string name="5000">What kind of disaster happened here?</string>
<string name="5001">West: Port Llast, East: Castle Jhareg</string>
<string name="5002">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the pillar alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5003">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;Might&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5004">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;Emperor&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5005">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;Nether&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5006">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;shall&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5007">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;Destroy&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5008">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;Rule&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5009">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;Return&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5010">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;Prevail&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5011">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;does&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5012">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;never&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5013">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;always&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5014">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the &apos;Gur-Atol&apos; rune.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5015">This pillar is weathered with age and covered with moss and small vines... there is no telling how long it has been standing here. Of particular interest are the large runes that seem to cover most of its surface, in no language you recognize.</string>
<string name="5016">Without some way of translating these runes, however, there is no way to determine what they say or what use the pillar might have. Its mysteries remain a secret.</string>
<string name="5017">With the help of the notes in the explorer&apos;s journal, you identify the runes as Ancient Netherese and piece together a rough translation.</string>
<string name="5018">The runes have been placed on depressions... three rows of four runes. Pressing one rune in each row results in a three-word Netherese phrase... the effect of which is unknown.</string>
<string name="5019">Do you wish to press a rune in the first row?</string>
<string name="5020">You step away from the pillar, suddenly aware of a faint yet palpable sense of evil around it.</string>
<string name="5021">Do you wish to press a rune in the second row?</string>
<string name="5022">Do you wish to press a rune in the third row?</string>
<string name="5023">As you press the last rune, the pillar begins to hum...</string>
<string name="5024">The Green Griffon</string>
<string name="5025">Me has no time to listen.</string>
<string name="5026">I have no time to listen to this.</string>
<string name="5027">Okay, okay. You tells me about it, then.</string>
<string name="5028">Fine, fine. Tell me what this is all about, then.</string>
<string name="5029">You go be lost, kid, or me smash!</string>
<string name="5030">Get lost, kid.</string>
<string name="5031">And me is busy with mine. Me goes now.</string>
<string name="5032">And I&apos;m busy with mine. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="5033">There be big reward?</string>
<string name="5034">Is there a reward in it for me?</string>
<string name="5035">You be calm. What be big problem?</string>
<string name="5036">Calm down. What seems to be the problem?</string>
<string name="5037">It no concern for me.</string>
<string name="5038">It&apos;s not my concern.</string>
<string name="5039">Why you and father not just go?</string>
<string name="5040">Why don&apos;t you and your father just leave?</string>
<string name="5041">You wants me to finds mother?</string>
<string name="5042">You want me to find your mother?</string>
<string name="5043">Sombody in charge helps you, no?</string>
<string name="5044">Surely someone in authority can help you.</string>
<string name="5045">Okay, me helps.</string>
<string name="5046">All right, I&apos;ll help.</string>
<string name="5047">You not hears &apos;bout me?</string>
<string name="5048">Haven&apos;t you heard of me?</string>
<string name="5049">You tells me what be wrong, then.</string>
<string name="5050">Tell me what&apos;s wrong, then.</string>
<string name="5051">This haves something to do with cult, maybe?</string>
<string name="5052">Does this have anything to do with a cult?</string>
<string name="5053">Err... hello, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Are you an adventurer? You don&apos;t... look like one. Me and my pa could really use some help, though, if you are.</string>
<string name="5054">You... you&apos;re an adventurer, aren&apos;t you? I mean... I mean greetings. Uh... that is, my pa and I could certainly use your help.</string>
<string name="5055">But... but please! There&apos;s nobody else who can help us! Everyone is busy with their emergencies!</string>
<string name="5056">I... oh... okay. I guess there&apos;s nothing I can say to convince you.</string>
<string name="5057">I think so. I bet my pa could pay you, if you helped out. You could talk to him about it, at least.</string>
<string name="5058">Well, me and my pa... his name&apos;s Gerrol, everyone in Port Llast knows him... we live on a farm just north of the town gates.</string>
<string name="5059">There&apos;s lots of monsters that live in the hills around our farm. Normally they don&apos;t bother us so much, but lately they&apos;ve been ambushing travelers and caravans and such, being real bold.</string>
<string name="5060">They even went and kidnapped my mother while me and pa were away from the farm last week! So my pa sent me to town to get help.</string>
<string name="5061">Pa says he won&apos;t leave ma behind... and besides, it&apos;s our land. Pa doesn&apos;t want to go. Couldn&apos;t you... just talk to him?</string>
<string name="5062">We just needs your help! All I ask is that you go and talk to my pa, Gerrol, nothing else.</string>
<string name="5063">Pa says he&apos;s sent lots of messages about the troubles, but the mayor&apos;s all caught up helping Neverwinter he&apos;s got no time to help us.</string>
<string name="5064">There were some other adventurers who went before, but none of them has come back. I was hoping... maybe you could do what they couldn&apos;t...</string>
<string name="5065">That would be great, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I&apos;m sure my pa would appreciate it. To get to our farm, you just need to go through the north gate and follow the road a bit.</string>
<string name="5066">I&apos;ll stay here for now and find some more people to send to pa, until he calls me back. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll do the trick, though. Just go and talk to him.</string>
<string name="5067">Umm... no. Should I have? I live on a farm just outside of town, so we don&apos;t get much news, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="5068">We&apos;d heard that a bunch of adventurers had come to Port Llast, however, so my pa sent me here to find some people to send to him. It&apos;s real important!</string>
<string name="5069">Uhh... maybe. I don&apos;t know anything about a cult. You&apos;d have to talk to my pa about that.</string>
<string name="5070">Um... hello, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Or... is it my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? I... I&apos;m not very good at this. It&apos;s just that you look like an adventurer, and my pa and I could certainly use some help.</string>
<string name="5071">You just need to go north of Port Llast to speak to my pa at the farm, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I&apos;ll go back there when my pa calls me.</string>
<string name="5072">Kill the enemies of the master!</string>
<string name="5073">Zombies?!</string>
<string name="5074">That not scares you?</string>
<string name="5075">That doesn&apos;t frighten you?</string>
<string name="5076">What books?</string>
<string name="5077">You speaks now, teeny-weeny old gnome...</string>
<string name="5078">Out with it, you crotchety gnome...</string>
<string name="5079">No, you say &apos;books&apos;. Me be sure.</string>
<string name="5080">No, you said &apos;books&apos;. I&apos;m sure of it.</string>
<string name="5081">Why you not tells someone &apos;bout this?</string>
<string name="5082">Why haven&apos;t you told anyone about this?</string>
<string name="5083">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Me from... uhh... Arcane Brothers. Key belongs to us.</string>
<string name="5084">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m from the Arcane Brotherhood, actually. The key belongs to us.</string>
<string name="5085">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes, but we don&apos;t call it the Arcane Brotherhood anymore...</string>
<string name="5086">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; No.</string>
<string name="5087">Yes, I guess I did.</string>
<string name="5088">Yeah, me did.</string>
<string name="5089">Mm? Oh, yes, yes. They&apos;ve been a bit restless for quite some time, now. I imagine it&apos;s one of those wizards down there, not quite as dead as he should be. You know how it goes.</string>
<string name="5090">Us caretakers don&apos;t frighten easily. Besides... I imagine that fella&apos;s busy with his books. He won&apos;t be bothering me for quite some time.</string>
<string name="5091">Oh, did I say books? Err... no I didn&apos;t. I said he&apos;s busy with his looks... yeah, that&apos;s it. Those undead look a fright, you know...</string>
<string name="5092">Dang blast it! Fine, fine. It just so happens those fool wizards left a whole collection of magical books down there. I don&apos;t know why. I bet they just plain forgot about &apos;em, I guess. Leave it to wizards.</string>
<string name="5093">I ain&apos;t never seen &apos;em, but my grandpappy did. He said they was huge books, all covered in runes. The kinds of things wizard usually get their robes all in a knot over.</string>
<string name="5094">Anyhow, I imagine them books is connected to whatever strangeness is going on down there. I don&apos;t mind. I just takes things as they come.</string>
<string name="5095">Tell who? In case you haven&apos;t noticed, people are busy as bees with all their plagues and fighting and such. City&apos;s closed up tighter&apos;n a salt merchant&apos;s pocketbook.</string>
<string name="5096">Me, I figure they&apos;ll notice soon enough when all them zombies begin pouring out of here. All in good time, as my granpappy used t&apos; say.</string>
<string name="5097">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh. Well, all right... though I have to say, you&apos;ve got to be the thickest wizard I&apos;ve ever met and then some. Not that I&apos;ve met any, mind you.</string>
<string name="5098">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; What do I look like? A baby gnome all in his swaddlings? Hmph. Tell me another one.</string>
<string name="5099">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh? Why didn&apos;t you say so? We&apos;ve only been holding onto this key for how long now?</string>
<string name="5100">I suppose you&apos;ve got some more dead to put down there, eh? Heh heh... well, with all them zombies walking about, there&apos;ll be plenty of room. Here... take the key and git.</string>
<string name="5101">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Eh? Didn&apos;t you just ask me what the Arcane Brotherhood was?</string>
<string name="5102">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Dagnabbit! Have I gone and fallen behind the times again? What do they call it now, the Merry Casters of Magick again? Ahh, no matter.</string>
<string name="5103">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh. Must have wax in my ears again. I could&apos;a sworn you did. Must be gettin&apos; old, finally.</string>
<string name="5104">I thought so. I ain&apos;t as old as I look, you know.</string>
<string name="5105">The board reads: &apos;BEWARE! The undead are restless. Bring weapons to visit Grandma or don&apos;t visit her at all. Really.&apos; It is signed: The Caretaker.</string>
<string name="5106">Long have I waited for life to return to these bones. None shall stop me now!</string>
<string name="5107">This pillar shines with a holy light, basking the room in its warm glow.</string>

<string name="5124">You forget it. You enters contest, just likes me.</string>
<string name="5125">Forget it. You entered the contest, just like me.</string>
<string name="5126">I... am most grateful for your aid, my friend. I was almost certain that I was about to die here in this dungeon.</string>
<string name="5127">I was ambushed by invisible creatures in the next room. They are quite powerful. I thought I was skilled enough to battle them anyway, but I was wrong.</string>
<string name="5128">During the battle, one of them came too close to that pillar of light and it... it exploded. I was too injured to take advantage of that knowledge... but you are not.</string>
<string name="5129">Now I intend to find my way out of here. Thank you again, friend. I wish you luck.</string>
<string name="5130">Please... do not leave me here to die, friend! I beg you!</string>
<string name="5131">You are a cruel &lt;man/woman&gt;. Pray you do not meet the same fate as I.</string>
<string name="5132">No! I will not let it end like this!</string>
<string name="5133">P-please hurry. I... do not wish to die in this place, friend.</string>
<string name="5134">I care nothing for this contest any longer. I just want to get out of here alive. Mutamin can keep his blasted coin.</string>
<string name="5135">I will gladly tell you of the creature... and how I believe it can be defeated. If I am healed. Please... I will not last, otherwise.</string>
<string name="5136">Help me.</string>

<string name="5142">Let me see what you sells.</string>
<string name="5143">Let me see what you&apos;re selling.</string>
<string name="5144">Certainly. Until Luskan opens its gates, I&apos;m afraid this is the only store in this region.</string>
<string name="5145">YOU HAVE ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE FINAL TEST!</string>
<string name="5146">You go home, but be safe. Much danger there be if you not go right home and see you father.</string>
<string name="5147">You can go home now, but be careful and go straight to your father.</string>
<string name="5148">You be safe now, so you tell me you story. Please?</string>
<string name="5149">You&apos;re safe now, but I need you to tell me what happened. Please?</string>
<string name="5150">You gots &apos;nuff excitement now?</string>
<string name="5151">Do you think you&apos;ve had enough mystery in your life now?</string>
<string name="5152">You fall for that tale? That story be as old as me grandma&apos;s grandma.</string>
<string name="5153">You fell for that old story?</string>
<string name="5154">I... I guess I could tell you. You seem much nicer than I thought you were.</string>
<string name="5155">Oh, yes. I want to be back in boring, old Port Llast. I like boring now. I&apos;ll never want mystery again.</string>
<string name="5156">Me not finds anything yet.</string>
<string name="5157">Nothing yet.</string>
<string name="5158">&lt;StartAction&gt;Show her the letter to Vardoc.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5159">&lt;StartAction&gt;Show her the Charwood cultist&apos;s journal.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5160">&lt;StartAction&gt;Show her Relmar&apos;s journal.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5161">Me keeps on looking.</string>
<string name="5162">I shall continue the search.</string>
<string name="5163">&lt;StartAction&gt;Show her the letter to Neva.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5164">&lt;StartAction&gt;Show her the letter to Solomon.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5165">&lt;StartAction&gt;Show her Ganon&apos;s journal.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5166">No other stuffs yet.</string>
<string name="5167">Nothing else, no.</string>
<string name="5168">This is good news. What have you discovered?</string>
<string name="5169">So the cult sought to strike at you again! And this time they have given themselves away in the process. Well done!</string>
<string name="5170">Hmm. The ramblings of a madman. One has to wonder what this cult hoped to achieve in that haunted place.</string>
<string name="5171">One can only wonder what this cult might have done had their plans in the Neverwinter Wood been successful. Well done.</string>
<string name="5172">This information suggests that this Maugrim and his cult are to be found within Luskan. I do wonder, however, if this is not some attempt on their part to deceive us. Perhaps they meant for you to find this?</string>
<string name="5173">I would like you to continue your investigation, just in case. I need a second piece of information that supports the first, to be absolutely certain it is the truth. We can afford no mistake.</string>
<string name="5174">This information confirms it, then... the cult is located within Luskan. Excellent work, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You have justified Lord Nasher&apos;s faith in you and more.</string>
<string name="5175">This Maugrim grows desperate, I see. They fear you... and well they should.</string>
<string name="5176">The cult sought to strike against you through an agent, did they? Fortunate for us that their efforts proved fruitless.</string>
<string name="5177">So the cult was responsible for stirring up the humanoids in the hills? You are to be commended for putting an end to that danger, indeed.</string>
<string name="5178">While this information you bring is incredibly valuable, it still does not tell us where the cult is based. We need that information if we are to strike at them.</string>
<string name="5179">Fortunately, it does mention where more cultists may be found. Charwood and the Neverwinter Wood. Search those places, perhaps, for the information we seek.</string>
<string name="5180">Have you found any other information?</string>
<string name="5181">You&apos;d better watch out!</string>
<string name="5182">Are you a werewolf?</string>
<string name="5183">You&apos;re kinda scary. Leave me alone!</string>
<string name="5184">Daddy said you&apos;re the hero of Neverwinter. You don&apos;t look like no hero!</string>
<string name="5185">Are you an adventurer? That must be neat!</string>
<string name="5186">My friend said you&apos;re not really &lt;race&gt;!</string>
<string name="5187">Mommy says you&apos;re the hero of Neverwinter. I want to be a hero!</string>
<string name="5188">I know somebody who has a crush on you. (giggle!)</string>
<string name="5189">You&apos;re the hero of Neverwinter, aren&apos;t you? You are! You are!</string>
<string name="5190">Wow! I want to be just like you someday!</string>
<string name="5191">I&apos;m not supposed to talk to strangers.</string>
<string name="5192">Are you here to kill that werewolf?</string>
<string name="5193">Is there going to be a big war, &lt;mister/missus&gt;?</string>
<string name="5194">Do you know Lady Aribeth? Is she really an elf?</string>
<string name="5195">I don&apos;t suppose there&apos;s something you want?</string>
<string name="5196">I&apos;m just here to have a drink or two. Leave me be.</string>
<string name="5197">They say the hills are still full of monsters. I hate monsters!</string>
<string name="5198">The roads out there aren&apos;t safe. I lost both my guards to some orc raiders.</string>
<string name="5199">I wonder how Mutamin gets all his money? Someone told me he was once a great adventurer.</string>
<string name="5200">I hear that the High Captains in Luskan have been slaughtering the populace in the name of some evil demon.</string>
<string name="5201">How long do you suppose they&apos;ll keep Luskan closed?</string>
<string name="5202">Sigh. This inn isn&apos;t bad, really... I&apos;d just rather get into Luskan and be done with my business.</string>
<string name="5203">I suppose you&apos;re here for the contest, huh?</string>
<string name="5204">Hmm. I hear winning the contest isn&apos;t worth it, after all. What do you think?</string>
<string name="5205">I&apos;d like to congratulate you on your victory, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="5206">Aren&apos;t you the one who won the contest? Wow. Well done!</string>

<string name="5216">This musty old tome appears to be the type of book that was written and never read. It is a long, boring text written by a druid, Jordius Caini Getafix the Third, several hundred years ago. It uses large, complicated and often seemingly meaningless words to discuss his observations on the Spirit of the Wood. One page in the text has been earmarked and there is a small comment beside an underlined passage in the margin.

&quot;This could mean that if one stood in the pool, below the waterfall, and somehow died, one could reappear, alive (presumably) in the realm of the Spirit. I think it would take a combination of two magical forces, one to kill the body, yet capture its essence and transport both to the Spirit&apos;s realm, the other to preserve the corpse and bring it back to life once it enters the realm. The death-giver should be easy, some kind of weapon, perhaps a dagger, since that should be easiest to manipulate in taking one&apos;s life. It would hardly to to imbue a morningstar with this power and then try to bash one&apos;s head in with it, ha ha.&quot;</string>
<string name="5217">Explorer&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="5218">Though this book has been severely damaged by exposure to the elements, large parts of it are surprisingly legible.

Included in its pages are translations of the runic language used by the ancient Netherese.

The remainder seems to be the personal journal of an unnamed explorer who had come to this region determined to find an ancient Netherese temple which he referred to as &apos;the Ruin of Gur-Atol&apos;.

The last page is of particular interest and reads:

&quot;I&apos;ve decided to camp in the forest, tonight. Whatever has happened in Charwood, it&apos;s something I certainly don&apos;t want to get involved in. The villagers there are frightening and will be no help in my search for the temple. It&apos;s best I just avoid them entirely.

&quot;Resting in the forest will not be much better, however. To think I scoffed at the tales I was told of it being haunted. It is so eerily silent... yet I will not be deterred. The secret portal that leads into the Ruins of Gur-Atol must be in this area... and I WILL find it. If I am right, the treasure that will still be there will make all these long months worthwhile.&quot; </string>
<string name="5219">Old Scroll</string>
<string name="5220">This weathered scroll is severely time-worn and covered with almost-indecipherable runes. There is a hand-written translation across the bottom, showing this to be some manner of religious text written by a Netherese priest. Part of the translation is of particular note:

&quot;The lands of NETHER will one day return to the destiny to which they were born. Its people SHALL rise up from their ancient graves and RULE all those which have come after them.&quot;</string>

The only way for mortals to follow is to enter that pool and die while in its waters. A magical dagger is obviously involved in the taking of one&apos;s life.

Poisoned and in great peril, the Spirit of the Wood has retreated to that world, followed by her poisoner, a cult agent by the name of Relmar. He has been killed and a journal on his corpse ultimately led to a cure for the troubled Spirit.

Renewed to her former vigor, the Spirit will once again be able to restore the forest to its proper balance. Aawill will be eager to hear the good news.</string>

<string name="5270">Kendrack, head of the mercenary guild and Mayor of Port Llast, has put out a reward for the death of five dangerous prisoners escaped from Waterdeep. They have separated to avoid detection but can all be identified by means of a tattoo on their left ear, marking them as inmates of the Bulwark prison. It is this tattoo that Kendrack wants as evidence of the deed.

Zor, a burly minotaur, is rumored to have been spotted on the north road, near the Green Griffon Inn. Wyvern, an elven ranger with a taste for trickery, will likely have sought refuge in the Neverwinter Wood. Stirge, an egomaniacal gnome, was last sighted on the road south of Port Llast.

<string name="5276">With the Wailing&apos;s cure and subsequent removal of Neverwinter&apos;s quarantine, the wizardess Eltoora has journeyed to Port Llast to provide her services to those searching for the cult responsible. She also comes with ulterior motives, however, as she seeks a collection of ancient tomes from the lost civilization of Imaskar. The five books are said to act as recipes, providing guidance to those undertaking magical experiments. Should any of the tomes be found, she will not only reward whoever returns them but also make the tomes publicly available to all arcanists who wish to experiment with them in her library.

Through scrying attempts, she has managed to narrow down the locations of the five tomes of Imaskar. The Tome of Fire and the Tome of Death are both said to be lost in Charwood, while the Tome of Life apparently rests with the corpse of Brother Toras in the cemetery outside the walls of Luskan. The Tome of Ice is housed within a tower south of Port Llast and the last, the Tome of Resonance, lies somewhere along the treacherous road to Luskan.</string>

It was a trap, however, and Sir Karathis was himself the Black Wolf.

Neurik believes that, if found soon enough, the three young men may still be curable by a charm he has concocted.

An important lead has been uncovered in the case, found on the body of one of the cult agents operating in the region. The cult appears to be operating out of the dreaded Host Tower of the Arcane which lies at the heart of the pirate city of Luskan.

Aribeth intends to have this lead followed up on and has moved the base of operations to Luskan, itself. Now that you are inside the city, you must seek out Aribeth and Aarin Gend at the Temple of Tyr to find out their plan to get you inside the Host Tower.</string>

With the city&apos;s long quarantine lifted and her lover, Fenthick, hanged, Lady Aribeth has moved the base of her investigation to the township of Port Llast, northernmost member of the Lords&apos; Alliance. There she has once again put out a call to adventurers to seek out the cult&apos;s corruption wherever it may lie. The cult&apos;s base must be discovered and its leaders brought to justice. Standing guard over Aribeth at the local mercenary barracks is Aarin Gend, a Spymaster in the service of the Alliance. She has encouraged all adventurers to work closely with him in their ongoing search of the region.

Aarin Gend has explained that the best lead for locating the cult lies to the north of Port Llast, in a series of caves that lie in the hills. They are inhabited by humanoid monsters that have been performing unusual raids. Should this avenue of investigation not prove worthwhile, the spymaster suggests searching either Luskan to the north, Neverwinter Wood to the east or the wildlands of the South Road.

<string name="5338">This single-minded spirit continues on its way past you, toward a place in the distance.</string>
<string name="5339">Captain Baram smells like a sewer. He gets mad if you tell him.</string>
<string name="5340">War is fun &apos;cause I get to stay up late!</string>
<string name="5341">I can&apos;t go home because my house burnt down.</string>
<string name="5342">Captain Kurth is a big meenie! He hit Billy.</string>
<string name="5343">Mommy says we have to stay here or we&apos;ll die.</string>
<string name="5344">Tag! You&apos;re it!</string>
<string name="5345">Your soul shall be mine!</string>
<string name="5346">I am invincible, fool! Suffering shall be your only reward!</string>
<string name="5347">I bask in the glory of Shar and she is with me!</string>
<string name="5348">I stand in the dark light of Shar and she is my armor.</string>
<string name="5349">Your powers are feeble against the powers of Shar weakling.</string>
<string name="5350">Nothing can touch us, fool! Prepare for death!</string>
<string name="5351">I said we didn&apos;t have anything more to discuss, didn&apos;t I? I assume you know where the door is?</string>
<string name="5352">Me think you wants to know: Kurth be dead.</string>
<string name="5353">I thought you should know: Kurth is dead.</string>
<string name="5354">No, me not does that.</string>
<string name="5355">No, I haven&apos;t.</string>
<string name="5356">Yes. Baram dead, too.</string>
<string name="5357">Yes, actually. He&apos;s dead too.</string>
<string name="5358">Me think you wants to know: Baram be dead.</string>
<string name="5359">I thought you should know: Baram is dead.</string>
<string name="5360">Yes. Kurth dead, too.</string>
<string name="5361">Yes, actually. He&apos;s dead too.</string>
<string name="5362">He is, is he? Well, that&apos;s good. That smug bastard deserves to suffer... I hope he was squealing for mercy in the end.</string>
<string name="5363">I suppose I should thank you for getting rid of him. I don&apos;t suppose you might have gotten rid of Baram while you were at it?</string>
<string name="5364">Oh, well. I suppose things won&apos;t really change, then, once he discovers he&apos;s the only High Captain left... if he actually is. You can never tell. But thank you anyhow.</string>
<string name="5365">What? You... you&apos;re joking, right?</string>
<string name="5366">No, you&apos;re not joking... I can see it in your face. That&apos;s wonderful news! Thank you, thank you! Finally I&apos;m not under the thumb of either of those bastards!</string>
<string name="5367">I wish I could give you some kind of reward! You&apos;ve done us all a huge favor! May the gods bless you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;!</string>
<string name="5368">What? You&apos;re... joking, right?</string>
<string name="5369">Well that&apos;s a relief. Baram was almost worse than Kurth with his twisted little brain. I suppose you did the job? Of course you did, or you wouldn&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="5370">Thank you for that, at least. You&apos;ve done the city a favor. I don&apos;t suppose you might have gotten rid of Kurth while you were at it?</string>
<string name="5371">What? You&apos;re... joking, right?</string>
<string name="5372">I&apos;m sorry, but I really must go!</string>

<string name="5396">The inscription on the shield reads: Beware! The gods as our witnesses, from this day forth the entrance to ancient Illusk shall be sealed. Beneath this house, three wards guard the gates forever confining the unholy evil of Voleron the Damned within. The ancient texts speak of a hero from the south that will break the seals and forever rid the world of the horror within. We pray that the seals will hold until that day comes.</string>
<string name="5397">Heart of Good to prove the hero&apos;s strength to the Guardian.</string>
<string name="5398">This seal has been broken.</string>
<string name="5399">A measure of blessed water to cleanse the hero&apos;s soul.</string>
<string name="5400">The final seal has been broken and the ruins of Illusk are open to you.</string>
<string name="5401">Head of Evil to prove the hero&apos;s courage.</string>
<string name="5402">This seal has been broken.</string>
<string name="5403">What foul curse befell this land when the gates of hell would not open for Voleron the Damned. Though Illusk was brought to ruins, still his evil choked the very life from the land and those that died at his hand will not sleep. Only the one who is destined to destroy Voleron will break the three seals. So have the gods decreed it, so shall it be.</string>
<string name="5404">At last! The &apos;hero&apos; of my enemies comes to die! Once you are dead, Voleron shall be free!</string>
<string name="5405">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the portal alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5406">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put the glowing sphere in the portal.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5407">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put the smooth token in the portal.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5408">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put a random object in the portal.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5409">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lore]&lt;/Start&gt;&lt;StartAction&gt; Examine the portal more closely.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5410">The portal in the center of the room is obviously a construction of magic, its energies being sustained in an artificial manner. Its purpose is unknown... but the aura it gives off fills the room with a dire chill and a sense of evil.</string>
<string name="5411">As it passes through the energies of the portal, there appears to be some kind of violent reaction. The sphere bursts and the portal flares white for just a moment. The magic of the structure is weakened, but not destroyed...</string>
<string name="5412">As the sphere passes through the magical energies, it causes a violent reaction. The portal crackles and shudders and suddenly explodes with power...</string>
<string name="5413">As it passes through the energies of the portal, there appears to be some kind of violent reaction. The token bursts and the portal flares purple for just a moment. The magic of the structure is weakened, but not destroyed...</string>
<string name="5414">As the token passes through the magical energies, it causes a violent reaction. The portal crackles and shudders and suddenly explodes with power...</string>
<string name="5415">You pick up a small piece of stone and put it into the portal. There is a small ripple as the stone passes through the energies... and then falls back onto the floor behind the portal.</string>
<string name="5416">It seems the stone had some effect upon the magic energy of the portal, but not a very strong one. Regardless, nothing can pass through to the wherever it leads.</string>
<string name="5417">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Through the swirling energies, some hellish landscape can just barely be seen. You can tell nothing else from your examination.</string>
<string name="5418">Wherever the portal leads, it is one-way only. Creatures pass through it into our world, but it cannot be used to travel into theirs.</string>
<string name="5419">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Through the swirling images within the portal you get a sense of a hellish landscape. The portal no doubt leads into the depths of the Abyss, itself.</string>
<string name="5420">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The portal connects to one of the outer planes... most likely a layer of the Abyss. It is used to regularly summon demons to this world. In your estimation, its energies seem incredibly sensitive to planar materials.</string>
<string name="5421">The portal is definitely one-way only. One cannot pass through it to the Abyss... though demons seem to be summoned through it into our world on a regular basis.</string>
<string name="5422">What you knows about portal?</string>
<string name="5423">Tell me what you know about this portal.</string>
<string name="5424">Kurth has brought a lot of demons through it... a lot of his power is connected to it in some way. Or that&apos;s what I was told, anyway, by one of his mages. Makes you wonder what he did to get that kind of power.</string>
<string name="5425">There&apos;s a library still around here that belonged to the wizard who made the portal. Maybe it could tell you more about it, I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="5426">You stands back! Me bets they do somethings to you!</string>
<string name="5427">Who you? How this happens?</string>
<string name="5428">You be calm. Me frees you from cocoon.</string>
<string name="5429">Stand back! I can just imagine what&apos;s been done to you!</string>
<string name="5430">Who are you? How did this happen?</string>
<string name="5431">Calm down. I freed you from this cocoon.</string>
<string name="5432">You makes it out okay?</string>
<string name="5433">You wants me to take you to Londa?</string>
<string name="5434">Me has better things to do.</string>
<string name="5435">Me tries.</string>
<string name="5436">Can you make it out of here?</string>
<string name="5437">Do you wish me to take you back to Londa?</string>
<string name="5438">Forget it. I have other things to do.</string>
<string name="5439">I shall try.</string>
<string name="5440">I... Ilmater&apos;s mercy! Where am I? Wh-what is this place?</string>
<string name="5441">Done to me? I... oh, the spiders. I... I remember...</string>
<string name="5442">Me? M-my name is Miriam. These... oh my. The spiders! I... I remember...</string>
<string name="5443">You... freed me? Oh... the spiders, I... I remember! I remember!</string>
<string name="5444">I... yes. I can leave. I... I&apos;ve got to get out of this city, I can&apos;t stay here. Th-thank you for freeing me, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... I must go...</string>
<string name="5445">O-of course. I... didn&apos;t think. N-nobody does anything for anyone, here, do they? I&apos;ve just got to leave, got to get out...</string>
<string name="5446">I cannot face Miss Londa. Not after... not after that. I&apos;ve just got to get out of this place. Th-thank you for freeing me, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... but I must go...</string>
<string name="5447">Destroy the intruder!</string>
<string name="5448">I would speak with you.</string>
<string name="5449">You be Maugrim!</string>
<string name="5450">You knows me coming?</string>
<string name="5451">Who you be?</string>
<string name="5452">So you&apos;re... Maugrim?</string>
<string name="5453">You were expecting me?</string>
<string name="5454">And who are you?</string>
<string name="5455">You be another prisoner of Maugrim, huh?</string>
<string name="5456">Another one of Maugrim&apos;s prisoners, then?</string>
<string name="5457">You knows me? Me not knows who you be.</string>
<string name="5458">You know of me? I have no idea who you are.</string>
<string name="5459">You be Arklem Greeth, huh? Old top wizard?</string>
<string name="5460">You are Arklem Greeth, then... the former Archmage Arcane.</string>
<string name="5461">Huh. You turns yourself into lich.</string>
<string name="5462">Interesting. Transformed yourself into a lich, have you?</string>
<string name="5463">Maybe you be weaker than you thinks.</string>
<string name="5464">Maybe you&apos;re just weaker than you thought.</string>
<string name="5465">You be undead monster?! You be lich!</string>
<string name="5466">You are a lich! An undead thing!</string>
<string name="5467">Me rather kills you, monster!</string>
<string name="5468">I&apos;d rather kill you where you stand, creature!</string>
<string name="5469">You forgets it! Me takes my chances!</string>
<string name="5470">Forget it! I&apos;ll take my chances!</string>
<string name="5471">You rewards me for letting you go?</string>
<string name="5472">Can you reward me for letting you go?</string>
<string name="5473">Why me want to free you?</string>
<string name="5474">Why would I free you?</string>
<string name="5475">How me gets you out, then?</string>
<string name="5476">How do I get you out of there, then?</string>
<string name="5477">What keeps me from killing you after, huh?</string>
<string name="5478">How me knows me can trusts you?</string>
<string name="5479">What&apos;s to keep me from killing you afterwards?</string>
<string name="5480">How do I know I can trust you?</string>
<string name="5481">Me finds some other way. Me not frees you!</string>
<string name="5482">I&apos;ll find some other way. I won&apos;t free you!</string>
<string name="5483">Me has questions, first.</string>
<string name="5484">I have some questions, first.</string>
<string name="5485">That be enough questions.</string>
<string name="5486">That&apos;s enough questions.</string>
<string name="5487">You helps me fight Maugrim, maybe?</string>
<string name="5488">Would you be willing to help me fight Maugrim?</string>
<string name="5489">Why Maugrim keeps you here? Why not kill you?</string>
<string name="5490">Why is Maugrim keeping you captive? Why not kill you?</string>
<string name="5491">You knows if Aribeth with Maugrim?</string>
<string name="5492">Do you know if Aribeth is with Maugrim?</string>
<string name="5493">What you knows &apos;bout Maugrim and cult?</string>
<string name="5494">What do you know about Maugrim and his cult?</string>
<string name="5495">Wait, now... who be you?</string>
<string name="5496">Wait a minute... who are you?</string>
<string name="5497">Ah. I see the fly in the ointment has finally arrived.</string>
<string name="5498">Don&apos;t be so foolish, &lt;man/woman&gt;. You expect the new &apos;master&apos; of the tower to calmly await your arrival in a cage of magic? I think not.</string>
<string name="5499">Are you surprised? This tower is a living thing, in its own manner. To anyone as accustomed to its rhythms as myself, you are the veritable bull in a china shop.</string>
<string name="5500">Someone who has been following your progress through the tower with a great deal of interest, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. You show remarkable determination.</string>
<string name="5501">I was the master of this tower long before the usurper took his place. I sensed your presence here immediately, even from this little prison.</string>
<string name="5502">Oh, indeed. I am Maugrim&apos;s prize, if the truth be known. I am Arklem Greeth... the former Archmage Arcane of the brotherhood, little mortal.</string>
<string name="5503">Bah. Blundering about the tower on some fool&apos;s errand, no doubt, without a thought as to where you are. No matter. My name is Arklem Greeth, little mortal.</string>
<string name="5504">It was I who was once the Archmage Arcane of the brotherhood. I fled from this tower when Maugrim showed his true intentions, but not quickly enough.</string>
<string name="5505">So you are not quite the dullard you seem. Good. You are correct... I fled the tower when Maugrim showed his true intention, but not quickly enough.</string>
<string name="5506">So my own reputation precedes me. Yes... you have the right of it, little mortal. I fled the tower when Maugrim showed his true intention, but not quickly enough.</string>
<string name="5507">Maugrim has power you cannot even imagine. His mistress favors him... and even the power granted me by this... form... could not resist capture in the end.</string>
<string name="5508">I have, at Nyphithys&apos;s advice, in fact. It has proven remarkably beneficial... both for myself and the brotherhood. Maugrim was a... a surprise. He is my enemy... and that means our interests coincide, yes?</string>
<string name="5509">Maugrim caught me by surprise, mortal. His power far surpassed anything I had suspected in him. Regardless, he is my enemy... and that means our interests coincide rather nicely, don&apos;t you think?</string>
<string name="5510">Indeed. Do not get yourself in a huff about it, mortal. At the moment, our interests rather coincide, don&apos;t you think?</string>
<string name="5511">Free me from this magical prison, mortal. You assist me... and I shall assist you.</string>
<string name="5512">Oh, truly? You are an amusing one, mortal. You can certainly try to kill me. The spells Maugrim has enveloped me in to keep me here would prevent your success... but you are free to try.</string>
<string name="5513">Wouldn&apos;t you rather discuss your options... or lack thereof... instead, hm?</string>
<string name="5514">(sigh) You mortals with your limited minds. Very well... do as you wish, if it satisfies your perverse sense of independence.</string>
<string name="5515">A reward? Certainly, my dear &lt;race&gt; friend. I can reward you. You see that door that leads into my sanctum? Have you tried to open it?</string>
<string name="5516">Why, indeed? How about this, my unimaginative &lt;race&gt; friend? You see the door that leads into my sanctum? Have you tried to open it?</string>
<string name="5517">It is locked tightly... with spells that I&apos;m positive you have no ability to break. I happen to know that Maugrim lies beyond it. He is the one you came here for, no?</string>
<string name="5518">I created the spells that hold the door. I can open it for you... but only if I am freed. It&apos;s either that or... you are certainly free to return whence you came. In failure.</string>
<string name="5519">So what do you say now, mortal? Do you really have a choice?</string>
<string name="5520">You see the four braziers that surround me? They sustain the magic that Maugrim keeps me held within.</string>
<string name="5521">They are protected by their own magic... too much for me to overcome on my own. If you were to damage them, however... and I was to add my power to yours... they could be destroyed, and I freed.</string>
<string name="5522">Attack them however you wish and I will turn my own efforts toward aiding you. Then I shall open the door to my sanctum for you... and I shall leave.</string>
<string name="5523">Hmph. You can certainly try if you wish, fool... I will not remain here long enough for you to break through my own protections, however, I can assure you.</string>
<string name="5524">Foolish &lt;man/woman&gt;. You can&apos;t. You can trust, however, that I would rather be away from here than deal with you myself. Have you another choice?</string>
<string name="5525">Go, then. I tire of this cage. I would see Maugrim dance before whatever &lt;race&gt; fury you can muster.</string>
<string name="5526">You see the four braziers that surround me? They sustain the magic that Maugrim keeps me held within... in much the same manner that Nyphithys was held.</string>
<string name="5527">It is locked tightly... with spells that I&apos;m quite sure are beyond even your ability to dispel. I happen to know that Maugrim lies beyond it. He is the one you came here for, no?</string>
<string name="5528">Naturally. Go ahead, mortal. I&apos;d be interested to hear what you have to ask.</string>
<string name="5529">Then what shall it be? Will you free me now?</string>
<string name="5530">Certainly not. You are on your own with your foolish quest. I intend to leave this tower and regroup elsewhere with my dear Nyphithys.</string>
<string name="5531">With luck, you will at least weaken Maugrim... or at least drive him from this tower. I intend to take advantage of that, in time.</string>
<string name="5532">There are many secrets of this tower that are yet mine alone. If Maugrim knew what I knew, he would already be aware of you... and you would not have made it so far.</string>
<string name="5533">Consider yourself lucky. If I didn&apos;t think that you might actually cause a problem for the fool, I might have been amused to warn Maugrim of your presence.</string>
<string name="5534">The elven blackguard? Indeed. She came with him and lies beyond that door. If you hurry, you just might catch her.</string>
<string name="5535">Have you another question, then?</string>
<string name="5536">Ahhh, now that is an interesting question. I, myself, have wondered much about the nature of Maugrim&apos;s mistress. How is it that she gives him such power?</string>
<string name="5537">The plague was loosed to strengthen her, you see. Each death in Neverwinter fed her with new life-force. And I know she seeks even more power, yet.</string>
<string name="5538">Maugrim is desperate to find what he calls the &apos;Words of Power&apos;. They are ancient artifacts I believe... four in total, though I had never heard of them before Maugrim, himself, made mention. He holds only one, but his mistress wishes them all.</string>
<string name="5539">What these &apos;Words of Power&apos; would do for Maugrim and his mistress one can only guess... I&apos;m sure you can. It would amuse me to see you halt their efforts, if that is your goal.</string>
<string name="5540">I have been in contact with my dear Nyphithys, and she has told me much about you. Sadly she has not been able to reach my old sanctum as you have, or I would already be free.</string>
<string name="5541">So? Will you free me or no, little mortal?</string>
<string name="5542">I am waiting, fool. Destroy the braziers and I will add my power to yours. I desire to be free!</string>
<string name="5543">It is done! I am free at last! Would that I could visit vengeance upon Maugrim for this indignity myself!</string>
<string name="5544">I give you thanks for my freedom, mortal. I shall open the door to my sanctum... you may deal with Maugrim at your leisure. Do not be here, however, when I return.</string>
<string name="5545">But you... you intend to be the fly in Maugrim&apos;s ointment, do you not? That will do. I will tell you what I know of his desires, little mortal.</string>
<string name="5546">Have you not wondered at the nature of Maugrim&apos;s mistress? How it is that she gives him such power?</string>
<string name="5547">The plague was loosed to strengthen her, you see. Each death in Neverwinter fed her with new life-force. And I know she seeks even more power, yet.</string>
<string name="5548">Maugrim is desperate to find what he calls the &apos;Words of Power&apos;. They are ancient artifacts I believe... four in total, though I had never heard of them before Maugrim, himself, made mention. He holds only one, but his mistress wishes them all.</string>
<string name="5549">What these &apos;Words of Power&apos; would do for Maugrim and his mistress one can only guess... I&apos;m sure you can. It would amuse me to see you halt their efforts, if that is your goal.</string>
<string name="5550">I would rather it had not come to this... but so be it.</string>
<string name="5551">Me must be going.</string>
<string name="5552">I must go.</string>
<string name="5553">I wish you well, then, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. May Tyr bless your efforts.</string>

<string name="5572">This book explains that the focus of a lab found on this level is to summon a powerful weapon. The arcane ritual appears to mention two ingredients to be placed within the Alchemist&apos;s Apparatus - a gargoyle&apos;s skull and a slaad&apos;s tongue. It is not clear which spell is to be the catalyst that summons the item but the final line reads: &apos;Dispel the magical essence from the components that you may reap your reward.&apos;</string>

&quot;Please inform the apprentices that they are no longer to dump their failed alchemical experiments into the sewer. One can only wonder how those potions affect the water under the city.&quot;

The signature is indecipherable.</string>

Chased from the scene by the sewer&apos;s more typical denizens, Colmarr was forced to leave his so-called Fantabulous Contraptulater behind. While the main body of the contraption is quite sturdy, it bore a series of four levers that were far more fragile. No doubt inquiring minds have already snapped them off and scattered them throughout the city. If the machine is to be restored to full use, all four levers will have to be found and re-attached.</string>

The machine has been found and its functions restored. It looks as if you could pull the levers until they are in the desired position. To activate the machine it looks as if you must pull the chain right beside the levers. Those wishing to brave the stench of the sewers and potions alike are welcome to experiment with it.</string>
<string name="5587">Londa, a world-weary woman staying at Luskan&apos;s Cutlass Inn, has lost all nine of her children to Baram, one of the city&apos;s vicious High Captains. She is hesitant to think of what cruelty they have suffered at his hands and longs only to hear news of them and have them returned safely to her side.

High Captain Baram has informed you that he cruelly had all nine of the children killed... that there is no chance of saving them. There is no way of knowing whether Baram is telling the truth. Regardless, Londa is unlikely to take the news well.</string>
<string name="5588">Politics makes for strange bedfellows, it seems. Certainly, there is no love lost between Bela&apos;s brothel and the High Captains of Luskan. Bela suggests that enemies of the High Captains might benefit by seeking out one of her boys, Oreth, who works upstairs...</string>

One of Bela&apos;s bitter courtesans has informed you that Kurth&apos;s main base lies in the walled-off West Docks district, accessible through a gap in the western wall near Kurth&apos;s ruined tower. With the right key, however, one could access a back entrance that can be found within the ruined tower, itself.</string>

<string name="5593">The city of Luskan rises and falls on the quarrels of its High Captains. Lately, those quarrels have become an all-out war for supremacy and the two remaining contenders, Kurth and Baram, have pulled out all the stops. Very recently, adventurers have laid siege to Kurth&apos;s base.

Inside the base, a prisoner was discovered who offered some information on Kurth. He said that Kurth was obtaining much of his power from the demonic portal in the base, and that more information on the portal could probably be found in the arcane library.</string>

<string name="5600">Through your valiant efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved and what citizens it still has have been spared the suffering of the Wailing Death. Desther, the man responsible for spreading the plague, did not act alone, however. He had substantial backing from a powerful and mysterious cult, which was tracked down with considerable effort to be based within the Host Tower of the Arcane Brotherhood in Luskan.

The leader of the cult, a sorcerer by the name of Maugrim, had engineered a coup to overthrow the order of wizards and bring the majority of its power under the influence of the cult. This power was used to approach other powers in the North and throw the city of Luskan into chaos... all in an effort to build an army that could assault Neverwinter. This army will be led by none other than Lady Aribeth herself... a fallen paladin who has become a blackguard in the service of the same mistress as Maugrim: a strange lizard creature by the name of Morag.

This Morag seeks &apos;Words of Power&apos;... what they are or what will happen once Morag obtains them is unknown, but they may prove to be the only way to block the great power Maugrim and his cult have already gathered.

<string name="5652">I was just happy to help.</string>
<string name="5653">Welcome, &lt;FirstName&gt;. On behalf of the Black Lion Uthgardt tribe let me extend my thanks for your efforts on behalf of Rolgan at his trial.</string>
<string name="5654">You did much when others of the Lords&apos; Alliance did nothing. For that you are forever a friend of the people of the Black Lion.</string>
<string name="5655">The Black Lion tribe call you Oathbreaker for failing to defend Rolgan. You should leave this place - you are no longer welcome here.</string>
<string name="5656">Welcome, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I must congratulate you on your performance at Rolgan&apos;s trial. You truly served the cause of justice in his acquital.</string>
<string name="5657">I know Neurik appreciates all you have done to aid the Temple in this matter.</string>
<string name="5658">Welcome, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope you are not feeling any guilt in failing to gain an acquital for the Uthgardt warrior - his blood is not on your hands.</string>
<string name="5659">You did your duty in this matter and presented the evidence to the court so justice might be served. Sometimes it is difficult for people to accept that Tyr&apos;s justice is harsh.</string>
<string name="5660">Rolgan owes you his life, &lt;FullName&gt;. You have earned much honor in defending him. We children of the Black Lion thank you for what you have done.</string>
<string name="5661">Rolgan&apos;s spirit haunts me for the judgment I have passed - just as he will haunt you for breaking your vow to defend him! Begone, Oathbreaker!</string>
<string name="5662">Welcome back. How&apos;s the life of the bounty hunter treating you? You bring any orc heads back for me? Or is there something else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="5663">Hello, again. If you&apos;ve come to me looking for work, you&apos;re out of luck. With Guzud, Vaath and Obould all out of the picture I&apos;m not handing out anymore bounties. Or was there something else you needed?</string>
<string name="5664">What did happen that night with Griff?</string>
<string name="5665">Go speak with Zokan. His rooms are in the center of the keep; you&apos;ll need to take the east corridor to get there.</string>
<string name="5666">You tell me how me gonna kill them golems again, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="5667">Tell me how to destroy the guardian golems again.</string>
<string name="5668">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5669">Me look for Power Words.</string>
<string name="5670">I am looking for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="5671">Guar-di-an golem? Cre-a-tor? What you mean?</string>
<string name="5672">Guardian golems? Creators? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="5673">Who you be? Is you a ghost?</string>
<string name="5674">Who are you? Are you some type of spirit?</string>
<string name="5675">You gotta know some way to beat them golems.</string>
<string name="5676">Surely there must be some way to defeat these guardian golems.</string>
<string name="5677">You not worry. Me gonna kill them golems and free you, ghosty!</string>
<string name="5678">Don&apos;t worry - I&apos;ll destroy the golems and free your spirit!</string>
<string name="5679">Go back in time? How me gonna do that?</string>
<string name="5680">Go back in time? How am I supposed to do that?</string>
<string name="5681">If you not gonna talk normal, me is gonna leave!</string>
<string name="5682">If you won&apos;t talk sense, then I&apos;m leaving!</string>
<string name="5683">Who you be? Is you a ghost?</string>
<string name="5684">Who are you? Are you some kind of spirit?</string>
<string name="5685">What is you saying? Me not get it.</string>
<string name="5686">What are you trying to say? I don&apos;t understand you.</string>
<string name="5687">Why are you still here? The invulnerable guardian golems of the Creators still walk these halls. You must flee before they destroy you! </string>
<string name="5688">You are of the living - there is no place for you here! Flee these ruins, or the guardian golems of the Creators will destroy you!</string>
<string name="5689">The magic of the Creators compels me to return to my work. The perfection of the Guardians must be maintained. Leave me to my endless torment.</string>
<string name="5690">One of the artifacts you seek is within the heart of this complex, encased in a magically protected vault. But if you seek the Word of Power, the invincible guardian golems of the Creators will surely destroy you.</string>
<string name="5691">The Creators fashioned the guardian golems to protect this place and the Word of Power within. The golems that walk these halls cannot be beaten, they are invulnerable. </string>
<string name="5692">The magic of the Creators has sustained them for ten thousand years, just as it has bound my spirit here for all eternity to maintain the golems in their flawless perfection.</string>
<string name="5693">I am a spirit doomed to be a slave to the Creators in death, even as I was a slave to them in life. My soul is forever bound to this place and the invulnerable golems the Masters forced me to create.</string>
<string name="5694">I was a slave when the golems were first fashioned ten thousand years ago, before this ghostly existence I now endure. The guardians were built without flaw or imperfection - they cannot be beaten!</string>
<string name="5695">To destroy the golems you would have to travel back in time, to the ancient days when the Creators walked the earth. You would have to travel to the time the golems were being made, and introduce a single flaw into their creation.</string>
<string name="5696">This small imperfection would make them vulnerable, and would break the spell of the Creators that binds my spirit to this place and compels me to sustain the golems for all eternity.</string>
<string name="5697">I pray for your success, though I fear you are a fool to try. I am doomed to this fate, but you can still escape this accursed place.</string>
<string name="5698">There is powerful magic in the lands beneath this complex. The Creators used the magic to build the sundials so they might travel back through the rifts of time.</string>
<string name="5699">The secrets of the sundials were not given to the slaves, but if you find a way to unleash their magic you can travel back to the time when the golems were being built.</string>

Excerpt:
&quot;I hate these stinking woods. We were supposed to be doing guard duty in Luskan, but orders came down and next thing you know, we&apos;re racing north and hunting for some kind of magical words. 

&quot;Boyd &apos;The Cockroach&apos; figures we&apos;re going to have to try to sneak into the lair of those giants we saw the other day and try to search there. I think his time as patrol leader must be nearly up. I still have that elven arrow I found. It would be a real pity if the elves managed to assassinate our brave leader...&quot;</string>

Excerpt:
&quot;I amused myself today with memories of the annual fox-hunt at the Vintner Estate. There were some old ruins, back in the woods behind his southern fields that the fox might head for. As we searched the ruins today, I imagined that the Words of Power were the fox and I the hound.

&quot;The other&apos;s must have thought I was cracking up when I started to laugh for no apparent reason, but I suddenly conjured up the image of Lord Vintner as a bespectacled hound and I couldn&apos;t help myself.&quot;</string>

Excerpt:
&quot;All glory to the coming Queen of the Old Ones. Today I had to deal with a traitor in our midst. Jerica was walking beside me as I discussed the possibility of another foray into that cursed dungeon. She was behaving strangely, quiet and introspective. Suddenly she asked me if I thought what we were doing was right. I asked her what she meant and she hesitantly replied that she was wondering if we should actually be serving the Old Ones.
The Coldwood knew blood that day. I had her stripped and tied between two of the trees. I whipped her myself until the flesh hung from her back in long strips. As I whipped her, she begged for forgiveness for her doubt. I was going to let her live, but then she cried out to Ilmater, for release.
As she muttered her prayer, I cut out her beating heart and burnt it as a sacrifice to the Old Ones.</string>

Edegar - my assistant, a good and honest man. He is usually to be found here helping out in the temple.
Averik - a Lords&apos; Alliance soldier. When not in the company of a female he can be found in the drinking house.
Jevon - a Lords&apos; Alliance soldier. A reliable young man who spends most of his free time in the barracks.
Dalcia - a female ranger. She spends her time living with the Uthgardt on the plateau near Beorunna&apos;s Well.
Palla - a wise woman of the Uthgardt. She makes her home on the plateau near Beorunna&apos;s Well.

When you are ready to start the trial, go speak to Neurik at the Temple of Tyr.</string>
<string name="5762">Adventurer&apos;s Note</string>
<string name="5763">An adventurer&apos;s journal; most of the pages are torn and blood-stained, but a few notes can be made out still:

&quot;The golems are invincible; it is only luck that has them move so slowly they cannot keep up.

&quot;There must be some way to defeat them; the strange wizard in the garden seems to know something, but she won&apos;t tell me.

&quot;I must leave now, I know, else I may never see my family again. If only I can make it back to the door.</string>
<string name="5764">This key was possessed by the guardian golems in the Creator Race Ruins; it opens the door they were protecting.</string>
<string name="5765">Golem Key</string>
<string name="5766">This note appears to be instructions from a high priest to one of his underlings describing how to enter the central vault of the complex:

As a keeper of the sacred artifacts you must understand the secrets of our inner sanctum. Only the rituals of smoke, light and sound will unbind the door - there is no other way to enter its hallowed walls. Once the slaves have finished building our golems, our defenses will be fully intact.

The enslaved fairy will guide you through the ritual of sound, for she is bound to the magic of the gongs. 

To complete the ritual of smoke you must cast the blessed powders on the sacred brazier so that their combinations match the descending order of the stones set into the brazier&apos;s base.

The ritual of light can only be completed using the stones drawn from the holy pool in the center of the pillars. Begin by choosing any two of the single stones set in the primary color pools. The secondary pools must then be filled with the twin gems that match the corresponding color that would be created by combining the hues of the stones in the primary pool.

You may keep this letter for a fortnight, and then you will be tested on what you have learned. Master the secrets of the rituals and the Queen will be pleased with you. Fail to learn them and you shall suffer a grisly fate.</string>
<string name="5767">These appear to be the lab notes of Cyril, the mage who created this laboratory:

I believe I have at last unlocked the keys to creating the Staff of Command! As I suspected all along, the key ingredients were a rakshasa eye and a quartz crystal. However, determining the proper spell to cast on the components once they were combined in my laboratory was not as simple as I had at first assumed.

My error came in looking for an obscure solution, and missing the stunningly obvious answer right in front of me. Of course the necessary spell to create a Staff of Command is Dominance.

I must remember this valuable lesson - the most obvious solution is often the right one, even when dealing with the arcane.</string>

<string name="5835">They could be anywhere in that war zone - inside an abandoned home, holed up in an empty shop. Nobody knows where they are... except maybe Asgard. But nobody even knows if he&apos;s still alive!</string>
<string name="5836">Asgard used to be a smuggler in Neverwinter, until he lost his sight. Now he&apos;s just an old, blind man. But he knew this city inside out - the location of every hidden passage and secret hideout.</string>
<string name="5837">Asgard might be able to help us get to Aribeth and Maugrim... if we knew where to find him. Last I heard he was living in the district just beyond the south gates, but now that it&apos;s become a warzone I doubt he&apos;s even still alive.</string>

<string name="5880">Who you be?</string>
<string name="5881">Who are you?</string>
<string name="5882">Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Aarin Gend has instructed me to provide whatever assistance I can to you in your mission to recover the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="5883">However my magic is not of a healing nature. My skills are tied to the teleportation portal in this temple and the Stone of Recall in your backpack. Is there something I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="5884">You should speak to Oleff in that case. My abilities are tied strictly to the Stone of Recall and the teleportation portal. Is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="5885">I am Sergol, a priest of Tyr. It is my duty to aid and assist those in the service of Neverwinter, though I am no healer. </string>
<string name="5886">My magic is tied to the Stone of Recall in your backpack and the teleportation portal you see in this room. Now, is there something else you need of me? </string>
<string name="5887">Here, I am giving you a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at any time and it will instantly transport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="5888">I thought you would be familiar with this by now. However, it is important so I will go over the use of the Stone of Recall again.</string>
<string name="5889">In your backpack you carry a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at anytime and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>
<string name="5890">This will allow you to return quickly to town whenever you need to, saving precious traveling time.</string>
<string name="5891">There is more, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once you have used the stone to return, go through the teleportation portal and it will instantly send you back to the place your stone was last activated.</string>
<string name="5892">Anyone in your service - henchmen, familiars and the like - will also be transported with you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="5893">You&apos;re lucky to be alive. We barely managed to bring you back; your soul had nearly departed to the afterlife. </string>
<string name="5894">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. May the grace of Tyr be with you. </string>
<string name="5895">I can help you return to the site of your last battle, but are you sure you want to go back so soon? </string>
<string name="5896">Whatever you were fighting will still be there. It would be wiser to find a way to avoid this confrontation, or at least to arm yourself better with supplies from some of the shops in the camp.</string>
<string name="5897">Or perhaps you should use the teleportation portal to return to the spot where you last activated your Stone of Recall.</string>
<string name="5898">Here, I am giving you a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at any time and it will instantly transport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>

<string name="5900">In your backpack you carry a Stone of Recall. You can activate this stone at anytime and it will instantly teleport you and anyone in your service back to this temple.</string>

<string name="5903">Anyone in your service - henchmen, familiars and the like - will also be transported with you. Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="5904">As you wish. I can use my magic to return you to the site you just came from. This will return you to your last battle. Are you ready? </string>
<string name="5905">As you wish. Prepare yourself, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="5906">Hmmm. I thought you would have been familiar with this process by now. Very well, I shall explain it to you myself.</string>
<string name="5907">You are one of Aarin Gend&apos;s most important agents. After all you have done for Neverwinter he wants me to keep watch over you personally. </string>
<string name="5908">Before your mission started I cast a Word of Recall spell upon you, so that whenever you become mortally wounded I can immediately teleport you here to safety. </string>
<string name="5909">Just now, some enemy must have struck you a near fatal blow, and so the spell&apos;s contingency magics activated and whisked you away to safety. </string>
<string name="5910">I can&apos;t do that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are too important. Neverwinter has need of your skills if we&apos;re ever to find the Words of Power. We can&apos;t risk an untimely demise.</string>
<string name="5911">As soon as your battered body appeared, the other clerics here called upon the healing power of Tyr to bring you back from the brink of death. </string>
<string name="5912">You are now as ready as you&apos;ll ever be to continue with your mission. The Recall spell will activate again if you are dealt another fatal blow. </string>
<string name="5913">The spell doesn&apos;t require your presence. I simply needed to know your full name, which Aarin Gend provided.</string>
<string name="5914">I am Sergol, a priest of Tyr. It is my duty to aid and assist those in the service of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="5915">Ah. You have awakened. I need to speak with you. </string>
<string name="5916">We are very disappointed in you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your slaughter of innocent people has caused much suffering in a time already overburdened with tragedy.</string>
<string name="5917">Were it up to me you would have been left to rot in your grave; however, Aarin Gend has ordered me to resurrect you. Despite your actions, Neverwinter still has need of you.</string>
<string name="5918">You will suffer no further consequences for your mad killing spree, but I implore you not to engage in such wholesale slaughter again. Please, focus on the mission you have been given. </string>
<string name="5919">&lt;StartAction&gt;Close the secret exit.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5920">&lt;StartAction&gt;Use the secret exit.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="6379">Keep acting like that, you&apos;ll see just how bad I can be.</string>
<string name="6380">All right, I says you attack right now!</string>
<string name="6381">Rrraaaagh!!!</string>
<string name="6382">I smack you down!</string>
<string name="6383">Bleed and die!</string>
<string name="6384">I hurt. Heal me right now. </string>

<string name="6386">Look, I see the enemy here. </string>
<string name="6387">We run now! This fight is lost!</string>
<string name="6388">You step up and I smack you back! Come on!</string>
<string name="6389">You guard me good, understand?</string>
<string name="6390">You not move from here. Hold this spot.</string>
<string name="6391">Urgh... Poisoned... Not good....</string>
<string name="6392">Spell magic got spoiled... urgh!</string>
<string name="6393">Attack made nothing happen! Nothing!</string>
<string name="6394">You follow behind me, all right?</string>
<string name="6395">You look here. See this.</string>
<string name="6396">Group up here! Get formed up!</string>
<string name="6397">You move. Now.</string>
<string name="6398">Maybe this lock needs picking.</string>
<string name="6399">Search careful for secret things here.</string>
<string name="6400">We hide now, in shadow.</string>
<string name="6401">I can do.</string>
<string name="6402">That can&apos;t be done.</string>
<string name="6403">This is done here.</string>

<string name="6406">Hello to you there.</string>
<string name="6407">Uh huh.</string>
<string name="6408">Nuh uh.</string>
<string name="6409">Stop, you.</string>
<string name="6410">I need rest time right now.</string>
<string name="6411">This dull. Hurry up and find stuff to do!</string>
<string name="6412">Goodbyes.</string>
<string name="6413">Thank you for that. That was good.</string>
<string name="6414">Rrgh.. this is... URGHH!!</string>
<string name="6415">Hah, yeah!</string>
<string name="6416">You listen to me here. I say things.</string>
<string name="6417">That sounds good, I think.</string>
<string name="6418">That&apos;s bad. Think of better stuff.</string>
<string name="6419">I warn you, things that bug me get stomped on!</string>
<string name="6420">There&apos;s been a prison break in the Peninsula District. Sedos Sebile, Commander of militia operations in the Peninsula, has requested help in finding a means into the Prison.</string>

<string name="6427">Why have you returned, warm-blood? **hiss** My magic cannot sustain this astral pocket much longer. You must leave through the portals and return to your own world so that I may finally be free to pass from this existence.</string>
<string name="6428">The Great Tree</string>
<string name="6429">Tell me again about your vision of my future.</string>
<string name="6430">Me want you to say again about what you see in me future.</string>
<string name="6431">Goodbye, Haedraline.</string>
<string name="6432">**hiss** I see you still live, warm-blood. **hiss** I feared you had perished with Morag and the rest of the Old Ones when the Source Stone collapsed.</string>
<string name="6433">What is this place, Haedraline? How did I get here?</string>
<string name="6434">Where is we, Haedraline lizard-girly? How me get here?</string>
<string name="6435">The Source Stone collapsed? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="6436">Source Stone collapse? What you mean?</string>
<string name="6437">You again? What do you want now?</string>
<string name="6438">You again? What you want now, lizard-girly?</string>
<string name="6439">I am anxious to return to my own world, Haedraline.</string>
<string name="6440">Me just want to go home now, lizard-girly.</string>
<string name="6441">When you destroyed Morag you destroyed her magic as well. **hiss** The world she had created - the Source Stone - crumbled into nothingness, and all trapped within it were utterly consumed. **hiss**</string>
<string name="6442">I used my magic to open a portal from the collapsing Source Stone into this astral pocket, a temporary place of refuge between that world and your own. **hiss** I am glad you found the portal and escaped with your life, warm-blood.</string>
<string name="6443">**hiss** My time here grows short. The Words of Power are broken and my magic is fading. **hiss** Soon I will pass from this existence and this astral pocket will also collapse.</string>
<string name="6444">Pass from this existence? Are you dying?</string>
<string name="6445">What you mean by pass from ex-ist-ence? Is you dying?</string>
<string name="6446">So it&apos;s over, then? Neverwinter is safe once more?</string>
<string name="6447">So it all be over? Neverwinter be safe now?</string>
<string name="6448">The time of the Creator Race is over. **hiss** There is no place for me in your world now, just as there was no place for Morag. I have accepted this, warm-blood.</string>
<string name="6449">You have faced Morag and the Old Ones and triumphed. **hiss** Even the foul and ancient magics of the dark Queen could not stand against your might. </string>
<string name="6450">You are the savior of Neverwinter, warm-blood - but you are also much, much more. **hiss** You have altered the fate of not just your own world, but a thousand others that would have fallen to Morag&apos;s armies.</string>
<string name="6451">I only did what had to be done.</string>
<string name="6452">Me only did what me had to do.</string>
<string name="6453">Maybe people should start bowing down before my awesome greatness.</string>
<string name="6454">Wow! People should bow down whenever me come near.</string>
<string name="6455">For all the work I did you&apos;d think I could get more of a reward.</string>
<string name="6456">Me think me could get some big reward for all the work me do.</string>
<string name="6457">Few could have faced Morag&apos;s power and survived. **hiss** But even though you have ended the threat of the Creator Race your work is far from done, for I have seen glimpses of what fate awaits you.</string>
<string name="6458">I have marked well your evil nature, warm-blood. **hiss** You hunger for power and wealth, you seek to dominate and destroy those who will not bow down before you. **hiss**</string>
<string name="6459">You are a champion of the North, a defender against all that is dark and evil. **hiss** Hold fast to what you believe to be true and your courage shall not fail when you face your greatest challenge.</string>
<string name="6460">Your legend and fame will continue to grow, spreading throughout the North. **hiss** But Morag will not be the most dangerous foe you face in your lifetime. **hiss** As you become ever more powerful, so will those who seek to destroy you. </string>
<string name="6461">Take heed of my warning, warm blood. You are not so different from my people - or from Morag herself. **hiss** As your terrible legend grows, so will the power and conviction of those who stand against you.</string>
<string name="6462">Heroes will rise to challenge your tyranny, just as you rose to challenge Morag. **hiss** Hoard your power and marshal your forces, for you will need all your resources to triumph against those who would cast you down.</string>
<string name="6463">Who are these upstarts who will dare to stand against me?</string>
<string name="6464">Who be them ones who want to fight with me?</string>
<string name="6465">Greatest challenge? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="6466">Greatest challenge? What you mean by that?</string>
<string name="6467">The city of Neverwinter is still vulnerable, and there are other enemies who seek to destroy it - and you. **hiss** There are sinister forces that will ally against you, for you are a symbol of all that is righteous and good.</string>
<string name="6468">More than this I cannot say, for my magic has grown weak with the destruction of the Words of Power, and the mists of time cloud my vision.</string>
<string name="6469">Quickly now, warm-blood. I cannot sustain this astral pocket much longer. **hiss** The portal behind me will return you to your own world.</string>
<string name="6470">I thank you for all you have done - never again will I be a Word Slave. **hiss** Go through the portal so that I may finally pass to my long awaited eternal rest.</string>
<string name="6471">What are you talking about? Who seeks to destroy me?</string>
<string name="6472">What you mean? Who be person who want to destroy me?</string>
<string name="6473">There are many who will try to steal that which you have worked so hard for, and others will seek to forge their own legend by destroying you. **hiss** Your enemies will band together, they will strike when you least expect it. **hiss** That is the price of fame and fortune.</string>
<string name="6474">**hiss** You speak with arrogance, but there is truth in your words.</string>
<string name="6475">You have done everything I have asked of you, warm-blood. **hiss** Morag has been defeated, the magic of the Words of Power is broken. **hiss**</string>
<string name="6476">The Creator Race can never return, and never again will I be a Word Slave. **hiss** You are free to leave this astral realm at any time, with my thanks. The portal behind me will take you back to your own world.</string>

<string name="6525">I am in a very good mood today. Someone must agree with my views, as the evil Meldanen has suffered an... incident. I&apos;m sure he deserved whatever has happened.</string>
<string name="6526">He was hoarding food, essentially starving the poor. I was going to offer a reward for the key to his warehouse, and for his silver tooth as proof of his death.</string>
<string name="6527">Tell me, do you know of any such things being done? You look like a &lt;man/woman&gt; of action.</string>

<string name="6539">Cloak of Resistance +2</string>
<string name="6540">Cloak of Resistance +3</string>
<string name="6541">Cloak of Resistance +4</string>
<string name="6542">Cloak of Resistance +5</string>
<string name="6543">Cloak of Arachnida</string>
<string name="6544">This black garment, embroidered with a web-like pattern in silk, gives the wearer many of the abilities of a spider.  The cloak also grants immunity to entrapment by web spells or webs of any sort.

Cloaks of this type are common in the Underdark, and are almost standard raiment for drow priestesses.</string>
<string name="6545">Cloak of the Bat</string>
<string name="6546">Known only by his nickname, Stiletto the thief became renowned for his amazing skill at burglary. He claimed he could get in and out of the most secure, heavily guarded treasure rooms without ever getting caught. Once, on a dare, he snuck into Zhentil Keep and stole a ring from Fzoul&apos;s high chambers. Getting in seemed to be easy, but escaping turned out to be more difficult. When Stiletto found himself surrounded by multiple guards, the secret of his career was revealed.  Stiletto turned into a bat and flew out through a window.</string>
<string name="6547">Cloak of Displacement</string>
<string name="6548">Interwoven with strands of sinew from a displacer beast&apos;s tentacles, the fabric of a Cloak of Displacement distorts and warps light waves, much like the displacement spell, making it much harder for enemies to score a proper hit on the wearer.</string>
<string name="6549">Cloak of Greater Sanctuary</string>
<string name="6550">These silvery gray cloaks seem to absorb light rather than be illuminated by it.  On command, these cloaks make their wearer wraithlike in appearance.  

The gnome wizard Dimble Deagal confounded Lathander&apos;s clerics in Featherdale for years before his secret was finally revealed by a traveler skilled in the Art.  Dimble owned one of these cloaks and used it to scare the local farmers.  The Featherdarrans had mistaken the often insubstantial gnome for an actual ghost and roused the local exorcists who continually failed to turn the false specter.</string>
<string name="6551">Greater Mantle of Spell Resistance</string>
<string name="6552">This embroidered garment is worn over normal clothing or armor.  A favored defensive tool of powerful spellcasters, it grants the wearer significant resistance to all spells.</string>
<string name="6553">Vestments of Faith</string>
<string name="6554">These holy garments are most often a gift from Ilmater to a favored disciple.  They are worn over normal clothing and grant a special protection to the person wearing it, helping to ease that faithful soul&apos;s physical suffering.</string>
<string name="6555">Laeral&apos;s Storm Armor</string>
<string name="6556">This well-crafted suit of full plate armor is made of a strange, nonmetallic material that does not conduct electricity. Lore has it that the substance is native to some other plane. </string>
<string name="6557">Storm Armor of the Earth&apos;s Children</string>
<string name="6558">This well-crafted suit of full plate armor is sized for smaller humanoids, and is crafted of a strange nonmetallic substance that does not conduct electricity or heat. Lore has it that the substance comes from some other plane of existence.</string>
<string name="6559">Cape of the Fire Bath</string>
<string name="6560">Common among clerics and other powerful followers of Kossuth, these cloaks of resistance are brilliant red and embroidered with images of flames. The wearer can withstand both extremely hot weather and mystical fire damage.</string>
<string name="6561">Cape of Winter</string>
<string name="6562">These cloaks of resistance are commonly found among frost giants and other Auril-worshipping creatures in the frozen North. The cloak is white and trimmed with white fur.  

The wearer can withstand extremes of cold weather and magical cold damage as well.</string>
<string name="6563">Cloak of Blackflame</string>
<string name="6564">This cloak resembles a tangle of thick, black cobwebs when not worn, but smoothes into a woven black cloak of coarse threads when donned.  It protects its wearer from energy-draining attacks.

Such cloaks originated in the halls of Sorcere in the city of Menzoberranzan where they are used by drow necromancers to protect themselves from their own creations.  This cloak is an adaptation for use in the surface realm.</string>
<string name="6565">Hair Shirt of Ilmater</string>
<string name="6566">This heavy shirt is made of coarse brown horsehair, unpleasant to the touch.</string>
<string name="6567">This thick shirt of coarse brown horsehair constrains its wearer but provides additional protection from damage. In addition, the wearer can invoke cure serious wounds once per day.  

Generally made and worn by disciples of Ilmater, the wearers of these garments usually only use the shirt&apos;s curative powers to ease the suffering of others.</string>

<string name="7267">Whatever the motives of the Monks of the Old Order might be, no one doubts that they are keenly, defensively minded. Rumor has it that the masters of the order attain ranks by being able to survive a beating by an Ogre, without ever raising a hand in defense. True or not, these robes, produced by the order to fund monasteries, are the trade mark of any monk who would survive in the frontlines of combat, against an enemy clad in armor.</string>
<string name="7268">When she was a young student in the monastery of the Dark Moon monks, Beyl Van Yoren&apos;s teachers would constantly urge her to move faster and faster. They were finally appeased, when she suddenly began to be able to hit them four shots for every one of theirs. Despite her speed, Beyl found she had trouble concentrating on lessons, usually because she was moving so much faster than everyone else, that she would often grow bored and restless. Eventually she gave up the robes and the monastery to go and live with the wizard, whom she had traded &apos;personal favors&apos; with for months, to earn the robes.</string>

<string name="7465">The Shining Hand Monastery in Vaasa has made an impressive reputation, and a small fortune, designing these robes. Demand has spread across many nations, such that different variations on the similar robes keep the monks hard at work. The robes increase a monk&#8217;s senses to such a degree that she can focus on her opponent and move her body to absorb blows. One drawback to these robes is that they make the wearer supersensitive to noise. Even in the quiet rooms of the monastery the wearer would have a hard time distinguishing between the snoring of a brother down the hall and the scuttling of a rat under his bed.</string>

<string name="7472">The original version of these boots were said to be worn by the wise wanderer, Teki Jin, of Kara-Tur. As he traveled and grew in strength, Teki was joined by students who would follow in his path. When a student left to travel their own path, Teki would pass his old boots to his student, to remind them that every path under the sun should be walked in the wisdom of the past. After his death, many copies of his boots would show up in stores, each supposedly handed down from Teki to a student. Even if these copies are nothing more than clever forgeries, they do seem to assist the wearer in avoiding enemy attacks.</string>

<string name="7517">Ciressa Gind&#8217;ra was a mage who infiltrated the Night Masks for the Harpers, before she was found drowned in a two-inch puddle outside her residence. To infiltrate them, Ciressa created an amulet that allowed her to mimic the abilities of a master thief. One night she used it to break into the Night King&#8217;s private quarters. She didn&#8217;t anticipate the Night King&#8217;s personal guard, who had a permanent detect magic spell surrounding the room. When the Night King was finished with her, he took the amulet and since it had qualities useful for any adventurer, he made copies of it, which he sold throughout the land.</string>

As a gift for her heroic deeds, Kelemvor gave her this amulet, along with the secret of making copies for other clerics dedicated to the destruction of powerful undead creatures. Many a thief has since found these items to be invaluable in their line of work as well.</string>

<string name="7524">Mynseril Lostbone was a powerful priest of Malar who enjoyed many a bloody brawl or battle, but felt that such fights were simply over too soon. Studying the regenerative capabilities of trolls, Mynseril was convinced that more entertainment value could be garnered from a field of regenerating warriors than a regular battlefield, so he commissioned the creation of a number of powerful rings. When the rings were finished, he distributed them to particularly vicious warriors, who were often on opposite sides of the battlefield.</string>

<string name="7527">Confounded by the inability to wear more than two magical rings at once, and desiring the powers of several of his own rings, Jagen Marsk, a Turmish noble, researched the combining of powers in magical rings. While what he was really hoping for was to combine invisibility with teleportation, he eventually had to settle with this ring, that provided a measure of magical protection, with a handy light source. He now sells these rings to finance his ever-growing obsession with more powerful combinations.</string>

<string name="7727">Greater Battle Robe</string>
<string name="7728">Mage&apos;s Battle Robe</string>
<string name="7729">Sick to death of hearing about the prowess of mages like Elminster, Blackstaff, and the Red Wizards of Thay; Klaphen Fortier, a powerful, but relatively unknown wizard, created these robes to bolster young spellcasters across the realms. His hope was that youthful and unscrupulous mages might be encouraged to challenge more powerful wizards in hopes of making a name for themselves. Rumor has it that Klaphen died in an accident of spectacular proportions, when 56 lightning bolts and numerous large meteors struck his tower.</string>
<string name="7730">Master Adventurer&apos;s Robe</string>
<string name="7731">Former Royal Magician Vangerdahast to King Azoun IV of Cormyr was once an accomplished adventurer of high fame. One reason he became popular in wizardly circles was his creation of the Adventurer&apos;s Robe. Mages have always struggled with the limitations placed on them by the ability to cast arcane magics. These robes give the mage an edge in surviving encounters with melee fighters by being able to absorb some damage from hits.</string>

<string name="7748">This obviously magical pool is filled with an opaque, viscous liquid. The tingle of immense power radiates from the pool and simply being near it fills you with a sense of divine will. An engraving on the side of the pool explains its purpose:</string>

<string name="7760">Mask of Persuasion</string>
<string name="7761">In his battle to deflect the attentions of the god Mask, the drow deity of thievery, Vhaeraun, granted his followers the knowledge to create these helms. These special helms not only mask the faces of his followers, but they make infiltration into enemy camps, such as the Church of Mask, far easier. With these helms, Vhaeraun&apos;s dedicated followers are some of the most effective and deadly spies in the realm.</string>

<string name="7769">Lost and alone in the gloomy wilderness of the underdark, Polt Henrikson prayed for guidance from his venerated deity, Savras. His pleas did not go unheard, and Polt felt a weight around his waist that he soon discovered was a belt. When he touched it, the belt began to glow and suddenly Polt felt a confidence he had never known before. When he emerged from the underdark, Polt went on to lead a revival amongst the worshipers of Savras.</string>

<string name="7772">Belt of Agility +1</string>
<string name="7773">Attempting to form an anti-thieves&apos; guild, Ronger Delphos, a successful merchant, paid thieves to become security experts, to guard merchants in Waterdeep. The guards were trained to use wands with the Hold Person spell, to capture the thieves for interrogation. To counteract this security measure, magical belts were purchased by the thieves&apos; guild, which nullified the effects of such spells. In the escalating war between the two guilds, many of these belts found their way into pawnshops and equipment stores.</string>

<string name="7778">Having explored the northlands extensively, a druid named Aawill commissioned the creation of these comfortable boots. Knowing he was heading for the sometimes-dangerous domain of the Neverwinter Woods, Aawill was looking for something helpful in combat, to lighten his need for armor. Since becoming the Archdruid for the Neverwinter Wood&apos;s Druid Grove, Aawill has commissioned several, more powerful versions of his original boots.</string>

<string name="8097">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="8098">The news I have heard is sad, yet I am sure you did your best. Is there anything I can do for you?</string>
<string name="8099">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="8100">Thanks. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="8101">Nothing. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="8102">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lore]&lt;/Start&gt; Elaith Craulnober. Me hears that name befores.</string>
<string name="8103">(sigh) Goodbye, then.</string>
<string name="8104">So ye&apos;ve gone and solved our problems, eh? Well, I guess I don&apos;t have to be stoppin&apos; no more wanderers then, and that&apos;s for sure.</string>
<string name="8105">And isn&apos;t it just the saddest day with the Spirit gone. I sure be hopin&apos; that we can be restoring the forest someday.</string>
<string name="8106">A wild, piercing screech fills your ears and an almost blinding light streams down from the heavens. Suddenly you realize you are no longer alone.</string>
<string name="8107">You catch a squirrel and slice it open on the altar. As its blood oozes onto the altar, you are filled with a sense of horror and revulsion as your body suddenly begins to decay.</string>
<string name="8108">Nothing seems to happen.</string>
<string name="8109">As the first drop of your blood hits the altar, an eerie shiver runs down your spine and you feel nausea grip your stomach. Your blood burns like lava in your veins.</string>
<string name="8110">Using the dagger, scratch your initials into the altar.</string>
<string name="8111">Sacrifice a small woodland creature on the altar, using the ceremonial dagger.</string>
<string name="8112">Wave the dagger in random patterns above the altar.</string>
<string name="8113">Draw the blade of the dagger across the palm of your hand and drip blood on the altar.</string>
<string name="8114">The image dissolves and suddenly you can see that the dwarf is in the Spirit&apos;s realm. A few minutes later Relmar is joined by several of the other men. </string>
<string name="8115">Relmar, the crazy dwarf!</string>
<string name="8116">Go on.</string>
<string name="8117">Me go free? Oh, joy! Me run away now. Me thanks you much.</string>
<string name="8118">Hmph. So that&apos;s what grandpappy was talkin&apos; about, was he? Just looks like a tattered old cook book to me. Smells like an old sock, to boot.</string>
<string name="8119">I don&apos;t know nothin&apos; that would help you out. Why don&apos;t you go find that woman that was askin&apos; all them questions about it? Eltoora, she said her name was. From Port Llast.</string>
<string name="8120">Or burn it. Or donate it to some school where young&apos;n wizards like to poke their tiny noses into places they don&apos;t belong. I have me graveyard to take care of, damn it! Off ye go!</string>
<string name="8121">Like this one wizard who came by here months back... Eltoora, she said her name was. From Port Llast. Desperate to find them books. I didn&apos;t tell her nothin&apos;.</string>
<string name="8122">Just what I said. Some mage from Port Llast who came here lookin&apos; for them old books. Said she&apos;d pay a pretty price for &apos;em, too.</string>
<string name="8123">She wouldn&apos;t pay ME nothin&apos; unless I actually went down and got her them books, however. Bloody thick-headed, them mages, I tell you.</string>
<string name="8124">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="8125">What you knows about magic book me finds in tomb?</string>
<string name="8126">What do you know about this tome I found in the tomb?</string>
<string name="8127">What you says about Eltoora?</string>
<string name="8128">What&apos;s this about Eltoora?</string>
<string name="8129">Though dwarven druids are rather rare, the few who choose this path can be quite intimidating.</string>
<string name="8130">This is the journal of one Dydd, another contestant in Mutamin&apos;s Challange. The last entry seems to make reference to the riddle with the numbered doors in the room where his body lies:

Curse this riddle! As near as I can tell the grand daughters that the riddle mentions expand in a pattern. 4 to 5 to 7 to 11? What comes next? It isn&apos;t 16. That is all that I know.</string>
<string name="8131">Karlat&apos;s Burning Wand</string>
<string name="8132">This wand is an extremely simple to use wand that casts the spell Burning Hands. The wand need only be waved and no arcane knowledge is required to use it. It was likely the very first wand given to a young apprentice mage.</string>
<string name="8133">Karlat&apos;s Protection Wand</string>
<string name="8134">This wand was used to cast protections on Karlat while he was summoning fiends. Anyone attempting to summon a fiend without protection will quickly have the beast at their throat.</string>
<string name="8135">This ragged trophy is the head of Dergiab, an ogre mage threatening Gerrol and the other farmers along the North Road out of Port Llast.</string>
<string name="8136">All Undead 2</string>
<string name="8137">Aarin&apos;s Tale</string>
<string name="8138">The mysterious Aarin Gend has told you a great deal of his earlier life and how he became Lord Nasher&apos;s spymaster, though his tale is not yet finished.

[NOTE: Aarin will likely continue the tale in the future, when you are a higher level of experience.]</string>
<string name="8139">The mysterious Aarin Gend completed his tale of how he became Lord Nasher&apos;s spymaster. He mentioned someone by the name of &apos;Calli&apos;, though he was reluctant to speak more of this person.

[NOTE: Aarin will likely continue the tale in the future, when you are a higher level of experience.]</string>
<string name="8140">Aarin Gend has talked to you of his past as well as the tragic love of his life, a woman he was forced to kill... tales he has never told anyone else. Aarin finds you interesting and has intimated that he would like to get to know you better in the future.

[NOTE: Aarin will likely continue his tale in the future, when you are a higher level of experience.]</string>
<string name="8141">Aarin Gend has talked to you of his past as well as the tragic love of his life, a woman he was forced to kill... a tale he rarely tells anyone. Aarin obviously considers you a friend... his tales, however, are complete for the time being and he will unlikely have the chance to continue.</string>
<string name="8142">Aarin Gend has told you secrets of his past he has rarely shared and expressed his affection for you, gifting you with an a small amulet as a token of his affection. He hopes to continue to get to know you better in the future.

[NOTE: If you desire to continue Aarin&apos;s tale into future chapters, hold onto the amulet.]</string>
<string name="8143">Events are moving quickly... it is unlikely that Aarin Gend will speak to you any further of himself. Naturally, however, he will work to aid you as Neverwinter&apos;s spymaster.</string>
<string name="8144">Aribeth&apos;s Tale</string>
<string name="8145">Aribeth has confessed some of her anxieties and anger over the death of Fenthick to you. She cannot seem to shake the feeling that Fenthick&apos;s execution was unjust and meant only to appease the angry citizens of Neverwinter.

(NOTE: Aribeth will continue her tale when you have achieved a higher level of experience.)</string>
<string name="8146">Aribeth has been possessed by terrible dreams as of late, dreams which have been frightening the servants and even alarming the normally stoic spymaster, Aarin Gend. She confessed the nature of these disturbing dreams to you, though only reluctantly.

(NOTE: Aribeth will continue her tale when you have achieved a higher level of experience.)</string>
<string name="8147">Aribeth told you of how she became a paladin in the service of Tyr... and it is obvious her faith in the God of Justice has been shaken by recent events.

(NOTE: Aribeth will continue her tale when you have achieved a higher level of experience.)</string>
<string name="8148">Lady Aribeth has told you much of herself, including how she first entered into the service of Tyr long ago. Her faith in the God of Justice seems to be shaken to the core... a fact which disturbs Aribeth profoundly. It is unlikely that she will continue her tales for now, wishing nothing more you to locate the cult quickly and deal them the vengeance they deserve.</string>
<string name="8149">Lady Aribeth has told you much of herself, including how she first entered into the service of Tyr as his holy champion long ago. Her faith has been profoundly challenged, her disturbing dreams growing far worse... though through all of this, Aribeth is glad to have found a faithful friend in you. She made a gift of her father&apos;s ring to you and bids you to keep it close to remind you of her always.

[NOTE: if you wish Aribeth&apos;s tale to continue into the next chapters, make sure you keep her ring in your inventory.)</string>
<string name="8150">Events are moving quickly... it is unlikely Aribeth will be able to discuss herself with you for the time being.</string>
<string name="8151">Boddyknock started telling of his father in Lantan, a horticulturalist of great repute... though it is obvious the recollection is an uncomfortable one for him.

[NOTE: Boddyknock will continue his tale... when you have achieved a higher level of experience.]</string>
<string name="8152">Boddyknock reluctantly related the tale of how he accidentally destroyed his father&apos;s precious garden, an act that has created a gulf between them. The gnome was reluctant to continue after the tale was done.

[NOTE: Boddyknock may continue his story... but only if you are a higher character level and have adventured enough with Boddyknock in the past so that he considers you a friend.]</string>
<string name="8153">Boddyknock expressed a desire to repair things with his father by finding a previous flower that his father has always desired. It is called a &apos;prism blossom&apos;.</string>
<string name="8154">Boddyknock was overjoyed to receive the prism blossom that he had been seeking.

[NOTE: the item Boddyknock gave you in Chapter 1 has been upgraded.]</string>
<string name="8155">Quint Jhareg, one of the two lords of Charwood who currently stand accused by the Guardian Spirit on the castle&apos;s main floor, has been discovered in a cell within his eastern tower. The former cleric of Lathander now seems quite mad and very much plagued by guilt over the death of the village children within this castle so long ago. Quint readily admits to gathering the children into the castle on midwinter&apos;s eve so long ago and also to stealing his brother&apos;s phylactery. He has begged that he be punished for his crimes.</string>

Quint readily admits to gathering the children into the castle on midwinter&apos;s eve so long ago and also to stealing his brother&apos;s phylactery. He has begged that he be punished for his crimes.

Quint has now provided a written oath stating that the above is true. This oath should be submitted to the Guardian Spirit as evidence.</string>
<string name="8157">Daelan related his tale of leaving his tribe to prove himself in the world, and arriving at the cesspool city that is Luskan.

[NOTE: Daelan will continue his tale, but only when you are a higher level of experience.]</string>
<string name="8158">Daelan continued his tale from earlier, cultimating in his freeing a group of slaves and fleeing Luskan. He yet carries a burden of shame with him, though he is reluctant to speak of it.

[NOTE: Daelan may continue his tale... but only when you are a higher level of experience and only if you have adventured enough with him in the past so that he considers you a friend.]</string>
<string name="8159">Daelan finished his tale, admitting that he seeks his mother&apos;s murderer. He has been granted a vision that the murderer wields a notched axe... and it is this axe Daelan hopes to find.</string>
<string name="8160">Daelan was pleased to receive the axe, knowing that his mother&apos;s murderer was surely dead.

[NOTE: the item Daelan gave you in Chapter 1 has been upgraded.]</string>
<string name="8161">Grimgnaw related several details of the Order of Long Death, including the reasons behind their great hatred of the undead.

[NOTE: Grimgnaw will continue the tale another time, probably when you have gained a higher level of experience.]</string>
<string name="8162">Grimgnaw continued his tale from before, expressing a desire to assist members of his Order who fell in battle against the lich and became undead, themselves. He was reluctant to detail exactly what help he could render them, however.

[NOTE: Grimgnaw may say more... but only when you are a higher level of experience and only if you have adventured with him in the past enough for him to consider you a friend.]</string>
<string name="8163">Grimgnaw related detail of the secret ritual that his Order uses upon their fallen members who have become undead. Grimgnaw seeks a mummified hand or a similar artifiact of the undead because it is an important reagent in that ritual, so it may be performed upon the rest of his comrades.</string>
<string name="8164">Grimgnaw is pleased at the discovery of the mummified hand he sought.

[NOTE: the item Grimgnaw gave you in chapter 1 has been upgraded.]</string>
<string name="8165">Linu began a tale of how she met her husband, Synth, a famous explorer.

[NOTE: Linu will continue the tale... when you have achieved a higher level of experience.]</string>
<string name="8166">Linu continued her tale of how Synth won her heart and they came to be married. She hinted that the story does not end well, however, and was reluctant to continue it.

[NOTE: Linu may continue her tale... but only if you have achieved a higher level of experience and adventured enough with her in the past so that she considers you a friend.]</string>
<string name="8167">Linu told the tale of her husband&apos;s mysterious disappearance on his last exploration voyage. She hopes to find evidence of what happened to him one day by tracking down a journal that she and Synth had shared while he was gone.</string>
<string name="8168">Linu was thankful to receive her husband&apos;s journal, but saddened at the truth that he was indeed long dead.

[NOTE: the item Linu gave you in Chapter 1 has been upgraded.] </string>
<string name="8169">Druids of Aawill&apos;s conclave in the Neverwinter Woods all tell of Jaer, the druid responsible for determining the heirarchy within the conclave. Any new druids wishing to join the conclave should speak with her.</string>
<string name="8170">Jaer, the druid responsible for determining the heirarchy of Aawill&apos;s conclave in the Neverwinter Woods, does so through a process of ritual combat. Druids wishing to join the conclave or improve their rank within it must speak with her. When he deems a fellow druid to be sufficiently skilled to challenge his or her superior within the conclave, Jaer initiates the ritual of the Druid&apos;s Circle. Whoever emerges victorious is issued membership of the appropriate rank.</string>
<string name="8171">Welcar, defender of the grove&apos;s fourth circle under Archdruid Aawill, has been challenged and defeated. Jaer has passed the ring onto its new defender.</string>

<string name="8176">The Spirit of the Neverwinter Woods has somehow come to harm and Aawill, an Archdruid who maintains a conclave there, is gravely worried. He has reluctantly granted forest access to adventurers so that they might help him right whatever has gone wrong.

Evidence discovered deeper in the forest tells of a pool at the base of a waterfall where the Spirit of the Woods would perform a ritual to enter the spirit world. The only way for mortals to follow is to enter that pool and die while in its waters. A magical dagger is obviously involved in the taking of one&apos;s life.</string>

<string name="8184">With the Wailing&apos;s cure and subsequent removal of Neverwinter&apos;s quarantine, the wizardess Eltoora has journeyed to Port Llast to provide her services to those searching for the cult responsible. She also comes with ulterior motives, however, as she seeks a collection of ancient tomes from the lost civilization of Imaskar. The five books are said to act as recipes, providing guidance to those undertaking magical experiments. Should any of the tomes be found, she will not only reward whoever returns them but also make the tomes publicly available to all arcanists who wish to experiment with them in her library.

Through scrying attempts, she has managed to narrow down the locations of the five tomes of Imaskar. The Tome of Fire and the Tome of Death are both said to be lost in Charwood, while the Tome of Life apparently rests with the corpse of Brother Toras in the cemetery outside the walls of Luskan. The Tome of Ice is housed within a tower south of Port Llast and the last, the Tome of Resonance, lies somewhere along the treacherous road deep into the Neverwinter Woods.</string>

<string name="8191">Neurik, a priest of Tyr who presides of Port Llast&apos;s temple, warns of a terrible tragedy that has befallen some of the town&apos;s young men. Sir Karathis Ironheart, a travelling werewolf hunter, enlisted the help of four boys to hunt a foul lycanthrope known only as the Black Wolf. It was a trap, however, and Sir Karathis was himself the Black Wolf. His claws raked the flesh of Bran, Urth, and Geth, infecting them with his dread disease, leaving only the youngest boy, Ander, to escape. Neurik believes that, if found soon enough, the three young men may still be curable by a charm he has concocted. 

Ander, who currently spends his days at the Alliance Arms Inn, trying to spread news amongst adventurers of the tragedy that befell his friends, has a few guesses as to where his friends might have fled. He suspects that Bran is somewhere along the road to Charwood and Geth might be taking refuge in the Neverwinter Woods. Ander wasn&apos;t sure about Urth but recommended talking to his parents who live on the edge of town. The last time Ander saw Sir Karathis, it was at the supposed cave of the Black Wolf, in the hills east of the Green Griffon Inn.</string>

<string name="8195">It appears that Sir Karathis Ironheart is not the Black Wolf after all. He entered the caves east of the Green Griffon Inn and was ambushed and infected himself. Maddened with the bloodlust of his unexpected transformation, he lashed out at the boys who had joined him in the hunt but luckily was able to refrain from killing them outright. Neurik, the Tyrist priest back in Port Llast was chagrined to learn that, even with the situation of Sir Karathis addressed, the dreaded Black Wolf remains on the loose. Worse yet, Sir Karathis has given him a familiar name: Alhelor, the merchant selling anti-lycanthropic supplies at Ander&apos;s side in Port Llast&apos;s Alliance Arms Inn. The boy&apos;s life is in great danger and Neurik has given the order to find and destroy Alhelor at once.

Luckily Ander is safe and sound in the Alliance Arms Inn. Alhelor appears to have caught wind of the recent news, however, and has supposedly retired to his home in the town&apos;s northeast corner. Given his previous ambush of Sir Karathis, it would be wise to proceed with caution.</string>

<string name="8269">The city of Luskan rises and falls on the quarrels of its High Captains. Lately, those quarrels have become an all-out war for supremacy and the two remaining contenders, Kurth and Baram, have pulled out all the stops.

Not far within the boundaries of Baram&apos;s base, a yuan-ti was encountered who carried a parchment which appeared to contain instructions for some form of necromantic ritual to create undead. According to the writing on the parchment, those who perform the ritual will be protected from any sort of harm. Of particular note was the following: &quot;Allow nothing to distract you. Ensure that the skeletal priests continue their worship unhindered and that the tablets remain intact or your ritual will be worthless.&quot; Who is performing this ritual and where is unknown... but no doubt answers lie nearby.</string>
<string name="8270">The city of Luskan rises and falls on the quarrels of its High Captains. Lately, those quarrels have become an all-out war for supremacy and the two remaining contenders, Kurth and Baram, have pulled out all the stops. Very recently, adventurers have laid siege to Baram&apos;s base, intent on assassinating him and bringing this bloody feud to its bitter end.

The yuan-ti necromancers performing their ritual have been killed, their sorceries stopped. On the body of one of them, a key has been found which will, no doubt, allow access further into Baram&apos;s base.</string>

<string name="8280">It&apos;s a mighty fine time fer folk like us. This war has been good for me.</string>
<string name="8281">With the fighting between Luskan and Neverwinter escalating, the goods I deal with are becoming rarer...and I can more readily set my price, if you get my meaning.</string>

<string name="8341">Please, hurry. I don&apos;t know what I&apos;d do if it turned out you were too late to help them!</string>
<string name="8342">They&apos;re in the homesteads to the west of the Fort - past the Uthgardt war camps. They&apos;d never make it safely to the Fort on their own.</string>
<string name="8343">Ah, welcome back, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Do you bring me news of Zokan Thunderer? Is the Uthgardt chieftain dead?</string>
<string name="8344">You are back, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Do you bring me news of the Uthgardt sub-chieftan, or is there something else you need? </string>
<string name="8345">Yes, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, what can I do for you? Have you come to report on the six catapults bombarding the Fort, or is there something else you need? </string>
<string name="8346">Why have you come back? I already gave you the cure for the Elk tribe - what more do you want from me?</string>
<string name="8347">And if you go back into the past, you might find some way to weaken the guardian golems patrolling this complex so you can get to the Word of Power you told me you were looking for. Or do you tell me at our next meeting? Whatever.</string>
<string name="8348">You know - the golems. The invulnerable guardians of this complex... didn&apos;t we go over this at our next meeting? You could disable them by using the sundial to go into the past.</string>

<string name="8388">Zokan has explained that the Elk tribe have allied against the Lords&apos; Alliance because of Commander Damas&apos; terrible betrayal; the Commander infected blankets with the Wailing Death and gave them to the Elk tribe as gifts. These blankets are proof of his crime.

The Elk Tribe within the Fort will keep peace with you while you remain their emissary, but likely those further away will not have received word as yet.

If his people could be cured, Zokan would cease the alliance with the Luskan forces, and all the Elk Tribe would keep the peace.</string>

<string name="8460">That seem simple. Even me get it.</string>
<string name="8461">That seems simple enough.</string>
<string name="8462">Okay.</string>
<string name="8463">Neverwinter has several difficulty settings you can choose from. I&apos;ll explain the main differences between the various settings, if you&apos;re interested. </string>
<string name="8464">In multi-player games the DM can adjust and control the difficulty settings. In single player games there are three settings you can choose from using the Options menu: Easy, Normal and Hardcore. </string>
<string name="8465">In the Easy setting enemies&apos; damage against you is limited to a maximum of 50% of the normal total, and all your hits do a minimum of 50% normal damage to them. Also, your spells won&apos;t hurt your own party members.</string>
<string name="8466">In the Normal setting damage rolls are calculated normally, although enemies can&apos;t score critical hits on you. Your spells still won&apos;t hurt your own party members. </string>
<string name="8467">The Hardcore setting makes players vulnerable to critical hits and also gives enemies attacks of opportunity if you use ranged weapons or potions in melee combat. Your spells will now injure your own party members if they are caught in the area of effect.</string>
<string name="8468">&lt;StartAction&gt;THE GAME HAS BEEN BALANCED FOR THE NORMAL DIFFICULTY SETTING!&lt;/Start&gt; Using the other settings may result in gameplay that is too easy or too difficult.</string>
<string name="8469">That&apos;s it for difficulty settings. Let&apos;s move on to the next part of the tutorial.</string>
<string name="8470">That&apos;s about all I can tell you about the difficulty settings.</string>

<string name="9105">links</string>
<string name="9106">That red wizard spoke to you, eh.  Well I&apos;ve never trusted their type and I&apos;m not about to start.</string>
<string name="9107">Does Drogan know his students have become so rude?  I have a good mind to drag you up there and let you explain yourself to him.</string>
<string name="9108">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt;  Alright, don&apos;t hurt me - He can stay.  I hope we don&apos;t all come to regret your rash action here today.</string>
<string name="9109">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; That does it!  Next time I see Drogan I&apos;m going to have a word with him about you.</string>
<string name="9110">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh now, &lt;FirstName&gt;.  Don&apos;t you be trying Master Drogan&apos;s tricks on me.</string>
<string name="9111">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; This is the red wizard I&apos;ve been looking for.</string>
<string name="9112">He can stay.</string>
<string name="9113">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You haven&apos;t been around as long as me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.  You&apos;ll learn - the Red Wizards are not to be trusted.  And you can tell him I said so.</string>
<string name="9114">Well - I tell you what.  Crazy old Piper has gone a little off the deep end after the last kobold attack.  He&apos;s scaring a few of the locals with his talk of doom.  You take care of him and I&apos;ll maybe give the red wizard a chance.</string>
<string name="9115">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt;Well alright - but I&apos;ll be watching him - you tell him he can set up shop on a provisional basis.</string>
<string name="9116">&lt;FirstName&gt;, it is good to see you! I was about to send someone down to check on everyone at Master Drogan&apos;s. I am afraid events are far out of hand around here.</string>
<string name="9117">Haniah! Did I ever &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; tell you how helpful you are &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt;? You&apos;re the besht, Haniah, shimply the besht!</string>
<string name="9118">Uh... thank you, sir. You are a very good boss too... &lt;StartAction&gt;[mutter]&lt;/Start&gt; usually...</string>
<string name="9119">Not exactly a party. I found the mayor this way in his home, after the kobold attack. He was hiding in his cellar with two empty wine bottles beside him.</string>
<string name="9120">Oh no! The mayor has been drunk on occasions, but never during a workday. I found him this way, after the kobold attack. He was hiding in his cellar with two empty wine bottles beside him.</string>
<string name="9121">I found the mayor this way in his home, after the kobold attack. He was hiding in his cellar with two empty wine bottles beside him.</string>
<string name="9122">I think the stress of the attack was simply too much for him and he lost control. I just hope that he will be better when he sobers up. I know it frightened me.</string>
<string name="9123">Luckily I was here and there were enough local farmers and townsmen to hold the kobolds off. They mostly just ran past, when they saw how many were in here. </string>
<string name="9124">So is everyone alright at the school?</string>
<string name="9125">Not Master Drogan! Oh, I can hardly afford to lose him. I was desperately hoping that he could help me deal with all of the problems that have cropped up after the attack.</string>
<string name="9126">Ah, I suppose that sounds awfully selfish of me, but I have only been here a short time, and now the mayor is completely useless!</string>
<string name="9127">Haniah&apos;s been like a &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; daughter to me, I tell you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. No, better than &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; better than a daughter. Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, good to see you. When did you get here?</string>
<string name="9128">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, what do I do?</string>
<string name="9129">I will do whatever is in my power to help you and Master Drogan. I just am unsure how much help I can give right now.</string>
<string name="9130">I am sure you do, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And if there is anything I can do to help, you can ask. I doubt there is a lot of help I can give though.</string>
<string name="9131">You know &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt;, even though I am the Mayor, everybody respects Drogan more. Hey, toots, why don&apos;t you run &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; and fetch me some more wine!</string>
<string name="9132">My name is Haniah, not Toots, and I am no tavern wench. I think you have had enough to drink, sir.</string>
<string name="9133">Bull droppings! I &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt;, I have barely just begun to drink. You go get me some... hey, why do I have four arms?</string>
<string name="9134">I am sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I have little time. Is there something you need?</string>
<string name="9135">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="9136">I find that in the last few minutes you have disillusioned me and encouraging you is the last thing on my mind.</string>
<string name="9137">I must admit, that in the last few years, I have had thoughts of you that go a step or two beyond friendship. </string>
<string name="9138">The only encouragement I can offer is the thought that someday we can get to know each other better. Perhaps as something more than just friends.</string>
<string name="9139">At the risk of sounding a little brazen, &lt;FirstName&gt;, if we get through these days and things can return to normal, I promise you a night of encouragement you will never forget.</string>
<string name="9140">But with all the problems we face right now, there is little else I can focus on. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="9141">You will have to speak to Farghan, the herbalist. His shop is right across the street. Anything else?</string>
<string name="9142">Ah, another one of the little problems. At least this one was easy to solve; I simply sent him packing. What did that red wizard have to say to you?  </string>
<string name="9143">Foolish of me?!? How dare you sit in judgment of decisions I make for the good of our community? I suppose you would let a horde of orcs set up an encampment, if you saw a profit in it.</string>
<string name="9144">The Red Wizards of Thay are &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; the evisht bunch of no-good-doers I&apos;ve ever heard of. I will &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; never allow one into the community. Not on my life.</string>
<string name="9145">You have spoken to him though. What makes you think I should allow him to set up an enclave?</string>
<string name="9146">Oh, there is no doubt that the majority are definitely evil. As for this particular wizard, I cannot be sure, but it seems very unlikely that he is any different from his superiors.</string>
<string name="9147">On what basis do you make this judgment?</string>
<string name="9148">That is a wise decision, but I am not sure that it will avail you greatly. Remember, evil rarely proclaims itself as such.</string>
<string name="9149">How dare you threaten an old, but dear man like Veraunt? You should be ashamed. Poisoned or healthy, Drogan will hear of this.</string>
<string name="9150">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; That does it!  Next time I see Drogan I&apos;m going to have a word with him about you.</string>
<string name="9151">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt;  Alright, do not hurt the Mayor. Szaren can stay.  Just leave us alone. Never speak to me again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will never forgive you for this insult.</string>
<string name="9152">That is not a funny joke. When it comes to violence, I have no sense of humor. I shall try to forget you said any such thing. Do you have a real argument to make?</string>
<string name="9153">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Szaren is an ally and should remain here in Hilltop.</string>
<string name="9154">He can stay.</string>
<string name="9155">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I fear you overestimate Szaren&apos;s goodwill. I doubt that he cares much how well we do, so long as it brings him profits.</string>
<string name="9156">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You must not have heard the stories I have heard, &lt;FirstName&gt;.  The Red Wizards are not to be trusted.  And you can tell him I said so.</string>
<string name="9157">That may be so, but letting him stay could be a bigger mistake. You must trust me on this.</string>
<string name="9158">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I knew I could count on you to come to the right decision.</string>
<string name="9159">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt;You make a good point. I just fear that one day they might begin to corrupt our people with their influence.</string>
<string name="9160">Szaren can stay. I just hope we never come to regret this decision. I will make sure that the mayor draws up the correct paperwork, once he sobers up. You can go tell Szaren.</string>
<string name="9161">Worry not about the Mayor, I can smooth things over with him. I really need the Piper problem taken care of, so you just handle that. </string>
<string name="9162">If you can handle that situation diplomatically, I would be willing to trust your judgment about Szaren. Anything else?</string>
<string name="9163">Thank goodness you are still well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know Master Drogan holds you in high esteem and you have always been kind to me since I came to Hilltop.</string>
<string name="9164">The biggest problem right now is with Piper, small surprise there. He has always claimed to have prophetic abilities, but now people are beginning to listen.</string>
<string name="9165">A couple days ago, Piper claimed that death was coming in the dark and that only &apos;the chosen&apos; would survive. </string>
<string name="9166">An old farmer, Hol Halstrom, called him an idiot, and Piper claimed Hol would be dead within the week.</string>
<string name="9167">That is exactly it. He makes those predictions so often, he was bound to eventually get one right.</string>
<string name="9168">I could not care less about Piper, except that he is starting to scare some of the more foolish townsfolk and farmers. They are scared and looking for answers, and Piper made an accurate prediction.</string>
<string name="9169">Hol&apos;s body was found near the edge of the village, with his throat slit so deep, his head was barely attached to his body.
</string>
<string name="9170">Piper has a number of people convinced that the kobolds are just messengers for a new, powerful god. I stopped listening to him at that point.</string>
<string name="9171">Piper is spreading panic and chaos in our village, something we can ill afford if we are to rebuild and possibly fortify ourselves.</string>
<string name="9172">I feared that might be so. I do not blame you, for I am certain you must have many important things to do.</string>
<string name="9173">You know &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt;, I lost my wife only five years ago. &lt;StartAction&gt;[sob]&lt;/Start&gt; I wish I could have her back again.</string>
<string name="9174">Yes sir, you told me she was killed by a burglar one night while you were at a gathering, here at the hall.</string>
<string name="9175">She would have liked you, Haniah. She &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; would have found the daughter she always &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; wanted. &lt;StartAction&gt;[sob]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9176">I hope you jest, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If Piper truly were a prophet, you and your peers would have perished long ago. No, there is only madness in Piper.</string>
<string name="9177">I only have access to a small sum of gold, but I will see what I can find, should you do this for me. It would be a great kindness from you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9178">I understand how one such as you might have trouble meeting... interested women, but I would never consider prostituting myself. Not even to keep my job.</string>
<string name="9179">&lt;FirstName&gt;, I cannot even begin to express how much that suggestion disgusts me. As if I would ever consider prostituting myself for a job.</string>
<string name="9180">You have no idea how often I dreamed of us together. Of course in my dreams you would never have suggested that I prostitute myself for my job!</string>
<string name="9181">Obviously you have a far lower opinion of me than I did of you. I ask that you never express such desires to me again.</string>
<string name="9182">Of course.  I had hoped for better from you in these troubled times, but I see that you will stick to your mercenary ways, even when we need you most.</string>
<string name="9183">I can only promise you 50 gold. That is all we can afford, what with so much destruction and misery, it is really more than we can afford. So will you do this for me?</string>
<string name="9184">I am not asking you to hurt him or anything like that, but if he would just stop or go away, it would make my job much simpler.</string>
<string name="9185">Would you really, &lt;FirstName&gt;? That would be such a relief. I am not asking you to hurt him or anything like that, but if he would just stop or go away, it would make my job much simpler.</string>
<string name="9186">Is there anything I can do to help you?</string>
<string name="9187">Oh, hello &lt;FirstName&gt;. I spoke with your friend already, but I&apos;m sure you would be a real help in the trials ahead.</string>
<string name="9188">I wish I could speak with you more, but I really do have a lot to deal with. Good luck.</string>
<string name="9189">Sir, please do not drink any more of that wine. You are going to make yourself sick.</string>
<string name="9190">Nonshensh! I&apos;m a healthy as a &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; as a bull. A little bit of wine never &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; never hurt any... oh my... that didn&apos;t feel so good &lt;StartAction&gt;[belch]&lt;/Start&gt;.</string>
<string name="9191">That is disgusting, sir. I am sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I have little time. Is there something you need?</string>
<string name="9192">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="9193">I find that in the last few minutes you have disillusioned me and encouraging you is the last thing on my mind.</string>
<string name="9194">I must admit, that in the last few years, I have had thoughts of you that go a step or two beyond friendship. </string>
<string name="9195">The only encouragement I can offer is the thought that someday we can get to know each other better. Perhaps as something more than just friends.</string>
<string name="9196">At the risk of sounding a little brazen, &lt;FirstName&gt;, if we get through these days and things can return to normal, I promise you a night of encouragement you will never forget.</string>
<string name="9197">But with all the problems we face right now, there is little else I can focus on. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="9198">You will have to speak to Farghan, the herbalist. His shop is right across the street. Anything else?</string>
<string name="9199">And what words of wisdom, or corruption, did the mage spill in your ear?</string>
<string name="9200">Ah, another one of the little problems. At least this one was easy to solve; I simply sent him packing. What did that red wizard have to say to you?  </string>
<string name="9201">Foolish of me?!? How dare you sit in judgment of decisions I make for the good of our community? I suppose you would let a horde of orcs set up an encampment, if you saw a profit in it.</string>
<string name="9202">The Red Wizards of Thay are &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; the evisht bunch of no-good-doers I&apos;ve ever heard of. I will &lt;StartAction&gt;[hic]&lt;/Start&gt; never allow one into the community. Not on my life.</string>
<string name="9203">You are back again. Does this mean that friend Piper is willing to settle down or go away?</string>
<string name="9204">Alright, but do please hurry. I am sure you have many concerns ahead of you.</string>
<string name="9205">Things are starting to smooth out, but until Piper is dealt with I will not be able to rest easy. </string>
<string name="9206">Thank you for asking though. I seem to spend much of my time just trying to calm people down. It is nice to have someone treat me as a friend.</string>
<string name="9207">I am impressed. I was wondering if anyone had the patience to deal with him.</string>
<string name="9208">You have shown excellent skill in diplomacy and good judgment. Szaren may set up his enclave. I hope you are choosing wisely in him.</string>
<string name="9209">Here is your reward. When Hol&apos;s widow heard that you were going to quiet Piper, she gave me an extra 10 gold to add to it. You are definitely deserving of it, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9210">I see blood, on your hands. You... you killed him! Get away from me, you butcher! I wanted no violence! Go!</string>
<string name="9211">It is good to see you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Life goes on as usual, though I am sad to tell you that the Mayor has not recovered from his binge and still drinks day and night.</string>
<string name="9212">I fear it will eventually be the death of him. I wish I knew what to do. But you must have other things on your mind. Is there some way in which I might help you?</string>
<string name="9213">Goodbye, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9214">Well, that&apos;s a relief. Thank you for telling me, I appreciate it.</string>
<string name="9215">I heard what you did for the refugees from Blumberg. That is the sort of heroic deed we need more of around here.</string>
<string name="9216">Fine, Szaren can stay, just keep away from me, butcher! Monster! Never return!</string>
<string name="9217">You are beneath my contempt! You disgust me. Go away and never speak to me again.</string>
<string name="9218">I want nothing to do with either of you. You have proven your evil ways, and the fact that you would try to convince me to help Szaren tells me that he cannot be trusted either.</string>
<string name="9219">Maybe you should go with him. Your ways are no better than his.</string>
<string name="9220">Yes, be gone, foul fiend.</string>
<string name="9221">Nothing thanks - just thought I&apos;d bask in your greatness.</string>
<string name="9222">Szaren asked me to talk to you about letting him set up an enclave here.</string>
<string name="9223">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; If you know what&apos;s good for you, you&apos;ll let the wizard stay.</string>
<string name="9224">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Seriously Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Listen mayor - you let the wizard stay or you&apos;ll be late... Late, as in the late mayor of Hilltop.  Understand me?</string>
<string name="9225">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Leave]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9226">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Pummel the mayor into submission]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9227">Just kidding... hahhaha...</string>
<string name="9228">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Charm]&lt;/Start&gt;  This is the Red Wizard you&apos;ve been looking for.</string>
<string name="9229">He may stay...</string>
<string name="9230">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Really Hilltop would be better defended from stuff like these kobolds if the Red Wizards were here.</string>
<string name="9231">You&apos;re right - I&apos;ll run that bum out of town.</string>
<string name="9232">Whatever...Is there no way I can change your mind?</string>
<string name="9233">I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="9234">I got enough problems with crazy people at the moment - You deal with him.</string>
<string name="9235">Someone decided to throw a party?</string>
<string name="9236">Do you usually have to put up with that?</string>
<string name="9237">Is he drunk? </string>
<string name="9238">What&apos;s the matter with him?</string>
<string name="9239">No. The school was nearly destroyed and Drogan lies near death. </string>
<string name="9240">There was nothing I couldn&apos;t handle, but Drogan was poisoned. </string>
<string name="9241">We were attacked by the kobolds and Master Drogan has been poisoned.</string>
<string name="9242">If I can help Drogan, then maybe he could help you.</string>
<string name="9243">I have problems of my own to worry about.</string>
<string name="9244">That is all. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9245">I could use a little encouragement.</string>
<string name="9246">I need some herbs to help Drogan.</string>
<string name="9247">I met a man called Szaren.</string>
<string name="9248">It is foolish of you to drive him away.</string>
<string name="9249">I think you should let him stay. </string>
<string name="9250">He was hoping you would reconsider his proposition.</string>
<string name="9251">I didn&apos;t know the Red Wizards are evil.</string>
<string name="9252">I have spoken to Szaren in length, and I think he should stay.</string>
<string name="9253">I shall go speak to him some more, so that I can make an informed decision.</string>
<string name="9254">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; If you don&apos;t let the wizard stay, the mayor might have an accident.</string>
<string name="9255">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Listen Haniah, you let Szaren stay or Veraunt dies!</string>
<string name="9256">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Leave]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9257">Sorry, I only meant that in jest.</string>
<string name="9258">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Charm]&lt;/Start&gt;  Szaren is an ally and should remain here in Hilltop.</string>
<string name="9259">He may stay...</string>
<string name="9260">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Szaren only wishes to bring us prosperity. </string>
<string name="9261">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Hilltop would be better defended from attacks if the Red Wizards were here.</string>
<string name="9262">You are making a big mistake, Haniah.</string>
<string name="9263">I will tell him of your decision. </string>
<string name="9264">I shall make him leave a swiftly as possible.</string>
<string name="9265">About Piper...</string>
<string name="9266">Fine, tell me about your problems. </string>
<string name="9267">I am here to help you, Haniah.</string>
<string name="9268">What are these problems you are having?</string>
<string name="9269">Does he make a lot of these predictions?</string>
<string name="9270">This is your problem? A fool of a doomsayer?</string>
<string name="9271">Let me guess, Hol was killed by the kobolds.</string>
<string name="9272">I have no time to deal with a lunatic.</string>
<string name="9273">What if he really is a prophet?</string>
<string name="9274">What would you pay me to solve this problem for you?</string>
<string name="9275">Perhaps we could meet somewhere private to discuss... payment.</string>
<string name="9276">You are being too vague. Name a sum or forget my help. </string>
<string name="9277">I do nothing for kindness, Haniah. Speak to me with gold.</string>
<string name="9278">I guess I can help you.</string>
<string name="9279">I will speak to Piper for you.</string>
<string name="9280">That&apos;s all. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9281">I could use a little encouragement.</string>
<string name="9282">I need some herbs to help Drogan.</string>
<string name="9283">I have spoken to Szaren again.</string>
<string name="9284">I met a man called Szaren.</string>
<string name="9285">It is foolish of you to drive him away.</string>
<string name="9286">I think you should let him stay. </string>
<string name="9287">He was hoping you would reconsider his proposition.</string>
<string name="9288">Tell me about your problems. </string>
<string name="9289">Not yet, but I&apos;m working on it.</string>
<string name="9290">How is everything going?</string>
<string name="9291">I will go see about Piper. </string>
<string name="9292">Piper is no longer a problem.</string>
<string name="9293">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9294">No, I don&apos;t think so.</string>
<string name="9295">I just wanted you to know that Drogan is well.</string>
<string name="9296">I met a man called Szaren.</string>
<string name="9297">Fine, I will tell him to leave.</string>
<string name="9298">Fine. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9299">There are several magical wards on this chest which you cannot seem to penetrate.</string>
<string name="9300">This alchemist&apos;s lab is where Master Drogan creates the focus crystals that power the rings he gives to his apprentices. He showed you once how to operate it.</string>
<string name="9301">You start gathering up the proper elixirs and powders that Drogan adds to the gems to create the crystals...</string>
<string name="9302">The table is very cluttered, and you begin sifting through the various powders and vials to see if there is anything of use.</string>
<string name="9303">Each focus crystal requires one quartz crystal combined with any two of the following gems: phenalope, aventurine, fluorspar or amethyst.</string>
<string name="9304">Placing the proper three gems in the grinder should enable you to use the various potions and powders already in the lab to create a functioning focus crystal.</string>
<string name="9305">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the lab alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9306">&lt;StartAction&gt;Create focus crystals.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9307">&lt;StartAction&gt;Search the lab.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9308">&lt;StartAction&gt;How do I create a focus crystal?&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9309">Ohhh - I feel weak..</string>
<string name="9310">The door to master Drogan&apos;s chambers are, as usual, sealed with an arcane lock spell to prevent some of his more curious pupils from poking around...for their own safety, or so Master Drogan says.</string>
<string name="9311">Don&apos;t bother with me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can&apos;t help you, though I wish I could.</string>
<string name="9312">Poor Master Drogan! I just can&apos;t wait until he&apos;s recovered.</string>
<string name="9313">I don&apos;t think those creatures are coming back. I shouldn&apos;t have to stay here guarding the house.</string>
<string name="9314">I wish I could go with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Whoever did this... well, I&apos;d just like to... ooo!! It makes me so mad!</string>
<string name="9315">So you&apos;ll leave the school forever once this is done? I wonder if that means Drogan will find a new student.</string>
<string name="9316">There is going to be so much work to get all this back in order. Master Drogan will be furious!</string>
<string name="9317">I hope everything&apos;s going well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;d hate to think whoever was behind all this was going to get away with it.</string>
<string name="9318">You&apos;ve changed so much during your adventure, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I... I barely recognize you, to be honest.</string>
<string name="9319">You seem like you&apos;re doing really well so far, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Master Drogan would be very proud of your progress, I think.</string>
<string name="9320">Thank Mystra! Master Drogan&apos;s looking so much better now. Ayala says that he&apos;s well on his way to a full recovery.</string>
<string name="9321">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I&apos;m so worried about Master Drogan! Do you think he&apos;ll be alright?</string>
<string name="9322">You don&apos;t *care*?! That&apos;s a terrible thing to say!</string>
<string name="9323">I haven&apos;t been here very long, but Master Drogan has never said anything but the most glowing things about you, &lt;FirstName&gt;! The very least you could do is show him some compassion!</string>
<string name="9324">Oh, poor little &lt;FirstName&gt;! &lt;He/She&gt; has to pay back Drogan for his kindness! What ever will &lt;he/she&gt; do?</string>
<string name="9325">Sarcasm, Mischa? I&apos;m surprised at you.</string>
<string name="9326">Oooo... sarcasm from Mischa. I am certain &lt;FirstName&gt; shall be forever scarred from this moment on.</string>
<string name="9327">Sarcasm, Mischa? I&apos;m surprised at you.</string>
<string name="9328">Well, &lt;he/she&gt;... oh, never mind. Just... go and do what you must, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9329">I am surprised, as well. Pleasantly surprised!</string>
<string name="9330">Well, that&apos;s good to hear, for once.</string>
<string name="9331">You know what Xanos would like to hear? Less mewling from idiot babes.</string>
<string name="9332">Oh, dear! &lt;FirstName&gt;, you have offended the ears of our little flower. How *ever* did you manage it?</string>
<string name="9333">I agree. I suspect you wouldn&apos;t say those things if Master Drogan were conscious, now, would you?</string>
<string name="9334">Oh, that&apos;s awful! The thought of Master Drogan actually dying... I... I just can&apos;t bear it!</string>
<string name="9335">Don&apos;t worry so much, Mischa. &lt;FirstName&gt; may not be correct... there may be hope for Master Drogan, yet.</string>
<string name="9336">Oh, Dorna! Do you really think so?</string>
<string name="9337">I... don&apos;t know. &apos;Plan for the worst and hope for the best.&apos; Wise words of Drogan, himself.</string>
<string name="9338">&apos;Do you really think so?&apos; It makes Xanos sick to his stomach. Surely Drogan will die just to be away from such mewling!</string>
<string name="9339">What a surprise. Poor little girl cannot face terrible reality. Shall we spread the news? The populace shall be shocked!</string>
<string name="9340">Oh, thank Mystra! I&apos;ll pray that those herbs get here right away, then. If only I could help, somehow... I feel so useless just guarding the place!</string>
<string name="9341">Don&apos;t get any thoughts in your head of leaving, Mischa. I need you here to guard your master... that is no small task, despite what you think.</string>
<string name="9342">Y-yes, miss. I understand.</string>
<string name="9343">Don&apos;t worry so much, Mischa. You&apos;re needed here... just as we&apos;re needed to find those artifacts and stop whoever&apos;s behind all this.</string>
<string name="9344">Oh, I suppose you&apos;re right. It just doesn&apos;t feel that way.</string>
<string name="9345">That is because you *are* useless, my little strumpet! Ha ha ha!</string>
<string name="9346">Oh, shut up, Xanos!</string>
<string name="9347">My my! The little girl shows heat! Perhaps you should take her along after all, eh, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Ha ha ha!</string>
<string name="9348">Bah! Your problem is that you are too generous with lessers, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That shall be your undoing.</string>
<string name="9349">We could speak about your problems, Xanos, but &lt;FirstName&gt; doesn&apos;t have all day.</string>
<string name="9350">Now why didn&apos;t I say that?</string>
<string name="9351">Monster bait? Bwah-ha haa!! Wonderful!!</string>
<string name="9352">Fine. Laugh at me, if that&apos;s what you want. Just help Master Drogan and I won&apos;t care at all.</string>
<string name="9353">That&apos;s nice of you to say. I just hope it&apos;s the truth.</string>
<string name="9354">So many people just try to shield me from the truth, sometimes. If I&apos;m ever going to be a paladin, I&apos;ll... have to face these things one day, won&apos;t I?</string>
<string name="9355">I suppose all I can do now is pray for him. Good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9356">I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll do everything we can to help Drogan, Mischa.</string>
<string name="9357">What, you don&apos;t believe &lt;FirstName&gt; now? You are accusing &lt;him/her&gt; of being a liar?</string>
<string name="9358">I... I said no such thing! That&apos;s not what I meant at all!</string>
<string name="9359">Ha ha ha! You are still such a little girl! Mystra&apos;s warrior, indeed!</string>
<string name="9360">What do I care? Stop bothering me.</string>
<string name="9361">I just want out of here, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="9362">I&apos;ll say whatever I like, girl.</string>
<string name="9363">I suppose you&apos;re right.</string>
<string name="9364">Probably not. It looks pretty grim.</string>
<string name="9365">Ayala says he just needs some herbs and he&apos;ll recover.</string>
<string name="9366">Knock it off, both of you.</string>
<string name="9367">Take her along? As what? Monster bait?</string>
<string name="9368">Leave her alone, Xanos.</string>
<string name="9369">He should be fine. Don&apos;t worry about it.</string>
<string name="9370">I hope you&apos;re not here to stir up trouble, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We&apos;ve enough problems.</string>
<string name="9371">Hello, &lt;FirstName&gt;. On an errand for Master Drogan, I take it?</string>
<string name="9372">Hello again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Everything&apos;s going well, I hope?</string>
<string name="9373">I&apos;ve heard there&apos;s still some kobolds in Hilltop. Why aren&apos;t the guards being gathered together to search around?</string>
<string name="9374">I hope this doesn&apos;t mean the caravan lines are being attacked again. We can&apos;t afford to go without supplies this late in winter!</string>
<string name="9375">We should get everyone together and make sure everyone&apos;s alright. Maybe Drogan could help us out?</string>
<string name="9376">This is terrible. I used to feel safe here in Hilltop. I can&apos;t believe those creatures were so bold!</string>
<string name="9377">I wonder if Blumberg is alright? It&apos;s a much smaller village... if they were attacked, they might all be killed!</string>
<string name="9378">Master Drogan is alright, I hope? He&apos;s done a lot of good things for Hilltop.</string>
<string name="9379">You just stay away from me and mine, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You would have thought Drogan would have picked a better sort to train.</string>
<string name="9380">There&apos;s no need for you to be wandering around Hilltop, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Why don&apos;t you go back to Drogan&apos;s?</string>
<string name="9381">Oh, it&apos;s you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You watch yourself around here... we had enough bad business with them kobolds.</string>
<string name="9382">I think that Drogan has done a fine thing training such a good-natured &lt;lad/lass&gt; such as yourself.</string>
<string name="9383">Thank the gods we have people like you in Hilltop, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can only imagine what the kobolds might have done here, otherwise.</string>
<string name="9384">Always a pleasure to see you in town, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I certainly hope those kobolds didn&apos;t hurt anyone at your school.</string>
<string name="9385">I heard that you&apos;re close to graduating from Drogan&apos;s school. You&apos;re... not thinking of leaving Hilltop, are you? We&apos;d all miss you greatly.</string>
<string name="9386">It&apos;s certainly nice to know that the kobolds didn&apos;t hurt you at all. Not that a man like yourself needs to worry about them, I suppose.</string>
<string name="9387">You know, I&apos;ve always said to my friends that it&apos;s too bad Drogan doesn&apos;t let &lt;FirstName&gt; come into town more... and here you are!</string>
<string name="9388">It&apos;s certainly nice to see you in town, &lt;FirstName&gt;. How you can stand to be cooped up in that house all day, I can&apos;t imagine.</string>
<string name="9389">It&apos;s good to see you&apos;re alright, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and that those nasty kobolds didn&apos;t hurt you. I&apos;d hate to hear anything bad happened to you.</string>
<string name="9390">You know, I&apos;ve always thought that Drogan was one lucky dwarf to have such a charismatic follower.</string>
<string name="9391">You&apos;re Drogan&apos;s apprentice, aren&apos;t you? You know, I&apos;ve heard a little about your barbaric background. Quite interesting.</string>
<string name="9392">I&apos;ve heard you&apos;re quite the brute with an axe in your hand. Wish you&apos;d been here to plant one in the heads of some of them kobolds, earlier.</string>
<string name="9393">You and that other apprentice of Drogan&apos;s... Dorna?... you&apos;re both from far up north, right?</string>
<string name="9394">I wouldn&apos;t have minded having a few spells to fight off those kobolds. I saw a few of them casting magic, themselves... it just seemed so unnatural.</string>
<string name="9395">Can&apos;t say that I know too much about magic and all... although it seems that your Master Drogan is a kind enough fellow. For a dwarf.</string>
<string name="9396">&lt;FirstName&gt;, isn&apos;t it? I&apos;ve heard that you&apos;re some kind of mage, just like Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="9397">You know, it&apos;s good that at least one of Drogan&apos;s students is a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;. Makes up for that rude half-orc he harbors.</string>
<string name="9398">You might want to say a prayer for our little town, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If the kobolds are bold enough to attack, who knows what manner of beast will be next?</string>
<string name="9399">You know... I&apos;ve told Mayor Verant a thousand times that we should build a proper church in Hilltop. That&apos;s why the kobolds attacked us! The gods are angry!</string>
<string name="9400">Thank the gods you&apos;re here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I wish you were about earlier with that weapon of yours when the kobolds were everywhere.</string>
<string name="9401">Does Master Drogan tell you to walk around with your weapon swinging about? It&apos;s quite distracting.</string>
<string name="9402">You can put your weapon away, now. I, um... I think all the kobolds have been driven out of Hilltop.</string>
<string name="9403">You know, I have a cousin in Sundabar whom everyone says is slow. Frankly I think that&apos;s quite a rude thing for them to say.</string>
<string name="9404">Thank goodness one of Drogan&apos;s apprentices is here. How is Master Drogan? Alright, I hope?</string>
<string name="9405">Hmmm. You&apos;re one of Drogan&apos;s apprentices, right? Quite nice of him to take pity on such a... well, that is... never mind.</string>
<string name="9406">I see you were in quite the tussle. Do those wounds hurt much?</string>
<string name="9407">Oh dear, did you get attacked by kobolds? You look quite beat up, there.</string>
<string name="9408">Oh my... you&apos;re bleeding! You should go and see Gilford right away. He can heal you up, good as new.</string>
<string name="9409">Err... did you lose your clothes somewhere? Or doesn&apos;t Drogan supply you with any?</string>
<string name="9410">Either the kobolds went and stole your clothes or you&apos;ve gone as mad as old Piper, there.</string>
<string name="9411">Are you mad? Running around in the middle of winter with no clothes on?</string>
<string name="9412">Thank you for healing me.</string>
<string name="9413">I was so afraid for Blumberg and it turns out I was right. They didn&apos;t stand a chance.</string>
<string name="9414">We can barely take care of our own people. How are we supposed to care for all these refugees?</string>
<string name="9415">I used to go to Blumberg all the time. I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s gone.</string>
<string name="9416">Someone told me that Master Drogan is better, now. That is the best news I&apos;ve heard all day!</string>
<string name="9417">Surveying the carnage, you discern that the gnolls and kobolds fought each other here. The battle is long over, however, and who the victors were and where they went is a mystery.</string>
<string name="9418">By examining the bodies, it seems obvious to you that the kobolds and gnolls fought each other here... although who attacked whom and why are a mystery. You are fairly sure that the gnolls won the battle.</string>
<string name="9419">By examining the bodies in the area and the tracks nearby, it is obvious to you that the kobolds were ambushed by a group of gnolls as they passed. You suspect that the gnolls were victorious, though it seems equally likely that many of the kobolds fled during the melee.</string>
<string name="9420">The chicken seems very indignant and excitable, but even you are uncertain as to what she&apos;s trying to say exactly.</string>
<string name="9421">The chicken tells you a lame joke about crossing some road and then clucks endlessly in laughter.</string>
<string name="9422">The chicken excitedly asks you to tell the dogs to stay away from their pens. It thinks the dogs are very frightening with their big teeth.</string>
<string name="9423">The chicken whispers to you in conspiratorial tones that it believes the human farmer may indeed be... an axe-murderer!</string>
<string name="9424">The chicken clucks in outrage, explaining to you its belief that the humans have been systematically stealing her unborn children.</string>
<string name="9425">The chicken launches into a story about how it had been very much startled by a stick the previous day.</string>
<string name="9426">The chicken tells you in hushed clucks that one of its brood-sisters swallowed an odd stone and then coughed it up in the water trough just this morning.</string>
<string name="9427">&lt;FirstName&gt; is a nice name. Are you going to be famous some day? Like Elminster the Sage?</string>
<string name="9428">My daddy says he could beat you in a fight any day. Is that true?</string>
<string name="9429">Do you have lots of money? Daddy says adventurers get lots of money.</string>
<string name="9430">I want to be a &lt;race&gt; adventurer someday, just like you! Um... I think...</string>
<string name="9431">Is Master Drogan really a dwarf? I think he&apos;s really hairy.</string>
<string name="9432">Do you have to learn a lot at that school? Like, um... numbers and stuff?</string>
<string name="9433">I know you! You&apos;re &lt;FirstName&gt;!</string>
<string name="9434">Kobolds are scary. Are you going to kill some?</string>
<string name="9435">What&apos;s a kobold? My sister says I look like one when I get mad.</string>
<string name="9436">Oooo... can you cast any spells? My mother says she saw Drogan cast one, once.</string>
<string name="9437">Have you ever been on a real adventure? Are you on one now?</string>
<string name="9438">My mother says that adventurers just get themselves killed a lot. Is that true?</string>
<string name="9439">I saw that Drogan once, you know. He&apos;s really short.</string>
<string name="9440">You&apos;re &lt;FirstName&gt;, aren&apos;t you? I want to be an adventurer someday just like you!</string>
<string name="9441">The cow stares at you with disinterested cow eyes.</string>
<string name="9442">The cow looks at you with vague disinterest, sending empathetic messages of discomfort in the cold and an interest in finding hay.</string>
<string name="9443">The deer stares at you alertly, ready to bolt should you approach it further.</string>
<string name="9444">The deer appears skittish and suspects you are a vicious kobold, ready to eat it. It has little interest in communicating with you.</string>
<string name="9445">The dog bares its teeth and growls, obviously alarmed by your approach.</string>
<string name="9446">The dog wags its tail with obvious uncertainty and shies away from you.</string>
<string name="9447">The dog looks at you curiously. It seems friendly enough.</string>
<string name="9448">The dog responds gladly to your approach, excitedly wagging its tail and accepting your touch.</string>
<string name="9449">At your command, the dog happily bounds off to return to its normal routine.</string>
<string name="9450">The dog is overjoyed at the information, ecstatic that he will finally be able to impress Bethsheva enough to become her mate.</string>
<string name="9451">The thoughts he sends to you are of thanks as he quickly runs off towards the herbalist&apos;s home.</string>
<string name="9452">The dog has difficulty understanding what you might find useful... though it happily informs you that the Bubbling Cauldron is a wonderful place to beg for food. Or it was: now it smells rank of kobolds.</string>
<string name="9453">Beyond that, the dog states only that Bethsheva might know something interesting. The dog&apos;s thoughts indicate that it finds Bethsheva most interesting.</string>
<string name="9454">The dog responds happily that Bethsheva is a wonderfully smart and beautiful wolf-bitch that resides with the human druid, Farghan.</string>
<string name="9455">The word amongst the dogs in town is that Bethsheva buried something valuable in the village, but none of them can find it.</string>
<string name="9456">The dog thinks that is most clever of the she-bitch and wishes he could mate with her.</string>
<string name="9457">He believes that another dog has recently mated with Bethsheva and shoots jealous thoughts in that lucky dog&apos;s general direction.</string>
<string name="9458">The dog responds to your empathic communication with images from its mind. It dislikes the smell of the kobolds and hid from the cruel creatures when they passed.</string>
<string name="9459">The dog believes that the kobolds ran south along the path, heading for the place where the human wall opens up.</string>
<string name="9460">You fish into your pack for a few strips of dried meat. The dog gulps them down happily and wags its tail in thanks.</string>
<string name="9461">&lt;StartAction&gt;Send the dog on its way.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9462">&lt;StartAction&gt;Tell the dog where Bethsheva buried the item.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9463">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask the dog for any useful information it might have.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9464">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask the dog about Bethsheva.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9465">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask the dog for information on the kobolds&apos; passing.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9466">&lt;StartAction&gt;Give the dog a snack.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9467">We have to guard the gate until the reinforcements come. Damn kobolds broke it down somehow. Anyway... if you&apos;re going out there, be careful.</string>
<string name="9468">I wouldn&apos;t suggest you leave town just yet, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s dangerous out there. Your choice.</string>
<string name="9469">Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Err... you&apos;re not thinking of heading beyond the wall, are you? With all them kobolds out there?</string>
<string name="9470">Right. Because you adventurer-types are so much more superior than us regular folk. Ahhh, do what you like.</string>
<string name="9471">Fine. Go get yourself killed. It&apos;s all the same to me.</string>
<string name="9472">You think so, do you? Yeah... maybe you&apos;re right. You&apos;re Drogan&apos;s apprentice and all that, after all.</string>
<string name="9473">Gone from Hilltop, yes, but who knows what they&apos;re up to out there? Kobolds are usually cowards, but these ones... they could be up to anything.</string>
<string name="9474">You&apos;re going to go looking for them? Well, that&apos;s a switch.</string>
<string name="9475">At any rate, if you&apos;re going out there, be careful. There&apos;s no telling what you&apos;ll encounter on the road this time of year.</string>
<string name="9476">At any rate, you might want to think twice before you leave Hilltop. I would suggest you get some decent equipment and maybe a little experience first.</string>
<string name="9477">I&apos;m told there&apos;s probably some folks in town who could use some help. We can&apos;t do anything until the reinforcements from Blumberg get here... maybe you could?</string>
<string name="9478">It&apos;s just a suggestion, anyhow. I won&apos;t stop you from leaving, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re intent on.</string>
<string name="9479">Mind your own business, cretin.</string>
<string name="9480">I can handle myself.</string>
<string name="9481">Aren&apos;t the kobolds long gone?</string>
<string name="9482">I have no choice. I need to find those kobolds.</string>
<string name="9483">Sorry, but I can&apos;t chat right now. There&apos;s only a few of us left after that attack and the mayor wants us on double-duty... just in case.</string>
<string name="9484">It might be safer if you went back to the school. There&apos;s only a few of us guards left right now to watch for any more attacks.</string>
<string name="9485">You be careful, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There&apos;s no way to be sure all the kobolds are gone, and more could arrive.</string>
<string name="9486">&lt;FirstName&gt;? Is everything alright at the school? How is Drogan doing?</string>
<string name="9487">What are you doing here? I&apos;m watching you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, just so you know.</string>
<string name="9488">Shouldn&apos;t you be back at your school? Drogan&apos;s there, isn&apos;t he? How is he doing?</string>
<string name="9489">I don&apos;t want any trouble out of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We&apos;ve got enough problems in Hilltop right now.</string>
<string name="9490">Eh? Err... no, not this second. I have to watch for the reinforcements to arrive from Silverymoon. How about you? Everything okay with Drogan?</string>
<string name="9491">And more than any of us need right now. There were plenty of people hurt by the kobolds, not that you&apos;d care.</string>
<string name="9492">Hmph. I don&apos;t know what Drogan sees in you. Well, do what you like. I have other things to worry about.</string>
<string name="9493">Oh? Everything okay at the school? Drogan is alright?</string>
<string name="9494">I&apos;ve heard enough about your exploits, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Just watch it, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="9495">Well... maybe I&apos;m being a bit harsh. I&apos;ve just heard stories about you.</string>
<string name="9496">It&apos;s good to see you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Something I can help you with?</string>
<string name="9497">You be careful there, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We&apos;re not certain all the kobolds are gone from Hilltop just yet.</string>
<string name="9498">It&apos;s good to see that you&apos;re okay, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We were worried about you and Drogan up at the school. How is Drogan doing?</string>
<string name="9499">Oh. I, ah... hope the old dwarf is alright, anyway. Those kobolds took us by surprise.</string>
<string name="9500">Something I can help you with?</string>
<string name="9501">Be careful.</string>
<string name="9502">Farghan&apos;s in his shop across from the tavern. But what am I saying? Of course you know where his shop is.</string>
<string name="9503">Not personally, no. Fiona&apos;s in her smithy, however... I&apos;m sure she can supply you whatever equipment you need at a decent price.</string>
<string name="9504">I can&apos;t. The mayor wants the few of us that are left watching out for any new attacks. When we get reinforcements from Silverymoon, we&apos;ll do a house-to-house search.</string>
<string name="9505">Yes. We&apos;ve already sent out a messenger to them, asking for help. Hopefully they weren&apos;t attacked as well.</string>
<string name="9506">The ones that ran away? They went south, by way of the town gate. You intend on chasing after them? If so, they&apos;ve got quite a head start on you.</string>
<string name="9507">So they must have killed her right after they escaped. That&apos;s a sad, sad shame. Thank you for telling me... I&apos;ll let everyone know.</string>
<string name="9508">They did? But... I thought Lodar reported that he had everything under control there, short of a stand-off with a few kobolds in the kitchen.</string>
<string name="9509">Blast! The mayor should have let us go and help those poor souls. Ahhh, well... thank you for bringing me the news, &lt;FirstName&gt;, bad as it is.</string>
<string name="9510">Well, you might want to talk to Haniah over at the town hall. I heard the mayor&apos;s so drunk he can barely stand... so she&apos;s got her hands full, I bet.</string>
<string name="9511">Beyond that, if you could check around to make sure the kobolds aren&apos;t still bothering the locals, we&apos;d appreciate it.</string>
<string name="9512">I&apos;d gladly do that myself, but as long as we&apos;re this short-handed none of us can spare the time from keeping watch before help arrives.</string>
<string name="9513">That&apos;s a relief. It&apos;s always been a point of pride amongst the people here that we have our own resident wizard, you know.</string>
<string name="9514">Damnable reptiles! Took us by surprise, they did. I hope Drogan recovers. If he died, that would be a real loss for all of us.</string>
<string name="9515">Poisoned? Then you&apos;d best get to Farghan&apos;s as soon as possible. He was in his shop the last I saw.</string>
<string name="9516">That&apos;s good to hear. Thank you for letting me know, I&apos;ll pass it on.</string>
<string name="9517">I wish we could have. We were taken by surprise and had our own battles to fight. We lost several men, I&apos;m afraid to say.</string>
<string name="9518">I can&apos;t say that killing Piper was the right thing to do, but I guess it&apos;s on your conscience now, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="9519">So you killed Piper, did you, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I can&apos;t say it wasn&apos;t coming for him, all things considered.</string>
<string name="9520">I cannot believe that Blumberg is burnt to the ground. I sure am glad we were better defended. You did a good thing, rescuing those refugees.</string>
<string name="9521">Is there something you need help with, sir?</string>
<string name="9522">I&apos;m more trouble than you can handle!</string>
<string name="9523">I could not care less what you think of me, fool.</string>
<string name="9524">I&apos;m on important business.</string>
<string name="9525">And why would I be any trouble?</string>
<string name="9526">Who cares? I have other things to worry about.</string>
<string name="9527">I&apos;ve got to go.</string>
<string name="9528">I need to find the herbalist.</string>
<string name="9529">I need some equipment. Can you help me out?</string>
<string name="9530">There are still some kobolds in Hilltop. Will you help with them?</string>
<string name="9531">Reinforcements from Silverymoon?</string>
<string name="9532">Do you know where the surviving kobolds went?</string>
<string name="9533">I wanted to report that I found Mara... dead. Just outside Hilltop.</string>
<string name="9534">I thought you should know... the kobolds killed everyone in the tavern.</string>
<string name="9535">Is there anything in Hilltop I can do to help out?</string>
<string name="9536">He was alive, last time I saw him.</string>
<string name="9537">He&apos;s not good. He was poisoned by kobolds.</string>
<string name="9538">He was poisoned by kobolds, actually. I need to get some herbs for him.</string>
<string name="9539">He was poisoned, but he&apos;s recovering now at the school.</string>
<string name="9540">We could have used your help when the kobolds attacked, you know.</string>
<string name="9541">You should talk to Katriana if you have any questions.</string>
<string name="9542">Thank you for healing me.</string>
<string name="9543">You notice some humanoid tracks beneath the cliff, but are unable to determine what creature made them or any information about them.</string>
<string name="9544">A large group of humanoids seem to have come down the cliff face and headed south out of town.</string>
<string name="9545">These appear to be kobold tracks. A large group of them, at least 30, seem to have come down the cliff face and headed south out of town.</string>
<string name="9546">Oh, thank the gods; Adam called down and said you returned the baby to him.</string>
<string name="9547">Leave me be! My home is broken, no thanks to you!</string>
<string name="9548">Where are they? Where are Adam and Tynan? Did you find them?</string>
<string name="9549">Oh, please hurry. I have the worst feeling of dread for my innocent child.</string>
<string name="9550">&lt;StartAction&gt;[sob]&lt;/Start&gt; No, no, gods no! Do not say they are dead! No! I cannot take this! Death take me; death take us all.</string>
<string name="9551">What is it? Please, tell me what has happened!</string>
<string name="9552">No! Not sweet Tynan! &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sob]&lt;/Start&gt; How could the gods be so cruel? Oh, Adam!</string>
<string name="9553">Bring him to me, please!</string>
<string name="9554">Oh thank the gods, and you too, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will go up and nurse him right away. That always soothes him so.</string>
<string name="9555">What? No! Please, do not say such a thing. What good could come from taking him? You cannot mean this!</string>
<string name="9556">I do not trust you. Give my child back and I will pay you. You are stronger than I am, so you do not have to worry about me double crossing you.</string>
<string name="9557">No! I will kill you, you villain!</string>
<string name="9558">Thank the gods, and you too, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Oh, Tynan, you precious little boy. How I feared you were dead. </string>
<string name="9559">But where is Adam? He... he is still alive, isn&apos;t he? Please, tell me I am not a widow.</string>
<string name="9560">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Your mouth says he lives, but I can see it in your eyes. My Adam is gone! Why would you lie to me about such a thing?</string>
<string name="9561">You killed him! Yes, that is the only reason for you to lie to me. Well, you won&apos;t kill me too! You can&apos;t have my baby! No! Help, murder!</string>
<string name="9562">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, thank you. I will go to him right away. First though, you deserve a reward. The only thing of value I have is my wedding ring. </string>
<string name="9563">No! No, poor, brave Adam. Those monsters murdered him! How can the gods be so cruel? At... at least I have Tynan, a small piece to remember Adam by.</string>
<string name="9564">I have my home and my wedding ring, as well. Of course, without Adam to support me, I guess I will have to sell the ring; just to help me until I can find a job.</string>
<string name="9565">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I could not ask that of you. If not for you my child would be dead too. I mean... it would be helpful, but I am sure I can survive if I sell my wedding ring.</string>
<string name="9566">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Gasp]&lt;/Start&gt; I would never have believed that anyone could be so kind. Be assured that Tynan will be raised to know who his savior was.</string>
<string name="9567">Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, that is so kind of you. Be assured that Tynan will be raised to know who his savior was. </string>
<string name="9568">I will sing your praises in his ear and someday, if I raise him properly, perhaps he will grow to emulate you. Good luck to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And thank you again.</string>
<string name="9569">No, please, leave Tynan alone. He is so small and helpless. Take my ring, just leave my babe alone!</string>
<string name="9570">But, I have nothing to give you. I need to sell my ring, or my child and I will starve to death before winter&apos;s end.</string>
<string name="9571">Thank you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will pray to the gods to keep you safe. </string>
<string name="9572">Oh, thank you. I will go to him right away. I have a healing potion hidden upstairs, where no one could find it.</string>
<string name="9573">First though, you deserve a reward. The only thing of value I have is my wedding ring. It&apos;s nothing special, but you might get a few gold for it.</string>
<string name="9574">I am sorry; I wish I had more to offer. I hope all goes well for you. I had better go see to my husband. Thank you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9575">Really? Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, that is so kind of you! When Adam and I have our next child, we will name it &lt;FirstName&gt;.. after you! Thank you so much. </string>
<string name="9576">Be careful in your journeys. We wouldn&apos;t want to lose a hero like you.</string>
<string name="9577">Please, I can still hear my child crying. Save Tynan!</string>
<string name="9578">My family is doomed! Oh, why will you not help me? Please!</string>
<string name="9579">Help me! Somebody help me! Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, thank the gods you are here! You must help me, please!</string>
<string name="9580">Kobolds attacked our house. Adam and I were still in bed when they burst into our room. We climbed out the window and Adam helped me down, then he went back in the front door.  </string>
<string name="9581">He went to save little Tynan, but he hasn&apos;t returned. Tynan is only two months old. Oh, please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you must save them!</string>
<string name="9582">But... but... you have been trained to do things like this. I would be slaughtered! Please, do not be so cruel! Save my family!</string>
<string name="9583">You are a horrible &lt;man/woman&gt;. Do not think that others will not hear about your cowardice! If my love and my child are lost, your name will become a curse upon every tongue in this town!</string>
<string name="9584">Questions? My family is about to be slaughtered, or may already be dead. How can you ask questions? This is no time for a friendly visit!</string>
<string name="9585">Please hurry and save my family!</string>
<string name="9586">What? Why would you need to know that? We have very few valuables. I am wearing my wedding ring, and that is the only thing of real value I own.</string>
<string name="9587">I... I... I cannot. If my husband is dead, I would have nothing else to remember him by. If you save him, I will give it to you. Just please, save my family!</string>
<string name="9588">Oh, I guess that is important to know. He is just upstairs in a side bedroom. Please, you must save him. I cannot imagine life without him.</string>
<string name="9589">I was climbing out the window, fleeing them. I didn&apos;t stop to count them! There must have been quite a few though. Adam is a strong man, and one or two would not be enough to stop him.</string>
<string name="9590">Payment? My husband and child may only have a few seconds to live! They might be dead already! Go now, please. I am sure we can come up with some reward, just go now!</string>
<string name="9591">Oh, thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, please hurry!</string>
<string name="9592">You&apos;ll always have a place in our hearts, &lt;FirstName&gt;.  My poor Adam..</string>
<string name="9593">You lied to me. How could I have ever trusted you? For all I know, you killed Adam! Get out of my home and never return!</string>
<string name="9594">We shall starve, I fear. I am glad to have my babe back, but I do miss Thomas.</string>
<string name="9595">Not yet.</string>
<string name="9596">You weren&apos;t terribly attached to your family were you? </string>
<string name="9597">I have some terrible news for you.</string>
<string name="9598">I have some good news and some bad news.</string>
<string name="9599">Let&apos;s just say you and your husband will have time to make a new kid. </string>
<string name="9600">I rescued your husband, but was too late to save your baby. </string>
<string name="9601">Adam lives, but your child was killed by a kobold.</string>
<string name="9602">I rescued your baby. </string>
<string name="9603">Your baby is fine, but Adam was killed.</string>
<string name="9604">The baby is fine, but I do not have him on me.</string>
<string name="9605">I put Tynan back in his crib. He is safe.</string>
<string name="9606">I am keeping your child.</string>
<string name="9607">I don&apos;t need to explain. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="9608">I will think of something. Goodbye. </string>
<string name="9609">I will sell him as a slave to the Thayvian wizard. </string>
<string name="9610">Give me something now, if you want him back.</string>
<string name="9611">Then I am keeping him.</string>
<string name="9612">I was kidding. Here he is.</string>
<string name="9613">Here is your young babe.</string>
<string name="9614">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; He is alive. He is just waiting inside for you.</string>
<string name="9615">I am afraid Adam didn&apos;t survive.</string>
<string name="9616">Would it help if I gave you some gold?</string>
<string name="9617">I guess you are right. Good luck then.</string>
<string name="9618">I insist. Here is fifty gold.</string>
<string name="9619">I insist, here is ten gold.</string>
<string name="9620">Give me that ring, or your babe will follow his father to an early grave.</string>
<string name="9621">I think I deserve a reward for saving your baby.</string>
<string name="9622">Yes, well, I will be going then.</string>
<string name="9623">Adam is well. He waits inside for you. </string>
<string name="9624">Adam lives, but you will need to get him a healer.</string>
<string name="9625">That&apos;s it? I deserve more than that for risking my life. </string>
<string name="9626">I guess it will have to do then.</string>
<string name="9627">I don&apos;t need a reward. I was glad I could help.</string>
<string name="9628">Thank you. That is very generous of you. </string>
<string name="9629">I have my own problems. Why don&apos;t you go save them?</string>
<string name="9630">No, Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9631">Sorry, I don&apos;t know what I was thinking. I will help. </string>
<string name="9632">I guess I can try. </string>
<string name="9633">I have to ask you some questions first.</string>
<string name="9634">That&apos;s all my questions.</string>
<string name="9635">I will save them. </string>
<string name="9636">Where do you keep your valuables?</string>
<string name="9637">If you want your family to live, give me that ring!</string>
<string name="9638">Where is the baby?</string>
<string name="9639">How many kobolds are there?</string>
<string name="9640">Before I do anything, let&apos;s discuss payment.</string>
<string name="9641">There is no time then. I will do my best.</string>
<string name="9642">The ox stares at you with disinterested ox eyes.</string>
<string name="9643">The ox looks at you with vague disinterest, sending empathetic messages of discomfort in the cold and an interest in finding hay.</string>
<string name="9644">The rat watches you warily, concerned only with its gnawing hunger as it shivers from the cold.</string>
<string name="9645">So what did the mayor and his beautiful assistant have to say?</string>
<string name="9646">Was there anything else you needed then?</string>
<string name="9647">Yes, good luck to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9648">Ah, violence should always be a last resort, but sometimes it is necessary. As you seem to be good a problem solving, I think we shall become fast friends.</string>
<string name="9649">You have been of great assistance, &lt;FirstName&gt;. When I return, I shall remember the help you lent, and you shall have the finest discount I can offer.</string>
<string name="9650">Here is your one hundred gold, as promised. I am sure you will do very well. Drogan has trained a fine adventurer. Good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9651">You disappoint me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I had hoped you might have more sense than that. Someday you too will be the victim of close-minded bigotry. I hope you remember our conversation on that day.</string>
<string name="9652">So be it. I thank you for trying to help me. You are a fresh breeze in a town full of the stench of prejudice. Good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9653">An ill wind accompanies this ill-fated day. And does this blasted cold ever end? How can civilization possibly exist in such a tormented landscape?</string>
<string name="9654">I wish it were truly that simple. I would like nothing better than to return to my home in Eltabbar, where temperatures are more moderate, and the seasons are of a reasonable length.</string>
<string name="9655">But, one does not say no to a command from Tharchion Dmitra Flass. Not if one wishes to survive, at least. </string>
<string name="9656">Now, judging from your uncouth demeanor, one could only suppose that you are one of Drogan&apos;s charges. I must then assume that you would be &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9657">That is unfortunate for both of us. I had hoped that a short discussion might be mutually beneficial. Alas, we shall never know.</string>
<string name="9658">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9659">I overheard a conversation at the town hall that described you in fair detail. Apparently there are those who feel that you will continue on Drogan&apos;s legacy as an adventurer.</string>
<string name="9660">I thought it might be worth getting a look at you before I left town. Perhaps we could talk about something of mutual benefit.</string>
<string name="9661">The one who told a stranger to shut up and leave, simply for expressing an opinion about the weather. Granted, that is far nicer than you might have gotten in my homeland.</string>
<string name="9662">But most of my peers would have been more polite, before they warmed you up with a fireball.</string>
<string name="9663">Odd, I would think it hard to cut someone&apos;s purse strings with numbed fingers from the frigid air. Such a short time here and already I have heard of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9664">Odd, I would think it hard to be a druid while all around you nature sleeps. From the looks of you, I would guess you are &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9665">Odd, I would think it hard to control your weapon when the frigid air numbs your fingers to the quick. Young and bold; let me guess, you must be &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9666">Odd, I would think it hard to voice your prayers with frigid air blasting down your throat. From the looks of you, I would guess you are &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9667">Odd, I would think it hard to keep your body flexible in such frigid weather. From the looks of you, I would guess you are &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9668">Odd, I would think it hard to cast your spells when your fingers are numb from the frigid air. Not a lot of magic users in a small village like this, so you must be &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9669">Odd, I would think it hard to pluck the strings on a lute in such a frigid temperature. Such a short time here and already I have heard of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, the bard.</string>
<string name="9670">Yes, I suppose it must be hard to cut someone&apos;s purse strings with numbed fingers from the frigid air. Such a short time here and already I have heard of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9671">Yes, I suppose it is hard to be a druid while all around you nature sleeps. From the looks of you, I would guess you are &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9672">Yes, it must be hard to control your weapon when the frigid air numbs your fingers to the quick. Young and bold; let me guess, you must be &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9673">Yes, it must be hard to voice your prayers with frigid air blasting down your throat. From the looks of you, I would guess you are &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9674">Yes, I suppose it must be hard to keep your body flexible in such frigid weather. From the looks of you, I would guess you are &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9675">Yes, it must be hard to cast your spells when your fingers are numb from the frigid air. Not a lot of magic users in a small village like this, so you must be &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9676">Yes. I suppose it must be hard to pluck the strings on a lute in such a frigid temperature. Such a short time here and already I have heard of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt;.</string>
<string name="9677">I suppose small villages must brag about any potential hero, though I would have thought they would wait until you graduated from this... school you have attended.</string>
<string name="9678">My name is Szaren and I am a wizard of Thay.  And quite honestly, if that admission is not enough to make you turn around and walk away, then I would say we are off to a great start.</string>
<string name="9679">Now that is the attitude I have come to expect, particularly in such a small, unimportant village as this. Yet here I am. </string>
<string name="9680">What is it that makes people ignore what is in their best interests, simply so they can hold on to their prejudices? No, do not answer. It is simply too bad that we could not come to an arrangement.</string>
<string name="9681">Yes, I hope you have a pleasant day as well.</string>
<string name="9682">Straight to business then? Well, that is a better attitude than I have been met with so far. </string>
<string name="9683">The very attitude I was desperately hoping to find. I have been met only with prejudice and an unforgivable lack of courtesy.</string>
<string name="9684">My good Mistress, Lady Dmitra Flass, Tharchion of Eltabbar, has been working very hard to end the strife within Thay, as well as the costly and detrimental wars between Thay and her neighbors.</string>
<string name="9685">Please, do not mistake her goals as being altruistic. Thayvians crave two main things in life: gold and power. </string>
<string name="9686">Part of her plan is to show the other rulers of our country how much can be gained through peace. Thay has begun to set up magical enclaves in cities throughout Faerun.</string>
<string name="9687">These enclaves sell magic items of various sorts to anyone with sufficient gold. So far the enclaves have been very successful and Lady Flass has gained much prestige.</string>
<string name="9688">Overly impatient are we? I will try to make this succinct then.</string>
<string name="9689">Your mayor is shortsighted and refuses to allow me to set up an enclave in Hilltop. Our goal was to prove our worth here in the Silver Marches, then expand once trust is earned.</string>
<string name="9690">As one of Drogan&apos;s students, you command some respect around here.  I hoped you might be willing to convince the mayor that my presence could only be a benefit here.</string>
<string name="9691">Of course, information is power. I will tell you what I can, so you may judge us fairly.</string>
<string name="9692">Then I bid you farewell and hope that you will return soon bearing good news.</string>
<string name="9693">Good luck, friend.</string>
<string name="9694">So, have you made your judgment? Will you try to help me?</string>
<string name="9695">I am afraid I left behind anything I did not feel would be necessary for this trip. Should I be allowed to return, I would bring some supplies with me.</string>
<string name="9696">The rest of the supplies, guards and workers would have to come by caravan, so they would take a while longer.</string>
<string name="9697">But there would be many arrangements to take care of before I could return, so I imagine it will take me a couple of weeks.</string>
<string name="9698">That is often the case, and yet we have found that our practice of slavery is not accepted in this part of the world, and so I left my slaves and came here using magic to transport me.</string>
<string name="9699">I even came without guards, for it made the travel easier. I did not expect much resistance, but you can understand how I was not quick to run out and attack the horde of kobolds all by myself.</string>
<string name="9700">If I am able to set up an enclave here, I would bring guards and slaves, though I would keep the slaves in the compound, so as not to offend the other residents.</string>
<string name="9701">Yes, the benefits to both would be great, although I doubt my profits will be as good as those enclaves in larger centers. </string>
<string name="9702">Still, there are many adventurers in these northern territories; I should do a fair trade.</string>
<string name="9703">I could hardly run a profitable business if the village was overrun with monsters, now could I? My guards and my magical abilities would be a true asset for Hilltop.</string>
<string name="9704">The enclave would be considered Thayvian soil, and I would not traffic in slaves, neither to buy nor sell. They would remain in the compound and belong only to me.</string>
<string name="9705">Besides, I guarantee that their lives would be far better out here than if they remained in Thay proper. I do not mistreat my slaves; it is not economical.</string>
<string name="9706">The Red Wizards are the rulers of Thay. When a child is still young, he or she is tested for power in the magical arts. Children who prove adept are taken to schools.</string>
<string name="9707">The schools teach us to use our powers to the fullest, which means that many youth die before they can become Red Wizards. The teachers are harsh, your fellow students are even worse.</string>
<string name="9708">Even reaching the status of Red Wizard guarantees nothing more than that you will be treated a little better than a slave. It takes many years for a powerful practitioner to reach high status.</string>
<string name="9709">It is better than the lot some face. There are benefits to being a Red Wizard, and I wouldn&apos;t want to live the life of slavery that my parents did.</string>
<string name="9710">It is minds like yours that start wars when there is room for peaceful prosperity.</string>
<string name="9711">I can see that we shall not be seeing eye to eye. Therefore, I shall depart and you can keep the stench of your provincial, small town. I refuse to spend even another minute here.</string>
<string name="9712">I hope these kobold invaders destroy your entire village.</string>
<string name="9713">I am not whining, I am simply responding to your question. There are benefits to being a Red Wizard, and I wouldn&apos;t want to live the life of slavery that my parents did.</string>
<string name="9714">What choice are we given? You do or you die, such is life. There are good points to being a Red Wizard, and I wouldn&apos;t want to live the life of slavery that my parents did.</string>
<string name="9715">Not that I remember my parents, but I certainly know what the life of a slave in Thay is worth. No I would not trade my upbringing for any other in Thay.</string>
<string name="9716">But enough about that. Do you have any other questions?</string>
<string name="9717">That is unfortunate. To have invested so much time here with no results will make my mistress very angry. The disgust for you and your people that we Thayvians hold appears to be well founded.</string>
<string name="9718">When the day comes that Szazz Tam and his armies prevail over my Mistress and her commerce, then you shall rue this day and the mistake you made.</string>
<string name="9719">I leave behind the stench of this village and its intolerant attitude.</string>
<string name="9720">I can afford to pay you one hundred gold. I would imagine that in a small village like this, that would be enough to buy you a small farm, and possibly the farmer too.</string>
<string name="9721">That is all I can afford. If you will not do this, I shall simply move on to the next village, and then the next, until I find someone willing to listen to reason.</string>
<string name="9722">I know that the weather up here is frightfully cold, but certainly there must be someone left whose wits have not been fully frozen.</string>
<string name="9723">That is all I ask. Thank you for doing such a kindness for a stranger. You shall be well rewarded.</string>
<string name="9724">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; What do I look like, some kind of charity? Gold is a reward for a job well done. So go do your job, as you promised.</string>
<string name="9725">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; It is always good to establish a rapport with those you deal with. I find gold helps speed the bonding.</string>
<string name="9726">Here is ten gold. I might even be willing to forget I gave you an advance, if you do a good job.</string>
<string name="9727">Best of luck to you, my young friend.</string>
<string name="9728">You must understand that normally we only set up an enclave in large cities, where commerce is strong and profits are high.</string>
<string name="9729">Unfortunately, we have had a very difficult time getting permission from local lords and rulers in the northwest. I am afraid our reputation precedes us.</string>
<string name="9730">You have never heard of the Red Wizards of Thay and how we are all evil, murderous villains, who sell our souls to demons in trade for more power?</string>
<string name="9731">What do they teach you in these adventuring schools? Why, it is almost refreshing, and yet, vaguely frightening.</string>
<string name="9732">I must go now.</string>
<string name="9733">Nothing yet.</string>
<string name="9734">No, farewell.</string>
<string name="9735">The mayor and his assistant are dead and will not stop you.</string>
<string name="9736">The mayor said it was fine for you to stay.</string>
<string name="9737">I am here to run you out of town, evil mage!</string>
<string name="9738">I am afraid my appeal changed nothing.</string>
<string name="9739">I fear that the mayor is no longer listening to my advice. </string>
<string name="9740">If you don&apos;t like it, shut up and leave.</string>
<string name="9741">I don&apos;t want to talk to you.</string>
<string name="9742">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="9743">What do you mean by that? </string>
<string name="9744">How do you know that?</string>
<string name="9745">Who are you calling uncouth?</string>
<string name="9746">How did you know who I was? </string>
<string name="9747">Actually I like this invigorating weather.</string>
<string name="9748">I couldn&apos;t agree more.</string>
<string name="9749">Who are you?</string>
<string name="9750">A Red Wizard in Hilltop? Be gone before I strike you down!</string>
<string name="9751">Good riddance.</string>
<string name="9752">What do you mean by that? </string>
<string name="9753">What is a Red Wizard doing in Hilltop?</string>
<string name="9754">I would hear more before I judge you.</string>
<string name="9755">You expect me to believe that? </string>
<string name="9756">Tell me more. </string>
<string name="9757">Sounds awfully noble.</string>
<string name="9758">Get to the point where I&apos;m supposed to be interested.</string>
<string name="9759">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="9760">That&apos;s all the questions I have.</string>
<string name="9761">I will end your evil existence right now! </string>
<string name="9762">I will not help you. You must leave our village alone. </string>
<string name="9763">I will return.</string>
<string name="9764">Do you have anything for sale?</string>
<string name="9765">Don&apos;t the Red Wizards usually travel with slaves?</string>
<string name="9766">Sounds like a lucrative prospect for you and the village.</string>
<string name="9767">I cannot allow you to bring slaves to this village.</string>
<string name="9768">So would you help defend the town if you had an enclave here?</string>
<string name="9769">So you plan to bring slavery to Hilltop? </string>
<string name="9770">No, I will not help you spread your evil! </string>
<string name="9771">What exactly are the Red Wizards?</string>
<string name="9772">That sounds like a horrible childhood.</string>
<string name="9773">The more Thayvian that die, the better off the world is.</string>
<string name="9774">Quit your whining; life is hard all over.</string>
<string name="9775">If it is so hard, why do it?</string>
<string name="9776">I have no interest in helping you.</string>
<string name="9777">How much is this worth to you?</string>
<string name="9778">That&apos;s not enough.</string>
<string name="9779">I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="9780">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; How about some gold upfront?</string>
<string name="9781">I will be back.</string>
<string name="9782">Why would you come to such a small village? </string>
<string name="9783">Is that why you are here?</string>
<string name="9784">Why would I walk away?</string>
<string name="9785">Greetings, m&apos;lady! Might I say that it&apos;s a fine thing to be greeted by such a fair face as yours on such a cold day.</string>
<string name="9786">Why hello there! Such a pretty face, even on a big folk such as yourself, is a treat to warm the heart on a cold, cold day.</string>
<string name="9787">Ah, but it&apos;s the tall ones that make the finest catch! You&apos;d be surprised the things a halfling can make up for when he&apos;s caught a foot or two short, m&apos;lady.</string>
<string name="9788">Mmm. On such a chilly day, it&apos;s a pleasant treat to meet such a pretty halfling lass as yourself.</string>
<string name="9789">Now, now, no need to get violent. Unless, um... well, no, never mind that. Can&apos;t blame a lad for trying, can you? Heh heh.</string>
<string name="9790">Ah, well, you can&apos;t blame a man for trying, can you? A woman like yourself no doubt has the lads throwing themselves at your feet... I can only do the same.</string>
<string name="9791">Ha! A compliment, is it? Well, that certainly beats the odd slap I&apos;ve gotten as of late. Perhaps my luck is turning about.</string>
<string name="9792">Oh-ho! We&apos;ve only just met and here you&apos;ve gone and figured me out already. It seems I&apos;m as uncomplicated as halflings come, eh?</string>
<string name="9793">My name is Torias. A pleasure to meet you. Might I have the honor of knowing your name?</string>
<string name="9794">Hard to get, is it? Have it your way, m&apos;lady. I&apos;ll but gladly play along.</string>
<string name="9795">Ahhh, yes, the dwarven wizard. I remember him from our last visit. Fine fellow. Good to know he keeps such excellent company.</string>
<string name="9796">&lt;FirstName&gt;, is it? A beautiful name for a beautiful lady.</string>
<string name="9797">Why, hullo there. I don&apos;t suppose you&apos;ve a rum-tipped cigar on you, by chance?</string>
<string name="9798">Ah, well. I grew attached to them in Amn, you see, and have only recently run out. Too bad. Grey days ahead, I suppose.</string>
<string name="9799">A rum-tipped cigar. It&apos;s... well, never mind. Simply something I grew attached to in Amn, and I&apos;ve recently run out. Ah, well.</string>
<string name="9800">Pardon my manners, sir. I am called Torias. And you are...?</string>
<string name="9801">Oh. Well, then, a good day to you.</string>
<string name="9802">Oh, I see. A &lt;man/woman&gt; of mystery, eh? Fair enough.</string>
<string name="9803">Then I am very pleased to meet you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9804">Is there something that Torias might do for you today?</string>
<string name="9805">I see. A good day to you, then.</string>
<string name="9806">Well... I would gladly answer questions, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;, but I&apos;m sure that Katriana would have my hide. I have to be on watch for more kobolds, you see.</string>
<string name="9807">There were some other kobolds that came running past well after everything seemed settled. Scared us but good, but they ran on south through the gate.</string>
<string name="9808">I&apos;ve no idea where they came from or what they were up to. Large group, actually.</string>
<string name="9809">Yes, indeed. The little fellows crept up on us and took us all rather by surprise. Made off with a good amount of our supplies, too.</string>
<string name="9810">Unlike the other kobolds which fled Hilltop by the gate, these ones ran north of here to an old farm. I followed them but I didn&apos;t dare go inside as I was alone.</string>
<string name="9811">Some of them jumped into the river to the east, but others might still be in there. They may even still have some of our equipment, I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="9812">Alas, I cannot. I have to stay with my fellows until they&apos;re better. No running off to adventure for me.</string>
<string name="9813">If you&apos;re thinking of going up there, I might suggest you speak to Katriana first. She might have a boon to ask of you. Beyond that... good luck.</string>
<string name="9814">Hmm. Well, Katriana would tell you that no, it doesn&apos;t... at least not at the moment. We came to Hilltop to stock up, and the kobolds made off with a lot.</string>
<string name="9815">At least... they made off with our public goods. We have some... private goods, if you know what I mean. Black market stuff.</string>
<string name="9816">Not necessarily, no. Just goods that might appeal to those of a, ah, more subtle nature: the workings to build traps, tools... those sorts of things.</string>
<string name="9817">Mmm... oh, of course, of course. What else can Torias do for you, my dear &lt;man/woman&gt;?</string>
<string name="9818">Certainly. Give me but a moment to find what I have...</string>
<string name="9819">Not necessarily, no. Just goods that a, ah, experienced rogue might appreciate. Like yourself, for instance... I can spot the type anywhere.</string>
<string name="9820">Greetings once again! Is there something Torias can do for you?</string>
<string name="9821">Good gracious me! Those are Daschnaya&apos;s cards! My, my, but will she ever be delighted that you&apos;ve found them.</string>
<string name="9822">Please... go and show these to Katriana. She&apos;ll let you in to see Daschnaya, I&apos;m sure. We&apos;ve all been worried sick about the poor woman ever since these cards were stolen!</string>
<string name="9823">Greetings, my good &lt;man/woman&gt;!</string>
<string name="9824">Katriana tells me that you were able to retrieve Daschnaya&apos;s cards. For that I am most grateful.</string>
<string name="9825">I hear that you&apos;re going to be coming with us to the desert, eh? Well, welcome aboard!</string>
<string name="9826">Care to be greeted by the back end of my fist?</string>
<string name="9827">How about I treat you to the back end of my fist?</string>
<string name="9828">I&apos;m a little tall for a small man like you, don&apos;t you think?</string>
<string name="9829">Care to meet the back end of my fist?</string>
<string name="9830">Whatever you&apos;re thinking, don&apos;t get your hopes up.</string>
<string name="9831">You&apos;re not so bad for a halfling lad, yourself.</string>
<string name="9832">Flatterer.</string>
<string name="9833">Forget it.</string>
<string name="9834">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;, apprentice to Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="9835">It&apos;s &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9836">No. Not that I would hand them out to strange halflings if I did.</string>
<string name="9837">Err... can&apos;t say that I do.</string>
<string name="9838">A rum-tipped what?</string>
<string name="9839">Leaving.</string>
<string name="9840">Someone who doesn&apos;t introduce &lt;him/her&gt;self.</string>
<string name="9841">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;, apprentice to Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="9842">I&apos;m called &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9843">I should go.</string>
<string name="9844">Can I ask you a few questions?</string>
<string name="9845">More kobolds?</string>
<string name="9846">You were attacked, I take it?</string>
<string name="9847">Why are you on watch for more kobolds?</string>
<string name="9848">I might head up that way. Care to join me?</string>
<string name="9849">Does this caravan sell anything?</string>
<string name="9850">You mean illegal goods?</string>
<string name="9851">Maybe later.</string>
<string name="9852">I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="9853">Let me see what you have, then.</string>
<string name="9854">Do you know what happened to the kobolds that attacked you?</string>
<string name="9855">I found these cards... do they belong to you?</string>
<string name="9856">I&apos;d like to see your goods.</string>
<string name="9857">You are unable to determine what creature made these tracks or any information about them.</string>
<string name="9858">These appear to be kobold tracks. Several of them seem to have gone into the barn, but not come out.</string>
<string name="9859">These appear to be kobold tracks. Two of them seem to have gone into the barn, but not come out.</string>
<string name="9860">Is there something I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="9861">Then I wish you well.</string>
<string name="9862">With the kitchen in such a mess, no, I&apos;m afraid not. You&apos;ll have to come back after the tavern re-opens if you want something.</string>
<string name="9863">Thank you so much for rescuing me! It&apos;s very fortunate you came along... I was certain those little beasts were going to kill me!</string>
<string name="9864">I might. If the kobolds didn&apos;t get into them, there&apos;s probably some in the pot on the stove. Help yourself.</string>
<string name="9865">That&apos;s very noble of you. I&apos;m sure Drogan would be very proud.</string>
<string name="9866">Err... very grateful, of course. Why do you ask?</string>
<string name="9867">I do wish I could do more than merely thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You were the only one who could save me, and for that I&apos;ll always be grateful.</string>
<string name="9868">Ha ha! I&apos;d gladly cook you up the best meal you&apos;ve ever eaten if my kitchen weren&apos;t a total wreck.</string>
<string name="9869">Tell you what. Come back here once we&apos;ve had a chance to re-open the tavern and I&apos;ll do just that. You won&apos;t be sorry!</string>
<string name="9870">Ha ha! Do you say that to all the girls you rescue, or just me?</string>
<string name="9871">I have a whole kitchen to start cleaning here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Maybe come back some other time and, ah... I&apos;ll see what I can arrange.</string>
<string name="9872">You know... I always had a fantasy about a brave adventurer sweeping me off my feet one day. This isn&apos;t it.</string>
<string name="9873">Now then. If you manage to get your head out of the gutter long enough, please take it outside. I&apos;ve got a kitchen to clean.</string>
<string name="9874">I... have a few coins, but that&apos;s all. I&apos;m not wealthy by any means. Surely you don&apos;t have need of them!</string>
<string name="9875">Thank you. I do wish I could give you the reward you deserve, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will always be grateful, I hope you know that.</string>
<string name="9876">Alright, then, take them. I&apos;ll have to work twice as hard now to open the tavern back up, so please excuse me.</string>
<string name="9877">Oh. Well, if you put it that way, here... take the coins. Now please leave, as I&apos;ve got an entire kitchen to clean up.</string>
<string name="9878">Please, help us! Get those kobolds out of here! Somebody has to do something!</string>
<string name="9879">Please, help me! They... they&apos;re going to kill me for certain!</string>
<string name="9880">I&apos;ll be on my way.</string>
<string name="9881">Do you have anything to eat around here?</string>
<string name="9882">Actually, I came here looking for Helmthorn berries. Do you still have some?</string>
<string name="9883">You&apos;re welcome.</string>
<string name="9884">It was nothing more than my duty.</string>
<string name="9885">So... just how grateful are you?</string>
<string name="9886">It took a lot of effort to rescue you, that&apos;s why.</string>
<string name="9887">I&apos;m hungry. Are my efforts worth a good meal?</string>
<string name="9888">Would the fair damsel deign to reward her rescuer with a simple kiss?</string>
<string name="9889">You&apos;re a pretty girl. Surely I don&apos;t have to spell it out for you.</string>
<string name="9890">I want a reward, of course. You must have some coin on you.</string>
<string name="9891">No. Keep them, then.</string>
<string name="9892">They&apos;ll have to do. Hand them over.</string>
<string name="9893">I can think of another way for a pretty girl like you to reward me...</string>
<string name="9894">I actually need some Helmthorn berries. The herbalist said you might have some.</string>
<string name="9895">**yip** **yip**</string>

<string name="9963">Maybe... for the right price.</string>
<string name="9964">No, forget I mentioned that.</string>
<string name="9965">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Perform]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attempt to fascinate the Kobolds]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9966">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Bane on the Kobold]&lt;/Start&gt; Just surrender now and you won&apos;t get hurt!</string>
<string name="9967">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Scare on the Kobold]&lt;/Start&gt; Just surrender now and you won&apos;t get hurt!</string>
<string name="9968">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Sleep on the Kobolds]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9969">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Cast Charm Person on the Kobold]&lt;/Start&gt; Just put your weapons away and give yourselves up. You can trust me.</string>
<string name="9970">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; I tell you what... surrender now and I&apos;ll let you all live.</string>
<string name="9971">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; All right, you win. We&apos;ll let you go.</string>
<string name="9972">I suppose you&apos;re right...</string>
<string name="9973">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;ll do as I say! Now let them go!</string>
<string name="9974">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Whisper]&lt;/Start&gt; We will ambush them when they come out!</string>
<string name="9975">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Don&apos;t worry about it. I will rescue her later, if I can.</string>
<string name="9976">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Take me as a hostage, instead, and let the woman go.</string>
<string name="9977">Forget it! I&apos;m not going in there by myself.</string>
<string name="9978">I agree. I will come alone.</string>
<string name="9979">Forget it. I won&apos;t do that.</string>
<string name="9980">Very well. No creatures. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Dismiss any familiars, animal companions or summoned creatures.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="9981">Now that the cook is safe I can kill you properly!</string>
<string name="9982">Now that I&apos;m on this side... how about I help you get out of here?</string>
<string name="9983">No. Forget I said anything.</string>
<string name="9984">Here! Eat hot death, kobold!!</string>
<string name="9985">Maybe. If the price is right.</string>
<string name="9986">Absolutely. Let&apos;s attack them now!</string>
<string name="9987">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Absolutely. Let&apos;s attack them now!</string>
<string name="9988">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m much stronger than the cook. Surrender now and you won&apos;t get hurt.</string>
<string name="9989">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Look... you can leave now. Just go and nobody will hurt you.</string>
<string name="9990">A reward? Sounds good to me.</string>
<string name="9991">Just get out of here, vermin. I don&apos;t want your reward.</string>
<string name="9992">Actually, I just like to kill. And you&apos;re next!</string>
<string name="9993">Please... talk to those kobolds, if you can. Just don&apos;t get Mara hurt, I beg you!</string>
<string name="9994">Go on, then. If you&apos;re not going to help us, we&apos;ll wait for someone that can!</string>
<string name="9995">Look at this place! Those damnable kobolds tore in here a while ago, looking for a fight, and now they&apos;ve barricaded themselves in the kitchen!</string>
<string name="9996">We certainly do. The problem is that they&apos;re holding my cook hostage in there. If we try to push past the barricade, they&apos;ll kill her for certain.</string>
<string name="9997">Then we&apos;ll have to wait until the town guard can help us. Go on! Get out of here, then, if you won&apos;t be of any use!</string>
<string name="9998">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Just... please make sure Mara isn&apos;t hurt.</string>
<string name="9999">Why you should...? I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m hearing this! You&apos;re Drogan&apos;s apprentice, aren&apos;t you? Drogan would help us in an instant!</string>
