<string name="100033">&quot;How did Mephistopheles respond?&quot;</string>
<string name="100034">&quot;Why is whether or not you loved him so important?&quot;</string>
<string name="100035">&quot;Once you&apos;ve embraced evil, there&apos;s no turning back.&quot;</string>
<string name="100036">&quot;Fine. Tyr chose you as his paladin, then. Do you doubt his wisdom?&quot;</string>

<string name="100038">&quot;You&apos;re in hell. It&apos;s a bit late to doubt your true nature.&quot;</string>

<string name="100041">&quot;Tyr chose you as his paladin. Do you doubt his wisdom?&quot;</string>
<string name="100042">&quot;Fine. Once you&apos;ve embraced evil, there&apos;s no turning back.&quot;</string>

<string name="100175">Demonic Grappling Hand</string>
<string name="100176">This hand seems to have a life about it. It wriggles and writhes as you hold it, constantly gripping at your fingers.

When properly thrown, it will latch onto nearby obstacles - provided there is something it can grab onto. Upon hooking onto something, it will pull its owner over to it, and place itself back in its owner&apos;s backpack.

The Demonic Grappling Hand can also be used to manipulate some objects, like activating them, or pulling them closer to its owner.</string>
<string name="100177">Gruul&apos;s Bracer</string>
<string name="100178">Dream Journal, Vol. I</string>
<string name="100179">The Sleeping Man dreams more and more about his search, now, tossing and turning restlessly as I probe deeper into his thoughts. The search had led him to the vast wastes of Cania, well beyond the Gates. I could almost feel the biting cold he suffered, on the verge of death amidst the blinding snows. He had a ring that turned the whole world dark and marked the path that compelled him ever forward. Every step was agony but every step brought him closer to his quest&apos;s completion. Only at the end of the dream did the nature of that quest become clear. He sought the Knower of Places... Thus I learned the Fourth-Fold Mystery of the Sleeping Man. He has slept more peacefully ever since and he has not dreamed of his time in the wastes since.</string>
<string name="100180">Sensei&apos;s Amulet</string>
<string name="100181">Sensei Dharvana uses this amulet to focus on the dreams of the Sleeping Man. For those of sufficient mental acuity, simply wearing the amulet while in the Sleeping Man&apos;s presence should be sufficient to bring any latent psionic powers to the fore.</string>
<string name="100182">Trumpet of Pandemonium</string>
<string name="100183">Bent and battered, this strange trumpet is somehow linked to the howling winds of Pandemonium. Its sound is definitely more jarring than it is musical.</string>

<string name="100185">Velox Potion</string>
<string name="100186">The potion contained within this bottle can warm the body for quite some time. The energy of the Velox Berries it was made from, has been harnessed within.

When times are tough, and there are no berries or wood to be found, this potion can be a life-saver.</string>
<string name="100187">Velox Berry</string>
<string name="100188">This highly sought after berry has a very unique attribute at its core. While it is not edible for most beings, it does provide a fiery spark when crushed or broken apart.

This can be quite useful for anyone travelling in harsh environments, as the spark can be used on flammable objects to create a fire that can burn far longer and far warmer than natural fires.</string>
<string name="100189">Band of Fire and Frost</string>
<string name="100190">Engraved on the face of this ring are two symbols - one to represent fire and one to represent ice. When these forces work together in harmony, the body is at peace with either of these elements.

It seemingly did its last owner no good, but this balancing power in the hands of either of the ring&apos;s elemental ties could cause a great uprising.

It is for this reason that the previous owner must have &quot;hid&quot; it away and embraced his death rather than giving it up. </string>

Wearing this will have the rods heal you insetad of hurting you. </string>
<string name="100220">Velox Leaf</string>
<string name="100221">This leaf has been foraged from the Velox Fern. The healing properties of these leaves are well-known throughout the land - that is, if the user knows how to extract them properly.

Use: Heals target and regenerates for a short period.

Can also be used on some water sources to dilute the healing properties, making the water more suitable for certain creatures.</string>

<string name="100223">TEMP - Used to morph the PC into different forms.</string>
<string name="100224">Rusted Copper Key</string>
<string name="100225">This is a small, rusted copper key, that is barely holding its shape. Even still, it still looks as if it could open something.</string>
<string name="100226">Sponge Spores</string>
<string name="100227">Sponge Spores are small, living bits of fungus, broken off of Water Mold. When eaten, the Spores die and release their air into the bloodstream of the imbiber.

This release of air only lasts a short while, but during that time, breathing is unnecessary, making travel through harsh, gaseous areas and deep waterways possible. </string>
<string name="100228">Water Mold</string>
<string name="100229">Water Mold is a very rare fungus, found only in remote caverns and swamps.

The Water Mold itself is not very useful, but the hundreds of living Sponge Spores it contains are.

When broken off, the Sponge Spores immediately replace themselves, feeding off the very air we breathe.

These Spores contain pockets of air, and when eaten can be very useful in the right situation.

Use this item to break off some Sponge Spores.</string>
<string name="100230">Scavenger Rat Skull</string>
<string name="100231">The skull of a scavenger rat, surprisingly clean for being devoured by a gutless beast.</string>
<string name="100232">Shroud of Kings</string>
<string name="100233">This is a very ordinary looking cloak.</string>
<string name="100234">The origin of this cloak dates back to the days when King Richard Garrison held power in Cania. It was crafted for him by his servant, a demented and twisted man named Pony Tall.

Pony was not a gifted being, but he managed to sew the cloak in a matter of just a few days. Barely resembling a cloak, Pony Tall had done the best he could and so wrapped the tattered garment up and made way to his master. 

After giving the cloak to the King, Pony was slaughtered for his foul gift, his blood staining and possibly corrupting the garment.

Before tossing the cloak out along with Pony&apos;s body, King Richard put it on to mock his dead, incompetant servant. Upon doing so, he felt better - in all ways - and the cold night air ceased.

It was never known how the cloak came to have the powers it has, but most suspect they actually originated from his dead servant&apos;s blood.</string>
<string name="100235">Sleeping Man Properties</string>
<string name="100236">Hammer of The Glacier</string>
<string name="100237">The dwarven smith Silverblade forged the first of these hammers - purportedly combining a masterfully crafted warhammer with a Girdle of Giant Strength and Gauntlets of Ogre Power - as a gift for his military-bound son. Sadly, the son fell before the hammer&apos;s completion and, in grief, Silverblade took it up himself, dying in valiant battle. Recently, the dwarf Barun reassembled the device, leading to the creation of additional variants by other master smiths.

This is one of those variants.</string>

<string name="100442">You have stumbled upon a pack of winter wolves deep in the wastes of Cania. They seem skittish and frightened but not overtly hostile. They must have a den somewhere nearby and an alpha wolf who leads them.</string>
<string name="100443">The leader of a pack of winter wolves has warned you of a clan of frost giants who live nearby, deep in Cania&apos;s frozen wastes. Some of the wolf pups have been stolen and the pack would no doubt be happy to see their young safely returned.</string>
<string name="100444">You have freed a group of wolf pups being held captive by a nearby giant clan. The pups yipped excitedly as they raced off for the safety of their den. The pack will be relieved by their safe return.</string>
<string name="100445">A group of wolf pups lie slaughtered outside a giant fortress, their blood pooling in the trodden snow. You wondered if their pack will survive this endless winter without them.</string>
<string name="100446">You have killed the leader of a wolf pack deep in the frozen wastes of Cania. Though he was no match for you in the end, he fought with the fury of a cornered animal. Without his strength and guidance, you doubt the remainder of the pack will survive the endless winter.</string>
<string name="100447">A Lost Leader</string>
<string name="100448">In speaking with the Spirits of the Dead who cluster around the Gates of Cania, you have learned that they had a leader who had stood up to Mephistopheles when he first announced that he would be devouring their souls to fuel his undead army on the Prime Material plane. He must have done something dire to her, however, for after the confrontation, she fled to a cave in the center of the city where she now refuses to speak with anyone. The Spirits say she&apos;s becoming one of the Lost, those who have given up hope and are slowly merging with the icy essence of Cania.</string>
<string name="100449">You have found the cave in which the so-called Lost Leader of the Spirits of the Dead has sequestered herself. The cave rests atop a ridge in the city&apos;s heart and though she has sealed the entrance with some form of spell, you were able to hear her sobs echoing from deep within. A strange dog-like creature paced back and forth, whining outside the cave&apos;s entrance.</string>
<string name="100450">You were able to guide the strange dog-like creature you found outside the Lost Leader&apos;s cave to where it needed to be. Once led to the right location, it shot a beam of energy into the city&apos;s icy walls, carving the Spirit Leader&apos;s name into the ice so she could finally become one of the lost. Leaning closer, you were able to read the newly carved name: &quot;Aribeth de Tylmarande.&quot; Curious, you wonder if the magical barrier she had placed at the cave entrance has faded with her passing.</string>
<string name="100451">There, in an ice-sheathed cavern at the heart of the City of Lost Souls, you beheld Aribeth de Tylmarande, the Lost Leader of the Spirits of the Dead. A thick layer of frost clings to her once-lithe frame, her ghostly shape at last made solid by the ice of Cania. Half-burned logs rest in a blackened pit before her, their flames long since quenched by the cavern&apos;s icy chill.</string>
<string name="100452">In an effort to thaw the frozen statue of Aribeth de Tylmarande, the Lost Leader of the Spirits of the Dead, you have expended a single precious velox berry to create a fire. Unfortunately, the paltry flames did little to combat the cavern&apos;s icy chill and were soon extinguished.</string>
<string name="100453">In an effort to thaw the frozen statue of Aribeth de Tylmarande, the Lost Leader of the Spirits of the Dead, you have expended two precious velox berries to create a fire. While the flames were sufficient to warm the confined space of the cavern, they were not enough to penetrate the icy chill that still clings to Aribeth&apos;s ghostly form.</string>
<string name="100454">Thanks to your efforts, Aribeth de Tylmarande, the Lost Leader of the Spirits of the Dead was rescued from the bitter chill of Cania. To your surprise, she expressed her gratitude by drawing her ghostly blade and pressing you to the attack.</string>
<string name="100455">Lost and now found, hostile and now pacified, Aribeth de Tylmarande, the ghostly leader of the Spirits of the Dead has surrendered herself to your will. It seems she has given up on life, even the threadbare shred experienced by the Spirits of the Dead. For your efforts to rescue her from the icy grasp of Cania to go unwasted, you will have to speak with her and convince her that she has something worth living for.</string>
<string name="100456">You have rescued Aribeth de Tylmarande, the ghostly leader of the Spirits of the Dead, from the icy grip of Cania. Thanks to your efforts and persistence, she has dedicated what remains of this threadbare afterlife to the cause of good. With that, you have restored her to her former paladinhood and she has offered to aid you in your quest through hell.</string>

<string name="100458">Arden Swift</string>
<string name="100459">Trapped here much like you, a group of Githzerai Pilgrims have related an interesting tale regarding a certain fellow named Arden Swift who has been traveling with them for the past while. According to the prevailing gossip, Arden got into an argument with the Pilgrims&apos; leader regarding his sacriligious plans to wake the so-called Sleeping Man who the Pilgrims are here to visit. Arden&apos;s currently drowning his sorrows in the Hellbreath Tavern in the city&apos;s southeast corner.</string>
<string name="100460">You have met a jester, Arden Swift, in the Hellbreath Tavern in the city&apos;s southeast corner. He seems somehow associated with the Githzerai Pilgrims currently patronizing the establishment but, given his tiefling heritage and the dirty looks they occasionally slip him over their half-empty tankards, you&apos;re unsure how.</string>
<string name="100461">In talking with Arden Swift, a bard traveling with the Githzerai, he has told you of his rather sacriligious plans to wake their so-called Sleeping Man using a Trumpet of Pandemonium he acquired somewhere in his travels. Due to a quick intervention on the part of the Pilgrims&apos; Sensei, the jester&apos;s plan never came to pass but he still carries the trumpet and it might be possible to convince him to part with it.</string>
<string name="100462">Arden Swift, patron of the Hellbreath Tavern and itinerant jester currently taveling with the entourage of Githzerai Pilgrims, has placed his beloved Trumpet of Pandemonium as a prize for an upcoming card game. He had intended to used the trumpet to wake the so-called Sleeping Man but had been caught red-handed by the Pilgrims&apos; Sensei before he could sound its blast. If you&apos;re interested in acquiring it for yourself, you merely have to place your ante on the table and guess the card he&apos;s holding in five questions or less. You&apos;re not entirely sure if you can trust him but it might be worth a try.</string>
<string name="100463">With some quick thinking and a good eye, you were able to win Arden Swift&apos;s Trumpet of Pandemonium in a game of cards. Although he cheated regularly throughout the actual game, he was good on his word and handed over the trumpet as soon as you won. You suspect he was more interested in the antes you put in, as he&apos;s probably racked up a hefty tab with the rather evil-looking bartender.</string>
<string name="100464">In a visit to the Hellbreath Tavern, you managed to pickpocket a trumpet from the jester Arden Swift. It looks dented and old. Though its sound quality probably leaves something to be desired, you&apos;re pretty sure it&apos;s going to be loud.</string>
<string name="100465">In a visit to the Hellbreath Tavern, you managed to pick a fight with the jester Arden Swift. Rummaging through his pack when it was all done, you found a strange-looking trumpet, dented and old. Though its sound quality probably leaves something to be desired, you&apos;re pretty sure it&apos;s going to be loud.</string>
<string name="100466">Using the Trumpet of Pandemonium you acquired from Arden Swift, you were able to do the unthinkable: wake the Sleeping Man...</string>
<string name="100467">Crystals in the Ice</string>
<string name="100468">Peering into an ice crystal that that thrust itself up from Cania&apos;s glacial floor, you saw a vision of Mephistopheles&apos; progress in the Prime Material Plane. It appears that he has discovered the carnage left behind by the Seer&apos;s defeat. As he passed through the rotting carcasses, they rose in his wake, a ghostly army bound to do his bidding...</string>
<string name="100469">Peering into an ice crystal that that thrust itself up from Cania&apos;s glacial floor, you saw a vision of Mephistopheles&apos; progress in the Prime Material Plane. It appears that, together with his newly created army, he is slowly winding his way to the surface, sowing destruction in his wake. Mephistopheles seems to feed off the ruin he is causing. With every moment, he grows stronger...</string>
<string name="100470">Peering into an ice crystal that that thrust itself up from Cania&apos;s glacial floor, you saw a vision of Mephistopheles&apos; progress in the Prime Material Plane. It appears that he has made his way to the surface, emerging in the Yawning Portal. Many of the patrons were incinerated by his deadly gaze, though you don&apos;t yet know the fate of Durnan and his family. Even so, time grows short and the city of Waterdeep is in great peril.</string>
<string name="100471">Escape from the Hells</string>
<string name="100472">The familiar blackness of death enveloped you but the blood-red eyes of your betrayer, Mephistopheles, lingered to the end. And then you woke to find your eyes reflected in the Gatekeeper&apos;s shimmering skin. Everything seems strangely familiar...</string>
<string name="100473">The archdevil Mephistopheles has played you for a fool. He has commanded your mysterious ally, the Gatekeeper, to bar your return to Waterdeep on the Prime Material plane, trapping you instead in some hellish world called Cania. The Gatekeeper seems sympathetic to your plight but claims he has no choice but to obey for Mephistopheles has commanded him by his True Name. Such names seem to have a strange power in this place and it seems the only way to break Mephistopheles&apos; prohibition will be learn the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name for yourself.</string>
<string name="100474">Your search for the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name has turned up its first clue: one of the citizens of this strange city claims that an old and venerable creature known as the Sleeping Man might have the information your looking for. He sleeps in the city&apos;s northwest quarter and apparently has done so for longer than anyone can remember. Hopefully, with his help, you&apos;ll be able to return home to Waterdeep and take your vengeance on the archdevil Mephistopheles.</string>
<string name="100475">The Sleeping Man was not as helpful in your quest for the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name as you had hoped. You did learn, however, of an ancient race called the Knowers that populated Cania before it was colonized by the legions of hell. One of them, the Knower of Names, was banished by Mephistopheles to an unknown prison deep in Cania&apos;s frozen wastelands. Unable to find the Knower of Names, the Sleeping Man instead sought out her sister, the Knower of Places, with the help of a magical ring that that served as his guide through Cania&apos;s wastes. If you can repeat his feat, perhaps she will be able to help you find her sister&apos;s hidden prison. The Sleeping Man broke the ring into three parts and hid it in a guarded room below his chambers. It seems your journey will begin there.</string>
<string name="100476">The Sleeping Man&apos;s ring that will lead you to the Knower of Places and hopefully to the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name is a strange artifact indeed. When you slip it onto your finger, it is as if you can see into another sort of space, another dimension. Some things are present there that are not present in the real world and some things you would expect to find have disappeared. One thing you are grateful to see, however, are a line of glowing arrows that will hopefully chart a safe course through Cania&apos;s vast wastelands. You feel the stirrings of hope in your chest for the first time since Mephistopheles banished you to this frozen place.</string>
<string name="100477">Tormented by her loneliness, the Knower of Places has agreed to help you on your quest for the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name. She has woven a new magic into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ring, allowing it to guide you to her sister, the Knower of Names, just as it guided you to her. She left you with a cryptic parting message that will hopefully aid you when you reach her sister&apos;s icy prison: &quot;You are not the first to seek the prison and not the first to find it. At 7 o&apos;clock a hole was dug and a fearsome devil freed. If he&apos;d have come but sixteen hours prior, he&apos;d have uncovered what you need.&quot; Hopefully you&apos;ll be able to compel the Gatekeeper to return you to Waterdeep before Mephistopheles has destroyed your home forever.</string>
<string name="100478">At long last you have learned the True Name of the Gatekeeper: Hecugoth the Abandoned. You say it aloud a few times, rolling it around on your tongue. It has sad sound to it but you are eager to put it to use. It&apos;s your ticket out of here, back to Waterdeep and the Prime Material or whatever still remains of them after the chaos that Mephistopheles has sown in your absence. The Relic of the Reaper will take you back to the Gates of Cania but you pause to consider whether you have any pressing tasks you wish to accomplish on this plane before you go. Facing Mephistopheles won&apos;t be easy and you&apos;d better have made your peace with the world.</string>
<string name="100479">Commanded by his True Name, the Gatekeeper has opened a Planar Gate that will lead you back home to Waterdeep. Mephistopheles won&apos;t be expecting you so you&apos;ll have to take advantage of whatever element of surprise you have. It will pay to be well-prepared before you step through that gate.</string>
<string name="100480">Waterdeep is in shambles and your sudden appearance has brought scant hope to Durnan and the handful of citizens and soldiers still trying to resist Mephistopheles&apos; forces. It&apos;s clear they&apos;re fighting a war of movement, winning what battles they can and surrendering ground whenever Mephistopheles himself makes an appearance. Though you dared not say it in their presence, you doubt their ragtag resistance will survive much longer without your assistance. This time, when Durnan retreats from Mephistopheles&apos; advance, you intend to be waiting for him.</string>
<string name="100481">Amidst the chaos of battle and shattered streets, Durnan and his brave but dwindling army retreated from Mephistopheles&apos; approach. The arch-devil towers over the city&apos;s architecture, reducing it to rubble with a gaze. There, in the scattered remnants of the proudest city of the Prime Material, you prepare to make your stand against the devil&apos;s onslaught...</string>
<string name="100482">And with that, Mephistopheles is defeated. Dark clouds linger in the graying sky above, the sounds of battle slowly growing still in the distance. Weary yet triumphant, you stop to ponder the significance of your victory...</string>
<string name="100483">Pilgrims of the Sleeping Man</string>
<string name="100484">According to rumor, the City of Lost Souls is a holy site for a group of planar Pilgrims. The bulk of them are said to be congregating in and around the Hellbreath Tavern in the southeast corner of town.</string>
<string name="100485">A group of disconsolate Pilgrims are trapped in Cania much like you. Their leader, the Sensei, led them here to worship at the feet of a figure they refer to as the Sleeping Man. She can be found in the Temple in the city&apos;s northwest corner.</string>
<string name="100486">Dharvana, the Githzerai Sensei, insists that you must learn and recite the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man before she will let you into the temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum to see him. She listed the Five-Fold Mysteries as follows: Who is he? From where did he come? Why did he leave? Who did he seek? What was the answer?</string>

<string name="100491">Dharvana, the Githzerai Sensei, insists that you must learn and recite the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man before she will let you into the temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum to see him. She listed the Five-Fold Mysteries as follows: Who is he? From where did he come? Why did he leave? Who did he seek? What was the answer?

You have now learned the answer to all five of those Mysteries, should you wish to recite them before the Sensei.</string>
<string name="100492">While exploring the Temple of the Sleeping Man in the city&apos;s northwest corner, you&apos;ve managed to pick the lock on one of the doors. It leads to the Inner Sanctum where the temple&apos;s namesake is said to rest.</string>
<string name="100493">In the holy confines of the Temple of the Sleeping Man, you have successfully recited his Five-Fold Mysteries before the Sensei Dharvana. Your reward is a crystalline amulet that she says will help you focus your thoughts on the dreams of the Sleeping Man, provided you have any latent psionic powers. The door into the temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum is now unlocked to you.</string>
<string name="100494">Defiling the holy confines of the Temple of the Sleeping Man, you have assassinated its leader, the Sensei Dharvana. Looting through her bloodied corpse, you found an interesting crystalline amulet about her neck. You pocket it surreptitiously, eager to explore the remainder of the temple.</string>
<string name="100495">There, in the temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum, with the winged form of the Sleeping Man prostrate before you, you tried in vain to make use of the Sensei&apos;s amulet. The crystal glowed a murky green when in his presence and you could feel its growing hum but you somehow lacked the wisdom to tap into its psionic powers. </string>
<string name="100496">There, in the temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum, with the winged form of the Sleeping Man prostrate before you, you made use of the Sensei&apos;s amulet. The crystal glowed a murky green when in his presence and you could feel its growing hum and then, all at once, you found yourself swept up within his dreams. </string>
<string name="100497">There, in the temple&apos;s dim green light, the Sensei&apos;s amulet clasped about your neck, you dreamed the dreams of the Sleeping Man. Mephistopheles was there and a woman called the Knower of Names, whom he banished. And an older woman, the Knower of Places, whom the Sleeping Man had visited in search of his one true love. Throughout his quest, he was somehow guided by a ring that now lies, buried and guarded, in a chamber below him. If you hope to find the Knowers, you will need that ring upon your finger...</string>
<string name="100498">There, in the temple&apos;s dim green light, you have done the unthinkable and woken the Sleeping Man. Hopefully he will be able to tell you the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name.</string>
<string name="100499">In waking the Sleeping Man, you unleashed the Sensei&apos;s fury. Driven mad with rage, she attacked and you had no choice but to defend yourself. Now she lies dead at the feet of the Sleeping Man who she worshiped. About her neck is a crystalline amulet. You snap it off, casually pocketing it as you have so many other treasures taken from the bodies of the dead.</string>
<string name="100500">The Sleeping Man knows many things but, sadly, the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name is not one of them. Even so, he tells of a race of creatures called the Knowers who once called Cania home. One of them, the Knower of Names was banished by Mephistopheles long ago while the other, the Knower of Places, lives in hiding deep in Cania&apos;s frozen wastelands. His own quest had brought him the latter&apos;s hidden lair, long ago, a feat made possible only with the aid of an enchanted ring. The ring lies in a chamber under the temple, guarded and kept safe all these many years. He has invited you to make use of the ring, provided you can claim it, and wishes you well on your journey.</string>
<string name="100501">The Devils&apos; Quarry</string>
<string name="100502">You&apos;ve heard mention of some form of quarry being operated by the devils in the City of Lost Souls. A fiend by the name of Gru&apos;ul apparently serves as the Quarry Boss.</string>
<string name="100503">The dented metal walls of the Quarry Office on the east side of town reverberate with the rage of the Quarry Boss, Gru&apos;ul. Apparently Grinder #5, down in the quarry proper, is malfunctioning. As Gru&apos;ul runs one of the only stores in town and he refuses to do business until the Grinder is back in operation, it might be in your interest to investigate.</string>
<string name="100504">Down in the ice quarry on the eastern edge of the City of Lost Souls, Lazy the Imp decided to stick his hand into Grinder #5 in order to gain a much-needed rest. You have succeeded in taking the Grinder apart, thereby freeing Lazy, but Gru&apos;ul, the Quarry Boss, still won&apos;t do business with anyone until that Grinder is back in operation.</string>
<string name="100505">Down in the ice quarry on the eastern edge of the City of Lost Souls, Lazy the Imp decided to stick his hand into Grinder #5 in order to gain a much-needed rest. You have succeeded in taking the Grinder apart, thereby freeing Lazy, but have been unable to put it back together again. You&apos;re not entirely sure how you&apos;re going to break the news to Gru&apos;ul, the Quarry Boss, but you&apos;re going to have to remedy the problem somehow if you expect to do any business with him in the future.</string>

You have succeeded in taking the Grinder apart, thereby freeing Lazy, but have been unable to put it back together again. Gru&apos;ul, the Quarry Boss, has put the 50,000 gp repair price squarely on your shoulders and, sadly, if you expect to do any business with him, you&apos;re going to have to pay up.</string>

Gru&apos;ul, the Quarry Boss, has put the 30,000 gp repair price squarely on your shoulders and, sadly, if you expect to do any business with him, you&apos;re going to have to pay up.</string>
<string name="100508">Down in the ice quarry on the eastern edge of the City of Lost Souls, Lazy the Imp decided to stick his hand into Grinder #5 in order to gain a much-needed rest. Luckily you have a knack with machines and were able to take the Grinder apart, free Lazy, and then put it back together once all was said and done. Gru&apos;ul, the Quarry Boss, should be happy to hear that you got it working again.</string>
<string name="100509">Down in the ice quarry on the eastern edge of the City of Lost Souls, Lazy the Imp decided to stick his hand into Grinder #5 in order to gain a much-needed rest. Deciding that his rest should be permanent, you chose to feed him through the Grinder. Gru&apos;ul, the Quarry Boss, should be happy to hear that everything is back in fine working condition.</string>
<string name="100510">Down in the ice quarry on the eastern edge of the City of Lost Souls, Lazy the Imp decided to stick his hand into Grinder #5 in order to gain a much-needed rest. Somehow you managed to convince Gru&apos;ul, the Quarry Boss, to declare a holiday for his laborers, thereby improving their quality of life. With the issue now addressed, you&apos;ll hopefully be able to do some actual business with the otherwise preoccupied Quarry Boss.</string>
<string name="100511">Thanks to your assistance, Gru&apos;ul the Quarry Boss has finally agreed to do business with you. If you ever need supplies, you can return to his store in the Quarry Office on the east side of town.</string>
<string name="100512">The Fifth-Fold Mystery of the Sleeping Man</string>
<string name="100513">Before Sensei Dharvana will let you enter her temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum to see the Sleeping Man, she wants you to learn and recite his Five-Fold Mysteries. The Fifth-Fold Mystery of the Sleeping Man is &quot;What was the answer?&quot;</string>

<string name="100524">The Gargoyle Statues</string>
<string name="100525">You can feel yourself getting closer to the hidden lair of the Knower of Places. In a secret chamber deep in the icy wastes of Cania, you have found the statue of a gargoyle. Etched along its base are the words &quot;Stone to stone the stone turns; Lightning to lightning, the ligtning fades.&quot;</string>
<string name="100526">A series of chambers run deep beneath the ice of Cania, leading to what you hope will be the hidden lair of the Knower of Places. Various gargoyle statues guard the way. You have just encountered another that bears a strange inscription: &quot;What one cannot hear, others cannot see.&quot;</string>
<string name="100527">A series of chambers run deep beneath the ice of Cania, leading to what you hope will be the hidden lair of the Knower of Places. Various gargoyle statues guard the way. A recent one bore a strange inscription that read &quot;What one cannot hear, others cannot see.&quot; You have just discovered a new statue. While it bears no inscription, it seems to be missing its ears.</string>
<string name="100528">A series of chambers run deep beneath the ice of Cania, leading to what you hope will be the hidden lair of the Knower of Places. Various gargoyle statues guard the way. The most recent gargoyle had been missing its ears. When you found and replaced them, however, the statue opened its mouth, revealing a small switch.</string>
<string name="100529">A series of chambers run deep beneath the ice of Cania, leading to what you hope will be the hidden lair of the Knower of Places. Various puzzles have stood in your way but now a portal has appeared, leading into a third chamber that lies beyond. </string>
<string name="100530">You can feel yourself getting closer to the hidden lair of the Knower of Places. In a secret chamber deep in the icy wastes of Cania, you caused three gargoyle statues to fire lightning at a magically warded door. With that, the warding faded, revealing a second chamber beyond.</string>
<string name="100531">A series of chambers run deep beneath the ice of Cania, leading to what you hope will be the hidden lair of the Knower of Places. Various gargoyle statues guard the way. The most recent gargoyle had been missing its ears. When you found and replaced them, however, the statue opened its mouth, revealing a small switch. When you pressed the switch, you heard three different gongs sound throughout the chamber in what seemed to be a very particular order. It seems that whoever created the statues expects you to find the gongs and play back the sequence.</string>
<string name="100532">The Mimic</string>
<string name="100533">A bizarre creature, shaped like a common treasure chest but wielding some strange grappling device, has stolen the clothes right off your back before escaping to safety. Cold, naked, and embarrassed, you vow to make the pesky little creature pay.</string>
<string name="100534">A bizarre creature, shaped like a common treasure chest but wielding some strange grappling device, has stolen armor right out of your pack before escaping to safety. Cold, naked, and embarrassed, you vow to make the pesky little creature pay.</string>
<string name="100535">A bizarre creature, shaped like a common treasure chest but wielding some strange grappling device, has stolen some of your possessions right out of your pack before escaping to safety. Cold, naked, and embarrassed, you vow to make the pesky little creature pay.</string>
<string name="100536">The pesky Mimic is dead at last and your stolen belongings returned. What is more, you have also recovered the strange grappling device it had been using to navigate the chambers. Judging by what the Mimic had been capable of, you surmise that you should be able to use it to pull yourself to certain objects or pull them to you. You have a sneaking suspicion that you&apos;ll be able to find other less conventional uses for it as well. Regardless, it appears that you simply need to be facing in the general direction of the object you intend to interact with when the grappling hand is activated.</string>
<string name="100537">The Prisoner</string>
<string name="100538">A magical platform glows high above you, a human form dimly visible upon it. It almost appears that the platform was intended as some form of prison, forever separating the mysterious figure from the world below. Perhaps there is a way to lower the platform and investigate further.</string>
<string name="100539">Your efforts to lower the magical prison have met with mixed success. While it didn&apos;t actually lower, per se, you were able to dissolve it. Unfortunately for the prisoner it held aloft, the results of your interference were rather catastrophic. If he wasn&apos;t already dead before the platform dissolved, he is now. Still, as the prisoner hit the ground, you heard a small ringing sound echo off the stone walls, suggesting that something else must have fallen with him.</string>
<string name="100540">Mould grows on the dessicated entrails of the fallen prisoner, suggesting that he was indeed dead long before your interventions. His remains are cloaked in the tangled remnants of a motheaten robe, its arcane lettering having long since faded beneath the dust. There, gleaming amidst his shriveled intestines, a golden ring pokes through the tatters of a tiny bag. It seems that the prisoner had valued it enough to swallow it and thereby hide it from his unknown captors.</string>
<string name="100541">The Scrivener</string>
<string name="100542">The Spirits of the Dead who congregate around the Gates of Cania speak of a creature called the Scrivener who bears the horrible responsibility of carving the names of Lost Spirits into the city&apos;s icy walls.</string>
<string name="100543">You have found a small dog-like beast called the Scrivener whining at the entrance to a cave at the heart of town. Some magical force blocks the entrance, however, leaving both of you out in the proverbial cold.</string>
<string name="100544">It seems you have found a friend in a small dog-like creature called the Scrivener. It speaks in the form of word pictures that it projects psionically into the air just above its head. It seems to want you to lead it somewhere but you&apos;re having trouble determining where it wants to go. It keeps projecting the following sequence of images to you: A sturdy oak, full with leaves, then a boy held in his father&apos;s arms. This second image seems to be focused on the boy rather than the father. </string>
<string name="100545">It seems you have found a friend in a small dog-like creature called the Scrivener. It speaks in the form of word pictures that it projects psionically into the air just above its head. It also seems to navigate the town by way of a series of stone pillars, etched with words. You have already led it to the first of these, called &apos;Treason&apos; but now it wishes to be taken to another. It keeps projecting the following sequence of images to you: A man on his deathbed, then two others standing side by side, then a fourth man&apos;s leg, bared between his ankle-high boots and knee-length breeches.</string>
<string name="100546">It seems you have found a friend in a small dog-like creature called the Scrivener. It speaks in the form of word pictures that it projects psionically into the air just above its head. It also seems to navigate the town by way of a series of stone pillars, etched with words. You have already led it to two of these, called &apos;Treason&apos; and &apos;Dimension,&apos; but now it wishes to be taken to a third. It keeps projecting the following sequence of images to you: A traveler&apos;s resting house, a shark cutting through the water, a close-up of a winking face, and steam rising from a cup and saucer.</string>
<string name="100547">Your strange little pet, the Scrivener, at last seems done with its task. When you led it to the pillar called &quot;Infinity,&quot; it found its way to a nearby section of wall and began to carve a name into the ice. When you took a closer look, you saw that the name read &quot;Aribeth de Tylmarande.&quot; With that, the Scrivener wandered off, content that its task was complete.</string>
<string name="100548">The Second-Fold Mystery of the Sleeping Man</string>
<string name="100549">Before Sensei Dharvana will let you enter her temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum to see the Sleeping Man, she wants you to learn and recite his Five-Fold Mysteries. The Second-Fold Mystery of the Sleeping Man is &quot;From where did he come?&quot;</string>

You have learned the Mystery from the countless devils who toil away in the quarry. They say he comes from a plane called Elysium.</string>
<string name="100551">Before Sensei Dharvana will let you enter her temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum to see the Sleeping Man, she wants you to learn and recite his Five-Fold Mysteries. The Second-Fold Mystery of the Sleeping Man is &quot;From where did he come?&quot;

You have learned the Mystery from the Scrivener who carves the names of the Lost into the ice. If you understood him correctly, it seems the Sleeping Man comes from someplace called Elysium.</string>
<string name="100552">The Sensei&apos;s Amulet</string>
<string name="100553">As you peer at the Sensei&apos;s amulet, you notice that the light seems to play strangely off its crystalline structure. Not quite sure what to make of this strange behavior, you return it to your pack for later investigation.</string>
<string name="100554">In a fortunate twist of fate, the Sensei&apos;s amulet has revealed its true nature. By carefully controlling the angle at which the light strikes its crystalline structure, you find that the resulting refraction has the unexpected ability to modify your body&apos;s form. You file the knowledge away for future reference. From here on in, you decide to be more a little more mindful of your magic items, that they don&apos;t trigger again so unexpectedly.</string>

<string name="100780">Odd Pile of Rocks</string>
<string name="100781">This pile of rocks looks oddly out of place - like it has been placed here by hand.</string>
<string name="100782">&quot;Be careful what you say here. There is a tension in Lith My&apos;athar between the followers of the Seer and the drow of House Maeviir.&quot;</string>
<string name="100783">&quot;Be on your guard. We are venturing into the true depths of the Underdark now.&quot;</string>
<string name="100784">&quot;The darkness here is often filled with unseen dangers. Watch the shadows carefully.&quot;</string>
<string name="100785">&quot;The Valsharess has many allies, but at the first sign of weakness they will turn on her. This is the way of the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="100786">&quot;Those who live on Toril&apos;s surface fear the drow, but far worse things than my people exist down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="100787">&quot;The Underdark has no seasons; no cycle of night and day. I find the constant darkness... comforting.&quot;</string>
<string name="100788">&quot;In the Underdark, you are either hunter or prey. Often you become the latter when you least expect it.&quot;</string>
<string name="100789">&quot;An imposing fortress, to say the least. I doubt whoever&apos;s inside will be happy to see us.&quot;</string>
<string name="100790">&quot;There is something foul in this place; it smells of ancient evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="100791">&quot;I see the drow are not the only ones who like to throw their slaves into the pits to do battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="100792">&quot;Can you feel it? A presence, thrumming against the walls of the skull. Guard your thoughts carefully.&quot;</string>
<string name="100793">&quot;The Eye Tyrant must be close... and I doubt she will be unguarded.&quot;</string>
<string name="100794">&quot;The stench of smoke and ash in this place is enough to make one gag!&quot;</string>
<string name="100795">&quot;Be careful of this woman. I suspect she is more than she appears.&quot;</string>
<string name="100796">&quot;No doubt many traps and monsters lay ahead... typical for any wizard&apos;s tower.&quot;</string>
<string name="100797">&quot;A jester without an audience... does nothing in this town make sense?&quot;</string>
<string name="100798">&quot;The town is gone! Imagine the power necessary to make a whole town disappear!&quot;</string>
<string name="100799">&quot;There are duergar nearby. The thick stink of their sweat fills the air.&quot;</string>
<string name="100800">&quot;These golems are unlike any constructs I have seen before!&quot;</string>
<string name="100801">&quot;Be careful. Wizards who seek to prolong their life often turn themselves into powerful undead.&quot;</string>
<string name="100802">&quot;The chill here is enough to freeze your very soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="100803">&quot;You can feel the heat of the fire, even from here. Let&apos;s move closer and warm ourselves.&quot;</string>
<string name="100804">&quot;I didn&apos;t expect it to be so warm in here.&quot;</string>
<string name="100805">&quot;Look there - a woman, frozen in ice. No, wait... I think she&apos;s an elf.&quot;</string>
<string name="100806">&quot;A jester in the Hells? Well, I suppose if anyone needs to be amused it&apos;s the souls trapped here.&quot;</string>
<string name="100807">&quot;A mimic... but it doesn&apos;t seem to be attacking. It only seems interested in devouring gems.&quot;</string>
<string name="100808">&quot;I don&apos;t see a bridge. We&apos;ll have to find some other way to cross this river of fire.&quot;</string>
<string name="100809">&quot;A door made of... lightning?This looks like a trap - or a test. These levers must be the key.&quot;</string>
<string name="100810">&quot;The Valsharess won&apos;t stop until she has conquered every land on the face of Toril.&quot;</string>
<string name="100811">&quot;The Seer believes you will save us all from the Valsharess. I pray she is right.&quot;</string>
<string name="100812">&quot;The Valsharess will send her assassins after us, but I know all their tricks.&quot;</string>
<string name="100813">&quot;The creatures of the Underdark can strike without warning... as can I.&quot;</string>
<string name="100814">&quot;The Seer has seen the future if we fail. The Valsharess will crush all of Toril beneath her boot heel.&quot;</string>
<string name="100815">&quot;We drow are unwelcome on Toril&apos;s surface. The Seer told me that even the followers of Eilistraee face persecution and prejudice.&quot;</string>
<string name="100816">&quot;Blood is easily wiped from a dagger&apos;s edge, but it is not so easily washed from your hands.&quot;</string>
<string name="100817">&quot;I rarely used poison on my victims; I preferred the quick cut of a blade or the blast of my magic. It seemed more clean, more pure.&quot;</string>
<string name="100818">&quot;I was taught to keep my blades sharp and a spell always at the ready. Old habits die hard.&quot;</string>
<string name="100819">&quot;A wise mage knows that *when* a spell is cast is almost as important as *which* spell is cast. Preparation is often the key to battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="100820">&quot;As an assassin, I was trained to kill. Those skills should serve us well in this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="100821">&quot;The Seer says the surface of Toril is beautiful. One day I hope to see it for myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="100822">&quot;Keep a sharp eye and a sharp blade. That was my motto when I was an assassin, and it serves us well enough now.&quot;</string>
<string name="100823">&quot;Eilistraee is the goddess of moonlight. One day I hope to visit the surface of Toril and see the moon for myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="100824">&quot;Sarn; walk carefully. Footsteps echo here, they can alert others to our presence.&quot;</string>
<string name="100825">&quot;Vith usstan! My backpack is a mess! My spell components are all mixed up. *sigh* I&apos;ll have to sort them out next time we stop.&quot;</string>
<string name="100826">&quot;Hold a second. I see something I can use as a component in one of my spells... there. We can continue now.&quot;</string>
<string name="100827">&quot;If you want me to cast one of my spells before a battle, just let me know.&quot;</string>
<string name="100828">&quot;I was taught one must conquer to survive; kill or be killed. That lesson holds true for us now.&quot;</string>
<string name="100829">&quot;*sigh* I fear there is much killing still ahead, and my heart is already stained with the blood of a thousand murders.&quot;</string>
<string name="100830">&quot;I killed my first victim when I was only a girl; a male slave who displeased me. I never even knew his name. I wonder why I&apos;m thinking of him now?&quot;</string>
<string name="100831">&quot;I always looked into the eyes of my victims as they died. Now those eyes are burned into my mind, and I can&apos;t stop thinking about them.&quot;</string>
<string name="100832">&quot;An assassin needs to be invisible, even in plain sight. It was a lesson I mastered quickly... thanks in part to my magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="100833">&quot;Move with care. The element of surprise can win a battle; we must be careful not to give ourselves away.&quot;</string>
<string name="100834">&quot;Everywhere I look I see places we could be ambushed. We are vulnerable here, we must be prepared for anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="100835">&quot;Part of me feels I belong here; a doomed soul condemned to this Hell.&quot;</string>
<string name="100836">&quot;I feel pity for those trapped here. Neither alive nor dead, with no real hope of escape.&quot;</string>
<string name="100837">&quot;The Valsharess is defeated, but now we have unleashed an even greater evil on Toril.&quot;</string>
<string name="100838">&quot;Mephistopheles played us for fools! We have to find a way to stop him. We have to!&quot;</string>
<string name="100839">&quot;As bad as the drow may be, the surface of Toril will fare much worse under the rule of a devil!&quot;</string>
<string name="100840">&lt;DEATH SCREAM AS HER SOUL IS RIPPED APART&gt;</string>
<string name="100841">&quot;You&apos;re going to want to speak to the Seer. Trust me, she can explain everything.&quot;</string>
<string name="100842">&quot;So now you know everything... the Valsharess, who we are, why we&apos;re here, all of it. What we&apos;re doing here is very important.&quot;</string>
<string name="100843">&quot;Is there something else you need from me, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="100844">&quot;Of course, Seer.&quot; Nathyrra bows her head in acceptance, then steps forward and begins to speak.</string>
<string name="100845">&quot;The drow have ever been ruled by the Matron Mothers who head the great houses. The Valsharess was once one of these: ruthless and powerful in her art, but no more so than any other Matron Mother.&quot;</string>
<string name="100846">&quot;But then Lolth, the Queen of Spiders and goddess of the drow, disappeared... and drow society was thrown into utter chaos. The Valsharess seized on this opportunity.&quot;</string>
<string name="100847">&quot;Once the Underdark is hers, she will turn her attention once more to the surface. She believes herself a Queen... a Valsharess, by our tongue... and her ambition knows no end.&quot;</string>
<string name="100848">&quot;The priestesses of Lolth are powerless before her, and the great drow houses have bent knee, just as many of the other Underdark races have been intimidated into joining her cause.&quot;</string>
<string name="100849">&quot;You stopped her plans in Undermountain for now, but she&apos;ll find another way. It won&apos;t be long. At best, you&apos;ve bought us some breathing time.&quot;</string>
<string name="100850">&quot;Not long ago, the devil she had enslaved warned the Valsharess that there was one who could defeat her. She ordered an augury and was presented with an image of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="100851">&quot;I... didn&apos;t trust you. I still do not. For all the fact that the Seer has foreseen your coming, that does not mean that we know anything about you. I had to be cautious.&quot;</string>
<string name="100852">&quot;Plus I had no idea Halaster would place a geas on you or send us down here. My goal was to stop the Valsharess in Undermountain first, and all other considerations came afterward.&quot;</string>
<string name="100853">Eilistraee guide my hand!</string>
<string name="100854">For the Seer!</string>
<string name="100855">You shall fall!</string>
<string name="100856">Your life is forfeit!</string>
<string name="100857">Quickly! My wounds need healing!</string>

<string name="100863">Mir! Hold. Wait a moment.</string>
<string name="100864">No, I must not fall!</string>
<string name="100865">The shadows&#8230; closing in&#8230;</string>
<string name="100866">Poison&#8230; but what kind?</string>
<string name="100867">My magic has failed!</string>
<string name="100868">My attacks are useless!</string>
<string name="100869">Follow me.</string>
<string name="100870">Over here. Look at this.</string>
<string name="100871">We should stay close now.</string>
<string name="100872">Step aside so I may pass.</string>
<string name="100873">No lock can thwart me!</string>
<string name="100874">We should examine this place carefully.</string>
<string name="100875">I will become one with the shadows.</string>
<string name="100876">Of course.</string>
<string name="100877">I cannot.</string>
<string name="100878">The task is complete.</string>
<string name="100879">If you load me down with equipment, I won&apos;t be of much use to you.</string>
<string name="100880">Yes?</string>
<string name="100881">Greetings.</string>
<string name="100882">Yes.</string>
<string name="100883">No.</string>
<string name="100884">Stop! Hold a moment.</string>
<string name="100885">We should rest and recuperate.</string>
<string name="100886">This boredom will dull our senses.</string>
<string name="100887">Farewell.</string>
<string name="100888">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="100889">Vith Usstan!</string>
<string name="100890">Well done.</string>
<string name="100891">I wish to speak with you.</string>
<string name="100892">An excellent idea.</string>
<string name="100893">I think this may be a mistake&#8230;</string>
<string name="100894">Only a fool dares to cross me!</string>
<string name="100895">You are not allowed to look at this creature&apos;s inventory.</string>
<string name="100896">&quot;This isn&apos;t the time or the place... my love.&quot; It&apos;s obvious she is all but choking on the word.</string>
<string name="100897">&quot;Mephistopheles will destroy all of Waterdeep if we do not stop him. There is no time for conversation.&quot;</string>
<string name="100898">&quot;I suppose we can spare a few moments away from our quest to speak. What do you want to talk about?&quot;</string>
<string name="100899">&quot;I just wanted you to know that I&apos;m starting to understand why the Valsharess is afraid of you... and why the Seer has so much faith in you.&quot;</string>
<string name="100900">&quot;When all this is over, what do you plan to do next? I mean... you will go back to the surface, won&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="100901">Nathyrra gives you a soft smile. &quot;Now you&apos;re just teasing me. Please, this is serious.&quot;</string>
<string name="100902">The drow seems momentarily taken aback by your offer, then quickly recovers. &quot;You are joking, of course. But my question was a serious one.&quot;</string>
<string name="100903">&quot;I have never been to the surface of Toril, though I have heard the Seer and some of the others speak of it. Tell me... what is it like?&quot;</string>
<string name="100904">&quot;Yes, I imagine you are eager to break the geas that has bound you to our cause. But after that, you won&apos;t have any reason to remain down here. No doubt you will go back to the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="100905">&quot;This may seem strange, considering where we are. But I don&apos;t know if we&apos;ll ever get out of here, and I want you to know something in case... well, just in case.&quot;</string>
<string name="100906">&quot;Yes, out with it. That&apos;s probably the best way.&quot;</string>
<string name="100907">&quot;We haven&apos;t known each other very long. But we&apos;ve been through a lot together and I feel very... I feel very close to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="100908">She gives you an exasperated look. &quot;Please, I&apos;m trying to be serious.&quot;</string>
<string name="100909">She casts a dubious glance at the inhospitable terrain around you. &quot;This isn&apos;t really what I&apos;d call romantic. Please, just listen. I&apos;m trying to explain how I feel about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="100910">&quot;I&apos;ve known many males in my life, but none of them ever meant anything to me. I&apos;ve always looked down on them as slaves or servants. I suppose that&apos;s to be expected, considering drow society.&quot;</string>
<string name="100911">&quot;But you&apos;ve changed all that. You&apos;re different. When I see you, I see an equal. Someone I respect. Someone I... someone I...&quot;</string>
<string name="100912">She gasps at the word, then laughs lightly at her own reaction. &quot;Yes. That&apos;s the word. Love. I love you.&quot;</string>
<string name="100913">&quot;I... I still want to serve Eilistraee, of course. But I want to do it with you by my side. I don&apos;t know how it will work out, but I&apos;m sure it will. That is, if you feel the same way about me.&quot;</string>
<string name="100914">&quot;I&apos;m... I&apos;m glad. Part of me was afraid that you might not share my feelings. But to know that you love me too...&quot; she trails off, a satisfied smile on her face.</string>
<string name="100915">&quot;I don&apos;t know. I suppose we should try and find a way out of this ice-bound realm. I know it will all work out, somehow. I have faith in you, my love. Wherever you lead, I will follow.&quot;</string>
<string name="100916">&quot;You&apos;re right, of course. But I&apos;m confident it will all work out, somehow. I have faith in you, my love. Wherever you lead, I will follow.&quot;</string>
<string name="100917">Nathyrra recoils as if she&apos;s been slapped, her eyes open wide in shock, then quickly recovers. &quot;I... I see. Well, forgive me, then. I thought there was something more between us.&quot;</string>
<string name="100918">&quot;I see now it was wrong. Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t bring this up again. Let&apos;s... let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="100919">&quot;I don&apos;t like this place. It is empty and bleak and cold. So very, very cold.&quot;</string>
<string name="100920">&quot;Now that we are about to leave this wretched plane behind us forever, I am not so sure I was ever meant to return to our own world.&quot;</string>
<string name="100921">She suddenly rubs her arms as if cold, sighing heavily. &quot;This is a plane of lost souls; maybe I belong here. I feel like I am caught between my past and my future, trapped without a purpose or direction.&quot;</string>
<string name="100922">&quot;Eilistraee has shown me the path I must walk, but I cannot do so without looking back at every step and seeing what I have left behind.&quot;</string>
<string name="100923">She gives you a sad smile. &quot;I know you will, my love. But I&apos;m not sure there&apos;s much you can do. Though I may lean on you for support, it is I who must bear the burden of my past life.&quot;</string>

<string name="100985">&quot;Might we speak?&quot;</string>
<string name="100986">&quot;The Seer seems to believe that the survival of our forces depends on your quest. I do not know if that is true, but I will come with you again if you need my help.&quot;</string>
<string name="100987">&quot;The Hells are a dangerous place to be... for me as much as for you. If you need a warrior at your side, I&apos;d be glad to join you.&quot;</string>
<string name="100988">&quot;Do you have need of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="100989">&quot;Yes, my love?&quot;</string>
<string name="100990">&quot;I am yours to command.&quot;</string>
<string name="100991">&quot;Watch you do not involve yourself in the squabbles of the drow. Even amongst the rebels, it seems they would rather kill each other than work together.&quot;</string>
<string name="100992">&quot;There is an old drow saying about the Underdark, I hear: &apos;Only death awaits the unwary within its shadows.&apos;&quot;</string>
<string name="100993">&quot;We must watch out for the Valsharess&apos; allies. If they come after us... and after you... they will do it out here in the caverns.&quot;</string>
<string name="100994">&quot;Let caution rule your step, here. Even the most innocent-looking creature can be filled with poison strong enough to bring down a rothe beast.&quot;</string>
<string name="100995">&quot;I&apos;ve always considered the Underdark to be not unlike the Abyss. In intent, anyhow.&quot;</string>
<string name="100996">&quot;There is an exit to the surface not far from here that I know of. We could... search for it, if you wished.&quot;</string>
<string name="100997">&quot;Don&apos;t get lost down here. Finding your bearings once you are lost in the shadows is far from simple.&quot;</string>
<string name="100998">&quot;What manner of being would build such a fortress, I wonder? And better yet, how sound are their defenses?&quot;</string>
<string name="100999">&quot;Can you not feel it? We are near the Master of this terrible place. Be wary.&quot;</string>
<string name="101000">&quot;I have heard of this place. Zorvak&apos;Mur, it&apos;s called... not a real settlement at all, but rather a slaving outpost for the illithids.&quot;</string>
<string name="101001">&quot;We must clad our wills in iron if we are to make it through this place alive. With their telepathic powers, the illithids are the ultimate deceivers.&quot;</string>
<string name="101002">&quot;And so this is the Beholder Tyrant. Prepare yourself for battle!&quot;</string>
<string name="101003">&quot;The stench of smoke and ash in this place is enough to make one gag!&quot;</string>
<string name="101004">&quot;Something... something is amiss, here. I smell a trap.&quot;</string>
<string name="101005">&quot;If this is a true wizard&apos;s tower, there are likely many magical traps ahead and summoned guardians. The guardians, at least, I can deal with.&quot;</string>
<string name="101006">&quot;That must be the most deranged and serious-looking jester I have ever seen. How fitting, considering everything else we have found here.&quot;</string>
<string name="101007">&quot;And so the settlement has returned whence it came. Hopefully its people will find peace, now that their ordeal is over.&quot;</string>
<string name="101008">&quot;Hmm. They look like duergar merchants to me. But why set up on such a remote island as this?&quot;</string>
<string name="101009">&quot;How long have the golems remained here, I wonder? Do they yet possess a master, or are they alone? I find myself feeling sorry for them, strange as that may sound.&quot;</string>
<string name="101010">&quot;You can smell the potent magic lingering in the air, here. The golems&apos; master is not dead... but nor is he alive.&quot;</string>
<string name="101011">&quot;I know where we are. This is Cania, within the outer plane known as Baator. One of the frozen hells, populated by devils... my demon blood will make me even less welcome here than you.&quot;</string>
<string name="101012">&quot;How typical that in here, unlike the other hells, fire would exist to draw sufferants to it for warmth and protection.&quot;</string>
<string name="101013">&quot;It is good to be out of the cold. I am less subject to temperature extremes than most, but even I was feeling the chill.&quot;</string>
<string name="101014">&quot;Is there... a woman, frozen within the ice? She looks human, perhaps... or humanoid, at least.&quot;</string>
<string name="101015">&quot;Oh look, we really are in the Hells after all. A mime.&quot;</string>
<string name="101016">&quot;It looks like some creature masquerading as a chest... and one that devours gems. How odd.&quot;</string>
<string name="101017">&quot;Hmmm. How do we get across this river of lava? Somehow I don&apos;t think swimming is the answer.&quot;</string>
<string name="101018">&quot;No doubt those levers are the key to by-passing the door. This is another puzzle... welcome to the Hells.&quot;</string>
<string name="101019">&quot;We will carve a path of blood through the Underdark, if need be.&quot;</string>

<string name="101027">&quot;Part of me wonders why we are mixed up in this. The Seer will meet her death down here, I am sure of it.&quot;</string>

<string name="101036">&quot;The words of my mentor come to mind: wait, and weigh your blow carefully. Then strike once and strike hard and it shall be the only one you need.&quot;</string>
<string name="101037">&quot;I once faced off against a small army of fiends with only a scant few demons at my back. I was the only one to walk away from the battlefield that day.&quot;</string>
<string name="101038">&quot;Does each step that we take on this adventure lead us closer to our death, I wonder?&quot;</string>
<string name="101039">&quot;I am unsure what will happen if I die upon your world. Will that part of me which is demonic return to the Abyss? I pray not. I had my fill of that place.&quot;</string>
<string name="101040">&quot;I have had enough of blood and death. Yet here I am, fighting for the Seer and up to my neck in it once more.&quot;</string>
<string name="101041">&quot;I am one with my will, one with my mace. Its path is my intent, its length my reach, its thundering blow my gentle kiss.&quot;</string>
<string name="101042">&quot;Hmmm. I keep thinking I should have left more instructions with Imloth before I left. No matter.&quot;</string>
<string name="101043">&quot;Where are we going? I would prefer to lead, rather than running after you all the day long.&quot;</string>
<string name="101044">&quot;My armor is tarnished beyond belief. Is that rust?! I shall have to polish it the next time we stop.&quot;</string>
<string name="101045">&quot;I do not like being underground. Even in the Abyss I never had the sense of such a... weight being directly overhead.&quot;</string>
<string name="101046">&quot;The darkness here is interminable. It is more than shadows... it engulfs the heart and swallows courage.&quot;</string>
<string name="101047">&quot;I understand the drow were once a surface race, driven underground by their surface cousins. How must they have felt, exiled to an unwelcoming land of shadowy caverns?&quot;</string>
<string name="101048">&quot;One eye to lift and one eye to sleep,
One to charm man and one for beast.
One eye to wound and one eye to slow,
One to bring fear and one to make stone...
hmmm, now I forget the rest...&quot;</string>
<string name="101049">&quot;Are you sure you are going the right way? Have we not been here before?&quot;</string>
<string name="101050">&quot;All the old legends of the greatest adventures do not mention the fact that most of it was spent walking, do they?&quot;</string>
<string name="101051">&quot;I remember when we fought against the great pit fiend, Arauchor. He used his power to open a chasm to separate us from him, then laughed that he would never be defeated... right before he slipped and fell in.&quot;</string>
<string name="101052">&quot;I must admit, killing mortals is much easier that killing demons. If you remove a demon&apos;s head, all you end up with is something that tries to bite your ankles.&quot;</string>
<string name="101053">&quot;I don&apos;t like how this place feels. It is as if we are being watched.&quot;</string>
<string name="101054">&quot;I look forward to repaying that archdevil well for his &apos;kindness&apos; in sending us here.&quot;</string>
<string name="101055">&quot;Ah, yes, the hellish planes. The lands of suffering, how well I know it.&quot;</string>
<string name="101056">&quot;It seems a bit... convenient... that the relic you found so long ago was part of Mephistopheles. Mind you, I suppose that&apos;s how you became involved in all of this, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="101057">&quot;Ahhh, I can feel my demonic blood rebelling against my presence here. It is the Blood Wars calling me now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101058">&quot;It has been some time since a lord of the Hells has been free in your world. This should be interesting... in a horrid, terrifying, &apos;get me out of here&apos; kind of way, I mean.&quot;</string>
<string name="101059">He rubs his chin thoughtfully, seemingly unsure how to continue. &quot;We might meet our end at any time now, and there is something I would like to get off my chest first.&quot;</string>
<string name="101060">He stiffens, his eyes blazing with brief anger before he looks at you. &quot;No, there is nothing &apos;sappy&apos; about it at all, though obviously I should get this over with before you insult me even more.&quot;</string>
<string name="101061">He nods. &quot;You are correct. I should just get this over with.&quot;</string>
<string name="101062">&quot;We have not known each other for long. I wanted you to know, however, that in the brief time we&apos;ve spent together I&apos;ve... come to feel quite close to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="101063">&quot;I... I think I&apos;ve come to know you quite well. I believe we have a companionship, perhaps even something more than that. Do you... not feel the same?&quot;</string>
<string name="101064">He smiles shyly, looking away for a moment. When his eyes return to you, they are bright and filled with emotion. &quot;I am most glad to hear it, my lady.&quot;</string>
<string name="101065">&quot;My life,&quot; he begins slowly, &quot;has been one of nothing but rage and despair. Even after I came to the Seer, I still believed that gaining my humanity was the most I could aspire to.&quot;</string>
<string name="101066">&quot;I do not feel that way anymore. I believe there is something greater I could aspire to.&quot; His eyes stare into yours intensely. &quot;I... I love you, my lady. With all my heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="101067">Afterwards, Valen smiles bashfully. &quot;It is more than I could have hoped for that you might return my feelings, my lady. Nothing could make me happier.&quot;</string>
<string name="101068">He looks off into the distance, grinning. &quot;I do not know, truly. All I know is that you are the most amazing woman I have ever encountered. Any future we have is enough for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="101069">&quot;I know.&quot; He looks down, smiling contentedly. &quot;I have no doubt at all that we&apos;ll make it through this. And then... well, I suppose we can talk about that then.&quot;</string>
<string name="101070">He nods, smiling gently even though wounded pride still shines from behind his eyes. &quot;Of course, my lady. I... expected no more.&quot;</string>
<string name="101071">&quot;Perhaps once this is over, we can speak of this again.&quot; He pauses, letting the question hang in the air as he turns away. &quot;I... am sorry if I have made you uncomfortable, my lady. I had to say it.&quot;</string>
<string name="101072">&quot;Let us move on. There is much to do if we ever wish to escape from this frozen wasteland.&quot;</string>
<string name="101073">Your answer was unexpected and Valen clearly looks both disappointed and uncomfortable. &quot;Ah,&quot; he sighs. &quot;I suppose I should have expected that.&quot;</string>
<string name="101074">&quot;There is nothing wrong with counting you as a friend. I would be more than pleased to count you as one.&quot; He smiles at you shyly. &quot;That is, of course, if you can forgive my lapse in etiquette.&quot;</string>
<string name="101075">He nods slowly, comprehending. &quot;I see,&quot; he says with a great deal of embarrassment in his voice. &quot;I am doubly the fool, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="101076">A pained expression crosses Valen&apos;s face and he looks away from you. &quot;I... I see.&quot; A flush suddenly rises in his cheeks. &quot;I suppose I should have known better than this.&quot;</string>
<string name="101077">&quot;I thought... well, it doesn&apos;t matter what I thought. I was very foolish. I won&apos;t trouble you again with my thoughts, I apologize.&quot; He clears his throat abruptly. &quot;Let&apos;s just... move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101078">He chuckles uneasily. &quot;I am serious, my lady. I wish to speak with you a moment, just you and I.&quot;</string>
<string name="101079">I... really, my lady! This is not what I meant at all! I just... I just wanted to tell you how I felt about you!</string>
<string name="101080">&quot;I wanted to express my admiration to you. I know that you were forced by Halaster to aid us, but I think you have done far more than was required. I am grateful.&quot;</string>
<string name="101081">He smiles broadly. &quot;Good. I&apos;m glad.&quot; He motions ahead. &quot;Let&apos;s keep going, then, friend. We have a plane yet to conquer and then an archdevil to face. Victory no longer seems quite so far away.&quot;</string>
<string name="101082">&quot;Speak to the Seer. She will explain everything.&quot;</string>
<string name="101083">The tiefling looks you over, sizing you up. &quot;The Seer believes you are our prophetical savior; our only hope of defeating the Valsharess. I, however, do not believe in prophecies.&quot;</string>
<string name="101084">&quot;Still, you are obviously capable in your own right. And we need all the help we can get if we are to win this war. So I&apos;m willing to take a chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="101085">Valen gives you a curt nod as a way of greeting. &quot;How can I assist you?&quot;</string>
<string name="101086">test</string>
<string name="101087">They cannot stand against us! Strike them down!</string>
<string name="101088">You cannot win this fight!</string>
<string name="101089">Into the flames we leap!</string>
<string name="101090">I am wounded! Help me!</string>
<string name="101091">I am being overwhelmed!</string>
<string name="101092">We are set upon once again.</string>
<string name="101093">Fall back! We must regroup!</string>
<string name="101094">My blood calls for yours and it *will* be satisfied.</string>
<string name="101095">I need you at my side!</string>
<string name="101096">Stop!</string>
<string name="101097">Ahhh! I will *not* go down!</string>
<string name="101098">Ahh! I can feel the poison!</string>
<string name="101099">My magic did not work!</string>
<string name="101100">This weapon is doing nothing!</string>
<string name="101101">Come. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="101102">What do we have here?</string>
<string name="101103">We should remain together.</string>
<string name="101104">Let me through.</string>
<string name="101105">I&apos;ll try to open it.</string>
<string name="101106">I&apos;ll keep an eye out.</string>
<string name="101107">Not a sound.</string>
<string name="101108">Very well.</string>
<string name="101109">I cannot.</string>
<string name="101110">It&apos;s done.</string>
<string name="101111">How much do you plan on weighing me down with, exactly?</string>
<string name="101112">At your command.</string>
<string name="101113">Greetings.</string>
<string name="101114">Yes.</string>
<string name="101115">No.</string>
<string name="101116">Wait one moment.</string>
<string name="101117">We all need our rest.</string>
<string name="101118">How long must we remain idle? This is accomplishing nothing.</string>
<string name="101119">Farewell.</string>
<string name="101120">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="101121">By the pits of Hell!</string>
<string name="101122">Ha ha! A good day!</string>
<string name="101123">I have something to say.</string>
<string name="101124">An excellent plan.</string>
<string name="101125">No, I don&apos;t think that will work.</string>
<string name="101126">Do you wish to die now? Because I can certainly arrange that.</string>
<string name="101127">You have died in the Hells and are now permanently dead.</string>
<string name="101128"></string>
<string name="101129">You suddenly feel weaker, as your weapon starts taking away a part of your life force.</string>
<string name="101130">We shall meet again!</string>
<string name="101131">Sabal has teleported away.</string>
<string name="101132">You pull the chain, but nothing happens at this time.</string>
<string name="101133"></string>
<string name="101134">You were defeated in the temple of Talona and are now permanently dead. You must load a savegame to continue.</string>
<string name="101135"></string>
<string name="101136"></string>
<string name="101137">Lizardfolk Whipmaster</string>
<string name="101138">The creature you dominated looks to you for instructions.</string>
<string name="101139">It waits for instructions.</string>
<string name="101140">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101141">It nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101142">It nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101143">It doubts it will be much help, but agrees to try.</string>
<string name="101144">It nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101145">It nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101146">It nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101147">It nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101148">It doubts it will be much help, but agrees to try.</string>
<string name="101149">It wonders how far you want it to stay away.</string>
<string name="101150">It nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101151">It nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101152">It nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101153">The creature waits for further instructions.</string>
<string name="101154">The creature wonders who it is casting spells on.</string>
<string name="101155">So shall it be done.</string>
<string name="101156">The creature waits for further instructions.</string>
<string name="101157">&quot;You be sure?&quot;</string>
<string name="101158">&quot;Who should I cast this on?&quot;</string>
<string name="101159">&quot;Very well!&quot;</string>
<string name="101160">Your animal companion is only paying minimal attention to you, until you catch its eye and signal that you wish to speak.</string>
<string name="101161">Nose twitching and whiskers trembling, your dire rat, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, scampers over and noses around at a bit of blood on your boots.</string>
<string name="101162">Hunching its massive muscles, the dire wolf, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, strides over and waits with a quiet nobility for your attention.</string>
<string name="101163">On nimble legs, your spider,&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, scampers over and waits for you to give it instructions.</string>
<string name="101164">Your panther, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, comes over and pushes its body up against you, searching for some attention.</string>
<string name="101165">With a wild screech, your hawk flies over and circles your head, wondering if you will be killing something again... soon.</string>
<string name="101166">With a grunt and a squeal, your boar, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, trots over and snuffles at your boots, wondering if it is pleasing you.</string>
<string name="101167">Your bear, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, lumbers over to you, feeling tired and hoping for a good scratch behind the ears.</string>
<string name="101168">Your wolf, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, bounds playfully over to you and drops its head to the side, wondering how it can assist you.</string>
<string name="101169">The badger, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, comes scratching and sniffing up to your leg, wondering in its typically fiery temper why you are bothering it.</string>
<string name="101170">Your dire rat playfully mauls your fingers whenever they come near, then trembles with excitement as your stroke its furry head. It is obviously unused to such kind treatment.</string>
<string name="101171">Your dire wolf eyes you warily as your pet it, not sure about the dignity of such attention. It wonders if you do the same thing to other companions you might have.</string>
<string name="101172">The spider recoils under your touch, but then realizes what you are doing and chitters happily.</string>
<string name="101173">Unfortunately, when it becomes clear that it is losing, your spider eats the pieces and proclaims victory.</string>
<string name="101174">The panther lets you pet it, but when you are done it pets you back. You sometimes forget just how heavy those paws can be.</string>
<string name="101175">Your hawk eyes your fingers as if they might be something to eat, but then relents and allows you to stroke its feathers.</string>
<string name="101176">The boar snorts happily and then does a strange little dance of joy when you are done.</string>
<string name="101177">The bear sniffs your fingers, then loses interest when it decides you don&apos;t have any honey on them.</string>
<string name="101178">Your wolf accepts your touch and rubs up against you, enjoying the attention.</string>
<string name="101179">Your badger snaps at your fingers as you bring them near, being in no mood for *getting friendly with the big folk*.</string>
<string name="101180">Your dire rat pulls out a deck of cards, seemingly from nowhere, and teaches you several different versions of a game it calls *Blackjack*.</string>
<string name="101181">Your dire wolf doesn&apos;t have much interest in games, but is willing to concede to a philosophical discussion on the meaning of life, so long as you scratch it behind the ears.</string>
<string name="101182">You and your spider play a challenging game of checkers, using its webs to make the board and stunned insects as pieces. </string>
<string name="101183">Unfortunately, when it becomes clear that it is losing, your spider eats the pieces and proclaims victory.</string>
<string name="101184">The only games your panther really likes are wrestling and one where it pounces at your feet and you are supposed to leap out of the way. You tend to lose at both, but you try.</string>
<string name="101185">A quick game of eye-spy with your hawk reveals that its eyesight is far superior to yours. It is very difficult to spot a brown mouse at one thousand yards.</string>
<string name="101186">Things are going great until you suggest a game of pig-in-the-middle and your boar gets all huffy and won&apos;t play anymore.</string>
<string name="101187">You try to play a game of twenty questions with your bear, but give up in frustration when all it ever thinks of is fish and honey.</string>
<string name="101188">You and your wolf play keep-away for a while, but its boundless energy eventually tires you. You hope no one saw you playing or you&apos;ll probably end up with a silly nickname like Waltzes-With-Wolves.</string>
<string name="101189">You and your badger have a lovely game of tug-a-war which starts with a bit of rope, but ends up tearing your sleeve. The badgers trots off proudly with the cloth in its teeth.</string>
<string name="101190">The rat tries to pay attention as you scold it, but keeps getting distracted by flea bites. Finally you give up in disgust.</string>
<string name="101191">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; lays down at your feet with its head on its paws and looks mournfully at you.</string>
<string name="101192">The spider just blinks its many eyes and waits for you to calm down.</string>
<string name="101193">Your panther hangs its head and swats at something on the ground, feeling embarrassed.</string>
<string name="101194">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; shrieks a lonely cry, not sure how you can blame it for such an unfortunate mistake.</string>
<string name="101195">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; snorts, turns its back on you and releases a very foul-smelling retort.</string>
<string name="101196">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; roars in frustration, realizing that it upset you, but not really understanding why.</string>
<string name="101197">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; hangs its head in shame then turns and and begins to slap its tail against your leg, to cheer you up.</string>
<string name="101198">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; stands on his hind legs and starts scolding you back. Apparently it feels that if you gave clearer instructions, it would not make mistakes.</string>
<string name="101199">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; greedily grabs the food and gorges himself as quickly as possible, watching carefully for any competitors that might try to steal some of it.</string>
<string name="101200">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; quickly consumes the carcass of a recent kill, silently offering you a share. You thank him, but turn down the offer.</string>
<string name="101201">The spider takes the food, wraps it in a web, bites it, then stuffs it into its mandibles in some kind of strange eating ritual.</string>
<string name="101202">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; ravages the carcass you throw to it, gulping it down in a few short gulps.</string>
<string name="101203">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; circles your hand then snatches the strip of flesh from it, ripping it and gulping it down quickly.</string>
<string name="101204">Not being fussy, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; pushes the food around in the dirt for a bit before gobbling it down.</string>
<string name="101205">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; sniffs at the meat and disappointedly eats the already dead food. It wishes you would put a spot of honey on it next time.</string>
<string name="101206">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; ravages the carcass you throw to it, gulping it down in a few short gulps.</string>
<string name="101207">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; snarls and attacks the food you drop. Experience has taught you never to feed a badger from your bare hand.</string>
<string name="101208">Not being hungry, the creature ignores the food, waiting for you to say something important.</string>
<string name="101209">Your familiar is only paying slight attention to you, until you catch its eye and signal that you wish to speak.</string>
<string name="101210">Staring at you with all its might, your eyeball floats over and communicates telepathically with you. &quot;&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; is ready to serve you, strange &lt;master/mistress&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="101211">Your pseudodragon flaps its wings laconically and lands in front of you, giving you a reptilian grin as it communicates telepathically with you. &quot;How can &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; be of service, &lt;master/mistress&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="101212">Your playful fairy dragon familiar flies over to you. &quot;Yes, &lt;FirstName&gt;, sweet &lt;master/mistress&gt;, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; is eager to serve you, yes, yes, yes!&quot;</string>
<string name="101213">Your raven, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, flies over to you and eyes you with curiosity, awaiting your command.</string>
<string name="101214">The pixie flies over to you, her trail of fairy dust floating into your face, almost making you sneeze. &quot;Yes, &lt;master/mistress&gt;? How can &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; help you?&quot;</string>
<string name="101215">The mephit flies near you, the cold from its body making your skin numb. &quot;What would you have of me, oh mighty tyrant?&quot;</string>
<string name="101216">The mephit flies near you, the heat from its body prickling your skin. &quot;Sir, yes sir, First Infernal Flier &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; reporting for duty, sir.&quot;</string>
<string name="101217">Your imp flaps over. &quot;What do you want, &lt;master/mistress&gt;. Is it not enough that &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; is bound to you in this infernally annoying plane? Must you badger me with constant questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="101218">Your hell hound, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, rushes over, excitedly hoping you will ask it to fry something.</string>
<string name="101219">Your panther, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, comes over and pushes its body up against you, searching for some attention.</string>
<string name="101220">Your bat, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt;, flies over and around your head, waiting for you to communicate instructions to it.</string>
<string name="101221">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; wants to kill more things. Lots more things. It feels that perhaps you have done a bit more than your share of the killing and wouldn&apos;t mind if it could have a few more.</string>
<string name="101222">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; shrugs indifferently. &quot;Could be better, could be worse. Just trying to stay alive, basically.&quot;</string>
<string name="101223">&quot;Oh my, yes, everything is going swimmingly, absolutely fabulous, perfect; except for the dangerous bits. Don&apos;t like them at all, no, no, no!&quot;</string>
<string name="101224">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; shakes itself, then lets out a rude noise and a blast of droppings. Apparently it is less than thrilled with the situation.</string>
<string name="101225">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; giggles and flits around, then squeaks out a reply, &quot;Lovely.&quot;</string>
<string name="101226">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; sighs, breathing out a cold mist. Finally it shrugs. &quot;I really cannot say. Is it warm in here?&quot;</string>
<string name="101227">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; stands at attention. &quot;Sir, you can count on me to do your bidding whenever you wish, but do not expect me to have an original thought. I wasn&apos;t trained to think.&quot;</string>
<string name="101228">&quot;Sir, yes sir!&quot;</string>
<string name="101229">&quot;Sir, yes sir! Right away, sir! Understood, sir!&quot;</string>
<string name="101230">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; eyes you incredulously. &quot;Less talking... more killing. Just a suggestion.&quot;</string>
<string name="101231">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; growls his immense pleasure at the number of creatures it has gotten to kill and devour.</string>
<string name="101232">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; growls at you, wishing you would take better care of yourself and stop getting into dangerous situations.</string>
<string name="101233">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; flies around and gives you the impression that it is really enjoying the new places you have explored. It just wishes it didn&apos;t have to keep dying.</string>
<string name="101234">Your eyeball excitedly engages in a staring contest with you. You are holding your own until it cheats and fires a small blast of frost into your eyes, causing you to blink.</string>
<string name="101235">It takes a while for your laid-back pseudodragon to get into a game, but once he does he never wants to stop. When he&apos;s done he wraps his tail cheerfully around your leg, squeezes and flies off.</string>
<string name="101236">Your fairy dragon loves games and would play for hours if you allowed her the time. When you are finished she gives your neck a big hug and happily flutters away.</string>
<string name="101237">You try to coax your raven into playing a game with you, but, infuriatingly, it just keeps saying, &quot;Never more.&quot;</string>
<string name="101238">Nothing like a good game of tickle with a pixie. Nope, nothing else like it in the world.</string>
<string name="101239">The mephit seems to find that any activity involving thought or movement is less than engaging. Finally it suggests a snowball fight, which it wins rather easily.</string>
<string name="101240">You and the mephit play a rousing game of capture the flag, but it sulks when you win more than one game in a row.</string>
<string name="101241">&quot;Why is it that everyone thinks imps enjoy riddle games? Did I come asking you about coffins or fish or rivers... no, I don&apos;t think so. Well... all right... maybe just one riddle...&quot;</string>
<string name="101242">You throw a ball over the head of your hell hound and shout &quot;Fetch!&quot;, but it just walks over and engulfs the ball in flames, eyeing you maliciously.</string>
<string name="101243">The only games your panther really likes are wrestling and ones where it pounces at your feet and you are supposed to leap out of the way. You tend to lose at both, but you try.</string>
<string name="101244">Playing your familiar&apos;s favorite game, you swipe at the air with a stick while the bat dives at it, getting as close as possible. This is amusing until it runs smack into the stick and drops, stunned.</string>
<string name="101245">The eyeball starts to cry large, wet tears that drip directly onto the floor. It dips in the air, drooping in shame as it floats away.</string>
<string name="101246">The pseudodragon let&apos;s its long tongue hang out of its mouth as it waits for you to finish. &quot;Yep, got the point. You don&apos;t have to tell me twice.&quot;</string>
<string name="101247">&quot;Oh, &lt;master/mistress&gt;, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; feels simply awful. She did not mean to make such a mistake, no she did not. Oh, say you will forgive &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; for her wickedness!&quot;</string>
<string name="101248">The raven eyes you with offended dignity, fluffs up its plumage, and turns its beak into the air, ignoring you completely.</string>
<string name="101249">The pixie bursts into tears, her whole body wracked with sobs. She almost seems inconsolable, until something on the floor catches her attention and she forgets all about you.</string>
<string name="101250">The ice mephit shivers uncontrollably. &quot;I have failed you, oh mighty flesh-stripping-tyrant! If you choose to banish me, I will understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="101251">The fire mephit salutes you. &quot;Sir, yes, sir! I will try not to repeat the offense again, sir! If I do, I will expect to feel the cane of discipline across my back, sir!&quot;</string>
<string name="101252">The imp raises an eyebrow. &quot;What? I&apos;m supposed to care what you think? Should I fall at your feet and grovel for forgiveness? Next time choose a pixie familiar. They&apos;re sensitive and taste good in a soup.&quot;</string>
<string name="101253">The hell hound growls a warning at you to mind your attitude and hold your opinions to yourself.</string>
<string name="101254">Your panther hangs its head and swats at something on the ground, feeling embarrassed.</string>
<string name="101255">The bat flies right into your face, wrapping its wings around your head and begins to cry and nuzzle your face for forgiveness. It is a very unsettling experience.</string>
<string name="101256">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; grabs the meat from you and hastily chokes it down. &quot;Mmm... delicious.&quot;</string>
<string name="101257">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; rips into the meat of a carcass, slurping at the blood as it runs down its chin. &quot;Ah, that feels better, thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="101258">&quot;Oh, &lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; does so love to eat, kind &lt;master/mistress&gt;, oh yes she does!&quot;</string>
<string name="101259">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; picks at the flesh in your hand and gobbles it down, eyeing the area to make sure nothing else tries to steal its food.</string>
<string name="101260">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; giggles joyfully, licking the crumbs off your fingers, then returns to flying. </string>
<string name="101261">&quot;Oh mighty giver-of-tasty-morsels, I thank you for this kind indulgence.&quot;</string>
<string name="101262">&quot;Sir, I shall consume my rations quickly then return to active duty, sir.&quot;</string>
<string name="101263">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; looks at the food you offer it, then sniffs loudly. &quot;So this is what your delicate palate considers cuisine, is it?&quot; The imp eats it all the same.</string>
<string name="101264">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; roasts the flesh of the carcass you throw it, then tears into it with its bared teeth.</string>
<string name="101265">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; ravages the carcass you throw to it, gulping it down in a few short gulps.</string>
<string name="101266">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; zooms over your head, catching the little crumbs of hard tack and cheese you throw in the air.</string>
<string name="101267">Not being hungry, the familiar ignores the food, waiting for you to say something important.</string>
<string name="101268">It waits for instructions.</string>
<string name="101269">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101270">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; hasn&apos;t a clue what you are talking about.</string>
<string name="101271">&quot;I&apos;ll show them how hell freezes over, oh mighty wind-of-doom!&quot;</string>
<string name="101272">&quot;Sir, all fires are go, I understand, sir!&quot;</string>
<string name="101273">&quot;Send them all to hell in a ball of flames. Gotcha!&quot;</string>
<string name="101274">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101275">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; doubts it will be much help, but agrees to try.</string>
<string name="101276">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; chitters delightedly, loving the challenge of a good trap.</string>
<string name="101277">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101278">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101279">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; nods in understanding.</string>
<string name="101280">&lt;CUSTOM10232&gt; nods in understanding.</string>

<string name="101570">&quot;Not much, I&apos;m afraid. I do my best to stay out of the planes of Hell. I can usually find the stuff I need in far less hostile realms.&quot;</string>
<string name="101571">&quot;Only that it&apos;s the home of those damnable drow... and other filthy races. I have as little to do with the Underdark&apos;s black caverns as possible, mortal.&quot;</string>
<string name="101572">&quot;Do you know anything about the Hells?&quot;</string>
<string name="101573">&quot;Can you tell me anything about the Underdark?&quot;</string>
<string name="101574">&quot;You realize that means draining some of your health, yes? Some of your precious constitution traded for a better blade?&quot;</string>
<string name="101575">&quot;Very well. Spoilsport.&quot;</string>
<string name="101576">&quot;Lovely! Let&apos;s get this underway, then, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="101577">&quot;You mean... well, yes. I imagine it could. If you like, just tell me when and I&apos;ll have the sword drain your health for a temporary boost of sorts. All temporary, naturally.&quot;</string>
<string name="101578">&quot;Never mind, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="101579">&quot;I know. Drain as much as you can.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[-6 Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="101580">&quot;I know. Drain a moderate amount.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[-4 Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="101581">&quot;I know. Drain only a little.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[-2 Constitution]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="101582">&quot;Temporary? Could it be made voluntary?&quot;</string>
<string name="101583">&quot;The weapon you are currently wielding is a throwing weapon. I cannot upgrade those, sorry. However, I can upgrade ranged or melee weapons.&quot;</string>
<string name="101584">&quot;The weapon you are wielding already has many powerful enchantments. I can not risk to work on such a powerful item, would be too dangerous.&quot;</string>
<string name="101585">The half-orc regards your companions thoughtfully. &quot;Hmmm. On second thought, perhaps you already have enough help, for now. Come back if that changes.&quot;</string>
<string name="101586">&quot;Ummm... never mind. Deekin had to go tinkle, but now it be too late.&quot;</string>
<string name="101587">&quot;You gots it, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="101588">&quot;Some books that Deekin reads when he be with Old Master... they says that all drow be evil and nasty. But that not be true?&quot;</string>
<string name="101589">Deekin nods slowly, shifting from foot to foot. &quot;So you thinks all drow be evil? Why you thinks that?&quot;</string>
<string name="101590">&quot;But... Deekin comes from dark caves, too. Deekin not be dark and twisted.&quot;</string>
<string name="101591">&quot;So some drow be exceptions? Can there be lots of exceptions, you thinks?&quot;</string>
<string name="101592">&quot;But... kobolds be evil race, too. And Deekin not be evil. At least, Deekin not thinks he be evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="101593">&quot;So... if there be one exception, there can be more? Can there be lots, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="101594">He sighs heavily. &quot;Deekin wonders about kobold tribe he comes from. He wonders if they be evil because they kobolds... or maybe if they could be good if someone shows them how?&quot;</string>
<string name="101595">The little kobold appears crestfallen at your response. &quot;Oh. Deekin just wonders, that be all.&quot;</string>
<string name="101596">He shifts from foot to foot some more, wringing his hands. &quot;Deekin not knows. Maybe Deekin thinkings that.&quot;</string>
<string name="101597">&quot;Deekin wonders sometimes if he be only good kobold ever. If he is... then Deekin be lonely forever too.&quot;</string>
<string name="101598">He nods quickly. &quot;Right, boss. Back to the adventure!&quot;</string>
<string name="101599">He eyes you dubiously but slowly nods. &quot;Deekin guesses you be right, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="101600">Deekin gives you a hopeful, toothy grin. &quot;Deekin hopes you be right, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="101601">Deekin gives you a hopeful, toothy grin. &quot;Maybe someday Deekin goes back to kobold tribe and they see what a great hero Deekin be? Deekin likes the sound of that.&quot;</string>
<string name="101602">Deekin gives you a big, toothy grin. &quot;Deekin gots you, boss, that be true. That be good enough for little Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="101603">Deekin thinks hard for a moment, scratching his head. &quot;It seem to Deekin that lots of drow be evil. But maybe there be exception?&quot;</string>
<string name="101604">Deekin thinks hard for a moment, scratching his head. &quot;What about Seer lady? You thinks she be evil?&quot;</string>
<string name="101605">&quot;My True Name... What... what do you intend to do with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101606">&quot;I... I am relieved. Now hurry, we must go through the gate and return to Toril. If we wait much longer, Mephistopheles will destroy all of Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="101607">A look of fear creeps into her dark-veiled eyes. &quot;But if I give you my soul, it will be the death of me. I would be nothing but dust without it... Are you sure of what you ask, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="101608">&quot;Thank you for that small mercy, my Lord. I beg you, though, ask nothing more of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="101609">The drow screams as her vital essence is ripped away. Before your eyes she ages a thousand years, her skin wrinkling, her eyes sinking, her body withering into a pile of bones and dust. Nathyrra&apos;s soul is now yours.</string>
<string name="101610">The drow&apos;s head snaps back and she lets out a cry of pain and despair. She speaks through tightly clenched teeth: &quot;You would force me to love you? What kind of beast are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="101611">&quot;My True Name gives you mastery over me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am compelled to obey, no matter how you abuse your power. But if I ever find a way to break free, I will kill you! ...Now what more abuse have you in store for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101612">She spits on the ground in disgust, but she can do nothing else against the power of her True Name. &quot;Will that be all?&quot;</string>
<string name="101613">She lets out a cry of rage, but does as you command. When the kiss is over, she turns away, unable to face you. It&apos;s obvious you&apos;ve broken her spirit utterly.</string>
<string name="101614">&quot;You&apos;ve made your point, &lt;FirstName&gt;,&quot; she says in a fierce whisper. &quot;Now we must find out if your power over Mephistopheles is as absolute as your power over me. What more do you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101615">Nathyrra&apos;s eyes open wide in surprise. She seems about to object, then she bows her head. When she looks up, there is a strange expression on her face.</string>
<string name="101616">&quot;My... my guilt is gone,&quot; she says, amazed. &quot;It has vanished, as if it never existed. I... I&apos;m free. Thank you for this, &lt;FirstName&gt;; you have given me a gift unlike any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="101617">&quot;But despite your kindness, I still find this... unsettling. The power of a True Name is a great responsibility; one I hope you will not abuse. Is there anything more you wish of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101618">&quot;No... Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, do not do this...&quot;</string>
<string name="101619">&quot;But what I did was wrong! Countless innocents died by my actions and countless friends as well. To feel no guilt, no remorse, is to become cold to the world. It would be inhuman. Is that what you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101620">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The ability to take responsibility for my past is the only dignity that still remains to me... Is there anything you would ask in its stead?&quot;</string>
<string name="101621">&quot;I suppose the gods have their mysteries. But what is commanded in their tongue must have their sanction, for good or ill. By your command, I am atoned... Is there anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="101622">&quot;Then I will not suffer, you have my word. It shall be as you command. Is there anything more you would ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101623">&quot;A curse, then, upon your descendants. May they each come to know despair... It will be as you command. Have you any other sufferings to heap upon me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101624">&quot;My soul? But that is all I have! I know not what power it might grant you but, without it, I will join the Lost... Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="101625">&quot;For that, I thank you. Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, stop this madness! For my sake, I beg you, ask nothing more...&quot;</string>
<string name="101626">&quot;As you command, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="101627">&quot;But I am a paladin again, something I could not have achieved without you! ...Yet this is your command and I must obey... Damn you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, let there be nothing more you would ask of me!&quot;</string>
<string name="101628">&quot;But how can it be love? ...Alas, you have commanded me and I will love you in whatever fashion I am able until the end of my days... Is there anything else you demand of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101629">&quot;No... What are you doing? How dare you!&quot;</string>
<string name="101630">&quot;Good, I am glad you have come to your senses. Now let us hurry, Mephistopheles awaits.&quot;</string>
<string name="101631">&quot;Don&apos;t be silly, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You don&apos;t need to command me by my True Name for that! To the contrary, I revel in it. The books of history will remember me as a great evil... Anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="101632">&quot;My soul? But that is all I have! I know not what power it might grant you but, without it, I will join the Lost... Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="101633">&quot;For that, I thank you. Is there anything else you would force upon me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101634">&quot;As you command, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="101635">&quot;But I am a blackguard, a path I chose on your advice! ...But you leave me no choice. I will do as you command... Please let there be nothing more you would ask of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="101636">&quot;My... My lord? ...You have commanded me and I will love you in whatever fashion I am able until the end of my days... Is there anything else you demand of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101637">&quot;Yes, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="101638">Valen&apos;s eyes grow wide as he hears the words. &quot;My True Name,&quot; he acknowledges, his eyes filled with a mixture of indignation and awe. &quot;How do you... intend to command me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101639">He sneers at you with disgust. &quot;You would force me to love you, my lady? After all we have been through?&quot;</string>
<string name="101640">Valen looks at you curiously, as if he didn&apos;t quite understand what you said... and then suddenly his eyes go wide. He stiffens, an electrical current running through his body violently.</string>
<string name="101641">A moment later, he spasms as a strange, black sheen seemingly lifts from his body and is dispersed. When he opens his eyes there is something... different about him. The otherworldly aura, the rage within his soul... all of it is gone.</string>
<string name="101642">&quot;I... I can&apos;t believe it!&quot; He looks at himself with incredulity, slowly smiling. &quot;The taint... it&apos;s gone! I feel... I feel wonderful! I feel human!!&quot; Laughing joyously, Valen hugs you. &quot;Thank you! Thank you for this wonderful gift!&quot;</string>
<string name="101643">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can never repay you for this. Now... we should go through the gate as soon as possible if we are to rescue your Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="101644">Valen&apos;s eyes flash a dangerous red. &quot;Take my soul,&quot; he growls, &quot;and that will be the end of me. Forever. Are you certain that is what you wish?&quot;</string>
<string name="101645">Valen nods, relieved. &quot;Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Please... ask nothing more of me, I beg you.&quot;</string>
<string name="101646">Before your eyes, Valen begins to shake violently. He screams in pure rage and agony as his vital essence is suddenly stripped away, his physical form fading away to so much dust. Valen&apos;s soul is now yours.</string>
<string name="101647">He stares at you in confusion. &quot;I am grateful, my lady, but... you would force me to love you? Even though that is not truly love at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="101648">He looks away, unwilling to look you in the eyes. &quot;Will there be anything else, my lady?&quot;</string>
<string name="101649">Valen stares at you with his intense blue eyes, clenching his jaw. &quot;So be it... my love. Your mastery over me knows no bounds. Should I ever free myself, however... I will kill you. Trust me on that.&quot;</string>
<string name="101650">Valen&apos;s eyes show only relief. &quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am grateful. Now... we should go through the gate as soon as possible if we are to rescue your Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="101651">He glares at you, his eyes burning a dark red... but he says nothing. Slowly, his gauntleted fists clench and unclench.</string>
<string name="101652">Valen struggles to resist your command, but finally gives in. He leans in, kissing you tenderly on the lips with his eyes closed. When you part, tears are streaming down his cheeks.</string>
<string name="101653">&quot;I hope this makes you happy, my lady,&quot; he spits. He refuses to look you in the eyes.</string>
<string name="101654">He stops and gazes into your eyes, his expression suddenly loving. Leaning in he kisses you softly. &quot;I suppose that there is.&quot;</string>
<string name="101655">&quot;Waterdeep awaits us, my love. The longer we wait here, the more people are hurt by Mephistopheles... he must be stopped.&quot;</string>
<string name="101656">His smile comes easily to him now. &quot;You have no idea, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It... it is as if a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders.&quot;</string>
<string name="101657">&quot;Deekin&apos;s True Name! What&apos;s it you want me to be doing, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="101658">&quot;Nothing? Nothing at all? Well that&apos;s a waste of a True Name, if you ask Deekin. How much did you spend on that again, boss? Oh well, we gots an adventure to finish, so hurry up.&quot;</string>
<string name="101659">&quot;Boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="101660">&quot;Yes, boss. Deekin will be all right... Really sad, but all right. Are you planning on dying, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="101661">&quot;Yes, boss. Deekin believe in himself. Anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="101662">&quot;Uh... Boss? Deekin kinda needs that soul. It&apos;s the only one he&apos;s got, see? Are you sure that&apos;s what you be wanting?&quot;</string>
<string name="101663">&quot;Oh phew! You had Deekin scared for a second there, boss. Maybe these True Names aren&apos;t so much fun after all... Have you gots any other commands for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="101664">&quot;Eeek... Okay, boss, here goes nothing... G&apos;bye... So long and thanks for all the fish... Don&apos;t let the gate hits you on the way out... AieeeeeEEEEeeee!&quot;</string>
<string name="101665">&quot;Mephistopheles waits for us on the prime. This may be the last battle for any of us.&quot;</string>
<string name="101666">&quot;You really thinks so?&quot;</string>
<string name="101667">Valen nods, patting Deekin on the head. &quot;Aye, I do. It shall be good to fight at &lt;FirstName&gt;&apos;s side, however. And yours, too, even.&quot;</string>
<string name="101668">&quot;It shall be a welcome reckoning,&quot; Nathyrra says. &quot;I look forward to fighting by your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Yours as well, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="101669">&quot;You is awfully nice to say that, elven lady.&quot;</string>
<string name="101670">&quot;You are a better fighter than you give yourself credit for.&quot; She looks about her at the hells. &quot;I, for one, will be glad to be away from this place of lost souls. They... call to me. It is unsettling.&quot;</string>
<string name="101671">Deekin is about to turn, but then he stops and puts up a small hand. &quot;Oh. Deekin just gots one more thing to says.&quot;</string>
<string name="101672">&quot;This be big, dangerous place. Maybe you wants to talks with Deekin about what tactics Deekin should use, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="101673">&quot;Okay boss. Back to the adventure!&quot;</string>
<string name="101674">Deekin looks at your companions. &quot;You sure you needs Deekin, boss? Deekin not wants to be third wheel.&quot;</string>
<string name="101675">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Reprimand Deekin.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="101676">&quot;Thanks for the update.&quot;</string>
<string name="101677">&quot;Of course it&apos;s true. Never trust a drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="101678">&quot;They are just like the shadows they inhabit. Dark and twisted.&quot;</string>
<string name="101679">&quot;Well... perhaps not all of them. But most of them.&quot;</string>
<string name="101680">&quot;If there are a few who aren&apos;t evil, they&apos;re rare exceptions.&quot;</string>
<string name="101681">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="101682">&quot;Their entire race is evil. There&apos;s no getting away from it.&quot;</string>
<string name="101683">&quot;That&apos;s true, I suppose.&quot;</string>
<string name="101684">&quot;You&apos;re an exception, that&apos;s all.&quot;</string>
<string name="101685">&quot;Not everyone can be perfect.&quot;</string>
<string name="101686">&quot;Are we still talking about the drow?&quot;</string>
<string name="101687">&quot;That sounds like a stupid idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="101688">&quot;I wouldn&apos;t get your hopes up, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="101689">&quot;You want to show them how to be good, Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="101690">&quot;Oh, enough crying! Let&apos;s get moving!&quot;</string>
<string name="101691">&quot;You don&apos;t need anyone. You have to learn that.&quot;</string>
<string name="101692">&quot;I think there might be other good kobolds out there, who knows?&quot;</string>
<string name="101693">&quot;I understand. I guess you&apos;re right, in a way.&quot;</string>
<string name="101694">&quot;You&apos;ve got me, don&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="101695">&quot;I don&apos;t really know, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="101696">&quot;Possibly. They say that the famous Drizzt Do&apos;Urden is a good drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="101697">&quot;Probably not.&quot;</string>
<string name="101698">&quot;The Seer is good, isn&apos;t she?&quot;</string>
<string name="101699">&quot;There are some good drow, yes, but most are evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="101700">&quot;Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="101701">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Nathyrra]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Qeyifalia the Skyseeker...&quot;</string>
<string name="101702">&quot;Nothing right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101703">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="101704">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="101705">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="101706">&quot;I bind you to me as my lover forever!&quot;</string>
<string name="101707">&quot;Your anger is nothing to me. I own you, body and soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="101708">&quot;You&apos;re so sexy when you&apos;re mad. Give me a kiss!&quot;</string>
<string name="101709">&quot;Forgive yourself for your past crimes.&quot;</string>
<string name="101710">&quot;I won&apos;t do anything to harm you, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="101711">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Aribeth]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Va&apos;ardalia the Twinsouled...&quot;</string>
<string name="101712">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="101713">&quot;Feel no guilt regarding what transpired in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="101714">&quot;You are right. I will not ask that of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="101715">&quot;Don&apos;t you see? This is your atonement... It&apos;s all right...&quot;</string>
<string name="101716">&quot;I just don&apos;t want to see you suffer so.&quot;</string>
<string name="101717">&quot;Yes, Aribeth. Dead and cold...&quot;</string>
<string name="101718">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="101719">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="101720">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="101721">&quot;I command you to pursue evil, not good.&quot;</string>
<string name="101722">&quot;I command you to love me...&quot;</string>
<string name="101723">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="101724">&quot;Feel no guilt regarding what transpired in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="101725">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="101726">&quot;If it means losing you, then no...&quot;</string>
<string name="101727">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="101728">&quot;I command you to pursue good, not evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="101729">&quot;I command you to love me!&quot;</string>
<string name="101730">&quot;That is all, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="101731">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Valen]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Oeskathine the Demonwrestler...&quot;</string>
<string name="101732">&quot;Nothing right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101733">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="101734">&quot;I bind you to me as my lover forever!&quot;</string>
<string name="101735">&quot;I hereby free you from your infernal taint.&quot;</string>
<string name="101736">&quot;You&apos;re welcome.&quot;</string>
<string name="101737">&quot;Glad you like it. Now give me your soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="101738">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="101739">&quot;Sorry, my love, but this is it for us.&quot;</string>
<string name="101740">&quot;Yes, I am.&quot;</string>
<string name="101741">&quot;Good. Now, in repayment, you are to become my lover forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="101742">&quot;Well... perhaps not.&quot;</string>
<string name="101743">&quot;You heard me.&quot;</string>
<string name="101744">&quot;We&apos;re done. For now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101745">&quot;You don&apos;t frighten me. I own you, body and soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="101746">&quot;You&apos;re so sexy when you&apos;re mad. Give me a kiss!&quot;</string>
<string name="101747">&quot;So there&apos;s hope for us after all?&quot;</string>
<string name="101748">&quot;Does it really feel that different?&quot;</string>
<string name="101749">&quot;I&apos;m glad. You certainly earned it.&quot;</string>
<string name="101750">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Deekin]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Ixthyria the Scalesinger...&quot;</string>
<string name="101751">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="101752">&quot;Believe in yourself, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="101753">&quot;You&apos;re kind, you&apos;re talented, you&apos;re funny. You don&apos;t need me anymore. If I die, you&apos;ll be all right.&quot;</string>
<string name="101754">&quot;Not if I can help it. Come, we have an adventure to finish.&quot;</string>
<string name="101755">&quot;Surrender your soul to me, little one!&quot; </string>
<string name="101756">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="101757">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="101758">&quot;What now?&quot;</string>
<string name="101759">&quot;Not right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101760">&quot;That sounds like a good idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="101761">She thinks for a moment. &quot;Actually, dear, it&apos;s not that important now that I think about it. Forget I said anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="101762">&quot;Actually, it looks like you have enough assistance. I would not want to create a crowd... come back later if you truly need me.&quot;</string>
<string name="101763">&quot;Would you like me to join up with you again?&quot;</string>
<string name="101764">---------- Random Pop-Ups Start Here ------------</string>
<string name="101765">&quot;Part ways? Are you... are you certain? I like to think my skills are quite useful, especially in our current situation.&quot;</string>
<string name="101766">&quot;You won&apos;t regret this, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="101767">&quot;I don&apos;t know if that is the wisest decision, but I will do as you say and wait here... for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101768">&quot;As you wish, though I think you are making a mistake. I will go back to where we first joined up. If you change your mind, you can come find me there.&quot;</string>
<string name="101769">&quot;If there is anything about my tactics you wish to change, simply let me know.&quot;</string>
<string name="101770">&quot;No magic? My spells are an important part of my strategy in battle, but if you think it&apos;s for the best then I won&apos;t use my magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="101771">&quot;This is probably for the best. I know best how to use my magic to compliment my other skills in combat. You won&apos;t be disappointed.&quot;</string>
<string name="101772">&quot;That seems like a strange decision, but if you feel it is in the group&apos;s best interest then I won&apos;t use my magic to dispel any disabling effects.&quot;</string>
<string name="101773">&quot;I will use my magic to negate any disabling effects whenever I can.&quot;</string>
<string name="101774">&quot;Very well, I won&apos;t touch any of the traps we come across from now on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101775">&quot;I will do my best to disable and remove any traps I detect.&quot;</string>
<string name="101776">&quot;I don&apos;t like to leave myself exposed and vulnerable, but if you feel it is for the best then I won&apos;t use stealth anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="101777">&quot;I will stay hidden until battle, then strike from the shadows!&quot;</string>
<string name="101778">&quot;I will be the Mistress of the Shadows, I will be like Lady Darkness herself.&quot;</string>
<string name="101779">&quot;Very well. I&apos;ll won&apos;t interfere when you come across a lock.&quot;</string>
<string name="101780">&quot;I will use my skills and spells to open any lock that stands in your way.&quot;</string>
<string name="101781">&quot;Very well. How close would you like me to stay?&quot;</string>
<string name="101782">&quot;As you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="101783">&quot;I&apos;m normally more effective if I use my magic and attack unseen, but if you feel it is best for the group I will now charge forward and attack.&quot;</string>
<string name="101784">&quot;I will take my lead from you in battle, and I will stay as close as your own shadow to protect your back.&quot;</string>
<string name="101785">&quot;Very well. I&apos;ll open my backpack and let you adjust it as you see fit.&quot;</string>
<string name="101786">&quot;I do have some knowledge of such things, though it is hardly my specialty. Let me look through your pack and see if I can identify anything you have not been able to.&quot;</string>
<string name="101787">&quot;My magic is at your disposal. What spell would you like me to cast?&quot;</string>
<string name="101788">&quot;Are you certain?&quot;</string>
<string name="101789">&quot;And who should be the target of my magic?&quot;</string>
<string name="101790">&quot;This should only take a moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="101791">&quot;A wise decision. Many battles are lost because of ill preparation. What type of buffing spells would you like me to cast?&quot;</string>
<string name="101792">&quot;What was the name of the place we went when... well, when we died?&quot;</string>
<string name="101793">&quot;Never mind. It&apos;s not important now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101794">&quot;Never mind. It&apos;s not important now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101795">&quot;Is there anything else you would like to discuss?&quot;</string>
<string name="101796">&quot;I am doing as well as can be expected, though I will feel better when all this is over.&quot;</string>
<string name="101797">&quot;Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?&quot;</string>
<string name="101798">Nathyrra gives you a weary smile. &quot;You needn&apos;t worry about me, my love... though I am eager for this adventure to end. This place brings up memories I would rather forget.&quot;</string>
<string name="101799">&quot;I am feeling strangely optimistic at the moment, though I couldn&apos;t say why. Maybe this is a good omen... or simply the lull before the chaos breaks.&quot;</string>
<string name="101800">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. Do I seem depressed? I suppose I&apos;ve been thinking about things more than I should, dwelling on my past. I should really keep my mind focused on the business at hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="101801">&quot;I haven&apos;t been sleeping well. My dreams are haunted by the faces of all those I have killed. But there is nothing you can do about that. Otherwise I am fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="101802">&quot;I&apos;m eager for our quest to reach an end, but I suppose I&apos;m not the only one. Otherwise, I&apos;m fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="101803">&quot;My sight still has not returned. Though I am used to the dark, I won&apos;t be of much use unless my blindness is cured.&quot;</string>
<string name="101804">&quot;I&apos;ve suffered a few minor wounds, but nothing too extreme. If you get a chance, maybe we could get them tended to.&quot;</string>
<string name="101805">&quot;I&apos;m badly wounded, but not critically. Still, it would be nice to have my injuries tended to before the next encounter.&quot;</string>
<string name="101806">&quot;My injuries are quite severe. If possible, they should be attended to right away.&quot;</string>
<string name="101807">&quot;The poison is still in my system. The sooner we get its effects neutralized, the better.&quot;</string>
<string name="101808">&quot;This disease has left me somewhat the worse for wear. We should get it tended to as soon as possible.&quot;</string>
<string name="101809">&quot;Currently I&apos;m focusing my training exclusively on improving my skills as an assassin and ignoring my training as a mage, as you suggested.&quot;</string>
<string name="101810">&quot;Currently I&apos;m focusing my training exclusively on improving my skills as a mage and ignoring my training as an assassin, as you suggested.&quot;</string>
<string name="101811">&quot;Very well. I&apos;ll work to balance my abilities as both a mage and an assassin. Whenever one class lags behind, I will focus on it exclusively until my abilities are once again balanced.&quot;</string>
<string name="101812">&quot;I am currently trying to find a balance between my magical abilities and my skills as an assassin. Whenever I get behind in one area, I try to become more experienced until the two are balanced.&quot;</string>
<string name="101813">&quot;Of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="101814">&quot;If you feel my skills as an assassin would be more useful than my spells, then I will focus exclusively on gaining experience as an assassin.&quot;</string>
<string name="101815">&quot;If you feel my spells are more valuable to the group than my assassin skills, then I guess I can focus exclusively on gaining more experience as a mage.&quot;</string>
<string name="101816">&quot;So you&apos;ve been thinking about them, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I have, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="101817">&quot;You&apos;ve been thinking about them, my love? I have, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="101818">&quot;If I listen close, I think I can hear them calling me. Some of the voices... some of the voices say my name. I think the souls of my victims are among those lost here.&quot;</string>
<string name="101819">&quot;Nothing. At least, nothing I can put into words. All I get is a sense of great sorrow... and pangs of terrible guilt.&quot;</string>
<string name="101820">&quot;Is it? I killed my victims on the orders of the Valsharess. Who knows how long Mephistopheles was manipulating her. Maybe he was using her to gather souls for him here.&quot;</string>
<string name="101821">&quot;The Red Sisters used ceremonial daggers, daggers with powerful enchantments. Perhaps those spells drew the souls from our victims and brought them to this plane.&quot;</string>
<string name="101822">&quot;Is that what you think this is? Simply a deranged imagination? Look where we are: we&apos;re in the Nine Hells! We are surrounded by lost souls and tormented spirits!&quot;</string>
<string name="101823">&quot;What I hear is real, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know it is. My victims have come back to haunt me with their endless cries.&quot;</string>
<string name="101824">&quot;Yes, though I don&apos;t feel like we are in any danger. Not physical danger, at least. They seem to have come back only to haunt me with their endless cries.&quot;</string>
<string name="101825">&quot;How can I stop it? Look where we are: we&apos;re in the Nine Hells! We are surrounded by lost souls and doomed spirits. My victims have come back to haunt me with their endless cries.&quot;</string>
<string name="101826">The drow&apos;s eyes go as bleak and cold as the land around you. &quot;You don&apos;t have to worry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have learned to live with the ghosts of my past.&quot;</string>
<string name="101827">&quot;I will harden my heart, and ignore their desperate cries. At least until we find a way out of this blasted realm. Hurry, lead on. I don&apos;t want to stay here any longer than we have to.&quot;</string>
<string name="101828">The drow looks at you with disgust in her eyes. &quot;I thought you were a man of compassion, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I thought I could count on you for support when I was weak.&quot;</string>
<string name="101829">&quot;Maybe... maybe you&apos;re not the man I thought you were, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot; She turns her back to you.</string>
<string name="101830">&quot;If there is one thing I have learned about love from bitter experience, it is that in the end it always seems to bring sorrow and betrayal.&quot;</string>
<string name="101831">&quot;I know... I know you speak the truth, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I don&apos;t know if I can shut them out. There are so many of them, so many voices. How can I stand alone against them?&quot;</string>
<string name="101832">The drow looks over at you and nods. &quot;Yes. I can do this. They are just voices, nothing more. They can&apos;t harm me, they only have power over me if I let them.&quot;</string>
<string name="101833">Slowly, Nathyrra regains her composure. &quot;Yes, I am beginning to feel better already. It is... bearable. But I would rather not spend any more time in this place than we have to.&quot;</string>
<string name="101834">&quot;Yes... you are with me. I can draw my strength from you. I... I can do this. They are voices, nothing more. They can&apos;t harm me. Not while you are by my side.&quot;</string>
<string name="101835">Nathyrra is silent for a while as she considers her answer. &quot;When I first joined the Seer, I thought I would go live with her followers on Toril&apos;s surface. I still might do that.&quot;</string>
<string name="101836">&quot;But other times I think that maybe I don&apos;t belong on the surface. Maybe, like the Seer, I should lead expeditions through the Underdark looking for others to save, as I myself was rescued.&quot;</string>
<string name="101837">She gives you a strange look. &quot;That is hardly the type of profession I want to pursue as a follower of Eilistraee. I want to help others trapped in the Underdark find the salvation I did.&quot;</string>
<string name="101838">&quot;Make no mistake, &lt;FirstName&gt;: I am still as capable as I ever was. But I want to use my skills in the service of Eilistraee now. If you think that makes me soft, then you just don&apos;t understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="101839">&quot;I don&apos;t think we have anything further to discuss in this matter. Let&apos;s just get back to our journey.&quot;</string>
<string name="101840">&quot;Maybe... maybe if I can find others who are lost in the darkness, I can help them find their way to a better life. I know how hard it is to escape the cycle of violence here in the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="101841">&quot;Yes, I suppose there are. But sometimes it seems those of us who live beneath the earth have so little hope, so little chance of escape. We need more help than those on the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="101842">&quot;I hope you&apos;re right. I will just have to let the grace of Eilistraee guide me.&quot; She sighs. &quot;This conversation is best saved for later. We should probably get back to our mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="101843">&quot;Unfortunately I don&apos;t think that will happen any time soon. Maybe someday... but until then I will serve Eilistraee as best I can. I&apos;m just not sure how to achieve that goal.&quot;</string>
<string name="101844">&quot;Stay with you? I... I thank you for the offer, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I don&apos;t think it is appropriate. I don&apos;t really want to spend my days following you from adventure to adventure.&quot;</string>
<string name="101845">&quot;When the time comes, I will have to let Eilistraee guide me. But that time is not upon us yet. We still have much to accomplish here. Let&apos;s return to our mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="101846">&quot;I... I have thought about that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Sometimes I think destiny has brought us both here for a reason; I think we are meant to be together.&quot;</string>
<string name="101847">&quot;But other times, I think we will have to go our separate ways. Our paths may cross from time to time, but ultimately we cannot walk the same road. I just... I just don&apos;t know if it will work.&quot;</string>
<string name="101848">&quot;That&apos;s not fair, &lt;FirstName&gt;! It isn&apos;t as simple as that! This is... complicated.&quot;</string>
<string name="101849">&quot;You... you really believe that, don&apos;t you? Maybe... maybe you&apos;re right.&quot; She gives you a warm smile. &quot;You&apos;ve definitely given me something to think about, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="101850">&quot;You... you would do that for me, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I... I don&apos;t know what to say. You&apos;ve certainly given me something to think about...&quot; She trails off, momentarily at a loss for words.</string>
<string name="101851">&quot;This... this isn&apos;t something we should decide right now. We should wait until all this is over. Then I will pray to Eilistraee for guidance and... and we shall see what we shall see.&quot;</string>
<string name="101852">&quot;Let&apos;s get back to our mission. Our enemy isn&apos;t defeated yet; we have to stay focused if we expect to survive.&quot;</string>
<string name="101853">&quot;I will gladly talk about the Lady of Moonlight with you, but I am hardly an expert. I have only recently come to understand her faith.&quot;</string>
<string name="101854">&quot;Eilistraee is the goddess of moonlight and the stars: things the drow no longer see, things we have forgotten. She is also the goddess of mercy, forgiveness and redemption.&quot;</string>
<string name="101855">&quot;All who come to her in search of a better way are welcome. Even one such as I - an assassin stained with a hundred deaths - is accepted. Eilistraee believes we can transcend what we once were.&quot;</string>
<string name="101856">Nathyrra&apos;s eyes grow cold. &quot;You have a right to your opinions. But there is no need to attack something I believe in so strongly with words that are cruel and spiteful.&quot;</string>
<string name="101857">&quot;It&apos;s obvious you don&apos;t really want to learn about Eilistraee, and I&apos;m not here to let you mock my faith for your amusement. Let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101858">&quot;Should the Valsharess be sincere in her desire to convert, she would be welcomed here. But I doubt she will show up to supplicate herself before the Seer anytime soon.&quot;</string>
<string name="101859">&quot;The Seer has the vision to see what is truly in a person&apos;s heart. She can tell if someone is sincere in their faith, or only using the words as a shield to hide their true intent.&quot;</string>
<string name="101860">&quot;That was why I was accepted, despite my past. The Seer could see that I was sincere in my desire to worship Eilistraee and receive her forgiveness.&quot;</string>
<string name="101861">Nathyrra casts her eyes down to the ground. &quot;I... I must be honest with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know the Lady Eilistraee accepts all, but sometimes I feel unworthy of even worshipping her.&quot;</string>
<string name="101862">&quot;There is so much blood on my hands, so much in my life that I look back on in shame. How can I live with myself, knowing all the things I&apos;ve done that I can never take back?&quot;</string>
<string name="101863">&quot;Yes, I suppose... I suppose you are right. Eilistraee accepts me for what I am now, without reservation or judgement. I should try to do the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="101864">&quot;But sometimes the faces of my victims still haunt me. I dream of them. Did you know that? They stare at me with unblinking eyes full of accusation and hatred.&quot;</string>
<string name="101865">&quot;I will try to keep my mind focused on what we are doing here. I won&apos;t let my own self-doubt cripple our mission. I promise you that.&quot;</string>
<string name="101866">&quot;Forgive me, but I don&apos;t feel much like talking about this anymore. Let&apos;s... let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101867">&quot;No, I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;m sorry... this is something I must work through on my own. You cannot help me with this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Nobody can.&quot;</string>
<string name="101868">&quot;That is a question many ask of the followers of Eilistraee. But the answer is simple: we believe in mercy and forgiveness, but we are not fools. We defend ourselves against our enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="101869">&quot;We will not allow ourselves to be tossed into a pit to be devoured by terrible beasts while our enemies laugh and watch. We will martyr ourselves for the cause, but we will not die senselessly.&quot;</string>
<string name="101870">&quot;However, if our enemy sincerely wishes to change, then we will accept them and forgive them for the injuries they have done us in the past. As I said, even a sinner like me can be saved.&quot;</string>
<string name="101871">She shakes her head. &quot;I do not have to earn my way to redemption. Eilistraee absolves me of my past sins because in my heart I know what I did was wrong. Salvation is a gift freely given.&quot;</string>
<string name="101872">&quot;That is what makes Eilistraee different than the other gods. She doesn&apos;t demand that I serve her. But I serve her because I believe in her, and I believe I can help save others.&quot;</string>
<string name="101873">&quot;House Kant&apos;tar is no more, it was destroyed by the Valsharess. When I decided to join the Red Sisters, I realized I would have to accept that and move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101874">&quot;Not if I wanted to survive. Joining the Red Sisters was an opportunity for me to get back some of what I had lost; power, prestige, influence. If that meant allying with my former enemy, so be it.&quot; </string>
<string name="101875">&quot;Of course, once I met the Seer I changed my allegiance to Eilistraee and rejected the Valsharess and my former life.&quot;</string>
<string name="101876">&quot;Why would you say that, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I thought... I thought we understood each other. I thought... I thought we trusted each other. Maybe I was wrong.&quot; Nathyrra sighs and shakes her head. </string>
<string name="101877">&quot;That means a lot to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Especially given what some of the others feel . There are some who see me as an opportunist, jumping from side to side. They don&apos;t realize the truth.&quot;</string>
<string name="101878">&quot;My conversion to Eilistraee is completely different than when I switched my allegiance from House Kant&apos;tar to the Valsharess. That was a move of convenience, the other is a change of belief.&quot;</string>
<string name="101879">&quot;Eilistraee showed me a new way to live my life. I was given a new cobaulth: a new path. I know the way ahead will be difficult, but in my heart I know it is right.&quot;</string>
<string name="101880">Nathyrra looks as if she has been slapped. &quot;I see you are no better than the others,&quot; she says through tightly clenched teeth. &quot;Enough with words, then. Let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101881">The drow seems momentarily taken aback by your words. &quot;I... thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I didn&apos;t expect such support, but I am grateful.&quot;</string>
<string name="101882">She smiles at you warmly. &quot;I know you will, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And I know that whatever may come, it will be easier because you are with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="101883">Nathyrra takes a deep breath before speaking again. &quot;I&apos;m glad we had this conversation, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But we won&apos;t stop our enemy simply by talking. We should really be moving on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101884">&quot;In joining the Seer, I sacrificed all I had gained with the Red Sisters, and I allied myself with the weaker party in this conflict. I wouldn&apos;t have done that if I didn&apos;t truly believe what the Seer stood for.&quot;</string>
<string name="101885">Nathyrra laughs. &quot;You certainly know how to make a girl feel good, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Thank you for the compliment.&quot;</string>
<string name="101886">Nathyrra gives you a shy smile. &quot;I&apos;m glad, too. You understand me. Though we haven&apos;t known each other long, I sense you already know me better than anyone. You believe in me.&quot;</string>
<string name="101887">&quot;You really don&apos;t understand, do you? House Kant&apos;tar was gone, it was less than nothing! Why should I cling to worthless dust when I had a chance to rebuild my life?&quot;</string>
<string name="101888">&quot;Joining the Red Sisters was my chance to gain back much of what I had lost: power, prestige, influence. If the cost of that was allying with a former enemy, then so be it.&quot;</string>
<string name="101889">&quot;Revenge served no purpose in my survival. The Red Sisters gave me back some of what I had lost; power, prestige, influence. The cost of that was allying with my former enemy.&quot;</string>
<string name="101890">&quot;There isn&apos;t a lot to tell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We were assassins, plain and simple. What set the Red Sisters apart was our unique - and often fatal - training methods.&quot;</string>
<string name="101891">She sighs. &quot;Fine, I suppose you&apos;ve earned the right to know something more about me. Very well, I&apos;ll tell you about our training.&quot;</string>
<string name="101892">&quot;Those who enter the Red Sisters&apos; training are hand picked by the Valsharess herself. A class of six students is selected for training. Only one will survive to completion.&quot;</string>
<string name="101893">Nathyrra shrugs. &quot;You were the one who brought it up. If you&apos;d rather not discuss it anymore, then we won&apos;t speak of it again.&quot;</string>
<string name="101894">&quot;I was, though it was hardly a foregone conclusion. If the exercises didn&apos;t kill you, there was a good chance one of the other students might. In fact, eliminating the other students was encouraged.&quot;</string>
<string name="101895">&quot;On the contrary. From the first day we know we are in a fight for our very lives. If the exercises don&apos;t kill you, the other students might. In fact, killing off the competition is encouraged.&quot;</string>
<string name="101896">&quot;Such a highly charged environment ensures that each student performs to the peak of her abilities at all times. It guarantees the survivor is the best of the group.&quot;</string>
<string name="101897">&quot;I came to the training later than most. Some thought my age would be a disadvantage. They thought I would learn and adapt more slowly than my younger rivals.&quot;</string>
<string name="101898">&quot;But I saw my age and experience as an advantage. Before joining the Sisterhood, I had already begun my study into the arts of magic - a distinct advantage over the other students.&quot;</string>
<string name="101899">&quot;Needless to say, the instructors were impressed with my ability to not only use magic, but to use it to my best advantage.&quot;</string>
<string name="101900">&quot;Each student in the training was given a name that signified their skills and abilities. My name was Alurl Faen. In your tongue it means best wizard.&quot;</string>
<string name="101901">&quot;There was only one other student with the skills to pose any threat to me: Velkyn Velde - Hidden Blade. Within a few months the others were dead - two by her hand, two by mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="101902">&quot;Velkyn and I were constantly trying to kill each other off. But we were both careful and cunning, and we reached the end of the training with both of us still alive.&quot;</string>
<string name="101903">&quot;The night before our graduation we were told that we would meet each other the next morning in one of the training rooms for a final showdown.&quot;</string>
<string name="101904">&quot;The instructors explicitly forbid us from trying to kill each other on that final night: they wanted us to be well rested for the next day&apos;s confrontation.&quot;</string>
<string name="101905">&quot;But I knew I was no match for her in single combat. She was too quick; I wouldn&apos;t even have a chance to use my magic. So that night I slipped out of my room, crept into hers and slit her throat.&quot;</string>
<string name="101906">&quot;So? When the morning came, she was dead. The instructors were angry I had disobeyed them, but they had no other students left alive. They had no choice but to graduate me.&quot;</string>
<string name="101907">&quot;The only thing I cheated was death. I had survived longer than the other students. That was the whole point of the training. Of course, I&apos;ve changed my opinions somewhat since I joined the Seer.&quot; </string>
<string name="101908">&quot;At the time, I was quite proud of myself. But I could never do such terrible things now. &quot; She shakes her head, dispelling the memories. &quot;Perhaps we should just get back to the task at hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="101909">&quot;I do... although I have changed in many ways since I converted to the worship of Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="101910">Nathyrra laughs. &quot;I doubt that would help, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I was very good at what I did. But you can sleep soundly now... I&apos;m not the person I used to be.&quot;</string>
<string name="101911">&quot;But enough of my stories. We still have much to do; we should get back to our quest.&quot;</string>
<string name="101912">&quot;That would have gone against everything the Red Sisters stood for. Instead, they told us we would meet in the morning in one of the training rooms for a final showdown.&quot;</string>
<string name="101913">&quot;Who said anything about fair? My life was at stake! Besides, we were trained to use whatever resources we have at our disposal. If anything, the instructors admired my use of spells.&quot;</string>
<string name="101914">She flashes you a predatory grin. &quot;And I have more assets than you could possibly imagine!&quot;</string>
<string name="101915">&quot;Actually, I&apos;d like to know something about you. When all this is over, what do you plan to do next? I mean... you will go back to the surface, won&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="101916">&quot;Well, I guess you should know that I&apos;m starting to understand why the Valsharess is afraid of you... and why the Seer has so much faith in you.&quot;</string>
<string name="101917">&quot;There is something I can tell you. I&apos;ve been watching you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;ve been observing how you handle yourself. You remind me of someone I used to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="101918">&quot;More about me? Well, I was reluctant to say anything before, as I barely knew you. But now that we are working together, you have a right to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="101919">&quot;As you wish. I hope we will get a chance to speak later, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="101920">Nathyrra gives you an icy glare. &quot;I was referring to something here that goes beyond the physical. I feel the frozen chill of the lost souls that are trapped all around us.&quot;</string>
<string name="101921">&quot;Yes, I suppose the sooner we find a way back to the prime material plane the better. I am eager to leave this world behind: it dredges up memories I would rather leave behind.&quot;</string>
<string name="101922">&quot;Surely you can feel them, too. They are like shadows of ghosts, they barely even exist. But if you listen you can hear them, like the whisper of a forgotten echo.&quot;</string>
<string name="101923">&quot;It&apos;s been growing stronger ever since we got to this plane. It&apos;s like they&apos;re trying to speak to us. To tell us something... but I can&apos;t quite make it out. Not yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="101924">The drow stands for a second, her head tilted to the side, listening. &quot;I can almost... no. It&apos;s gone. Maybe it would be best if we just kept going.&quot;</string>
<string name="101925">&quot;No? Are you certain? If you just listen... no, they&apos;ve gone silent. For now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101926">Nathyrra gives you a strange look. &quot;Maybe... maybe you&apos;re right.&quot; She pulls her arms tight against herself and shivers. &quot;Let&apos;s keep moving. Please.&quot;</string>
<string name="101927">Nathyrra gives you a strange look. &quot;Maybe... maybe you&apos;re right.&quot; She shivers and pulls you close, drawing on your warmth. After a few seconds she lets you go and says, &quot;Let&apos;s keep moving. Please.&quot;</string>
<string name="101928">The drow stands for a second, her head tilted to the side, listening. &quot;No, I don&apos;t think they&apos;re trying to warn us... it&apos;s almost like... no, it&apos;s gone. They&apos;ve gone silent, for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101929">Nathyrra pulls her arms tight against herself and shivers. &quot;Let&apos;s keep moving. Please.&quot;</string>
<string name="101930">She shivers and pulls you close, drawing on your warmth. After a few seconds she lets you go and says, &quot;Let&apos;s keep moving. Please.&quot;</string>
<string name="101931">&quot;No, I suppose not. But there is something here that goes beyond the physical. I feel the frozen chill of the lost souls that are trapped all around us.&quot;</string>
<string name="101932">&quot;Is that all you think about, even here in this frozen wasteland? I might find your clumsy attempts to flatter me more admirable if they weren&apos;t so horribly inappropriate.&quot;</string>
<string name="101933">&quot;Besides, I was not speaking of simple physical warmth. The cold I was referring to goes far deeper. It is the frozen chill of the lost souls, trapped all around us.&quot;</string>
<string name="101934">Nathyrra arches her eyebrow playfully. &quot;I&apos;m glad you find it attractive, but I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s worth getting frostbite over.&quot;</string>
<string name="101935">Aribeth rolls her eyes. &quot;Could you two at least have the decency to conduct your coy lovers&apos; banter in private? This place is unbearable enough as it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="101936">Nathyrra pointedly ignores the elf&apos;s attempted jibe. &quot;Actually, the cold I was referring to goes far deeper than the flesh. It is the frozen chill of the lost souls, trapped all around us.&quot;</string>
<string name="101937">&quot;We haven&apos;t known each other very long, but we&apos;ve been through a lot together. I know you were forced into helping us against the Valsharess, but even so I&apos;m still grateful for all you did.&quot;</string>
<string name="101938">&quot;Are you really that self-serving? Do you even care that Mephistopheles is likely raining destruction down on Waterdeep right now?&quot;</string>
<string name="101939">&quot;Well, at least you aren&apos;t totally self-serving. I suppose we don&apos;t really have much else to talk about, though. Let&apos;s just focus on getting out of this damned plane and stopping him.&quot;</string>
<string name="101940">&quot;I see. Well then, I suppose we don&apos;t really have much to talk about, after all. Let&apos;s just focus on getting out of this damned plane and then we can go our separate ways.&quot; </string>
<string name="101941">&quot;I believe you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Just as I believe you&apos;ll find a way to stop Mephistopheles and free us from this plane. You are a great hero... maybe the greatest ever.&quot;</string>
<string name="101942">&quot;That is true, but if anyone can find a way to stop him, I know it&apos;s you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You proved you were a true hero against the Valsharess, and I know you&apos;ll find a way out of this, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="101943">&quot;But you&apos;re more than just a hero to me. I&apos;m used to living alone, hidden in the shadows. I... I don&apos;t have many friends. But I consider you a friend, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="101944">She smiles, a look of relief on her face. &quot;I&apos;m glad to hear you say that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We&apos;re going to need all the friends we can get in a place like this.&quot;</string>
<string name="101945">&quot;Now let&apos;s find a way to get ourselves the Hell out of here!&quot;</string>
<string name="101946">&quot;M-more than friends? I... I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I care for you, but only as a friend. I don&apos;t... I don&apos;t really know you well enough to feel anything more.&quot;</string>
<string name="101947">&quot;Maybe... maybe I shouldn&apos;t have said anything. I didn&apos;t want to... I mean, I never intended to... I&apos;m sorry.&quot; She turns away, flustered.</string>
<string name="101948">&quot;You&apos;re angry. If I did anything to make you think I felt anything more than friendship for you, I&apos;m sorry. I just hope that when you calm down, we can still be friends. Let&apos;s... let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101949">Nathyrra looks distinctly uncomfortable. She can&apos;t even meet your eyes as she says, &quot;Yes. That&apos;s probably for the best. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101950">She looks up at you, her expression one of mingled relief and sorrow. &quot;I wish I felt differently, &lt;FirstName&gt;... but I don&apos;t. Let&apos;s... let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101951">She smiles, and casts her eyes downwards. You can&apos;t be sure but you think she might be blushing. She takes a second to compose herself then continues.</string>
<string name="101952">&quot;Yes, of course. You&apos;re right. I&apos;m sorry, I don&apos;t know what came over me. Until we&apos;ve defeated the Valsharess, there&apos;s no point in wondering what my future holds. It can only confuse things.&quot;</string>
<string name="101953">&quot;Sometimes I think boring is what I&apos;m looking for. My life is full of excitement: I can&apos;t seem to avoid it. Maybe up on the surface I can finally find the peace I seek.&quot;</string>
<string name="101954">&quot;So I have heard. The Seer has warned me that we drow will always face suspicion and hatred up there. But is it any worse than the death and betrayal we live with down here?&quot;</string>
<string name="101955">Nathyrra shakes her head. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I shouldn&apos;t be dreaming about a future on the surface while we still have to defeat the Valsharess. It can only complicate things.&quot;</string>
<string name="101956">&quot;Let&apos;s... let&apos;s just get on with the adventure.&quot;</string>
<string name="101957">&quot;I have heard of its many wonders: the sun, the wind, the rain. It is hard for me to even imagine such things. I find them both exciting and terrifying at the same time.&quot;</string>
<string name="101958">&quot;Your overzealous confidence is inspiring, yet it is also vaguely disturbing. Still, it is nice to see some tangible proof that my faith has not been misplaced.&quot;</string>
<string name="101959">Nathyrra casts her eyes downwards. &quot;Sometimes I wonder where I would be had I not converted to the faith of Eilistraee. I imagine what would have happened if I had actually killed the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="101960">Nathyrra looks surprised. &quot;Have I not told you this tale yet? When I was one of the Red Sisters, back when I still served the Valsharess, I was sent to kill the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="101961">&quot;No? Well, I suppose you can figure the details on your own anyway. Suffice to say, I came to kill the Seer, but instead I converted to the faith of Eilistraee.&quot; </string>
<string name="101962">&quot;But since you seem to believe we are so pressed for time, then I guess we should be moving on.&quot;</string>
<string name="101963">&quot;This was less than a year ago, shortly after the Valsharess transcended the ambitions of the other Matron Mothers and began her true rise to power.&quot;</string>
<string name="101964">&quot;The Seer had been leading expeditions into the Underdark. She and her followers came to spread the teachings of Eilistraee, and to aid those who wanted to escape to the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="101965">&quot;Several important agents in the service of the Valsharess converted at the Seer&apos;s urging and abandoned their former mistress. Obviously, the Valsharess could not allow this to continue.&quot;</string>
<string name="101966">&quot;I was one of the Valsharess&apos; top assassins: ambitious and capable. She told me that if I brought her the Seer&apos;s head, she would make me a trainer within the Red Sisters - a great honor.&quot;</string>
<string name="101967">&quot;I began by studying the teaching of Eilistraee; I wanted to know the enemy I faced. The lessons they taught were strange to me: mercy, compassion, forgiveness, redemption.&quot;</string>
<string name="101968">&quot;At the time, I thought these things to be nothing but foolish ideals and dismissed them out of hand. I saw them only as a way to gain an advantage over my target.&quot;</string>
<string name="101969">&quot;You may be right. Strange as the teachings of Eilistraee were, the seeds of my conversion had been planted in my mind... though I didn&apos;t even know it myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="101970">&quot;I infiltrated the Seer&apos;s camp, posing as a would-be convert. It was a simple matter to arrange a face-to-face meeting with my victim. To my surprise, I was even allowed to meet with her alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="101971">&quot;Alone with the Seer, I pulled my blade and moved forward to strike her down. She sat there, motionless. There was no fear in her eyes, no surprise. It was as if she had expected this.&quot;</string>
<string name="101972">&quot;I meant to kill her, yet for some reason she wasn&apos;t afraid of death. I had never seen that before. And something stayed my hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="101973">&quot;It may have been divine intervention by Eilistraee herself, or perhaps it was my own conscience. Whatever the reason, my hand was paralyzed, my blade frozen in my grip.&quot;</string>
<string name="101974">&quot;The Seer looked at me and said: You must choose, Nathyrra. Strike me down, and the Valsharess will shower you with riches. Or let me live, and be redeemed at the feet of the Lady Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="101975">&quot;The strange paralysis holding my hand was broken, my will was once more my own. And instead of striking her down I knelt before her, and laid my knife at her feet.&quot;</string>
<string name="101976">&quot;Yes, of course. We won&apos;t stop the Valsharess with mere words. Come, let us go.&quot;</string>
<string name="101977">Nathyrra gives you a strange look. &quot;Then I guess we must be grateful it was I in that position and not you. Had I killed the Seer, it is unlikely any of us would still be alive to oppose the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="101978">&quot;But enough of this. We must continue on our adventure and find a way to stop the Valsharess. Nothing else matters right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="101979">&quot;Yes, since that day I have devoted myself to the Seer and the Lady Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="101980">&quot;Perhaps, though at the time I was not aware of her gift. All I knew was that, for the first time, my victim was not afraid of death. And though I meant to kill her, something stayed my hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="101981">&quot;No, and I suppose I might not really have felt that way even back then. Studying the teachings of Eilistraee planted the seeds of my conversion in my heart and mind... though I was unaware of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="101982">&quot;No, my faith in the Seer and Eilistraee has always been strong. However, it is nice to see some tangible proof of our beliefs.&quot;</string>
<string name="101983">&quot;Yes, and I share her faith. Still, it is nice to see some tangible proof of our beliefs.&quot;</string>
<string name="101984">&quot;I&apos;ve been watching you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;ve been observing how you handle yourself. You remind me of someone I used to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="101985">&quot;This is hardly spying, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We&apos;re working together, it&apos;s only natural to be curious about each other. I&apos;ve been observing you, just as I&apos;m certain you&apos;ve been observing me.&quot;</string>
<string name="101986">&quot;Like Seelamin, you have an air of authority about you. Even as a slave, Seelamin&apos;s mere presence commanded respect. &lt;He/She&gt; was a leader... as are you.&quot;</string>
<string name="101987">&quot;You remind me of Seelamin, a servant I knew before I joined the Red Sisters. &lt;He/She&gt; was a &lt;class&gt;, like you... and a surfacer. House Kant&apos;tar - my house - purchased &lt;him/her&gt; at a slave auction.&quot;</string>
<string name="101988">&quot;Seelamin was unlike any of the other servants. &lt;He/She&gt; had an air of authority; even as a slave &lt;his/her&gt; mere presence commanded respect. Seelamin was a leader... as are you.&quot; </string>
<string name="101989">&quot;No, I suppose you don&apos;t. Besides, Seelamin is part of my past. &lt;He/She&gt; has been dead for many years; &lt;he/she&gt; was killed when House Kant&apos;tar fell to the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="101990">&quot;Yes, I suppose you are right. That part of my life is gone. Seelamin has been dead many years; &lt;he/she&gt; was killed when House Kant&apos;tar fell to the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="101991">&quot;Seelamin has been dead for many years. &lt;He/She&gt; was killed when House Kant&apos;tar fell to the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="101992">Nathyrra nods. &quot;House Kant&apos;tar was one of the first to fall to the Valsharess. This was many, many years ago. At the time, she was simply another ambitious drow Matron Mother - indistinguishable from any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="101993">&quot;No, though I can see how you might think that given my association with the Red Sisters. But I didn&apos;t join them until much, much later.&quot;</string>
<string name="101994">&quot;I was the youngest daughter of Mother Vassena, Matron of House Kant&apos;tar. When our House fell, the Valsharess expected that I and all my sisters would be slain along with the Matron.&quot;</string>
<string name="101995">&quot;I didn&apos;t, at first. I was the youngest daughter of Mother Vassena, Matron of House Kant&apos;tar. When our House fell, the Valsharess expected I and all my sisters would be slain along with the Matron.&quot;</string>
<string name="101996">&quot;But though I was young, I was already well versed in the politics of the drow. I had allies outside House Kant&apos;tar who helped me escape when the rest of my family perished.&quot;</string>
<string name="101997">&quot;Very well. The Valsharess sent the Red Sisters to hunt me down and kill me, but whenever one found me it was she who ended up dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="101998">&quot;I killed so many of the Red Sisters that the Valsharess finally invited me to join her. I was tired of living a life on the run, and so I accepted her offer.&quot;</string>
<string name="101999">The drow scowls at you. &quot;Yes, my tale is over. Obviously you want to stay focused on our mission. Very well, let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102000">&quot;Yes, I suppose this really isn&apos;t the best time to discuss this. If you want to speak to me about this later on, just let me know. Until then, let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102001">&quot;Family doesn&apos;t count for much among the drow. In time I would have plotted to kill Matron Vassena and my sisters so I could rule House Kant&apos;tar. My sisters would have done the same. It is our way.&quot;</string>
<string name="102002">&quot;With House Kant&apos;tar&apos;s fall, my dreams of Matronhood were destroyed. But I still had ambition, I still sought to better my station and improve my life. The Red Sisters offered my only viable alternative.&quot;</string>
<string name="102003">&quot;A bit, yes. But you have to understand the drow mind. I was worth more to her alive than dead. The Valsharess was ambitious, she wouldn&apos;t willingly throw away such a potentially valuable ally.&quot;</string>
<string name="102004">&quot;But this really isn&apos;t the time to discuss this. We need to focus on stopping the Valsharess. If you want, we can talk about this more later.&quot;</string>
<string name="102005">&quot;A bit, yes. But you have to understand the drow mind. I was worth more to her alive than dead. The Valsharess was ambitious, she wouldn&apos;t willingly throw away such a potentially valuable ally.&quot;</string>
<string name="102006">&quot;Family doesn&apos;t count for much among the drow. In time I would have plotted to kill Matron Vassena and my sisters so I could rule House Kant&apos;tar. My sisters would have done the same. It is our way.&quot;</string>
<string name="102007">&quot;I was a dobluth - an outcast in your tongue - a drow with no House. I was constantly on the run, trying to stay one step ahead of the assassins the Valsharess sent after me: the Red Sisters.&quot;</string>
<string name="102008">&quot;The Red Sisters are very good at what they do; wherever I fled they found me. Of course, I am also very good, and each time I was discovered it was one of them who ended up dead, not me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102009">&quot;After dozens of her most valuable agents had died at my hand, the Valsharess realized I would make a better ally than an enemy. She invited me to join the Red Sisters, and I accepted.&quot;</string>
<string name="102010">The drow laughs. &quot;Very forward of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;... though I admit I find you strangely intriguing. But that wasn&apos;t what I meant.&quot;</string>
<string name="102011">The drow laughs. &quot;In all honesty you aren&apos;t what most people would call handsome, &lt;FirstName&gt;... though I do find you strangely intriguing. But that really wasn&apos;t what I meant.&quot;</string>
<string name="102012">The drow laughs. &quot;I&apos;ll admit you have certain charms that most women would find... appealing. I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not the first to tell you so. But that wasn&apos;t what I meant.&quot;</string>
<string name="102013">&quot;There is something you should know about me. I was reluctant to say anything before, as I barely knew you. But now that we are working together, you have a right to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="102014">&quot;As you may have heard, I was an assassin before I came to serve the Seer... a common enough profession among the drow. But I was no ordinary assassin; I served as one of the Red Sisters.&quot;</string>
<string name="102015">&quot;I don&apos;t think you fully grasp the importance of what I am trying to tell you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102016">&quot;The Red Sisters is an elite group of assassins sworn to the service of the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="102017">The drow shakes her head sadly. &quot;Even after all we have been through, even after I helped you with Halaster, you still don&apos;t trust me, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="102018">&quot;I suppose I shouldn&apos;t be surprised. You aren&apos;t the first to doubt my loyalty to the Seer, even though I have become a follower of Eilistraee and turned my back on the evil of the Valsharess.&quot; </string>
<string name="102019">&quot;I have risked my life time and time again to stop the Valsharess, I have done everything the Seer has asked of me and more, and still I must bear the burden of others&apos; suspicion.&quot;</string>
<string name="102020">Nathyrra spits in anger. &quot;You&apos;re as bad as all the rest. What do I have to do to prove myself? The Seer believes in me; she trusts me. Why can&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="102021">&quot;My knowledge of the Valsharess has proven valuable to the Seer and her followers, and for this I am glad. But because of my former allegiance, there are some who still view me with suspicion.&quot;</string>
<string name="102022">&quot;Then you are a fool. Who knows the Underdark better than I do? Who knows the agents of the Valsharess better? You need me at your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="102023">&quot;Good. Watch me. Maybe then you&apos;ll see that I am doing everything possible to stop the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="102024">&quot;If my words can&apos;t convince you of my loyalty to the Seer and her cause, then I hope my actions can.&quot;</string>
<string name="102025">The drow smiles. &quot;Really? I... I was afraid that when I told you of my past that you might refuse to work with me. You wouldn&apos;t be the first.&quot;</string>
<string name="102026">The drow lets out a long sigh. &quot;I&apos;m glad we had this discussion, &lt;FirstName&gt;; now that you know the truth about my past, we can be completely focused on stopping the Valsharess. Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102027">She sighs. &quot;No, I suppose I can&apos;t. But Eilistraee teaches us that redemption is possible for us all. At least the Seer believes in me. I know she trusts me. I suppose that will have to be enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="102028">&quot;I did, but those days are behind me now. The Seer has shown me a better way, and I have become a follower of Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="102029">The drow smiles. &quot;Now you sound like the Seer. But sometimes our history is not so easily ignored. I don&apos;t think you fully understand what I&apos;m telling you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102030">--------- Romance Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="102031">She shrugs, looking away. &quot;I... never mind. Perhaps I should have said nothing. It will be good to get away from this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="102032">For a long moment, Nathyrra looks about the area, her eyes haunted. When she turns back she notices you looking at her and she blushes slightly.</string>
<string name="102033">&quot;No, I suppose it isn&apos;t. Maybe we can talk about this after we use Mephistopheles&apos; True Name to send him back to the Hells where he belongs.&quot;</string>
<string name="102034">&quot;Deekin&apos;s True Name! What&apos;s it you want me to be doing, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="102035">&quot;Nothing? Nothing at all? Well that&apos;s a waste of a True Name, if you ask Deekin. How much did you spend on that again, boss? Oh well, we gots an adventure to finish, so hurry up.&quot;</string>
<string name="102036">&quot;Boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="102037">&quot;Yes, boss. Deekin will be all right... Really sad, but all right. Are you planning on dying, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="102038">&quot;Yes, boss. Deekin believe in himself. Anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="102039">&quot;Uh... Boss? Deekin kinda needs that soul. It&apos;s the only one he&apos;s got, see? Are you sure that&apos;s what you be wanting?&quot;</string>
<string name="102040">&quot;Oh phew! You had Deekin scared for a second there, boss. Maybe these True Names aren&apos;t so much fun after all... Have you gots any other commands for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102041">&quot;Eeek... Okay, boss, here goes nothing... G&apos;bye... So long and thanks for all the fish... Don&apos;t let the gate hits you on the way out... AieeeeeEEEEeeee!&quot;</string>
<string name="102042">Valen&apos;s eyes grow wide as he hears the words. &quot;My True Name,&quot; he acknowledges, his eyes filled with a mixture of indignation and awe. &quot;How do you... intend to command me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102043">He sneers at you with disgust. &quot;You would force me to love you, my lady? After all we have been through?&quot;</string>
<string name="102044">Valen looks at you curiously, as if he didn&apos;t quite understand what you said... and then suddenly his eyes go wide. He stiffens, an electrical current running through his body violently.</string>
<string name="102045">A moment later, he spasms as a strange, black sheen seemingly lifts from his body and is dispersed. When he opens his eyes there is something... different about him. The otherworldly aura, the rage within his soul... all of it is gone.</string>
<string name="102046">&quot;I... I can&apos;t believe it!&quot; He looks at himself with incredulity, slowly smiling. &quot;The taint... it&apos;s gone! I feel... I feel wonderful! I feel human!!&quot; Laughing joyously, Valen hugs you. &quot;Thank you! Thank you for this wonderful gift!&quot;</string>
<string name="102047">Valen&apos;s eyes flash a dangerous red. &quot;Take my soul,&quot; he growls, &quot;and that will be the end of me. Forever. Are you certain that is what you wish?&quot;</string>
<string name="102048">Valen nods, relieved. &quot;Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Please... ask nothing more of me, I beg you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102049">Before your eyes, Valen begins to shake violently. He screams in pure rage and agony as his vital essence is suddenly stripped away, his physical form fading away to so much dust. Valen&apos;s soul is now yours.</string>
<string name="102050">He stares at you in confusion. &quot;I am grateful, my lady, but... you would force me to love you? Even though that is not truly love at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="102051">He looks away, unwilling to look you in the eyes. &quot;Will there be anything else, my lady?&quot;</string>
<string name="102052">Valen stares at you with his intense blue eyes, clenching his jaw. &quot;So be it... my love. Your mastery over me knows no bounds. Should I ever free myself, however... I will kill you. Trust me on that.&quot;</string>
<string name="102053">Valen&apos;s eyes show only relief. &quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am grateful. Now... we should go through the gate as soon as possible if we are to rescue your Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="102054">He glares at you, his eyes burning a dark red... but he says nothing. Slowly, his gauntleted fists clench and unclench.</string>
<string name="102055">Valen struggles to resist your command, but finally gives in. He leans in, kissing you tenderly on the lips with his eyes closed. When you part, tears are streaming down his cheeks.</string>
<string name="102056">&quot;I hope this makes you happy, my lady,&quot; he spits. He refuses to look you in the eyes.</string>
<string name="102057">He stops and gazes into your eyes, his expression suddenly loving. Leaning in he kisses you softly. &quot;I suppose that there is.&quot;</string>
<string name="102058">&quot;Waterdeep awaits us, my love. The longer we wait here, the more people are hurt by Mephistopheles... he must be stopped.&quot;</string>
<string name="102059">His smile comes easily to him now. &quot;You have no idea, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It... it is as if a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders.&quot;</string>
<string name="102060">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can never repay you for this. Now... we should go through the gate as soon as possible if we are to rescue your Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="102061">&quot;No... Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, do not do this...&quot;</string>
<string name="102062">&quot;But what I did was wrong! Countless innocents died by my actions and countless friends as well. To feel no guilt, no remorse, is to become cold to the world. It would be inhuman. Is that what you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102063">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The ability to take responsibility for my past is the only dignity that still remains to me... Is there anything you would ask in its stead?&quot;</string>
<string name="102064">&quot;I suppose the gods have their mysteries. But what is commanded in their tongue must have their sanction, for good or ill. By your command, I am atoned... Is there anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="102065">&quot;Then I will not suffer, you have my word. It shall be as you command. Is there anything more you would ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102066">&quot;A curse, then, upon your descendants. May they each come to know despair... It will be as you command. Have you any other sufferings to heap upon me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102067">&quot;My soul? But that is all I have! I know not what power it might grant you but, without it, I will join the Lost... Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="102068">&quot;For that, I thank you. Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, stop this madness! For my sake, I beg you, ask nothing more...&quot;</string>
<string name="102069">&quot;As you command, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="102070">&quot;But I am a paladin again, something I could not have achieved without you! ...Yet this is your command and I must obey... Damn you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, let there be nothing more you would ask of me!&quot;</string>
<string name="102071">&quot;But how can it be love? ...Alas, you have commanded me and I will love you in whatever fashion I am able until the end of my days... Is there anything else you demand of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102072">&quot;No... What are you doing? How dare you!&quot;</string>
<string name="102073">&quot;Good, I am glad you have come to your senses. Now let us hurry, Mephistopheles awaits.&quot;</string>
<string name="102074">&quot;Don&apos;t be silly, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You don&apos;t need to command me by my True Name for that! To the contrary, I revel in it. The books of history will remember me as a great evil... Anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="102075">&quot;My soul? But that is all I have! I know not what power it might grant you but, without it, I will join the Lost... Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="102076">&quot;For that, I thank you. Is there anything else you would force upon me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102077">&quot;As you command, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="102078">&quot;But I am a blackguard, a path I chose on your advice! ...But you leave me no choice. I will do as you command... Please let there be nothing more you would ask of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102079">&quot;My... My lord? ...You have commanded me and I will love you in whatever fashion I am able until the end of my days... Is there anything else you demand of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102080">&quot;Yes, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="102081">&quot;My True Name... What... what do you intend to do with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102082">&quot;I... I am relieved. Now hurry, we must go through the gate and return to Toril. If we wait much longer, Mephistopheles will destroy all of Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="102083">A look of fear creeps into her dark-veiled eyes. &quot;But if I give you my soul, it will be the death of me. I would be nothing but dust without it... Are you sure of what you ask, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="102084">&quot;Thank you for that small mercy, my Lord. I beg you, though, ask nothing more of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102085">The drow screams as her vital essence is ripped away. Before your eyes she ages a thousand years, her skin wrinkling, her eyes sinking, her body withering into a pile of bones and dust. Nathyrra&apos;s soul is now yours. </string>
<string name="102086">The drow&apos;s head snaps back and she lets out a cry of pain and despair. She speaks through tightly clenched teeth: &quot;You would force me to love you? What kind of beast are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="102087">&quot;My True Name gives you mastery over me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am compelled to obey, no matter how you abuse your power. But if I ever find a way to break free, I will kill you! ...Now what more abuse have you in store for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102088">She spits on the ground in disgust, but she can do nothing else against the power of her True Name. &quot;Will that be all?&quot;</string>
<string name="102089">She lets out a cry of rage, but does as you command. When the kiss is over, she turns away, unable to face you. It&apos;s obvious you&apos;ve broken her spirit utterly.</string>
<string name="102090">&quot;You&apos;ve made your point, &lt;FirstName&gt;,&quot; she says in a fierce whisper. &quot;Now we must find out if your power over Mephistopheles is as absolute as your power over me. What more do you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102091">Nathyrra&apos;s eyes open wide in surprise. She seems about to object, then she bows her head. When she looks up, there is a strange expression on her face.</string>
<string name="102092">&quot;My... my guilt is gone,&quot; she says, amazed. &quot;It has vanished, as if it never existed. I... I&apos;m free. Thank you for this, &lt;FirstName&gt;; you have given me a gift unlike any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="102093">&quot;But despite your kindness, I still find this... unsettling. The power of a True Name is a great responsibility - one I hope you will not abuse. Is there anything more you wish of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102094">The drow stiffens. &quot;I wish it was as easy as you make it sound, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I can&apos;t pretend my past never happened. I have to live with the knowledge of what I&apos;ve done.&quot;</string>
<string name="102095">&quot;I see. Well, that&apos;s the last you&apos;ll hear from me, then. I wouldn&apos;t want to get in the way when you banish Mephistopheles back to the Hells where he belongs.&quot;</string>
<string name="102096">&quot;No... no, I suppose you can&apos;t. This is my problem, and I must find some way to deal with it - after we do our best to defeat Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="102097">&quot;I want to forgive myself. I know I&apos;m not the person I was before, and I know Eilistraee has forgiven me. But I just don&apos;t know if I&apos;m able to.&quot;</string>
<string name="102098">&quot;Yes, I suppose I will. In time.&quot; She sighs and shakes her head. &quot;I&apos;m sorry... I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m bringing this up now, even as Mephistopheles is wreaking havoc on Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="102099">&quot;It must be this plane. It does strange things to me. Let&apos;s... let&apos;s get out of here so you can send Mephistopheles back to the Hells where he belongs.&quot;</string>
<string name="102100">&quot;No, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you can&apos;t keep doing this! You can&apos;t keep appeasing us with professions of your love. You have to choose: her or me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102101">&quot;See what your jealousy has wrought, drow!? You&apos;re still a selfish little girl! Just because you have breasts doesn&apos;t make you a woman... May the gods take mercy on your folly!&quot;</string>
<string name="102102">&quot;Save your sermons for the pulpit, ghost. You&apos;d best be long gone once &lt;FirstName&gt; and I are done with Mephistopheles because my tolerance for your preaching ends as soon as his blood flows...&quot;</string>
<string name="102103">&quot;You insolent... male! If this were the Underdark, I would kill you for such words! That door is my ticket to the surface, now, nothing else... And to think I fell in love with such a worm as you...&quot;</string>
<string name="102104">&quot;I suppose we have no time for delay, &lt;FirstName&gt;... A great evil lurks in Toril. We must shine heaven&apos;s light upon it and sap away its power. Come, let us make our peace with the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="102105">&quot;Very well... If you&apos;re fool enough to fall for her, then who am I to end your folly? I&apos;m walking through that door for my own reasons, not for yours... Perhaps that&apos;s as it should be anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="102106">&quot;If things were as they should be, you would not be returning at all, ghost... Come, my love, duty waits for us back on Toril. I want to see this surface world you have told me so much about.&quot;</string>
<string name="102107">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You have what, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Well this has been a nice little game but consider it over! If I step through that door, it&apos;s because I have unfinished business in Toril, not for you...&quot;</string>
<string name="102108">&quot;You insolent... male! If this were the Underdark, I would kill you for such words! That door is my ticket to the surface, now, nothing else... And to think I fell in love with such a worm as you...&quot;</string>
<string name="102109">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;See, Aribeth? He has room for both of us in his bed! What is it that you so afraid of?&quot;</string>
<string name="102110">&quot;It seems wrong somehow but I love you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. &apos;Tis better to have half your heart than none at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="102111">&quot;How many women *do* you love, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I seem to remember hearing similar words from your lips.&quot;</string>
<string name="102112">&quot;See what your jealousy has wrought, drow!? You&apos;re still a selfish little girl! Just because you have breasts doesn&apos;t make you a woman... I should have killed you when I first laid eyes on you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102113">&quot;Well you&apos;d better do it before &lt;FirstName&gt; and I are done with Mephistopheles because my tolerance for you ends as soon as his blood flows...&quot;</string>
<string name="102114">&quot;You insolent... male! If this were the Underdark, I would kill you for such words! That door is my ticket to the surface, now, nothing else... And to think I fell in love with such a worm as you...&quot;</string>
<string name="102115">&quot;Then let us tear these devils from our backs and slay them, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Toril is ours by right. We show no mercy. We take no prisoners. We return home and we return to conquer...&quot;</string>
<string name="102116">&quot;Very well... If you&apos;re fool enough to fall for her, then knock yourself out. I&apos;m walking through that door for my own reasons, not for yours... All this talk of love is enough to make me sick.&quot;</string>
<string name="102117">&quot;Then go be sick and may you choke on it, ghost... Come, lover, duty waits for us back on Toril. I want to see this surface world you have told me so much about.&quot;</string>
<string name="102118">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You have what, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Well this has been a nice little game but consider it over! If I step through that door, it&apos;s because I have unfinished business in Toril, not for you...&quot;</string>
<string name="102119">&quot;You insolent... male! If this were the Underdark, I would kill you for such words! That door is my ticket to the surface, now, nothing else... And to think I fell in love with such a worm as you...&quot;</string>
<string name="102120">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You can&apos;t compete with me, Nathyrra, so you might as well join me. I don&apos;t bite. It&apos;s really more of a nibble, isn&apos;t it, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="102121">&quot;If you&apos;re looking to shock me, Aribeth, try again. In case you&apos;ve been too busy to notice, I am a drow, after all... Let us share this male, then, and fight about him later.&quot;</string>
<string name="102122">&quot;Come, &lt;FirstName&gt;, every second we delay here is another second before I see this surface world of yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="102123">&quot;Why elven lady be so sad? Deekin thinks this be best part of great adventure! The boss be greatest boss ever!&quot;</string>
<string name="102124">&quot;You are correct, Deekin. &lt;FirstName&gt; is a fine &apos;boss&apos; and has done well by us. I am simply... eager to leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="102125">&quot;Well, Deekin just wants to thanks boss. Deekin gots lots of notes now for next book, and all his pages not even be burnt away!&quot;</string>
<string name="102126">Deekin looks at Nathyrra more closely. She doesn&apos;t appear to be listening, so he tugs on her armor. &quot;You still looks sad to Deekin. What be wrong?&quot;</string>
<string name="102127">&quot;I know I shall be more than glad to be away from here. Remaining this long in Baator has not been easy.&quot;</string>
<string name="102128">&quot;No, it has not, has it? I have seen the fire behind your eyes, Valen. This place haunts you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102129">&quot;No more than it does you, Nathyrra. What is it that you feel here?&quot;</string>
<string name="102130">&quot;I was just wondering... well... what is this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="102131">&quot;And who is the Reaper? Or maybe I should ask *what* is the Reaper?&quot;</string>
<string name="102132">&quot;An ally you know nothing about? How very naive of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope this ally doesn&apos;t turn on you when you least expect it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102133">&quot;I see. Obviously you know little about this Reaper. Do you at least know something about this realm?&quot;</string>
<string name="102134">&quot;A nexus realm run by a mysterious demon-type being? You certainly have put your faith in a strange ally, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope your faith isn&apos;t misplaced.&quot;</string>
<string name="102135">&quot;Are you saying you don&apos;t know, or you won&apos;t tell me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102136">&quot;What... what happened? Where are we? Can this be... no, it can&apos;t. Can it? Are we... are we in one of the Nine Hells?&quot;</string>
<string name="102137">Nathyrra gives you a glare that is as cold as the world around you. &quot;Then get moving. I&apos;m just as eager as you to find a way out of here.&quot;</string>
<string name="102138">The drow shakes her head, still trying to come to grips with the reality of where you are. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I know little about the Hells. If this were the Abyss, I might be of more use.&quot;</string>
<string name="102139">&quot;All I can suggest is we try to find a way out of here as quickly as possible, though I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve already figured that part out for yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="102140">&quot;There are many planes of Hell, and not all of them are fire and brimstone. But I never actually expected to visit any of them myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="102141">&quot;No need to be sarcastic, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps jumping from plane to plane is routine for you, but I still find the experience a bit unusual.&quot;</string>
<string name="102142">&quot;They say this town appeared on this island from out of nowhere... obviously there is powerful magic at work here. Magic the Valsharess might want to use for herself.&quot;</string>
<string name="102143">The drow grits her teeth as she replies. &quot;If you waste all your rancor on your allies, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you won&apos;t have anything left for your enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="102144">&quot;Precisely what I was thinking. Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="102145">&quot;The illithid have no respect for other races, they see us all as potential thralls. The temptation of an unguarded mind is too much for them to resist.&quot;</string>
<string name="102146">&quot;If you plan to wade through an ocean of illithid blood to reach the Elder Brain, I&apos;ll help you every step of the way. But remember our mission: we are here to strike a bargain.&quot;</string>
<string name="102147">&quot;We need to negotiate with the Elder Brain so it can convince other mind flayer communities to abandon her. If you keep your mind well guarded, maybe we can do this without violence.&quot;</string>
<string name="102148">Nathyrra sighs. &quot;Very well, I guess we&apos;ll do this the hard way, then. When the fighting starts, I&apos;ll be quick to jump to your aid.&quot;</string>
<string name="102149">&quot;The helmets of those duergar slavers should be sufficient to shield your thoughts from the mind flayers&apos; probing. As long as you wear the helmet, your mind should be safe.&quot;</string>
<string name="102150">&quot;Since you are obviously the leader of our group, the illithid will consider me as your thrall. No self-respecting illithid would lower itself to probe the mind of another&apos;s thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="102151">&quot;Just remember to play the role of a slaver visiting Zorvak&apos;Mur, and things should go smoothly. At least, as smoothly as one could expect in a city full of mind flayers.&quot;</string>
<string name="102152">Nathyrra scowls at you. &quot;I&apos;m going to assume that was a joke, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am nobody&apos;s slave. I will play the role of servant during your visit to Zorvak&apos;Mur, but don&apos;t forget that it is but an act!&quot;</string>
<string name="102153">&quot;As long as you remember to play the role of a slaver visiting the city, then things should go smoothly. At least, as smoothly as one could expect when dealing with the mind flayers.&quot;</string>
<string name="102154">Nathyrra arches her eyebrow playfully. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t make a very good thrall, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Remember, in drow society we females are used to being in charge.&quot;</string>
<string name="102155">&quot;Yes... or so you males believe. And who am I to shatter your illusions? Besides, we have more important things to worry about right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102156">&quot;I am *not* bossy, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Can I help it if I always seem to know the right way to approach a problem? Would you rather I didn&apos;t share my advice with you?&quot;</string>
<string name="102157">Nathyrra starts to say something else, then snaps her mouth shut. After a moment she says, &quot;I think there was a compliment in there. I suppose I should quit now, while I&apos;m ahead.&quot;</string>
<string name="102158">&quot;Defensive? Defensive?! I&apos;m not defensive, I&apos;m just... uh... defending myself against these unfair accusations!&quot;</string>
<string name="102159">&quot;Hmph. I&apos;m going to take that as a compliment: obviously you admire my take charge attitude and the air of authority I project.&quot;</string>
<string name="102160">&quot;I see. Well then, just remember to play the role of a slaver visiting Zorvak&apos;Mur and things should go smoothly. At least, as smoothly as one could expect in a city full of mind flayers.&quot;</string>
<string name="102161">&quot;Yes, it will. Just be careful not to remove it once we are inside Zorvak&apos;Mur. If you leave your mind exposed, the illithid won&apos;t hesitate to attack.&quot;</string>
<string name="102162">&quot;This temple has the feel of death and dark magic about it. Whatever awaits us inside, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to learn it is tied to the undead hosts that have joined the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="102163">&quot;I think there may be more than just the undead in this place. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to find a cult of necromancers inside; a dark circle of wizards devoted to raising the dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="102164">&quot;Whining? I prefer to call it good planning. You may enjoy stumbling blindly from encounter to encounter, but I like to be prepared. I find it makes survival so much easier!&quot;</string>
<string name="102165">She shakes her head. &quot;At times like this it is hard not to question the Seer&apos;s faith in you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Find, lead the way to the slaughter. I&apos;ll follow along as I always do.&quot;</string>
<string name="102166">The drow sighs. &quot;Direct and to the point, as ever. Very well, let&apos;s get on with the slaughter.&quot;</string>
<string name="102167">&quot;I know you will, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Just remember: you aren&apos;t facing this alone. Whatever happens, I&apos;ll be at your side.&quot;</string>
<string name="102168">&quot;As will I.&quot;</string>
<string name="102169">&quot;Me too, Boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="102170">&quot;This village... all these people appear to be from Toril&apos;s surface. Something isn&apos;t right. The denizens of the Underdark only use surfacers for slaves or food... or both.&quot;</string>
<string name="102171">&quot;Maybe, though I doubt we we have much to fear from the villagers themselves. I&apos;d guess they&apos;re slaves... though who they might serve is a mystery.&quot;</string>
<string name="102172">&quot;Yes, you&apos;re probably right. But who do they serve? And why?&quot;</string>
<string name="102173">&quot;Of course. Just be prepared for... well, I don&apos;t know what. Just try to be prepared.&quot;</string>
<string name="102174">&quot;Do you mean is this an illusion or some kind of spell to hide their true nature? No, I don&apos;t think so... though I can&apos;t be sure, of course. But I think they really are what they appear.&quot;</string>
<string name="102175">&quot;There&apos;s something strange about these ruins. The architecture is different from the tunnels of the beholders. It&apos;s not illithid, it&apos;s not duergar... and it certainly isn&apos;t drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="102176">The drow gives you a sour look. &quot;I don&apos;t like going into a situation without knowing what to expect. This place feels... wrong, somehow.&quot;</string>
<string name="102177">&quot;The air feels heavy. Flat. The magic here is dead... I don&apos;t know if my spells will even function in this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="102178">&quot;It&apos;s not just my spells! A dead magic zone affects everyone. But my spells aren&apos;t my only weapon.&quot; She gives you a defiant glare. &quot;Lead the way. I&apos;m ready whenever you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="102179">&quot;True enough, I suppose. Though I suspect that whatever waits for us inside will have adapted to an existence without magic long before we arrived.&quot;</string>
<string name="102180">&quot;Fortunately my spells aren&apos;t my only weapon.&quot; She takes a deep breath, then slowly exhales. &quot;Lead on, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m ready whenever you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="102181">&quot;I couldn&apos;t even begin to guess. But I imagine whatever we find inside will have found a way to survive without relying on magic long before we ever arrived.&quot;</string>
<string name="102182">&quot;That&apos;s possible, I suppose. But it does little to calm my fears. I don&apos;t like going into a situation without knowing what to expect. This place feels... wrong, somehow.&quot;</string>
<string name="102183">&quot;We have to try and find the Eye Tyrant, though it won&apos;t be easy. There could be dozens of beholders lurking in these tunnels.&quot;</string>
<string name="102184">&quot;I am not scared! At least, no more than any sensible person should be. The beholders are formidable opponents... and they won&apos;t take kindly to visitors.&quot;</string>
<string name="102185">&quot;Hmmm... I hadn&apos;t thought of that. I suppose if there are we&apos;ll have to deal with them as we find them. If we can help them we will. But if they attack us, we will have to defend ourselves.&quot;</string>
<string name="102186">&quot;Eyes peeled? In a beholder hive? Is that a joke, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Need I remind you what could happen to us? Petrification. Disintegration. Simple death. Hardly a joking matter!&quot;</string>
<string name="102187">Nathyrra shakes her head and allows herself a small grin. &quot;Laughing in the face of death... I don&apos;t know if you are incredibly brave or unbelievably foolish. For all our sakes, I hope it&apos;s bravery.&quot;</string>
<string name="102188">&quot;Are you fully prepared for this, &lt;FirstName&gt;? A dungeon full of golems can be difficult if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re about to face.&quot;</string>
<string name="102189">&quot;No, of course not. But golems present special difficulties. Magic has little effect on them, many weapons can&apos;t even harm them. And these golems may be different than others.&quot;</string>
<string name="102190">&quot;The wizard who created them was supposed to be a master at creating such constructs. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if we encounter something no one has run into before.&quot;</string>
<string name="102191">&quot;You&apos;re special; I can&apos;t let anything happen to you. Please, promise me you&apos;ll be careful.&quot;</string>
<string name="102192">Nathyrra scowls, but catches herself before she spits out something she might regret. In a flat voice she says, &quot;Fine. Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="102193">&quot;Remember: the fate of all who follow the Seer is in your hands, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you fall, our hopes fall with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102194">The drow gives her head an exasperated shake. &quot;Spare me your clumsy flirtations, male. I meant you are special because of the Seer&apos;s visions. You are supposed to be our savior.&quot;</string>
<string name="102195">Nathyrra allows herself the hint of a smile before replying. &quot;That is kind of you to say, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But actually, I was referring to the Seer&apos;s vision. You are destined to be our savior.&quot;</string>
<string name="102196">&quot;Be careful near the docks. The Dark River is one of the keys to Lith My&apos;athar&apos;s military strength: no army can safely cross its waters. But any who fall in are instantly swept away to their death.&quot;</string>
<string name="102197">&quot;Good. When you wish to cross, simply look for Cavallas. He, or maybe she - with Cavallas it is hard to say - can take us safely across.&quot;</string>
<string name="102198">&quot;If you wish to cross, simply look for Cavallas. The Boatman knows the river like no other. He, or maybe she - with Cavallas one is never sure - will take us where we need to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="102199">&quot;It will stop them from attacking this side of the city, at least. There are no bridges across the Dark River - any that get built are quickly washed away by rising waters.&quot;</string>
<string name="102200">&quot;The currents make it impossible to swim, and nearly impossible to cross by ship. Only the most skilled boatman can go from one bank to the other without being dragged down to a watery grave.&quot;</string>
<string name="102201">&quot;The Underdark is a strange place for a surfacer. Many find it unnerving, even when they are prepared for it. Given the suddenness of your arrival, I wanted to know how you were feeling.&quot;</string>
<string name="102202">&quot;Yes, you&apos;ve already shown ample proof of that. But your ego may yet be your downfall. Even a mage as powerful as Halaster can fall if he gets careless - as we ourselves have seen.&quot;</string>
<string name="102203">&quot;Don&apos;t underestimate the dangers of the Underdark. The creatures that fight for survival here are unlike anything you may have seen on Toril&apos;s surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="102204">&quot;I&apos;m glad to hear you say that. I won&apos;t lie to you, the Underdark is a dangerous place. The creatures that fight for survival here are unlike anything you may have seen on Toril&apos;s surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="102205">&quot;But I want you to know that you are not alone in this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will do everything in my power to help you stop the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="102206">Her eyes narrow briefly, but otherwise she shows no reaction. &quot;I am used to the suspicions of others. I&apos;ve learned there is nothing I can do but prove myself through my actions.&quot;</string>
<string name="102207">&quot;Come, let&apos;s move on. We won&apos;t stop the Valsharess by standing around here.&quot;</string>
<string name="102208">The drow nods. &quot;Please do. I&apos;m glad we had this talk. But we should be moving on now; the real work still lies ahead.&quot;</string>
<string name="102209">The drow tips her head in gracious acknowledgement of your words. &quot;I&apos;m glad we had this talk. But we should be moving on now; the real adventure still lies ahead.&quot;</string>
<string name="102210">&quot;The Seer has said you are the only one who can defeat the Valsharess. Our fate is tied to you and your success. It is only natural that I show concern for your reaction to the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="102211">She seems momentarily confused, then laughs as she catches your meaning. &quot;Don&apos;t flatter yourself, jaluk! I am not interested in you in *that* way.&quot;</string>
<string name="102212">&quot;Of course. We still have much to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="102213">&quot;Yes, I suppose you&apos;re right. However, I like to believe I am capable of looking after myself. In the future I will try to be more careful.&quot;</string>
<string name="102214">&quot;I assume you would like me to join up with you again?&quot;</string>
<string name="102215">The drow says nothing, but simply nods her head in acknowledgement. You think you can see the hint of a smile on her lips.</string>
<string name="102216">The drow arches an eyebrow, looking at your companions. &quot;Are you certain you have need of me? You seem to have plenty of assistance.&quot;</string>
<string name="102217">The drow&apos;s eyes smolder dangerously, but she nods her head in acceptance. &quot;Very well. If you feel you will be better off without me, then I&apos;ll wait here.&quot;</string>
<string name="102218">The drow stiffens. &quot;Life is fragile, and our enemies are formidable. Some... setbacks are to be expected. But don&apos;t let this one failure overshadow all I can do.&quot;</string>
<string name="102219">&quot;I can help you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And I will try to be more careful in the future. That is, assuming you want me to join up with you again.&quot;</string>
<string name="102220">Nathyrra bristles at your words. &quot;I am well aware of my own abilities, &lt;FirstName&gt; - and my own limitations. You don&apos;t have to worry about me; I&apos;ll be more careful in the future.&quot;</string>
<string name="102221">&quot;That is reassuring. However, I hope you won&apos;t need to keep bringing me back from the dead in the future.&quot;</string>
<string name="102222">------- This line must be placed at the end of inter-party banter ---------</string>
<string name="102223">&quot;So, Aribeth, I heard you were quite the hero in the city of Neverwinter. For a while. Until you betrayed them.&quot;</string>
<string name="102224">&quot;Do you really think you are in any position to judge me, drow? You were an assassin. How many of those you killed believed you to be a friend until you plunged the knife into their heart?&quot;</string>
<string name="102225">&quot;I&apos;m not judging you, Aribeth. Though if I were, I&apos;d say we&apos;re really just opposite sides of the same coin: I am an assassin who has found redemption, you are a paladin fallen from grace.&quot;</string>
<string name="102226">&quot;For one claiming to have found redemption, you harbor much hatred in your heart, drow. Perhaps your old life is still more a part of you than you are willing to admit.&quot;</string>
<string name="102227">&quot;No, I suppose she doesn&apos;t. You&apos;ve traveled with her for some time, and if you truly believe she has found redemption, then my own opinion hardly matters.&quot;</string>
<string name="102228">The dark elf glares at you. &quot;I thought that after all we&apos;ve been though I would have earned your support. I guess I was wrong.&quot;</string>
<string name="102229">Nathyrra addresses Aribeth once more. &quot;My people have a saying: elg&apos;carress. Let&apos;s just leave it at that.&quot;</string>
<string name="102230">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt; is right. This bickering is pointless. My people have a saying: elg&apos;carress. Let&apos;s just leave it at that.&quot;</string>
<string name="102231">Aribeth&apos;s eyes darken and she glowers over at the dark elf. &quot;I speak enough drow to know what that expression means.&quot;</string>
<string name="102232">Nathyrra shrugs innocently. &quot;I meant no offense. Perhaps something was lost in your translation. In any case, we should be moving on. We&apos;ve wasted enough time already.&quot;</string>
<string name="102233">Aribeth laughs. &quot;I can see why &lt;FirstName&gt; is so taken with you, Nathyrra. There is a fierce fire burning beneath your ebony skin, though you have no need to direct its heat my way.&quot;</string>
<string name="102234">&quot;I&apos;m not looking for love. My romances tend to end... poorly. Believe me when I say I don&apos;t pose any threat to your relationship with &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="102235">&quot;You&apos;re right: you don&apos;t pose any threat at all. I can see that now. I guess we really have nothing further to discuss then, do we? Let&apos;s just get back to the task at hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="102236">&quot;So, Valen... you have to admit that &lt;FirstName&gt; has certainly proven &lt;him/her&gt;self so far, despite your reservations.&quot;</string>
<string name="102237">Valen glances over uncomfortably in your direction. &quot;Yes, I can admit that your Seer&apos;s prophet has proven more than capable... so far.&quot;</string>
<string name="102238">&quot;So does this mean you&apos;re going to rethink your skepticism concerning the Seer&apos;s visions?&quot;</string>
<string name="102239">The tiefling smiles. &quot;Very cunning, drow. Get me to commit to an uncomfortable admission, then while I am off-balance, quickly follow up with another point in an effort to win me over to your side.&quot; </string>
<string name="102240">&quot;If your moves with a blade were as quick and subtle as your way with words, you might even be a match for me in battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="102241">&quot;You&apos;re one to talk! Distract me with a flurry of compliments, then parry my question with a completely unrelated argument; nicely done. Now answer the question... and I am a match for you in battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="102242">&quot;My views on the Seer&apos;s visions are unchanged, Nathyrra. And I&apos;ve watched you in battle; you have a hole in your defenses.&quot;</string>
<string name="102243">&quot;I can accept your beliefs are unchanged, but I&apos;d argue your point about the hole in my defenses. I leave my left side slightly exposed on purpose, to lure an opponent in. Then I strike!&quot;</string>
<string name="102244">&quot;And each time you do, you leave your right leg completely open. That&apos;s the hole I&apos;m talking about, not the obvious bait of your unguarded left side.&quot;</string>
<string name="102245">Nathyrra closes her eyes, picturing herself in battle. She opens them in sudden surprise. &quot;You&apos;re right! My right leg is exposed; I&apos;ll have to work on that. Thank you, Valen. I&apos;m glad we had this talk.&quot;</string>
<string name="102246">&quot;Valen, may I ask you something?&quot;</string>
<string name="102247">&quot;I suppose. What is it you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="102248">&quot;I know you are as devoted to the Seer as I am. I know you believe in her cause and the cause of Eilistraee. But despite this, you don&apos;t believe in the Seer&apos;s visions. Why not?&quot;</string>
<string name="102249">The tiefling looks uncomfortable, and rubs his hand against the powerful muscles of his neck. &quot;I am part demon; maybe this gives me more perspective on the whole idea of divine prophecies.&quot;</string>
<string name="102250">&quot;Far too often I&apos;ve seen mortals misled by beings of the Outer Planes. I&apos;ve seen them manipulated by these so-called visions, allowing themselves to be directed like pieces on a gameboard.&quot;</string>
<string name="102251">&quot;So you think Eilistraee&apos;s vision was meant to mislead the Seer?&quot;</string>
<string name="102252">&quot;No, not exactly. But I think the Seer&apos;s visions may not necessarily have come from Eilistraee. Or, maybe Eilistraee herself was being misled. The gods are not infallible, you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="102253">&quot;Yet you follow the Seer anyway?&quot;</string>
<string name="102254">&quot;As you said before, I believe in what the Seer and Eilistraee stand for. I have seen too many lost souls redeemed not to believe; like you, like me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102255">&quot;Does my honesty bother you, Nathyrra? Would you be more comfortable if I believed in the Seer&apos;s prophecy, like you?&quot;</string>
<string name="102256">The drow shakes her head. &quot;No, I guess it doesn&apos;t really matter why you follow the Seer. The important thing is that you are on our side. And, after seeing you in battle, I&apos;m glad.&quot;</string>
<string name="102257">&quot;Uh... drow lady, is you staring at Deekin? Every time I looks, you  be watching me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102258">Nathyrra frowns. &quot;Yes, I suppose I have been watching you. Or, to be more accurate, studying you. I&apos;m trying to learn what your edge is.&quot;</string>
<string name="102259">&quot;Edge? What you means? Deekin&apos;s elbows be kind of bony, but they nots got edges.&quot;</string>
<string name="102260">&quot;You&apos;re a survivor, Deekin. I&apos;m not sure how you do it, though. You&apos;re small and weak, and you come across as a bit... simple. And you&apos;re far too trusting and innocent.&quot;</string>
<string name="102261">Nathyrra shakes her head in frustration. &quot;By all rights you should have been dead and buried long ago, and yet somehow... somehow you manage to keep going. It defies all logic.&quot;</string>
<string name="102262">The kobold looks confused. &quot;Is drow lady mads at Deekin? Deekin do something wrong?&quot;</string>
<string name="102263">&quot;Is that your secret? Blissful ignorance? No, it has to be an act - a cover. There&apos;s more to you than meets the eye. There *has* to be. And I&apos;m going to figure it out. I&apos;m watching you, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="102264">The kobold smiles. &quot;You watches me? You want Deekin sings so you not get bored?&quot;</string>
<string name="102265">&quot;Uh... no, no, don&apos;t sing. Hmmm... maybe this isn&apos;t an act. Maybe you&apos;re just one of those mysteries nobody is ever meant to understand. You know what, Deekin? Just forget I said anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="102266">Deekin nods and gives Nathyrra the thumbs up. &quot;No problem, drow lady. Deekin forgets what we talkings about already.&quot;</string>
<string name="102267">&quot;Deekin, is it true what &lt;FirstName&gt; has told me about you? Did you really learn your craft at the foot of a dragon?&quot;</string>
<string name="102268">&quot;Yep, it be true. Deekin go there to learns to be sorcerer, but Old Master say Deekin not so good at it. He thinks Deekin maybe better if he sings and tells stories.&quot;</string>
<string name="102269">&quot;It&apos;s a wonder he didn&apos;t just give up on you and devour you in a single gulp.&quot;</string>
<string name="102270">&quot;Deekin wonder about that sometimes. Maybe Old Master be lonely. He not have many friends. Nobody ever come to visit, and Old Master never get invited to parties.&quot;</string>
<string name="102271">&quot;Really? I can&apos;t imagine why nobody would want to invite a dragon over.&quot;</string>
<string name="102272">&quot;Deekin think that strange, too. Maybe they afraid he break chairs if he try to sit in them. Old Master pretty big. Deekin not say this to his face, but he even be kind of fat. For a dragon.&quot;</string>
<string name="102273">&quot;Hey - maybe that why Old Master not eat Deekin right away! You thinks he be on some kind of special dragon diet? Maybe kobolds is high in fat.&quot;</string>
<string name="102274">&quot;I suppose that&apos;s possible...&quot;</string>
<string name="102275">&quot;You think other dragons be worried about getting fat, too? Maybe Deekin need to makes special cookbook for dragons who wants to lose weight? Deekin never seen nothing like that before!&quot;</string>
<string name="102276">&quot;I admit, cookbooks for dragons is probably an untapped market. But I don&apos;t think...&quot;</string>
<string name="102277">&quot;How you start book like that? Maybe Deekin makes list of all foods that is fatty or not. What about you, drow lady? You sleek and lean. Is all dark elves like you?&quot;</string>
<string name="102278">&quot;Uh... better put the drow down as fatty. The health conscious dragon should avoid eating us at all costs.&quot;</string>
<string name="102279">Deekin scribbles a quick note on a crumpled piece of parchment. &quot;Drows be fatty. Got it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102280">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="102281">&quot;I think we need to part ways.&quot;</string>
<string name="102282">&quot;All right, fine. Stay with me, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="102283">&quot;Wait here until I return.&quot;</string>
<string name="102284">&quot;Go on. Maybe we&apos;ll meet later.&quot;</string>
<string name="102285">&quot;I want to change your tactics.&quot;</string>
<string name="102286">&quot;I don&apos;t want to change anything else right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102287">&quot;I don&apos;t want you to cast any spells until I say otherwise.&quot;</string>
<string name="102288">&quot;I want you to go ahead and cast spells on your own.&quot;</string>
<string name="102289">&quot;Do not try to use dispel magic spells to remove disabling effects from party members.&quot;</string>

<string name="102411">&quot;What was it you wanted to say earlier?&quot;</string>
<string name="102412">&quot;Let&apos;s stop and talk for a moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="102413">&quot;That&apos;s all for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102414">&quot;No, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="102415">&quot;How are you doing? Is anything wrong?&quot;</string>
<string name="102416">&quot;I wish to discuss your training.&quot;</string>
<string name="102417">&quot;I&apos;d like you to go back to finding a balance between the two.&quot;</string>
<string name="102418">&quot;Continue with what you&apos;re doing now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102419">&quot;Concentrate on becoming an assassin.&quot;</string>
<string name="102420">&quot;I want you to focus exclusively on your mage training.&quot;</string>
<string name="102421">&quot;I want to talk more about the lost souls.&quot;</string>
<string name="102422">&quot;What do they say to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="102423">&quot;I think it&apos;s just your guilty conscience acting up.&quot;</string>
<string name="102424">&quot;That&apos;s ridiculous.&quot;</string>
<string name="102425">&quot;If you&apos;re losing your sanity, I can replace you!&quot;</string>
<string name="102426">&quot;Well, you killed them. I guess they&apos;d be angry with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102427">&quot;You can&apos;t let yourself continue to be haunted by your past.&quot;</string>
<string name="102428">&quot;I&apos;m sick of this. You deal with this problem, now!&quot;</string>
<string name="102429">&quot;You have to be strong, Nathyrra. You have to resist them.&quot;</string>
<string name="102430">&quot;You&apos;re not what you once were, Nathyrra. The spirits have no claim over you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102431">&quot;You can, Nathyrra. I believe in you. You are stronger than you realize.&quot;</string>
<string name="102432">&quot;But you aren&apos;t alone, my love. I&apos;m with you. Always.&quot;</string>
<string name="102433">&quot;What do you plan to do after all this?&quot;</string>
<string name="102434">&quot;You could find plenty of work as an assassin on the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="102435">&quot;You&apos;ve gone soft!&quot;</string>
<string name="102436">&quot;I think trying to help others in the Underdark is a noble goal.&quot;</string>
<string name="102437">&quot;There are people who need saving on the surface, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="102438">&quot;When the time comes, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll make the right choice.&quot;</string>
<string name="102439">&quot;Sounds like you want to change all of drow society.&quot;</string>
<string name="102440">&quot;Maybe you could stay with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102441">&quot;Fine. Choose Eilistraee instead of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102442">&quot;We can make it work.&quot;</string>
<string name="102443">&quot;Wherever you go, I&apos;ll go with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102444">&quot;I want to talk to you about Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="102445">&quot;Just tell me what you can.&quot;</string>
<string name="102446">&quot;What do the followers of Eilistraee believe in?&quot;</string>
<string name="102447">&quot;Sounds like a stupid religion to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102448">&quot;If anyone can be saved, what about the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="102449">&quot;I&apos;m glad you&apos;ve found your salvation.&quot;</string>
<string name="102450">&quot;We&apos;ve all done terrible things in our past. You just deal with it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102451">&quot;You have to learn to leave the past in the past, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102452">&quot;Maybe part of worshipping Eilistraee is learning to forgive yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="102453">&quot;Don&apos;t let those dreams get in the way of our mission!&quot;</string>
<string name="102454">&quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;</string>
<string name="102455">&quot;If Eilistraee preaches mercy and forgiveness, why are we doing so much killing in her service?&quot;</string>
<string name="102456">&quot;Is that why you&apos;re helping me now? Some kind of penance for past sins?&quot;</string>
<string name="102457">&quot;I want to know more about House Kant&apos;tar.&quot;</string>
<string name="102458">&quot;I suppose you really didn&apos;t have any other choice.&quot;</string>
<string name="102459">&quot;House Kant&apos;tar, the Valsharess, the Seer: your loyalty seems rather fickle.&quot;</string>
<string name="102460">&quot;I just hope you don&apos;t switch sides yet again.&quot;</string>
<string name="102461">&quot;I&apos;m glad you&apos;re on our side now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102462">&quot;I can see your conversion is sincere.&quot;</string>
<string name="102463">&quot;Pretty words, but they don&apos;t mean much coming from you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102464">&quot;You don&apos;t have to walk this path alone, Nathyrra. I will be there to help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102465">&quot;It doesn&apos;t seem that different to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102466">&quot;I&apos;m not sure I understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="102467">&quot;I&apos;m glad you did. Otherwise we would never have met.&quot;</string>
<string name="102468">&quot;I hope you won&apos;t discard me so easily.&quot;</string>
<string name="102469">&quot;Didn&apos;t you want revenge?&quot;</string>
<string name="102470">&quot;I want to know more about the Red Sisters.&quot;</string>
<string name="102471">&quot;All right, if you&apos;d rather not talk about it...&quot;</string>
<string name="102472">&quot;So tell me about the training.&quot;</string>
<string name="102473">&quot;Actually, I don&apos;t want to talk about this.&quot;</string>
<string name="102474">&quot;Obviously you were the survivor from your class.&quot;</string>
<string name="102475">&quot;That hardly seems like an efficient way to do things.&quot;</string>
<string name="102476">&quot;It&apos;s always good to have an edge.&quot;</string>
<string name="102477">&quot;So how did you finally kill her?&quot;</string>
<string name="102478">&quot;But the instructors said that wasn&apos;t allowed!&quot;</string>
<string name="102479">&quot;You&apos;re a horrible person!&quot;</string>
<string name="102480">&quot;But you cheated!&quot;</string>
<string name="102481">&quot;You like to play by your own rules, don&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="102482">&quot;Remind me to keep an eye on you when I go to sleep.&quot;</string>
<string name="102483">&quot;They should have just graduated you both.&quot;</string>
<string name="102484">&quot;You used magic? That&apos;s hardly fair!&quot;</string>
<string name="102485">&quot;That&apos;s what I like about you - you know how to use all your assets!&quot;</string>
<string name="102486">&quot;I want to know more about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102487">&quot;No, not yet. Stay here.&quot;</string>
<string name="102488">&quot;Yes, come along.&quot;</string>
<string name="102489">&quot;Not right now, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102490">&quot;Yes, Nathyrra?&quot;</string>
<string name="102491">&quot;Wow, you&apos;ve got a great grasp of the bloody obvious!&quot;</string>
<string name="102492">&quot;All I feel is the need to find a way out of this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="102493">&quot;Isn&apos;t that a cheery thought.&quot;</string>
<string name="102494">&quot;You can feel the lost souls?&quot;</string>
<string name="102495">&quot;Can we just move on?&quot;</string>
<string name="102496">&quot;I don&apos;t hear anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="102497">&quot;Maybe we don&apos;t want to hear what they&apos;re saying.&quot;</string>
<string name="102498">&quot;Maybe they&apos;re trying to warn us.&quot;</string>
<string name="102499">&quot;Well, we are in the one of the Nine Hells. It isn&apos;t supposed to be pleasant.&quot;</string>
<string name="102500">&quot;But the cold makes your lips such a pretty shade of blue.&quot;</string>
<string name="102501">&quot;Quit stalling. Out with it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102502">&quot;What is it, Nathyrra?&quot;</string>
<string name="102503">&quot;I didn&apos;t have a choice. That&apos;s the only reason I helped you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102504">&quot;I want to stop Mephistopheles, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="102505">&quot;All I care about is getting out of the Nine Hells.&quot;</string>
<string name="102506">&quot;Nope.&quot;</string>
<string name="102507">&quot;I would have helped even if it wasn&apos;t for the geas on me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102508">&quot;It didn&apos;t help much. Now we&apos;ve got Mephistopheles to deal with.&quot;</string>
<string name="102509">&quot;Really? I just consider you a glorified servant.&quot;</string>
<string name="102510">&quot;I consider you a friend, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="102511">&quot;We could be more than just friends, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102512">&quot;You think you could do better, drow? You&apos;re no prize, yourself!&quot;</string>
<string name="102513">&quot;Never mind. Let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102514">&quot;It&apos;s okay, Nathyrra. I understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="102515">&quot;Really? I don&apos;t feel anything for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102516">&quot;Aw, I didn&apos;t know you cared...&quot;</string>
<string name="102517">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. Go on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102518">&quot;Let me save you some time: I *don&apos;t* have any feelings for you, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102519">&quot;Someone you love?&quot;</string>
<string name="102520">&quot;And I love you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102521">&quot;We still have to find a way out of here, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102522">&quot;So what happens now?&quot;</string>
<string name="102523">&quot;What about your faith? What about Eilistraee?&quot;</string>
<string name="102524">&quot;I consider you a friend, Nathyrra. Nothing more. I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="102525">&quot;I do, Nathyrra. I love you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102526">&quot;Humor is part of my romantic charm.&quot;</string>
<string name="102527">&quot;I feel close to you too, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102528">&quot;Right now all I think about is killing the Valsharess!&quot;</string>
<string name="102529">&quot;Who cares about the surface?! We&apos;ve got more important things to worry about!&quot;</string>
<string name="102530">&quot;It&apos;s pretty boring compared to the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="102531">&quot;Well, they aren&apos;t too fond of drow up there.&quot;</string>
<string name="102532">&quot;You&apos;ll see it for yourself, someday.&quot;</string>
<string name="102533">&quot;The surface is beautiful.&quot;</string>
<string name="102534">&quot;Yes, I suppose I will.&quot;</string>
<string name="102535">Why? Do you want to run away together?</string>
<string name="102536">&quot;I&apos;m going to slaughter the Valsharess like a hog!&quot;</string>
<string name="102537">&quot;Killed the Seer? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="102538">&quot;I don&apos;t have time for this story!&quot;</string>
<string name="102539">&quot;I haven&apos;t heard this tale yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="102540">&quot;Why were you sent to kill the Seer?&quot;</string>
<string name="102541">&quot;Then what happened?&quot;</string>
<string name="102542">&quot;So she sent you to end the problem.&quot;</string>
<string name="102543">&quot;Maybe studying Eilistraee&apos;s teachings made you more open to the idea of a conversion.&quot;</string>
<string name="102544">&quot;But you couldn&apos;t kill her?&quot;</string>
<string name="102545">&quot;We should probably continue on with our quest.&quot;</string>
<string name="102546">&quot;You&apos;re weak! I would have killed her!&quot;</string>
<string name="102547">&quot;And you&apos;ve served the Seer ever since?&quot;</string>
<string name="102548">&quot;She had seen you in a vision, hadn&apos;t she?&quot;</string>
<string name="102549">&quot;Obviously you don&apos;t feel that way now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102550">&quot;Are you saying you doubted the Seer&apos;s visions?&quot;</string>
<string name="102551">&quot;The Seer believes in me because of her visions.&quot;</string>
<string name="102552">&quot;I don&apos;t like you spying on me, drow!&quot;</string>
<string name="102553">&quot;Really? Who?&quot;</string>
<string name="102554">&quot;Why do I remind you of &lt;him/her&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="102555">&quot;I remind you of a slave?&quot;</string>
<string name="102556">&quot;I really don&apos;t care about this.&quot;</string>
<string name="102557">&quot;Seelamin is in your past. &lt;He/She&gt;&apos;s not here now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102558">&quot;What happened to &lt;him/her&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="102559">&quot;Wait a minute - the Valsharess destroyed your House?&quot;</string>
<string name="102560">&quot;Let me guess... you helped the Valsharess destroy House Kant&apos;tar.&quot;</string>
<string name="102561">&quot;Did you have anything to do with House Kant&apos;tar&apos;s fall?&quot;</string>
<string name="102562">&quot;If she destroyed your House, why did you join the Red Sisters?&quot;</string>
<string name="102563">&quot;Just make a long story short and get to the point!&quot;</string>
<string name="102564">&quot;Is the story over yet? Sorry, I dozed off there for a bit.&quot;</string>
<string name="102565">&quot;We should probably get back to our mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="102566">&quot;How could you go work for the woman who killed your family?&quot;</string>
<string name="102567">&quot;Weren&apos;t you worried it was a trap?&quot;</string>
<string name="102568">&quot;Weren&apos;t you worried it was a trap?&quot;</string>
<string name="102569">&quot;How could you go work for the woman who killed your family?&quot;</string>
<string name="102570">&quot;I don&apos;t get it. How did you end up joining the Red Sisters?&quot;</string>
<string name="102571">&quot;So you went into hiding?&quot;</string>
<string name="102572">&quot;So you&apos;ve been watching me? See anything you like?&quot;</string>
<string name="102573">&quot;Is there some point to this?&quot;</string>
<string name="102574">&quot;I knew you couldn&apos;t be trusted!&quot;</string>
<string name="102575">&quot;How do I know you&apos;re not a spy, pretending to help us?&quot;</string>
<string name="102576">&quot;You turned on the Valsharess. Next you might turn on us.&quot;</string>
<string name="102577">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Nathyrra. I trust you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102578">&quot;No wonder you know so much about her.&quot;</string>
<string name="102579">&quot;I don&apos;t know if I want you traveling with me anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="102580">&quot;No, I want you to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="102581">&quot;Fine, I&apos;ll keep you around. But I&apos;m watching you!&quot;</string>
<string name="102582">&quot;I trust you, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102583">&quot;Can you blame them?&quot;</string>
<string name="102584">&quot;You worked for our enemy?&quot;</string>
<string name="102585">&quot;I&apos;m glad you&apos;re on our side now, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102586">&quot;So you were an assassin. Who cares?&quot;</string>
<string name="102587">&quot;The past is in the past, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102588">&quot;The Red Sisters?&quot;</string>
<string name="102589">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="102590">&quot;Are you going to tell me what the problem is or not?&quot;</string>
<string name="102591">&quot;This isn&apos;t the best time for this, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102592">&quot;Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="102593">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Deekin]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Ixthyria the Scalesinger...&quot;</string>
<string name="102594">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="102595">&quot;Believe in yourself, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="102596">&quot;You&apos;re kind, you&apos;re talented, you&apos;re funny. You don&apos;t need me anymore. If I die, you&apos;ll be all right.&quot;</string>
<string name="102597">&quot;Not if I can help it. Come, we have an adventure to finish.&quot;</string>
<string name="102598">&quot;Surrender your soul to me, little one!&quot; </string>
<string name="102599">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="102600">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="102601">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Valen]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Oeskathine the Demonwrestler...&quot;</string>
<string name="102602">&quot;Nothing right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102603">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="102604">&quot;I bind you to me as my lover forever!&quot;</string>
<string name="102605">&quot;I hereby free you from your infernal taint.&quot;</string>
<string name="102606">&quot;You&apos;re welcome.&quot;</string>
<string name="102607">&quot;Glad you like it. Now give me your soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="102608">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="102609">&quot;Sorry, my love, but this is it for us.&quot;</string>
<string name="102610">&quot;Yes, I am.&quot;</string>
<string name="102611">&quot;Good. Now, in repayment, you are to become my lover forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="102612">&quot;Well... perhaps not.&quot;</string>
<string name="102613">&quot;You heard me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102614">&quot;We&apos;re done. For now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102615">&quot;You don&apos;t frighten me. I own you, body and soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="102616">&quot;You&apos;re so sexy when you&apos;re mad. Give me a kiss!&quot;</string>
<string name="102617">&quot;So there&apos;s hope for us after all?&quot;</string>
<string name="102618">&quot;Does it really feel that different?&quot;</string>
<string name="102619">&quot;I&apos;m glad. You certainly earned it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102620">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Aribeth]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Va&apos;ardalia the Twinsouled...&quot;</string>
<string name="102621">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="102622">&quot;Feel no guilt regarding what transpired in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="102623">&quot;You are right. I will not ask that of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102624">&quot;Don&apos;t you see? This is your atonement... It&apos;s all right...&quot;</string>
<string name="102625">&quot;I just don&apos;t want to see you suffer so.&quot;</string>
<string name="102626">&quot;Yes, Aribeth. Dead and cold...&quot;</string>
<string name="102627">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="102628">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="102629">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="102630">&quot;I command you to pursue evil, not good.&quot;</string>
<string name="102631">&quot;I command you to love me...&quot;</string>
<string name="102632">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="102633">&quot;Feel no guilt regarding what transpired in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="102634">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="102635">&quot;If it means losing you, then no...&quot;</string>
<string name="102636">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="102637">&quot;I command you to pursue good, not evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="102638">&quot;I command you to love me!&quot;</string>
<string name="102639">&quot;That is all, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="102640">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Nathyrra]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Qeyifalia the Skyseeker...&quot;</string>
<string name="102641">&quot;Nothing right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102642">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="102643">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="102644">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="102645">&quot;I bind you to me as my lover forever!&quot;</string>
<string name="102646">&quot;Your anger is nothing to me. I own you, body and soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="102647">&quot;You&apos;re so sexy when you&apos;re mad. Give me a kiss!&quot;</string>
<string name="102648">&quot;Forgive yourself for your past crimes.&quot;</string>
<string name="102649">&quot;I won&apos;t do anything to harm you, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102650">&quot;I&apos;m really getting sick of this! Get over it already!&quot;</string>
<string name="102651">&quot;Enough with the chit-chat! I just want to kill Mephistopheles!&quot;</string>
<string name="102652">&quot;I can&apos;t help you with this, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102653">&quot;You have to learn to forgive yourself, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102654">&quot;In time you&apos;ll learn to forgive yourself, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102655">&quot;I&apos;ll help you through this, Nathyrra. I love you, remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="102656">&quot;Why must you two always fight? Fine, I love neither of you!&quot;</string>
<string name="102657">&quot;Forgive me... I&apos;m sorry, Nathyrra, but it&apos;s Aribeth I love.&quot;</string>
<string name="102658">&quot;Leave us be, Aribeth. I loved Nathyrra first and best.&quot;</string>
<string name="102659">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I have love enough for the both of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102660">&quot;Why must you two always fight? Fine, I love neither of you!&quot;</string>
<string name="102661">&quot;Forgive me... I&apos;m sorry, Nathyrra, but it&apos;s Aribeth I love.&quot;</string>
<string name="102662">&quot;Leave us be, Aribeth. I loved Nathyrra first and best.&quot;</string>
<string name="102663">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I have love enough for the both of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102664">&quot;You&apos;re welcome, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="102665">&quot;The Reaper has always referred to it as his realm, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="102666">&quot;He&apos;s an ally. That&apos;s all you need to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="102667">&quot;I don&apos;t know what he is. A demon, perhaps? He just is.&quot;</string>
<string name="102668">&quot;Enough questions. The Reaper is an ally. That&apos;s all you need to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="102669">&quot;No... not really. He said something about a nexus, but I didn&apos;t really get it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102670">&quot;This place is a nexus, or so the Reaper says. I&apos;m not sure I understand it all.&quot;</string>
<string name="102671">&quot;The Reaper says his realm is a nexus. It connects to many places, but not all.&quot;</string>
<string name="102672">&quot;Why don&apos;t you ask him yourself?&quot;</string>
<string name="102673">&quot;Are you done yapping? I&apos;d like to try and find a way out of here.&quot;</string>
<string name="102674">&quot;Do you know anything about this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="102675">&quot;Seems a bit... cold to be one of the Hells, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="102676">&quot;What was your first clue?&quot;</string>
<string name="102677">&quot;That&apos;s very helpful. What would I do if you weren&apos;t here to point out the blatantly obvious?&quot;</string>
<string name="102678">&quot;Not if we find it first!&quot;</string>
<string name="102679">&quot;If they try anything, I&apos;ll slaughter them all!&quot;</string>
<string name="102680">&quot;When I hack my way to the Elder Brain, it&apos;ll negotiate with me!&quot;</string>
<string name="102681">&quot;What could I use to protect my mind?&quot;</string>
<string name="102682">&quot;What about your mind?&quot;</string>
<string name="102683">&quot;Then we shouldn&apos;t have any problems.&quot;</string>
<string name="102684">&quot;I can&apos;t imagine you as anybody&apos;s thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="102685">&quot;You as my servant? Does this mean you&apos;ll cook and clean for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102686">&quot;This isn&apos;t drow society. Around here, the man is in charge!&quot;</string>
<string name="102687">&quot;No wonder you&apos;re so bossy.&quot;</string>
<string name="102688">&quot;Enough of this. Let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102689">&quot;When I want your advice, I&apos;ll ask for it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102690">&quot;You&apos;re sure cute when you&apos;re angry.&quot;</string>
<string name="102691">&quot;Wow - you&apos;re not only bossy, you&apos;re defensive, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="102692">&quot;I&apos;ve noticed that about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102693">&quot;It wasn&apos;t a compliment. Believe me. Let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102694">&quot;No, you&apos;re just bossy.&quot;</string>
<string name="102695">&quot;It *was* a compliment. I like bossy, domineering women.&quot;</string>
<string name="102696">&quot;This helmet will protect me from them.&quot;</string>
<string name="102697">&quot;I&apos;m not afraid of a few zombies!&quot;</string>
<string name="102698">&quot;You think the undead are inside the temple?&quot;</string>
<string name="102699">&quot;I&apos;m getting sick of your whining, drow!&quot;</string>
<string name="102700">&quot;Whatever we find, I&apos;ll destroy it!&quot;</string>
<string name="102701">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll be careful in there.&quot;</string>
<string name="102702">&quot;Do you think it&apos;s some kind of trap?&quot;</string>
<string name="102703">&quot;They&apos;re probably slaves, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="102704">&quot;We won&apos;t get to the bottom of this by standing here.&quot;</string>
<string name="102705">&quot;We&apos;ll have to investigate to find out.&quot;</string>
<string name="102706">&quot;Maybe they aren&apos;t what they appear.&quot;</string>
<string name="102707">&quot;So what? Who cares?&quot;</string>
<string name="102708">&quot;What good are you if you can&apos;t cast any spells?&quot;</string>
<string name="102709">&quot;Good. Now we don&apos;t have to worry about an enemy&apos;s spell killing us.&quot;</string>
<string name="102710">&quot;A dead magic zone? How is that possible?&quot;</string>
<string name="102711">&quot;Maybe we&apos;ll learn more about them if we look around.&quot;</string>
<string name="102712">&quot;Maybe some long forgotten race left them here.&quot;</string>
<string name="102713">&quot;Come on. The sooner we find this Eye Tyrant, the sooner this is over.&quot;</string>
<string name="102714">&quot;What&apos;s the matter? Are you scared?&quot;</string>
<string name="102715">&quot;There might be slaves in here, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="102716">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll keep my eyes peeled.&quot;</string>
<string name="102717">&quot;It&apos;s just a joke. Relax.&quot;</string>
<string name="102718">&quot;I&apos;m sorry... I didn&apos;t mean anything by it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102719">&quot;I don&apos;t need you mothering me, drow!&quot;</string>
<string name="102720">&quot;I haven&apos;t run into anything I can&apos;t handle, yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="102721">&quot;Nobody said this was going to be easy.&quot;</string>
<string name="102722">&quot;I&apos;d like to go into the dungeon now. That is, unless you have some more useless advice you want to pass on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102723">&quot;I&apos;ll be careful.&quot;</string>
<string name="102724">&quot;You think I&apos;m special? I think you&apos;re special, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="102725">&quot;I&apos;ll be careful.&quot;</string>
<string name="102726">&quot;So how are we supposed to cross it?&quot;</string>
<string name="102727">&quot;You think this river will stop the army of the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="102728">&quot;I can look after myself, drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="102729">&quot;It doesn&apos;t seem that bad too me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102730">&quot;It&apos;s unsettling, but I&apos;ll be okay.&quot;</string>
<string name="102731">&quot;I still don&apos;t trust you, drow. If you betray me...&quot;</string>
<string name="102732">&quot;I&apos;ll keep that in mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="102733">&quot;Thank you, Nathyrra. It&apos;s good to know I have your support.&quot;</string>
<string name="102734">&quot;You&apos;re worried about me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102735">&quot;Is this some kind of drow come on?&quot;</string>
<string name="102736">&quot;I don&apos;t want to discuss this now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102737">&quot;You came with me. Expect to die.&quot;</string>
<string name="102738">&quot;Yes. Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="102739">&quot;No, not right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102740">&quot;You keep dying. That&apos;s a problem.&quot;</string>
<string name="102741">&quot;Your skills are stealth and secrecy. Try to stay out of combat.&quot;</string>
<string name="102742">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. I won&apos;t abandon you, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102743">&quot;Nathyrra doesn&apos;t answer to you, Aribeth!&quot;</string>
<string name="102744">&quot;She has a point, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="102745">&quot;Stop it, both of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102746">&quot;Actually, perhaps you&apos;ve enough people with you at the moment. Sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="102747">Tomi eyes your companions suspiciously. &quot;Hmph. Don&apos;t want t&apos; be a spoilsport, but ya got a whole crowd already. If it thins out some, come give me a holler, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="102748">&quot;Do you have need of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102749">---------- Random Pop-Ups Start Here ------------</string>
<string name="102750">He frowns, troubled. &quot;If you wish. I would prefer not to leave you without proper defense, if it can be avoided.&quot;</string>
<string name="102751">&quot;So be it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102752">He nods, looking about. &quot;Do not take too long. I dislike being idle.&quot;</string>
<string name="102753">He nods, looking about. &quot;Do not be long, my love. I cannot protect you if we are apart.&quot;</string>
<string name="102754">&quot;I shall go back to where we first joined up, then. If you change your mind, you can meet me there.&quot;</string>
<string name="102755">He kisses you softly on the cheek. &quot;Until we meet again, then, my love. Be safe.&quot;</string>
<string name="102756">He frowns, troubled. &quot;If you are certain, my love, then I will gladly obey. I have no desire to leave you, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="102757">&quot;Of course, my love.&quot; He sounds more relieved than anything else, avoiding your gaze. &quot;But only if you are certain...&quot;</string>
<string name="102758">&quot;Tell me how you need me to act, and I shall endeavor to do so.&quot;</string>
<string name="102759">&quot;That&apos;s good. And far less painful, considering the method I use to &apos;disarm&apos; a trap.&quot;</string>
<string name="102760">He arches an eyebrow, half-grinning. &quot;If you think I can, let&apos;s see.&quot;</string>
<string name="102761">He nods. &quot;It was not as if I was actually avoiding detection, at any rate.&quot;</string>
<string name="102762">&quot;I will be as quiet as possible, then, until the battle begins.&quot;</string>
<string name="102763">He smirks briefly. &quot;I am no creeper in the shadows, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I shall attempt to avoid kicking buckets about if it will assist you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102764">&quot;So be it. I would only be forced to destroy the lock, anyhow.&quot;</string>
<string name="102765">He shrugs. &quot;I can try to bash it open, if need be. Expect nothing subtle in that regard.&quot;</string>
<string name="102766">&quot;Where would you have me, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="102767">He nods in agreement, saying nothing.</string>
<string name="102768">He nods. &quot;I am most effective when rushing headlong into the thick of combat, believe it or not.&quot;</string>
<string name="102769">&quot;I will watch your back and follow your lead, as you say.&quot;</string>
<string name="102770">He removes his backpack and offers it to you without comment.</string>
<string name="102771">&quot;My knowledge of magical lore is limited to some few tales I heard during my time in the Abyss. I shall look through what you have and tell you if I recognize anything... but I feel hardly confident.&quot;</string>
<string name="102772">&quot;The demi-plane that I appeared in after we died... does it have a name, I wonder?&quot;</string>
<string name="102773">&quot;Do not worry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am not concerned about that any longer.&quot;</string>
<string name="102774">&quot;Never mind. It&apos;s not important now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102775">&quot;Talk?&quot; He seems mildly taken aback and regards you with curious interest. &quot;What do you wish to discuss?&quot;</string>
<string name="102776">&quot;Have you anything else for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="102777">He shrugs. &quot;I am fine. I have a sudden urge to kill everyone and everything about me, but that&apos;s nothing new... I am a tiefling with a demon&apos;s blood, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="102778">&quot;Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?&quot;</string>
<string name="102779">Valen smiles at you warmly. &quot;Nothing is wrong, my lady. Not while you are here with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102780">&quot;Nothing is wrong at all. Let&apos;s get this over with soon, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="102781">&quot;I miss the planes, to tell the truth. I miss the city of Sigil. It has been too long since I walked its crooked streets.&quot;</string>
<string name="102782">&quot;My blood... it is sometimes difficult to suppress the demonic urges that well up in my blood. It is... nothing for you to be concerned over, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="102783">&quot;I will be glad when this is over, but otherwise I am fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="102784">&quot;Wrong? I cannot see. Would that qualify as something wrong? I don&apos;t really wish to hit the wrong target in the next combat.&quot;</string>
<string name="102785">&quot;I have a few minor wounds. Nothing to worry over.&quot;</string>
<string name="102786">&quot;I am wounded, but it is nothing critical as of yet. We do not need to stop, if that is what you are asking.&quot;</string>
<string name="102787">&quot;I have been severely wounded, as you can see. Perhaps some healing would be in order? Or a short rest?&quot;</string>
<string name="102788">&quot;There is a poison loose in my system.&quot; He shifts uncomfortably. &quot;I may be able to fight it off, I don&apos;t know.&quot;</string>
<string name="102789">&quot;There is a sickness in my blood... I can feel it coursing through me. Anything you could do to assist would be welcome.&quot;</string>
<string name="102790">He ponders your question. &quot;I&apos;m not certain. There was a time that I believed I would return to the surface and continue to serve at the Seer&apos;s temple. Now... perhaps not.&quot;</string>
<string name="102791">&quot;Part of me wants to explore this world of yours. I have stayed too long in one place, and there is still much to see. Perhaps I will start with Waterdeep, itself.&quot;</string>
<string name="102792">&quot;And eventually I would like to return to Sigil. I have not seen it since I was very young... I miss my glorious City of Doors. I miss the planar folk, the Sensatoriums and even the creatures that wander the streets.&quot;</string>
<string name="102793">&quot;But I can always put off such travels to another day. It would be just as enjoyable to continue on by your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Our partnership has been an enjoyable one.&quot;</string>
<string name="102794">&quot;Oh? Of course I am all right with Nathyrra. Why wouldn&apos;t I be? I am very happy that the two of you have found love together, truly.&quot;</string>
<string name="102795">&quot;And nobody asks me if I wish the accompaniment of a third wheel, I see?&quot;</string>
<string name="102796">&quot;Do you object? I can serenade the two of you as you sleep. Come, Nathyrra! Just think of the adventures we&apos;ll have!&quot;</string>
<string name="102797">Nathyrra grins, though she tries to hide it. &quot;Well,&quot; she admits grudgingly, &quot;I suppose it would not be so bad. If &lt;FirstName&gt; is fine with it, that is.&quot;</string>
<string name="102798">&quot;See? Everything is settled! Now... let&apos;s get on with the rest of this adventure so we can move onto the next one, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="102799">&quot;Excellent! I look forward to many exciting adventures at your side, my friend!&quot;</string>
<string name="102800">Valen chuckles. &quot;Then let us travel together, for a while at least. We can see how things go, yes? I, for one, look forward to many exciting adventures at your side.&quot;</string>
<string name="102801">&quot;But we have much to accomplish first before any of us travels anywhere, yes? Perhaps it&apos;s best we get on with it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102802">He turns and smiles at you warmly. &quot;But, of course, all these thoughts are for naught if my lady wishes me to stay with her.&quot;</string>
<string name="102803">He regards you with an arched brow. &quot;Thank you, but no. I would rather travel on my own once this adventure is over, &lt;FirstName&gt;. No offense to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102804">He looks at you and smiles. &quot;Indeed? That is an interesting invitation that I will certainly consider, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="102805">He smiles at you warmly. &quot;Indeed, my love, I would gladly stay with you wherever you might go. Is that what you wish?&quot;</string>
<string name="102806">He shrugs, still smiling. &quot;As you wish. I will spend as much time with you as I can. If it must be from time to time as our paths cross, I shall be just as happy.&quot;</string>
<string name="102807">He laughs heartily. &quot;No, perhaps not at that. And glad I am that such is the case, my lady.&quot;</string>
<string name="102808">He grins, cupping your cheek in his hand gently. &quot;Good. I would have it no other way, my lady.&quot;</string>
<string name="102809">He chuckles. &quot;And I am not, my lady. I am gaining everything because I am with you. That is all that matters to me, truly, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="102810">&quot;I am curious of one thing, however, my lady... what future do you envision for us? Do you foresee marriage? Children?&quot;</string>
<string name="102811">He chuckles embarrassedly. &quot;I know, I know... I am moving too fast. Very well, consider me suitably notified.&quot; He eyes you with a grin. &quot;Don&apos;t expect me to give up forever, though, my love.&quot;</string>
<string name="102812">He takes your hand. &quot;But there&apos;s much yet to do. And I, for one, can&apos;t wait for this to be over and the rest of our life to get started.&quot;</string>
<string name="102813">He chuckles. &quot;Oh? Very well, then, my love. I&apos;m more than happy to chase after you like a lovesick puppy... for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="102814">He nods. &quot;I should have suspected as much. Very well, I am satisfied to spend my time with you. Questions about our future can wait.&quot;</string>
<string name="102815">He nods, shrugging. &quot;So be it. We have all the time in the world for such things, I am sure. What&apos;s important is that we are together.&quot;</string>
<string name="102816">&quot;It is good to know that the possibility is there. I am satisfied. Whatever else comes... let it come.&quot;</string>
<string name="102817">He thinks for a moment. &quot;I have never given such a question much thought. I would love a child,&quot; he grins at you, &quot;*your*child, that is... but perhaps it is too soon for such thoughts?&quot;</string>
<string name="102818">He laughs again. &quot;Hah! Here on the ground? As intriguing as that might be, I&apos;d prefer to wait until we have the chance to do it right.&quot;</string>
<string name="102819">&quot;I did not actually get to spend much time on this world, all things considered. Much of my earlier days I spent in confusion. I had some... unfortunate encounters.&quot;</string>
<string name="102820">He sighs. &quot;One of the first groups I ran into was a band of hobgoblin bandits led by a clever ogre mage. She figured out right away that I knew little about this world.&quot;</string>
<string name="102821">&quot;She tricked me into thinking that she and the hobgoblins were freedom fighters valiantly defending themselves against an evil hunter who was chasing them.&quot;</string>
<string name="102822">&quot;That&apos;s kind of you to say, but likely not. In the planes, creatures are seldom as they seem. The ogre might have been a vicious creature, but all your kind might have been that way for all I knew.&quot;</string>
<string name="102823">&quot;Anyhow,&quot; his mouth twists into a frown, &quot;it turned out that the &apos;evil hunter&apos; was none other than a paladin.&quot;</string>
<string name="102824">&quot;Uh-oh indeed. We fought, and I nearly killed the man. Thankfully I stopped to question him before the death blow and I realized the true nature of the situation.&quot;</string>
<string name="102825">&quot;The only thing I could do, of course. I was forced to kill both parties.&quot;</string>
<string name="102826">&quot;I did not feel good about killing the paladin, but I had no choice. He was not about to forgive my attack. He thought me evil. But I had to kill him before he regained my strength.&quot;</string>
<string name="102827">&quot;I had similar difficulties with others I met. I would have thought that my experience in Sigil would have made me harder to take advantage of, not easier. It was surprising.&quot;</string>
<string name="102828">&quot;It was only once I reached the Seer that I felt safe. She and her fellow drow hid away from surfacers, so I saw few in my time there.&quot; He shrugs. &quot;Perhaps it was just as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="102829">&quot;No, that&apos;s true. Nor would I wish to.&quot;</string>
<string name="102830">&quot;I hope so. It feels as if I have been blundering about so far.&quot;</string>
<string name="102831">&quot;Perhaps not, but I don&apos;t want people to be frightened of me. I need to do what I can.&quot;</string>
<string name="102832">&quot;You are joking, but I do not think it is a very funny subject. I want to do what is right, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="102833">&quot;We&apos;ve talked enough about me, for the moment. Let us get back to our journey.&quot;</string>
<string name="102834">&quot;He was not about to forgive my attack. He saw me as evil. So I had little choice but to kill him before he regained his strength.&quot;</string>
<string name="102835">&quot;You sound rather judgmental. Truth be told, the paladin was not about to forgive me for my attack, and the hobgoblins deserved to die for their tricky. Or that is how I saw it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102836">&quot;It was not my fault, &lt;FirstName&gt;! In the planes, beings are seldom as they seem. The ogre may have been hideous and... well, vicious... but I had no way to know you all weren&apos;t like that, here.&quot;</string>
<string name="102837">&quot;It was... not easy. After so many months of torture I was hardly in the shape to battle anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="102838">&quot;Grimash&apos;t held me in one of his towers on a more remote Abyssal plane. He kept many of his... valuables there. Things he wished to visit and marvel over from time to time. I was but one possession on display.&quot;</string>
<string name="102839">&quot;I suppose I should be thankful that he put me in such a place. It made a very inviting target for attack... which it eventually was.&quot;</string>
<string name="102840">&quot;If it had been attacked by baatezu, perhaps. This was an outlaw force of tanar&apos;ri led by another balor, however. They wanted nothing to do with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102841">&quot;No, they came for other, more material, valuables. They drew off Grimash&apos;t&apos;s guards and tore the building asunder. This opened my cage, allowing me to escape.&quot;</string>
<string name="102842">He smirks gently. &quot;At first. I still had to carve a path for myself out of the Abyss. Grimash&apos;t was not about to let me go easily once he found out.&quot;</string>
<string name="102843">&quot;The obvious thing, of course. Although it took me many months of searching, I found the Seer at last. And it was if she had expected me all along.&quot;</string>
<string name="102844">His eyes grow calm as he stares off into space. &quot;She coaxed my humanity out of me. I will always have her to thank for that.&quot;</string>
<string name="102845">He frowns thoughtfully. &quot;You would not say that if you had experienced what I did. I fear too often that my humanity will be swallowed up again and I will become as I was in the Abyss.&quot;</string>
<string name="102846">&quot;That is a cold and lonely place, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I wish to be a good man. And I want to die that way.&quot; He suddenly looks away. &quot;But enough of my prattle. Let&apos;s get back to what we were doing.&quot;</string>
<string name="102847">&quot;That is a cold and lonely place, my lady. I wish to be a good man. And I want to die that way.&quot; </string>
<string name="102848">He looks at you for a long moment without expression, then shrugs. &quot;And perhaps I am neither of those things. They, however, will not bring me any peace.&quot;</string>
<string name="102849">&quot;Come,&quot; he motions. &quot;We should be moving on before it gets too late.&quot;</string>
<string name="102850">He frowns deeply. &quot;You think so? I yearn for peace, my lady. Perhaps one day you shall find it as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="102851">Valen doesn&apos;t look at you right away, but when he does his eyes brim with emotion. He nods his thanks to you slowly.</string>
<string name="102852">&quot;You are too kind, my lady. I do not think I am a good man, but I strive to be. Maybe one day I will be worthy --&quot; he stops himself short, blushing slightly and avoiding your gaze.</string>
<string name="102853">&quot;Forgive my boldness, my lady,&quot; he says quietly. &quot;We should be moving on, I think.&quot;</string>
<string name="102854">Valen doesn&apos;t look at you right away, but when he does his eyes brim with emotion. &quot;I... sometimes I think so, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="102855">&quot;Then there are other times when I believe if I could only find a woman who  --&quot; he stops short suddenly, blushing slightly and looking away from you.</string>
<string name="102856">&quot;It can be.&quot; He frowns. &quot;There are times, however, when I fear it will take me over completely. I feel as I did in the Abyss.&quot;</string>
<string name="102857">&quot;Sometimes.&quot; He frowns. &quot;When I fight, there are moments when I fear my rage will take me over forever again. I feel as I did in the Abyss.&quot;</string>
<string name="102858">&quot;A balor can be defeated like any other demon... or archdevil, for that matter. If you possess a weapon that is enchanted well enough, you can strike through their defenses. Just strike hard.&quot;</string>
<string name="102859">&quot;Did I not already say before that he did? Yes, of course, many times. I was no longer the young child that he could scoop up and capture, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="102860">&quot;Each of his minions I dealt death to. And when the day came for Grimash&apos;t to come to me personally, it was his turn to perish. A glorious day, indeed.&quot;</string>
<string name="102861">His smile is grim. &quot;I believe that Grimash&apos;t had his end coming to him.&quot;</string>
<string name="102862">&quot;Not initially. I had to find a way from Sigil to this world, first... and then I had to find the Seer. No easy task when you don&apos;t know your way around. It took me years.&quot;</string>
<string name="102863">He looks a little sheepish. &quot;I don&apos;t actually know.&quot;</string>
<string name="102864">&quot;When I fought in the Blood Wars, I was a mindless soldier. Time passed, but I had little recollection of much of it.&quot; He touched one of his horns absently. &quot;And my demonic blood makes my age hard to guess.&quot;</string>
<string name="102865">&quot;There are ways out of any plane, if you know where to look for them. Some portals are natural, some placed long ago and forgotten, some new... I was determined to find one and I did.&quot;</string>
<string name="102866">&quot;A marilith who was something of a competitor for Grimash&apos;t agreed to allow me to use her portal to Sigil in exchange,&quot; here Valen stops short and blushes, &quot;... err... in exchange for a favor.&quot;</string>
<string name="102867">His blush increases and he looks away. &quot;I&apos;d really rather not say.&quot;</string>
<string name="102868">He unsuccessfully stifles a grin, and then laughs out loud. &quot;You are a very wicked woman, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And I mean that in a good way.&quot;</string>
<string name="102869">He looks at you curiously. &quot;You want me to speak about my time spent fighting? Whatever for?&quot;</string>
<string name="102870">He thinks about it for a long moment, and then finally shrugs. &quot;There is no harm in discussing my past. Ask what you will of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102871">Valen chuckles lightly. &quot;Well, that was much simpler than I thought it might be, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Let us return to our travels, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="102872">Valen turns and looks at you, shock evident on his face. &quot;That... that is a most personal question, my lady...&quot;</string>
<string name="102873">He is silent for a long moment, and then finally he nods. &quot;Yes, I was. Once.&quot; He looks directly at you. &quot;She died.&quot;</string>
<string name="102874">He nods and looks away. &quot;I&apos;m certain you need know nothing more about me, my lady. Let us move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102875">&quot;She was a mortal servant of my master in the Abyss. When I was being tortured, my master brought her before me and... and he killed her.&quot;</string>
<string name="102876">He closes his eyes, frowning. &quot;It was meant to cause me pain and it did. But that was a long time ago.&quot;</string>
<string name="102877">He smiles gently, not looking at you but rather at an image in his mind. &quot;No. Nobody else since. I have moved on, however... but there has been no-one else.&quot;</string>
<string name="102878">&quot;Perhaps if we... could move the topic to something else, my lady. I would appreciate it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102879">&quot;Very well. Let us move on, then. There is yet much to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="102880">He shakes his head slowly, sighing. &quot;No. I will never forget her. I did, however, move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102881">&quot;There was no opportunity, my lady. I was wounded and weak, having been tortured for months. If I could have done anything I would have.&quot;</string>
<string name="102882">A flash of pain crosses his face, but Valen swallows it back and nods slowly. &quot;Thank you, my lady. It is... not easy to discuss her, even still.&quot;</string>
<string name="102883">His brow furrows as he ponders the question. &quot;To tell you the truth, I do not know. There were times I wanted to die. There were times I tried to die. But I never did.&quot;</string>
<string name="102884">&quot;Perhaps it was simply my fate to survive long enough to escape Grimash&apos;t&apos;s grasp. I certainly do not question it overmuch.&quot;</string>
<string name="102885">His face becomes stone. &quot;If you say so.&quot;</string>
<string name="102886">He nods at you. &quot;I am pleased to be of service.&quot;</string>
<string name="102887">He smiles a bit bashfully. &quot;Thank you, my lady. That is most kind of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102888">&quot;I think it best not to try. Life is easier to live without banging one&apos;s head against such mysteries.&quot;</string>
<string name="102889">&quot;Gods often like to interfere in the lives of mortals, so it is not impossible. If they expect my devotion for it, however, they&apos;re sadly mistaken.&quot;</string>
<string name="102890">He smiles grimly. &quot;The armies of the Abyss are legion. There were more warriors with my same tale than there are grains of sand. Few survived as I did, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="102891">&quot;I was a young lad in the streets of Sigil, if you must know. An orphan since my mother had died, and a thief when I could get away with it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102892">&quot;Ask as you wish, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="102893">&quot;In Sigil, devils and demons walk the streets along with many other types of creatures. It is not an uncommon sight. One day a demon by the name of Grimash&apos;t saw me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102894">&quot;He saw the demon&apos;s blood within me and scooped me up. There was no escaping him. I suppose I should be thankful that he saw a use for me, else I would likely have been nothing more than a snack for him that day.&quot;</string>
<string name="102895">&quot;Indeed. It was long ago, so I&apos;ve no skills from those days, but at the time I was one of the finest urchin pickpockets in the Hive.&quot;</string>
<string name="102896">He nods. &quot;Sigil is a merciless place, even for children. I was but one of many who starved most of the time, death but a moment away.&quot;</string>
<string name="102897">&quot;Judge me if you wish, but in Sigil one survives as one can. Even as it was, I spent most of my time starving. Always death was but a moment away.&quot;</string>
<string name="102898">His eyes grow sad. &quot;She was murdered by a customer. Or so I was told.&quot;</string>
<string name="102899">&quot;My mother worked for a... very greedy and selfish demoness. I am certain that the demoness killed her because she did not perform sufficiently one month when she was ill.&quot;</string>
<string name="102900">&quot;The demoness disliked mortal frailty.&quot; He frowns deeply at the memory. &quot;And disliked me even more. I was on the street, homeless, within an hour of my mother&apos;s death.&quot;</string>
<string name="102901">&quot;Maybe. There is bad and then there is worse, however. And in a place such as Sigil, there are several levels worse than that, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="102902">Valen shrugs. &quot;I did not need to. She met her death at someone else&apos;s hands soon enough. Sigil is a cruel and uncompromising place.&quot;</string>
<string name="102903">He nodded. &quot;And not unusual for Sigil in the slightest. It is a cruel place.&quot;</string>
<string name="102904">He grimaces. &quot;I would rather not say.&quot; A blush can be seen rising on his cheeks. &quot;Suffice it to say that she partook in a very old profession.&quot;</string>
<string name="102905">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We were not close, however. I barely remember her, in fact, though I would not have wished her end on anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="102906">He grins. &quot;Sigil is the most famous city of the planes, the great City of Doors as it is sometimes called. All planars have walked its streets at one time or another.&quot;</string>
<string name="102907">&quot;Most of the citizens of Sigil would no doubt be offended to hear that anyone from your world has never heard of them. It is an odd place, beautiful and hideous and dangerous and all in-between.&quot;</string>
<string name="102908">He thinks about it for a long moment, and then shrugs. &quot;Very well. If it will please my lady, I would gladly tell her a tale or two. Ask what you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="102909">&quot;I am not sure. Those who follow the Seer accepted me readily enough for her sake, but the others... they despise any creature who is not drow, themselves. I am no exception.&quot;</string>
<string name="102910">&quot;They didn&apos;t listen to me at first.&quot; A slight smile plays across Valen&apos;s features. &quot;But I have a way of convincing even drow that my orders bear listening to.&quot;</string>
<string name="102911">&quot;Strangely enough, I do not think my leadership would have been possible were it not for my demonic heritage.&quot; As if suddenly realizing his error, he stops short and looks at you warily. &quot;You... know what a tiefling is?&quot;</string>
<string name="102912">He smiles bashfully, a gauntleted hand touching one of the goat-like horns on his head in a quick and self-conscious manner. &quot;You jest, of course, my lady...&quot;</string>
<string name="102913">His cheeks redden with embarrassment. &quot;Th-thank you, my lady. You are... too kind.&quot; He clears his throat abruptly. &quot;But... do you know what I am, truly?&quot;</string>
<string name="102914">&quot;My mother,&quot; he begins slowly, &quot;bore the child of a being we call a cambion... a being half a man and half a demon. This makes me part demon, myself.&quot; His eyes grow troubled. &quot;Does this bother you?&quot;</string>
<string name="102915">He nods, his look troubled. &quot;And... my demon&apos;s blood does not bother you?&quot;</string>
<string name="102916">He looks away, his face expressionless. &quot;I see. Perhaps you would be more comfortable if I left?&quot;</string>
<string name="102917">He pauses, considering. Then he finally nods. &quot;It shall not become an issue, I assure you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102918">&quot;Now where was I? Oh, yes. The drow respected the part of me that was infernal, I think. I have a temper that some call frightening, and they did not have to see much of it for word to get around.&quot;</string>
<string name="102919">&quot;That gave them respect enough that they didn&apos;t resist when I assumed command during our first... engagement with the Valsharess.&quot; He rubs his chin thoughtfully. &quot;Three months ago. It feels like forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="102920">&quot;There is no good word for the way drow commit warfare. It is not two armies on the open field, clashing in a battle of arms.&quot;</string>
<string name="102921">He searches for words. &quot;It is as if... two great shadows silently meet. A fleet of assassins and dark magic seeking the throat of the opponent...&quot;</string>
<string name="102922">&quot;We weren&apos;t prepared for that first battle, and the Valsharess outnumbered us in every way. We lost three allied houses and the Seer&apos;s chosen General before I was able to drag the army into retreat.&quot;</string>
<string name="102923">He stops, considering your words, and finally nods. &quot;It... has not been easy. There has only been defeat after defeat, but I kept us alive. That is something.&quot;</string>
<string name="102924">&quot;So we ran. I kept us together as much as I could, and the Valsharess nipped at our heels until we were out of drow territory almost entirely.&quot;</string>
<string name="102925">He stops, considering your words. &quot;No,&quot; he says grimly, &quot;I have never led them to victory in battle, that is true. There has been no victory to be had.&quot;</string>
<string name="102926">&quot;We ran,&quot; he sighs grimly. &quot;I kept us together as much as I could, and the Valsharess nipped at our heels until we were out of drow territory almost entirely.&quot;</string>
<string name="102927">&quot;Even in Lith My&apos;athar we are not safe. It is a temporary respite until the Valsharess finishes us off, as the Seer told you. That is why we are so desperate. Few have hope as the Seer does.&quot;</string>
<string name="102928">He shrugs. &quot;Very well. It is not a pleasant tale, anyway, and certainly one that has left what few forces remain of our side with little hope.&quot;</string>
<string name="102929">He glances meaningfully at you. &quot;I&apos;ve kept them alive and on the run since that first battle, but only barely. I would truly hate to see them... come to harm.&quot; With that he abruptly ends the conversation.</string>
<string name="102930">He nods slowly, his blank expression barely hiding his wounded pride. &quot;As you wish. I will return to the place we met.&quot;</string>
<string name="102931">His face is stone. &quot;It... fills me with an infernal lust for violence and suffering. A lust I have spent a lifetime battling.&quot;</string>
<string name="102932">He nods solemnly. &quot;Thank you. It... will not become a problem, I assure you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102933">Valen seems quite startled by your response, obviously never having encountered it before. Slowly he smiles. &quot;You are... quite intriguing yourself, my lady.&quot;</string>
<string name="102934">His smile is slow in response, as if your answer is one he is not accustomed to. &quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I... appreciate that.&quot;</string>
<string name="102935">His smile is slow in response, as if your answer is one he is not accustomed to. &quot;No. It shouldn&apos;t, really.&quot;</string>
<string name="102936">&quot;It did. For a time.&quot; A slight smile plays across Valen&apos;s features. &quot;I have a way of convincing even drow that my orders bear listening to.&quot;</string>
<string name="102937">&quot;The Seer cares what happens to them. She cares what will happen to us all should the Valsharess&apos; plans come to fruition.&quot;</string>
<string name="102938">A shadow creeps behind Valen&apos;s eyes and he frowns thoughtfully. &quot;I care what happens to the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="102939">&quot;There really isn&apos;t much more to say about me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps our attention would be better focused on completing the task at hand?&quot;</string>
<string name="102940">Valen shrugs. &quot;I am a bit curious about your beliefs, to be truthful. Many here on your world worship a god or goddess... are you one of them?&quot;</string>
<string name="102941">Valen ponders for a long moment before looking over at you, reluctance evident on his features. &quot;I think there is something else I would speak of, first. I have been wrong about something... about you. I owe you an apology.&quot;</string>
<string name="102942">He watches you for a moment, his expression betraying the uncertainty behind his fierce eyes. &quot;If you wish to speak, I would prefer another subject than myself. I would talk about the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="102943">&quot;You wish to know more about me, do you? How about we start with you first, instead?&quot;</string>
<string name="102944">Valen frowns and considers his next words carefully. &quot;I wish to know,&quot; he begins, &quot;what makes you so special?&quot;</string>
<string name="102945">&quot;The archdevil will destroy Waterdeep and much more if we do not stop him. If you wish to discuss anything, make it quick.&quot;</string>
<string name="102946">&quot;There is little to talk about at this point... my love.&quot; The last words he speaks with a ring of distaste.</string>
<string name="102947">Valen nods, frowning, but says nothing further.</string>
<string name="102948">He nods, looking uncomfortable. &quot;Please tell me when it would be more appropriate, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We can speak then.&quot;</string>
<string name="102949">&quot;This... is not easy for me.&quot; You notice he has a pained expression, and his eyes glow a dull red. &quot;I feel my blood rebelling against me the longer we stay here.&quot;</string>
<string name="102950">He wheels on you suddenly and only barely seems able to keep himself in check. &quot;Do not do that, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I can... I can barely contain myself as it is!&quot;</string>
<string name="102951">&quot;I told you of the Blood Wars, did I not? My tanar&apos;ri blood calls out for me to destroy everything baatezu.&quot; He wipes his forehead, his hand shaking. &quot;I do not know why the devils here don&apos;t descend upon me as it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="102952">He takes several long breaths, calming slowly. &quot;You are not helping,&quot; he growls. &quot;I am... doing my best, I assure you.&quot;</string>
<string name="102953">He takes several long breaths, calming slowly. &quot;I am trying, &lt;FirstName&gt;, believe me. I... I think I can do it, though it is no simple matter.&quot;</string>
<string name="102954">He takes several long breaths, calming slowly. &quot;Yes, I... have to wonder at that. Perhaps you have assumed Mephistopheles&apos; place here in more than name.&quot;</string>
<string name="102955">He takes several long breaths, calming slowly. &quot;I... believe so. It is not easy, but I think I can control myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="102956">&quot;Perhaps it would be better if you... left me behind.&quot; He scowls deeply. &quot;I cannot guarantee that I won&apos;t cause more problems than I help with.&quot;</string>
<string name="102957">He nods grimly. &quot;If... that is your decision, then we will part ways. I will try to find my way as best as I can... but at least I will not hinder your mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="102958">He turns away from you. &quot;Then so be it. Good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I... I&apos;m sorry I could not see this through to the end.&quot;</string>
<string name="102959">He turns away from you, his back stiff. &quot;Then so be it. Good luck, my love. I am sorry I could not stay with you until the end. I... I wanted to, very much...&quot;</string>
<string name="102960">He nods, smiling grimly. &quot;I suppose I should be thankful. I have the feeling that if I was not standing next to you I would already be dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="102961">He smiles at you, a bit ashamed. &quot;I am glad to hear it, my lady. I would not leave you willingly if I had the choice.&quot;</string>
<string name="102962">He sighs deeply and looks to the path ahead. &quot;Let&apos;s move on, then, and find a way out of this place. I... will be fine. Trust me.&quot;</string>
<string name="102963">He takes your hand and squeezes it, closing his eyes and drawing what strength he can from the contact between you. When he opens his eyes, he kisses your hand and smiles at you.</string>
<string name="102964">&quot;Thank you, my lady. Let us... move on and find a way out of here. I shall be fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="102965">Valen&apos;s back stiffens. &quot;You needn&apos;t. And obviously I was mistaken to say anything to you at all.&quot; He gestures ahead. &quot;Let&apos;s just move on and get this over with as soon as possible.&quot;</string>
<string name="102966">Valen&apos;s eyes flash briefly with anger. &quot;Is that so? Even if you care nothing for the Seer or the drow, what about the city above? Mephistopheles may be destroying Waterdeep as we speak.&quot;</string>
<string name="102967">&quot;That is good to know, at least. Let us find a way off this plane, then, so we can get to Mephistopheles as soon as possible.&quot; He looks away, grimacing.</string>
<string name="102968">&quot;And to think I actually admired you.&quot; Valen looks away, grimacing. &quot;Let&apos;s get on with it, then. I have people I care for, even if you do not.&quot;</string>
<string name="102969">&quot;I&apos;m glad to hear that. You are a champion unlike any I have ever seen. I am proud to fight at your side.&quot;</string>
<string name="102970">He nods. &quot;That&apos;s true. I must admit I thought taking on an archdevil an impossibility once. At your side, however, I feel almost certain we can be victorious.&quot;</string>
<string name="102971">Valen gestures ahead, grinning. &quot;We should move on, then. We have a plane yet to conquer and then an archdevil to face. Victory no longer seems quite so far away.&quot;</string>
<string name="102972">&quot;I would like to think of us as more than simple comrades-in-arms, however. I am a man who has had few friends in his life, but I would be proud to count you as one of them... if you are willing.&quot;</string>
<string name="102973">He looks at you with clear disappointment. &quot;Oh? I&apos;d thought...&quot; he shrugs suddenly. &quot;Never mind what I thought. Obviously I was mistaken. I&apos;m sorry to have brought it up.&quot;</string>
<string name="102974">Valen looks away, crestfallen. &quot;I... I do not think so, my lady. It would be a lie if I claimed to not find you attractive, it is just... I do not see a future between us. I am sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="102975">&quot;I shouldn&apos;t have said anything at all. I did not mean to imply that I...&quot; he sighs and turns away. &quot;You&apos;re angry with me, now. So be it. Let&apos;s... just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102976">He looks at you sadly, reaching out with a hand and caressing your cheek fondly. &quot;I wish I felt differently, my lady.&quot; He pulls his hand away, embarrassed. &quot;Perhaps we should just... move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="102977">He smiles gently, leaning forward to kiss you upon the lips. The kiss is slow and contains a hint of promise.</string>
<string name="102978">&quot;I must admit,&quot; he begins, &quot;I am simply curious about your beliefs. Many here on your world worship a god or goddess... are you one of them?&quot;</string>
<string name="102979">He looks at you, a bit confused. &quot;No, not at all. Did I make it seem that way? If so, I apologize. I meant no disrespect... I am simply curious to know if you are a worshipper.&quot;</string>
<string name="102980">He nods. &quot;I see. That is too bad, perhaps, for I have always thought faith to be a good thing from what I have seen of it on your world. I do not think I possess the capacity, myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="102981">He nods. &quot;I see. Faith is a good thing, from what I&apos;ve seen of it on your world. I do not think I possess the capacity for it myself, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="102982">&quot;I have seen my share of greater beings during my time in the planes, or heard about them. And I know that there are many who have faded away or died... or even been killed at the hands of mortals.&quot;</string>
<string name="102983">&quot;To me, this makes them too... familiar to honor in such a personal way, despite the power that I know they have to grant to others.&quot; He glances at you. &quot;I hope that does not sound offensive.&quot;</string>
<string name="102984">He nods. &quot;Of course you are correct. I did not mean to tread upon such a touchy subject. My apologies.&quot;</string>
<string name="102985">&quot;That&apos;s good. I have found many people on your world to be very closed in their ideas and difficult to speak to of planar notions. I&apos;m glad you are not one of them.&quot;</string>
<string name="102986">&quot;The Seer has spoken to me often about Eilistraee, the drow goddess that she places her faith in.&quot; He frowns. &quot;I cannot feel the same. I do not think she expects me to, yet...&quot; He shrugs helplessly.</string>
<string name="102987">&quot;Part of me believes I should become more accustomed to the ways of this world. The other part of me says I will always be a planar and I should not try to change that. What do you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="102988">He thinks about it for a moment. &quot;No. I don&apos;t think so.&quot;</string>
<string name="102989">He nods slowly. &quot;I see what you are saying. There are things to love about your world as well, I suppose... it is just that I have seen so little of it. I have not even seen a true city, yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="102990">He nods slowly. &quot;I suppose you are right. It is difficult to forever remain a stranger in a strange land, however. I at least one day want to see one of the cities I hear so much about.&quot;</string>
<string name="102991">He nods slowly. &quot;I suppose it is time that I learned more about your world. Part of the trouble is that I have never been to any of the cities.&quot;</string>
<string name="102992">He looks at you suddenly, getting an idea. &quot;This Waterdeep of yours, the city that the Valsharess is attacking... perhaps I could join you when you return there. Would that be acceptable?&quot;</string>
<string name="102993">He smiles broadly. &quot;Excellent. Having a guide who actually knows the place would be most fortuitous. I look forward to it.&quot;</string>
<string name="102994">&quot;Come,&quot; he urges, &quot;let us move on again. I do not wish to talk your ear off.&quot;</string>
<string name="102995">He smiles broadly. &quot;I&apos;d like that too, my lady. Perhaps you could even show me about? Then I could get better acquainted with you, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="102996">&quot;Oh,&quot; his eyes betray a moment of hurt, and then he covers it up. &quot;Fair enough. I suppose I can always travel someplace on my own, later.&quot;</string>
<string name="102997">&quot;Oh,&quot; he seems somewhat crestfallen. &quot;I was hoping to maybe have a guide to show me around the city when I&apos;m there.&quot;</string>
<string name="102998">&quot;Because I respect your opinion. Why else?&quot;</string>
<string name="102999">He frowns. &quot;Very well. I did not mean to burden you with a simple question.&quot;</string>
<string name="103000">&quot;Power is a relative term. There are beings more powerful than gods. The Lady of Pain controls Sigil and keeps all gods out... yet she is no god, herself, and worshipped by none.&quot;</string>
<string name="103001">&quot;Mmm... no, I know what I speak of as well as anyone else does. Our experiences are very different, however. Growing up in in the planes gives one a unique point of view.&quot;</string>
<string name="103002">He nods. &quot;Yes, that&apos;s true... I should have known that. I suppose I was not paying close enough attention to your practices. I do not think I would have the same capacity for such faith, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="103003">Valen sighs and looks askance at you with a bit of reluctance evident. &quot;I have been wrong about something. I owe you an apology.&quot;</string>
<string name="103004">Valen stiffens for a moment and then regards you with a frown. &quot;Too bad. You are going to get it anyway, whether you like it or not.&quot;</string>
<string name="103005">He ponders for a moment, obviously going over what he wants to say in his head. &quot;Ever since the Seer foretold your coming, I have resented you. A little.&quot;</string>
<string name="103006">&quot;I think... I think it was more because I wanted to be the one who kept the Seer safe. I had been working so long to save the rebels I did not want someone bursting in and taking all the credit.&quot;</string>
<string name="103007">&quot;So I convinced myself you could not be trusted, that perhaps the Seer&apos;s vision was wrong. And yet you have proven yourself time and again. I... am very sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="103008">He seems slightly taken aback. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="103009">He glares at you for a long moment. &quot;So you are not even going to take me seriously. So be it. Let us move on, then, and put this behind us.&quot;</string>
<string name="103010">A hint of a smirk plays along his mouth until finally he bows to you. &quot;Of course you are correct, my lady. I humbly beg for the chance to rescind my words. Could you ever see your way to forgiving me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103011">He blushes suddenly, taken by surprise. &quot;Err... surely my lady is joking?&quot;</string>
<string name="103012">He chuckles lightly, though his blush continues. &quot;Then I... I suppose I will have to consider that a forgiveness of a sort, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="103013">He sighs deeply and rolls his eyes. &quot;If you insist,&quot; he mutters. Turning to you, he bows formally. &quot;I am most sorry to have judged you carelessly, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Could you ever see your way to forgiving me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103014">&quot;I am glad,&quot; he smiles. &quot;It has been good to fight at your side so far on this journey. I begin to believe that perhaps we really will win against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="103015">&quot;I feel I must warn you, however... she may not even be our true opponent. If she holds an archdevil captive, he may indeed be far more powerful than she.&quot;</string>
<string name="103016">&quot;Little. My old master, however, was a dread Balor known as Grimash&apos;t, one of the most powerful of all tanar&apos;ri. Yet an archdevil such as the one the Valsharess holds would laugh at his abilities.&quot;</string>
<string name="103017">&quot;I say this because he may be the primary reason that the Valsharess possesses the power she does. If we could find out how she controls him, and perhaps break that control... then we might have a chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="103018">&quot;But perhaps it is pointless to speak of this now until we learn more. Let us continue on our path.&quot;</string>
<string name="103019">He is taken aback, looking at you in shock. &quot;Wh-what? What do you mean, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Do you *plan* to betray us?&quot;</string>
<string name="103020">&quot;I suppose you are correct. Still I should not have judged you so quickly. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103021">He glares at you for a long moment. &quot;And here I had thought our battling back to back... no, never mind. You wish to be flippant. Let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="103022">He glares at you for a long moment. &quot;And here I had thought our battling back to back... no, never mind. It is good that I know this now. Obviously I was not as mistaken as I thought.&quot;</string>
<string name="103023">He nods slowly, sadly. &quot;As you wish. I had to tell you that, regardless.&quot;</string>
<string name="103024">He watches you for a moment, his expression betraying the uncertainty behind his fierce eyes. &quot;I wish to talk about the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="103025">He frowns. &quot;I think what I have to say is important. If you really wish to ignore me, however, then so be it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103026">Valen stiffens, and for a moment his blue eyes flash a deep red. &quot;As you wish,&quot; he says curtly and turns away.</string>
<string name="103027">He thinks about it for a moment, and then shakes his head. &quot;It is not my place to discuss the Seer&apos;s business beyond how it relates to me, personally. But perhaps that will shed some light on what you wish to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="103028">Valen glares at you coolly for a moment before finally disregarding what you said. &quot;I think you need to know,&quot; he begins, &quot;just how important the Seer is to me... to everyone who follows her.&quot;</string>
<string name="103029">&quot;Possibly. I think you need to know just how important the Seer is to me... to everyone who follows her. I intend to protect her at all costs.&quot;</string>
<string name="103030">&quot;I am unsure how much knowledge you have of the planes, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I suspect little, in which case the Blood Wars mean nothing to you. Is that so?&quot;</string>
<string name="103031">He laughs heartily, taken by surprise. &quot;No, no,&quot; he chuckles, &quot;and surely not all men are pigs? Or do I not want to ask that question?&quot;</string>
<string name="103032">&quot;The Blood Wars are the ages-old conflict between the demons of the Abyss and the devils of Baatezu. We have battled so long and so ferociously that the War is now part of our blood.&quot;</string>
<string name="103033">&quot;There is no true hope of winning, just one battle after the next is fought wherever demons and devils encounter each other. An endless cycle of rage and bloodshed.&quot;</string>
<string name="103034">&quot;I was... recruited into those battles.&quot; He looks away from you, his eyes taking on a haunted cast. &quot;For years I fought in the Outer Planes as something less than a soldier... I was a beast.&quot;</string>
<string name="103035">&quot;I was captured,&quot; he scowls at the memory. &quot;I spent all of my youth fleeing from the Blood War, but I was scooped up by the demons and made a battle slave anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="103036">Valen thinks for a moment. &quot;I cannot be sure. Much of my time in the Abyss was spent in incoherent rage... perhaps twenty years? More? Time has little meaning there.&quot;</string>
<string name="103037">&quot;Thank you. It is... something I try not to contemplate any longer. At the time, however, it was all I knew.&quot;</string>
<string name="103038">He nods to you and attempts a wan smile of appreciation. &quot;Thank you, my lady. It is... something I try not to think about any longer. At the time, however, it was all I knew.&quot;</string>
<string name="103039">&quot;The Blood Wars made me into the warrior I am,&quot; he nods to his armor and weapons. &quot;Though it meant nothing to me. I was a mindless soldier, no more.&quot;</string>
<string name="103040">&quot;My infernal masters encouraged the demonic blood that was within me. I was beholden to it... I reveled in it, and was desperate to please my masters with each opponent I slaughtered.&quot;</string>
<string name="103041">&quot;There was nothing in me that was human, and that meant less than nothing to me. Until the Seer found me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103042">He shakes his head. &quot;No. The first time I saw her, I was summoned along with my master to your world by a spell... to fight against the Seer, in fact.&quot;</string>
<string name="103043">&quot;A drow priestess had called us and so we were beholden to do battle. During the attack I came face to face with the Seer... and she... looked into my soul. I have no other way to describe it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103044">&quot;We were banished back to the planes, but the memory of the Seer stayed with me. It haunted my dreams.&quot; Valen closes his eyes, shuddering. &quot;For the first time in decades, I began to remember the life I once had.&quot;</string>
<string name="103045">He pauses, closing his eyes. &quot;My master sensed my... difficulty. I was tortured, for months or years... I really could not tell. I only remember that it was agony beyond measure. Demons know how to torture.&quot;</string>
<string name="103046">&quot;Eventually I was able to escape Grimash&apos;t.&quot; For a moment Valen&apos;s eyes take on a haunted look. &quot;I made my way to your world, an alien place for a planar such as me, and searched until I found the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="103047">&quot;She healed my wounds and... spoke to me. She offered to help me. If I wanted it.&quot; His voice is thick with emotion. &quot;She saved me in every way that one can be saved.&quot;</string>
<string name="103048">He regards you with a cool look. &quot;It is nothing like that at all. The Seer has been my guide and my savior, never my lover.&quot;</string>
<string name="103049">He regards you with a cool look. &quot;That is beneath you, my lady. The Seer is my mentor and my guide, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="103050">&quot;I thought it necessary to tell you all this simply so you know how truly important the Seer is to me. I would never betray her... or allow her to be betrayed.&quot;</string>
<string name="103051">He regards you coldly before looking away. &quot;My pleasure. Just remember that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103052">He nods, looking away from you. &quot;So we do. At any rate, I simply thought you should know that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103053">He grimaces. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, I do not mean to make accusations. I simply thought you should know that.&quot; He turns to the path ahead. &quot;At any rate, let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="103054">He frowns. &quot;That was my choice, not hers. The Seer has only ever sought to help me. She has demanded nothing in return.&quot;</string>
<string name="103055">Valen smirks. &quot;Yes, he did. He was unsuccessful. It seems that all my skill at killing devils also applies just as well to demons. Imagine that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103056">Valen glares at you. &quot;Well I would not want to bore you. Suffice it to say that the Seer saved me... in every way that someone can be saved.&quot;</string>
<string name="103057">His voice is flat. &quot;It wasn&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="103058">&quot;Not directly, no. But... I think she was the first person who had really looked at me. And therefore she made me look at myself. I didn&apos;t like what I saw.&quot;</string>
<string name="103059">&quot;I had little choice. I was a slave, you see, the property of my demonic master. He threw me into each battle and I fought to survive.&quot;</string>
<string name="103060">He regards you with his intense blue eyes, his gaze seeming to bore into you as he considers his words carefully. &quot;I wish to know,&quot; he begins, &quot;what makes you so special?&quot;</string>
<string name="103061">He regards you coolly with an upraised brow and says nothing for a moment. &quot;You could try. But we are not here to fight each other, you and I.&quot;</string>
<string name="103062">He shrugs, avoiding your gaze. &quot;Perhaps it is and perhaps it isn&apos;t. Either way it is still a question, and one that I think deserves an answer.&quot;</string>
<string name="103063">&quot;I speak, of course, of the fact that you have replaced me as the leader of our forces. I have kept us alive for months, and suddenly you appear,&quot; he makes a slash with his hand, &quot;and it is over.&quot;</string>
<string name="103064">Valen is silent for a long minute, seemingly troubled by his thoughts. &quot;The Seer believes what she believes. Her goddess leads and she follows without question, and this has been enough... so far.&quot;</string>
<string name="103065">His glance is cold. &quot;I am not brooding. And I shall speak my mind if I feel the need.&quot;</string>
<string name="103066">&quot;Is that so?&quot; He regards you with interest. &quot;You sound quite confident. Some might call that bravado, I think, considering what we face.&quot;</string>
<string name="103067">&quot;I believe that the Seer has visions. I believe it may even be that her goddess sends them. I am a being of the planes, however, and I ascribe no infallibility to gods and goddesses.&quot;</string>
<string name="103068">&quot;The Seer believes that you will lead us to victory, but nothing is said of what such a victory might cost us.&quot; He looks at you pointedly once more. &quot;Some costs, I think, are too high.&quot;</string>
<string name="103069">&quot;Meaning that the Seer assumes that you are here to help us. I make no such assumption.&quot;</string>
<string name="103070">His stare is intense. &quot;I have led these people through every danger so far and kept the Seer safe throughout. I won&apos;t see them betrayed.&quot;</string>
<string name="103071">&quot;Thank you.&quot; His stance does not soften. &quot;But that is why I must have an answer on this.&quot;</string>
<string name="103072">&quot;I don&apos;t think it is. My loyalty is to the Seer, but these drow have been my responsibility for too long to simply let them be killed. I will have an answer.&quot;</string>
<string name="103073">&quot;Indeed. The geas.&quot; He frowns. &quot;I distrust magic. I especially distrust magic&apos;s ability to control the will. Geas or no geas, I expect you&apos;ll find a way.&quot;</string>
<string name="103074">&quot;I can&apos;t say I wouldn&apos;t do that same. It must be difficult to be so... bound.&quot; He grimaces. &quot;But what would you do if the geas were gone? Would you abandon us to the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="103075">&quot;A fair answer. I suppose I can ask little else of you, given the circumstances.&quot;</string>
<string name="103076">&quot;I said I would help you and I intend to do so faithfully,&quot; he says with renewed steel, &quot;but I intend to watch you, as well. I don&apos;t trust you, and it is as simple as that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103077">He nods to the path ahead. &quot;Don&apos;t let me delay us any longer. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="103078">He studies you again, obviously uncertain. &quot;So you say. I suppose we shall see, won&apos;t we?&quot;</string>
<string name="103079">&quot;I see.&quot; He looks disappointed. &quot;Then perhaps my fears are well-justified.&quot;</string>
<string name="103080">&quot;A fair answer. I might feel the same in your shoes. Just because I sympathize, however, does not mean I can relax my guard.&quot;</string>
<string name="103081">&quot;And perhaps that is enough for the Seer. I suppose it shall have to be enough for me, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="103082">&quot;And why not? You&apos;ve no loyalty to beholden yourself to the drow or the Seer. For all I know you may see the death of any drow as a good thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="103083">&quot;Because the Seer asked me to assist you, and you said you needed that assistance. Why? Have you changed your mind?&quot;</string>
<string name="103084">He regards you with an arched brow. &quot;Would you give it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103085">He stops and considers for a short while, his eyes watching you with a burning intensity. Finally he continues. &quot;I am not asking you to give your word. Too much has been asked of you already.&quot;</string>
<string name="103086">He clenches his jaw, fury flashing in his eyes. &quot;I see. All drow deserve to die simply because of what they are. Or is it because you&apos;ve a blood-lust that demands it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103087">&quot;So do you mean that? Or are you just toying with me? Would you abandon us to the Valsharess given the chance?&quot;</string>
<string name="103088">He clenches his jaw, fury flashing in his eyes. &quot;I see. The self-righteousness of a celestial, but not half of the wisdom. The Seer is a drow, and it does not matter that her cause is just.&quot;</string>
<string name="103089">&quot;That&apos;s true. But you *are* in charge now. Does that mean nothing to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103090">He studies you thoughtfully. &quot;I... am glad to hear that, if a little surprised. You barely know us, and you&apos;ve no reason to accept such a duty gladly.&quot;</string>
<string name="103091">&quot;That may be all that&apos;s important to you and the Seer, but that&apos;s not all that&apos;s important to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103092">He studies you, frowning thoughtfully. &quot;No, I suppose you didn&apos;t at that. None of us did, yet here we are.&quot;</string>
<string name="103093">&quot;You may not be directing them at this moment, but when the time comes I&apos;m certain that the Seer intends to put the lives of our forces in your hands.&quot; He frowns. &quot;That is what I worry about.&quot;</string>
<string name="103094">He studies you carefully. &quot;I suppose you could refuse. I would assume that when the time comes, your life will be tied to the outcome of the war, just as ours are.&quot;</string>
<string name="103095">His voice is dry. &quot;According to everything I&apos;ve been told, being dramatic is one of my specialties.&quot;</string>
<string name="103096">He maintains a serious face for a few moments longer before finally sighing and rolling his eyes. &quot;Very well. You are probably correct... I am making too much of this. I would still like to know your thoughts.&quot;</string>
<string name="103097">A flicker of a smile crosses his face and is gone just as quickly. &quot;You have both of those qualities in abundance, my lady, but that is not what I am referring to.&quot;</string>
<string name="103098">A flicker of a smile crosses his face and is gone just as quickly. &quot;Surely my lady knows that she needs neither of those things to intrigue a man.&quot; He looks away suddenly. &quot;But that is not what I speak of.&quot;</string>
<string name="103099">--------- Romance Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="103100">&quot;So it seems we are arriving at the end of our adventure. Soon we will be out of the Nine Hells... and not a moment too soon, in my opinion.&quot;</string>
<string name="103101">&quot;I... I know. I have been fighting the urges of my blood ever since we arrived in Baator. The infernal taint on my soul ever pushes me to continue the Blood Wars, it seems.&quot;</string>
<string name="103102">&quot;When I think of all the time I spent fighting here in the Outer Planes... when I think of my humanity being swallowed whole by my demonic half... I can&apos;t help but feel there is little hope for me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="103103">Valen&apos;s tail lashes irritably as he frowns. &quot;True enough. We have Mephistopheles to deal with, don&apos;t we? Let&apos;s get on with it, then. I would sooner have this over and done with.&quot;</string>
<string name="103104">&quot;Deekin&apos;s True Name! What&apos;s it you want me to be doing, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="103105">&quot;Nothing? Nothing at all? Well that&apos;s a waste of a True Name, if you ask Deekin. How much did you spend on that again, boss? Oh well, we gots an adventure to finish, so hurry up.&quot;</string>
<string name="103106">&quot;Boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="103107">&quot;Yes, boss. Deekin will be all right... Really sad, but all right. Are you planning on dying, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="103108">&quot;Yes, boss. Deekin believe in himself. Anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="103109">&quot;Uh... Boss? Deekin kinda needs that soul. It&apos;s the only one he&apos;s got, see? Are you sure that&apos;s what you be wanting?&quot;</string>
<string name="103110">&quot;Oh phew! You had Deekin scared for a second there, boss. Maybe these True Names aren&apos;t so much fun after all... Have you gots any other commands for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103111">&quot;Eeek... Okay, boss, here goes nothing... G&apos;bye... So long and thanks for all the fish... Don&apos;t let the gate hits you on the way out... AieeeeeEEEEeeee!&quot;</string>
<string name="103112">&quot;No... Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, do not do this...&quot;</string>
<string name="103113">&quot;But what I did was wrong! Countless innocents died by my actions and countless friends as well. To feel no guilt, no remorse, is to become cold to the world. It would be inhuman. Is that what you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103114">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The ability to take responsibility for my past is the only dignity that still remains to me... Is there anything you would ask in its stead?&quot;</string>
<string name="103115">&quot;I suppose the gods have their mysteries. But what is commanded in their tongue must have their sanction, for good or ill. By your command, I am atoned... Is there anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="103116">&quot;Then I will not suffer, you have my word. It shall be as you command. Is there anything more you would ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103117">&quot;A curse, then, upon your descendants. May they each come to know despair... It will be as you command. Have you any other sufferings to heap upon me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103118">&quot;My soul? But that is all I have! I know not what power it might grant you but, without it, I will join the Lost... Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="103119">&quot;For that, I thank you. Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, stop this madness! For my sake, I beg you, ask nothing more...&quot;</string>
<string name="103120">&quot;As you command, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="103121">&quot;But I am a paladin again, something I could not have achieved without you! ...Yet this is your command and I must obey... Damn you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, let there be nothing more you would ask of me!&quot;</string>
<string name="103122">&quot;But how can it be love? ...Alas, you have commanded me and I will love you in whatever fashion I am able until the end of my days... Is there anything else you demand of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103123">&quot;No... What are you doing? How dare you!&quot;</string>
<string name="103124">&quot;Good, I am glad you have come to your senses. Now let us hurry, Mephistopheles awaits.&quot;</string>
<string name="103125">&quot;Don&apos;t be silly, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You don&apos;t need to command me by my True Name for that! To the contrary, I revel in it. The books of history will remember me as a great evil... Anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="103126">&quot;My soul? But that is all I have! I know not what power it might grant you but, without it, I will join the Lost... Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="103127">&quot;For that, I thank you. Is there anything else you would force upon me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103128">&quot;As you command, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="103129">&quot;But I am a blackguard, a path I chose on your advice! ...But you leave me no choice. I will do as you command... Please let there be nothing more you would ask of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103130">&quot;My... My lord? ...You have commanded me and I will love you in whatever fashion I am able until the end of my days... Is there anything else you demand of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103131">&quot;Yes, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="103132">&quot;My True Name... What... what do you intend to do with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103133">&quot;I... I am relieved. Now hurry, we must go through the gate and return to Toril. If we wait much longer, Mephistopheles will destroy all of Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="103134">A look of fear creeps into her dark-veiled eyes. &quot;But if I give you my soul, it will be the death of me. I would be nothing but dust without it... Are you sure of what you ask, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="103135">&quot;Thank you for that small mercy, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. I beg you, though, ask nothing more of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103136">The drow screams as her vital essence is ripped away. Before your eyes she ages a thousand years, her skin wrinkling, her eyes sinking, her body withering into a pile of bones and dust. Nathyrra&apos;s soul is now yours.</string>
<string name="103137">The drow&apos;s head snaps back and she lets out a cry of pain and despair. She speaks through tightly clenched teeth: &quot;You would force me to love you? What kind of beast are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103138">&quot;My True Name gives you mastery over me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am compelled to obey, no matter how you abuse your power. But if I ever find a way to break free, I will kill you! ...Now what more abuse have you in store for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103139">She spits on the ground in disgust, but she can do nothing else against the power of her True Name. &quot;Will that be all?&quot;</string>
<string name="103140">She lets out a cry of rage, but does as you command. When the kiss is over, she turns away, unable to face you. It&apos;s obvious you&apos;ve broken her spirit utterly.</string>
<string name="103141">&quot;You&apos;ve made your point, &lt;FirstName&gt;,&quot; she says in a fierce whisper. &quot;Now we must find out if your power over Mephistopheles is as absolute as your power over me. What more do you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103142">Nathyrra&apos;s eyes open wide in surprise. She seems about to object, then she bows her head. When she looks up, there is a strange expression on her face.</string>
<string name="103143">&quot;My... my guilt is gone,&quot; she says, amazed. &quot;It has vanished, as if it never existed. I... I&apos;m free. Thank you for this, &lt;FirstName&gt;; you have given me a gift unlike any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="103144">&quot;But despite your kindness, I still find this... unsettling. The power of a True Name is a great responsibility; one I hope you will not abuse. Is there anything more you wish of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103145">Valen&apos;s eyes grow wide as he hears the words. &quot;My True Name,&quot; he acknowledges, his eyes filled with a mixture of indignation and awe. &quot;How do you... intend to command me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103146">Valen&apos;s eyes show only relief. &quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am grateful. Now... we should go through the gate as soon as possible if we are to rescue your Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="103147">Valen&apos;s eyes flash a dangerous red. &quot;Take my soul,&quot; he growls, &quot;and that will be the end of me. Forever. Are you certain that is what you wish?&quot;</string>
<string name="103148">Valen nods, relieved. &quot;Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Please... ask nothing more of me, I beg you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103149">Before your eyes, Valen begins to shake violently. He screams in pure rage and agony as his vital essence is suddenly stripped away, his physical form fading away to so much dust. Valen&apos;s soul is now yours.</string>
<string name="103150">He sneers at you with disgust. &quot;You would force me to love you, my lady? After all we have been through?&quot;</string>
<string name="103151">He looks away, unwilling to look you in the eyes. &quot;Will there be anything else, my lady?&quot;</string>
<string name="103152">Valen stares at you with his intense blue eyes, clenching his jaw. &quot;So be it... my love. Your mastery over me knows no bounds. Should I ever free myself, however... I will kill you. Trust me on that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103153">He glares at you, his eyes burning a dark red... but he says nothing. Slowly, his gauntleted fists clench and unclench.</string>
<string name="103154">Valen struggles to resist your command, but finally gives in. He leans in, kissing you tenderly on the lips with his eyes closed. When you part, tears are streaming down his cheeks.</string>
<string name="103155">&quot;I hope this makes you happy, my lady,&quot; he spits. He refuses to look you in the eyes.</string>
<string name="103156">Valen looks at you curiously, as if he didn&apos;t quite understand what you said... and then suddenly his eyes go wide. He stiffens, an electrical current running through his body violently.</string>
<string name="103157">A moment later, he spasms as a strange, black sheen seemingly lifts from his body and is dispersed. When he opens his eyes there is something... different about him. The otherworldly aura, the rage within his soul... all of it is gone.</string>
<string name="103158">&quot;I... I can&apos;t believe it!&quot; He looks at himself with incredulity, slowly smiling. &quot;The taint... it&apos;s gone! I feel... I feel wonderful! I feel human!!&quot; Laughing joyously, Valen hugs you. &quot;Thank you! Thank you for this wonderful gift!&quot;</string>
<string name="103159">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can never repay you for this. Now... we should go through the gate as soon as possible if we are to rescue your Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="103160">He stares at you in confusion. &quot;I am grateful, my lady, but... you would force me to love you? Even though that is not truly love at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="103161">He stops and gazes into your eyes, his expression suddenly loving. Leaning in he kisses you softly. &quot;I suppose that there is.&quot;</string>
<string name="103162">&quot;Waterdeep awaits us, my love. The longer we wait here, the more people are hurt by Mephistopheles... he must be stopped.&quot;</string>
<string name="103163">His smile comes easily to him now. &quot;You have no idea, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It... it is as if a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders.&quot;</string>
<string name="103164">Valen sighs sadly. &quot;No time? No, there never does seem to be any time, does there? Are we truly friends, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Does that mean nothing to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103165">He gazes at you sadly. &quot;No time, is it? Is this the response I can expect from now on? I love you, my lady, but you do not leave me with much hope for us, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="103166">Valen stiffens at your words, his eyes flashing with sudden anger. &quot;And that is about the response I would expect from you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I should know better by now than to speak my thoughts around you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103167">&quot;Let&apos;s go on and find Mephistopheles and have this over with now. It seems to be the only thing you&apos;re interested in.&quot;</string>
<string name="103168">Valen stiffens at your words, his tail lashing. &quot;You make it sound as if my feelings are worthy only of ridicule. I thought you were a friend, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="103169">He stares at you a moment longer, scowling. &quot;And that is all that is important, is it? So be it. Let&apos;s go on and have this done with quickly.&quot;</string>
<string name="103170">&quot;Whining, is it? Then I see we are not true friends at all.&quot; He turns away, scowling. &quot;No matter. Let&apos;s find Mephistopheles and have this done with.&quot;</string>
<string name="103171">&quot;That&apos;s true. I should know better, I suppose. It is just... difficult to always feel so alone and cut off from others I encounter.&quot;</string>
<string name="103172">&quot;I know. I suppose I should not be angry with you, for there is nothing you can truly do for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103173">He gazes at you sadly. &quot;I do love you, my lady, and therefore I wonder why you would treat me so coldly? Is there no hope for us, either?&quot;</string>
<string name="103174">&quot;She has tried. She brought me back from the brink, from the snarling beast I once was... but she can only do so much.&quot;</string>
<string name="103175">&quot;In the end, I am on my own with this. My demon half will always be a part of me, something I cannot escape even if I return to your world. I will have to accept that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103176">He nods. &quot;Perhaps you are right. All wounds heal in time, correct? And in the meantime there is still much to be done.&quot;</string>
<string name="103177">He sighs and gestures ahead. &quot;Let&apos;s find Mephistopheles and have this over with. I look forward to fighting at your side, one more time at least.&quot;</string>
<string name="103178">&quot;No,&quot; he shakes his head. &quot;No, that&apos;s not necessary. It is simply something I have to do on my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="103179">He smiles gratefully. &quot;Thank you, my friend. I appreciate the gesture.&quot;</string>
<string name="103180">He gazes at you sadly. &quot;I do not know. I have felt cut off from other beings for so long, I... I&apos;m not sure what hope is. Do you think there is hope for the two of us, my lady?&quot;</string>
<string name="103181">He nods slowly, his expression heartbroken. &quot;I... suppose I can expect no more than that. Very well. Let&apos;s find Mephistopheles and have this over with. I do not want to drag this out more.&quot;</string>
<string name="103182">&quot;Whining, is it? Then I begin to wonder if there is truly love between us at all.&quot; He turns away, scowling. &quot;No matter. Let&apos;s find Mephistopheles and have this done with.&quot;</string>
<string name="103183">He nods. &quot;That is good advice. And you are correct, my lady, as always. I will put my thoughts aside then... if you say we have hope, I believe it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103184">He grins and gestures ahead. &quot;Let&apos;s find Mephistopheles and have this battle over with. I cannot wait for the future to come, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="103185">&quot;Is there?&quot; He looks at you, smiling ruefully. &quot;Then I shall have to rely on you to remind me of it, my lady. For when you tell me it is so, I believe it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103186">&quot;Deekin feels sad, too. How is Deekin ever going to organize all these notes?&quot; He rifles through his backpack, sighing. &quot;Deekin thinks he lost some in lava, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="103187">Valen smiles sadly, patting Deekin on the head. &quot;You are a good companion to travel with, kobold. You lift my spirits when I think nothing will.&quot;</string>
<string name="103188">Deekin gives Valen a toothy grin. &quot;You just gots to trust in the boss. Deekin trusts in the boss and everything is okay. One day Deekin hopes to be as great a hero as the boss is.&quot;</string>
<string name="103189">&quot;A worthy goal, to be certain.&quot;</string>
<string name="103190">&quot;You still be very sad, though, even if you say Deekin lifts your spirits. Deekin sees it in your eyes.&quot;</string>
<string name="103191">&quot;Well, I for one will be quite glad to be away from this place.&quot; Nathyrra looks about her grimly. &quot;The lost souls here... call to me. It is unsettling.&quot;</string>
<string name="103192">&quot;They call to you? I must admit, I hear nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="103193">&quot;I just feel as if I was meant to remain here. I have... sent many souls here, I suspect. It haunts me.&quot; She sighs and looks up at Valen. &quot;You know what I speak of, do you not?&quot;</string>
<string name="103194">Valen looks around, intrigued. &quot;This almost seems to be some kind of... demi-plane. How interesting. Does it have a name, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="103195">&quot;And the Reaper is an outsider, is he? How did you come to acquire the services of such a being?&quot;</string>
<string name="103196">&quot;Indeed? Very well, then, &lt;FirstName&gt;... have it your way. Such demi-planes are rarely lying about to be picked up, however. Most likely this is a part of something greater. But you know best.&quot;</string>
<string name="103197">&quot;I see. And what do you know of this demi-plane, if that is indeed what it is?&quot;</string>
<string name="103198">&quot;Interesting. A demi-plane that has no allegiance to any higher power? And how did you come to have access to it? No matter, I suppose... you know what you are doing.&quot;</string>
<string name="103199">He arches a brow. &quot;You don&apos;t know or you won&apos;t tell me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103200">Valen looks around, grimacing as if realizing something very unpleasant. &quot;Lovely,&quot; he mutters. &quot;We are in the Hells.&quot;</string>
<string name="103201">Valen rolls his eyes. &quot;You don&apos;t need to say it twice. Let&apos;s go... I&apos;m as eager to get out of here as you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="103202">&quot;Indeed.&quot; He looks around a bit more. &quot;This is Baator, also known as the Nine Hells. More specifically it is one of the nine planes that make up Baator, the icy graveyard known as Cania. Home to Mephistopheles... until recently, it seems.&quot;</string>
<string name="103203">&quot;I should warn you now that my presence may cause... problems. I am tanar&apos;ri, a half-demon from the Abyss, and the devils of Baator are my natural opponents thanks to the Blood Wars.&quot;</string>
<string name="103204">&quot;That is just the thing... my own blood will make me want to attack them, and vice versa.&quot; He frowns deeply. &quot;I will... try to control myself. We should find a way out of here soon, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="103205">&quot;Not all the hellish planes are places of smoke and fire. Some are icy, as this one is... some are dark and murky underwater graves, while still others are civilized with cities of their own.&quot; He shrugs. &quot;This is no worse than any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="103206">&quot;I have been here before, in fact. I spent many long years fighting in the Blood War both here and in the Abyss.&quot;</string>
<string name="103207">&quot;So here we are. This town appeared from nowhere, they say... ripe for the pickings, as most races of the Underdark would put it. So will the Valsharess, come to think of it. She&apos;ll send someone here if she hasn&apos;t already.&quot;</string>
<string name="103208">Valen glares in your direction. &quot;I have a few suggestions where you could go, if you like. If you ever want to hear them, let me know.&quot;</string>
<string name="103209">&quot;Just be aware that there may already be enemies here... but beyond that, naturally I agree with you. Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="103210">&quot;Careful here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Other races are nothing but potential thralls to the mind tyrants. They will think nothing of invading your mind and pillaging it of all knowledge if you let them.&quot;</string>
<string name="103211">&quot;If you say so. Remember that killing everything here will not help the rebel army at all... we need to negotiate with the Elder Brain, not slaughter it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103212">&quot;You must speak with the Elder Brain so it can convince other mind flayer communities to abandon the Valsharess. If you keep your mind well-guarded, perhaps we can do this without violence.&quot;</string>
<string name="103213">&quot;I hope you are right. I will be very angry with you if we end up as thralls, however... if I still have a mind left to be angry with.&quot;</string>
<string name="103214">&quot;I would suspect the helmets of those duergar should protect you. Nathyrra would have a better idea than I would, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="103215">&quot;So long as we present you as the leader of our group, they won&apos;t bother probing my mind. They&apos;ll think I&apos;m your thrall. Illithids have a certain strange pride that way... they&apos;d be de-spooned by the Elder Brain if they were ever caught noticing a servant.&quot;</string>
<string name="103216">&quot;Just remember to play the role of a slaver visiting Zorvak&apos;Mur, and things should go smoothly. At least, as smoothly as one could expect in a city full of mind flayers.&quot;</string>
<string name="103217">Valen frowns. &quot;I will assume that is a joke. I had a master once in the Abyss, but never again. I will play the role of servant during your visit to Zorvak&apos;Mur, but don&apos;t forget that it is but an act!&quot;</string>
<string name="103218">&quot;As long as you remember to play the role of a slaver visiting the city, then things should go smoothly. I would prefer to avoid attempting to scour the entire place clean by combat unless necessary.&quot;</string>
<string name="103219">Valen chuckles, blushing suddenly. &quot;I... don&apos;t think I would make a very good thrall, my lady. My demonic blood makes me surly and moody at the best of times.&quot;</string>
<string name="103220">His blush deepens and he looks away. &quot;You play games with me, my lady. Please... let us deal with the situation at hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="103221">Valen turns on you, suddenly angry. His eyes flash red for a moment as he growls. &quot;I sincerely doubt that, my lady. I am *not* an animal for you to prod and poke at your leisure!&quot;</string>
<string name="103222">Valen starts to say something else, then snaps his mouth shut and slowly sighs. &quot;You are a very strange woman. I never know quite how to take you, it seems.&quot;</string>
<string name="103223">&quot;Defensive? Defensive?! I am just,&quot; he flounders for a moment, &quot;just not submitting to ridicule!&quot;</string>
<string name="103224">He looks confused. &quot;Is that a compliment? Sometimes I can never be sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="103225">&quot;Very well. Just remember to play the role of a slaver visiting Zorvak&apos;Mur and things should go smoothly enough. I really do not wish to attempt to &quot;clean out&quot; the enclave through combat unless necessary.&quot;</string>
<string name="103226">&quot;So I understand. If it works, just be careful not to remove it once we&apos;re inside Zorvak&apos;Mur. I&apos;d hate to be surrounded by these things if they suddenly become hostile.&quot;</string>
<string name="103227">&quot;This temple has the feel of strong magic. Evil magic. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to discover that it&apos;s the source of all the undead that have been bolstering the Valsharess&apos; numbers in her army.&quot;</string>
<string name="103228">&quot;The undead and more, most likely. We could be dealing with priestesses of Kiaransalee... or even a cult of necromancers. There&apos;s no way to know without investigating, and that could be quite dangerous.&quot;</string>
<string name="103229">&quot;Unimportant? Our survival is unimportant?&quot; He shrugs. &quot;I thought you would want to hear my observations. Very well, then... I shall remain silent.&quot;</string>
<string name="103230">He grins. &quot;Of that I have little doubt. Let&apos;s be off, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="103231">&quot;Good. You&apos;ll not be facing this alone, however. I will be fighting at your side.&quot;</string>
<string name="103232">&quot;I, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="103233">&quot;Me too, Boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="103234">&quot;This village... these are all surface folk. Why would they be here? The Underdark races use surfacers as slaves or food... or both. Nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="103235">&quot;Perhaps. There seems to be little danger from the surfacers themselves... they are captives, if not slaves. Who their masters might be is the real question.&quot;</string>
<string name="103236">&quot;Perhaps. But who do they serve? And why?&quot;</string>
<string name="103237">&quot;You are right, of course. There is a mystery here, however... I suggest caution.&quot;</string>
<string name="103238">&quot;Do you mean is this an illusion or some kind of spell to hide their true nature? No, I don&apos;t think so... though I can&apos;t be sure, of course. But I think they really are what they appear.&quot;</string>
<string name="103239">&quot;These ruins are... very strange. I am not well-versed in the architecture of the Underdark races, but it&apos;s nothing like what I&apos;ve seen. Not drow, not illithid, not beholder.&quot;</string>
<string name="103240">Valen shoots you a dire look. &quot;I don&apos;t like going into a situation without knowing what to expect. This place feels... wrong, somehow.&quot;</string>
<string name="103241">&quot;The air feels heavy. Flat. The magic here is dead, I&apos;m sure of it... we planars are sensitive to such things.&quot;</string>
<string name="103242">&quot;True... but if there is something dangerous to be found inside, no doubt it knows about the dead magic zone and has adapted to it, meaning it is just as deadly as ever.&quot;</string>
<string name="103243">He grasps his weapon firmly. &quot;Thankfully I&apos;m no wizard. Lead on, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I will follow.&quot;</string>
<string name="103244">&quot;I have no idea, to tell the truth. If we go inside, however, we&apos;re going to have to rely on something other than magic to get us through.&quot;</string>
<string name="103245">&quot;Perhaps. I dislike walking into a situation where I do not know what I face, however. All of this feels... wrong, somehow.&quot;</string>
<string name="103246">&quot;The Eye Tyrant is going to be somewhere in these tunnels. Finding it won&apos;t be easy, however... the beholders will all defend it to the last one of them, if need be.&quot;</string>
<string name="103247">&quot;Hardly. The beholders are formidable opponents, however. I have no interest in being turned to stone or disintegrated, amongst other fates they can bestow. Let&apos;s simply be cautious.&quot;</string>
<string name="103248">&quot;True. We will have to keep an eye out for them. They may attack us to assist their masters, so we should be wary.&quot;</string>
<string name="103249">&quot;So will they.&quot; He looks at you, suddenly grinning mischievously. &quot;All dozen or so of them.&quot;</string>
<string name="103250">Valen laughs but says nothing further, gesturing for you to lead on.</string>
<string name="103251">&quot;Mmm. Golems make for particularly implacable foes. If there are as many here as the tales say, we will be in for a challenge. Are you certain we are prepared for this, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="103252">&quot;No, of course not. But golems present special difficulties. Magic has little effect on them, many weapons can&apos;t even harm them. And these golems may be different than others.&quot;</string>
<string name="103253">&quot;The wizard who created them was supposed to be a master at creating such constructs. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if we encounter something no one has run into before.&quot;</string>
<string name="103254">&quot;At any rate, just be careful where you direct us. Wizards keep them as guardians for a reason.&quot;</string>
<string name="103255">&quot;You&apos;re special; I can&apos;t let anything happen to you. Please, promise me you&apos;ll be careful.&quot;</string>
<string name="103256">Nathyrra scowls, but catches herself before she spits out something she might regret. In a flat voice she says, &quot;Fine. Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="103257">&quot;Remember: the fate of all who follow the Seer is in your hands, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you fall, our hopes fall with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103258">The drow gives her head an exasperated shake. &quot;Spare me your clumsy flirtations, male. I meant you are special because of the Seer&apos;s visions. You are supposed to be our savior.&quot;</string>
<string name="103259">Nathyrra allows herself the hint of a smile before replying. &quot;That is kind of you to say, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But actually, I was referring to the Seer&apos;s vision. You are destined to be our savior.&quot;</string>
<string name="103260">&quot;I just wish to warn you: when we are at the docks, be careful. The Dark River is the key to Lith My&apos;athar&apos;s defensibility, as no army can cross it. It&apos;s rivers are poison and the creatures within it deadly.&quot;</string>
<string name="103261">&quot;Good. When you wish to cross, simply look for Cavallas. He is called &apos;the Boatman&apos; in these parts simply because he possesses the only craft able to cross the Dark River&apos;s waters.&quot;</string>
<string name="103262">&quot;If you wish to cross, simply look for Cavallas. He is called &apos;the Boatman&apos; in these parts simply because he possesses the only craft able to cross the Dark River&apos;s waters.&quot;</string>
<string name="103263">&quot;I would suggest caution when dealing with Cavallas, however. He is... a bit strange, I must admit.&quot;</string>
<string name="103264">&quot;It will stop them from attacking this side of the city, at least. There are no bridges across the Dark River - any that get built are quickly washed away by rising waters.&quot;</string>
<string name="103265">&quot;The waters are poisonous and the currents deadly swift. Only the most skilled boatman can go from one bank to the other without being dragged down to a watery grave.&quot;</string>
<string name="103266">&quot;I understand you didn&apos;t reach the Underdark by the... normal route. In that case you might not be aware of exactly what it is. I can explain, if you like.&quot;</string>
<string name="103267">&quot;You believe so?&quot; Valen looks at you with an arched brow. &quot;So be it. I hope you are as prepared for the dangers that await you as you claim.&quot;</string>
<string name="103268">&quot;There is the world above,&quot; he points up, &quot;that you know. The surface. And there is the world below,&quot; he gestures about him.</string>
<string name="103269">&quot;The real mistake to make here would be to assume that the Underdark is little more than a cavern of some kind. It is not. It is an entire world, complete with seas and rivers and many layers.&quot;</string>
<string name="103270">&quot;And the first rule for every creature of the Underdark is survival. There are precious few who would not enslave you or make you their dinner... or sell you to one who would.&quot;</string>
<string name="103271">&quot;The Seer seems to think that you are special enough that we should place our lives in your hands. I wonder if that is wise... I suppose I shall see.&quot;</string>
<string name="103272">&quot;Deekin places his life in boss&apos; hands and Deekin gots no complaints. But Deekin&apos;s life be only really little.&quot;</string>
<string name="103273">&quot;Well, I... I suppose that&apos;s something, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103274">&quot;Are you questioning the Seer, Valen?&quot;</string>
<string name="103275">&quot;Not yet, Nathyrra. Not yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="103276">&quot;If I had the power, naturally I would.&quot; He glances your way and smiles faintly. &quot;Perhaps I&apos;ll think of this occasion should that ever happen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103277">&quot;Shall we continue our travels, then, or would you like me to remain here?&quot;</string>
<string name="103278">He looks at your companions curiously. &quot;I would gladly go with you, but it looks like you have plenty of help as it is. Let me know when you truly need my help.&quot;</string>
<string name="103279">He nods. &quot;Do not leave me for too long. I dislike being idle.&quot;</string>
<string name="103280">His face is grim as Valen suddenly stares into your eyes. He reaches out with a rough hand and brushes your cheek. &quot;I would storm the Nine Hells themselves to bring you back to me, I swear it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103281">He stares at the ground for a long moment, avoiding your gaze. &quot;Whether it is my fault or not, I failed you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I do not intend to fall again.&quot;</string>
<string name="103282">Valen turns and regards you with a bemused expression. &quot;I am more accustomed to fighting on my own, and I have done so against far more enemies without perishing I assure you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103283">&quot;If we are to survive, we must help each other.&quot; He stares at you pointedly. &quot;That is, of course, assuming you still want me to travel with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103284">Valen seems about to protest, but then closes his mouth and is silent for a moment. He nods curtly. &quot;I don&apos;t intend to,&quot; he says with quiet determination.</string>
<string name="103285">His smile is as sudden as it is rare, radiating a gentle smile that touches his brilliant blue eyes. &quot;That&apos;s good to hear,&quot; he grins, &quot;but I&apos;d rather not make a habit of it regardless.&quot;</string>
<string name="103286">Almost absently, he reaches up and caresses your cheek with his rough hand... and then drops it a moment later, looking away. &quot;We should be going, no?&quot;</string>
<string name="103287">------- This line must be placed at the end of inter-party banter ---------</string>
<string name="103288">&quot;Aribeth. I understand that you were once a follower of Tyr, a god of justice. Are you still?&quot;</string>
<string name="103289">Aribeth regards Valen with a cool, upraised brow. &quot;I do. Why do you ask?&quot;</string>
<string name="103290">&quot;I find it odd that you would still be able to have such faith in your god after all that has been done to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103291">&quot;And what do you know of that?&quot;</string>
<string name="103292">&quot;I know enough. I am from the surface lands, after all, I am not a drow. I know who you are and what happened in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="103293">Aribeth thinks on the question for a long minute. &quot;Nothing was done to me. I did it to myself, and I pray for Tyr&apos;s forgiveness.&quot;</string>
<string name="103294">Valen snorts with derision. &quot;I also know who Fenthick is. Was *that* justice?&quot;</string>
<string name="103295">Her eyes harden. &quot;Perhaps not. But all the rage I felt then should not have... did not need to...&quot; she slows to a stop, closing her eyes. &quot;Just because I believe in justice does not mean I will find it in others.&quot;</string>
<string name="103296">&quot;But doesn&apos;t that make it your responsibility to strike down the unjust?&quot;</string>
<string name="103297">&quot;I thought it did. It only made it worse. I must find... another path.&quot; Aribeth&apos;s voice is cracked with emotion, and Valen merely watches her. Finally he nods, impressed, and pushes no further.</string>
<string name="103298">Aribeth regards Valen coolly. &quot;Do you always ask such personal questions of total strangers, half-breed?&quot;</string>
<string name="103299">He smirks in response. &quot;When the occasion calls for it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103300">She shrugs. &quot;No, of course I do not follow Tyr any longer. He betrayed me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103301">&quot;You are referring to what happened in Neverwinter.&quot; At her glare, he nods. &quot;Yes, I know about that. I am from the surface, after all, I am not a drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="103302">&quot;Then, yes. Of course I am referring to that. The people of Neverwinter deserved my hatred, and yet still my god abandoned me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103303">&quot;So you felt he should intervene because of your long service? Change what happened to your elven man?&quot;</string>
<string name="103304">Aribeth&apos;s glare grows icier. &quot;I would prefer the god of justice support my war against the unjust.&quot;</string>
<string name="103305">&quot;And is that why you painted your armor black?&quot;</string>
<string name="103306">&quot;You have the blood of a demon within you, half-breed. Tell me that the sweet call of its rage has not sent you beyond all reason, and then speak to me again in mocking tones.&quot;</string>
<string name="103307">Valen says nothing, and she looks at him pointedly. &quot;When its call sang in your blood, demon-man, did you enjoy it? Did it slake your lusts finally, or merely fan the flame of your desires?&quot;</string>
<string name="103308">&quot;Enough,&quot; Valen growls, avoiding her gaze.</string>
<string name="103309">&quot;I quite agree,&quot; she snarls, and turns away from him, ending the conversation.</string>
<string name="103310">&quot;Nathyrra... perhaps you could answer a question for me regarding the drow language. It&apos;s something that has... puzzled me for a time.&quot;</string>
<string name="103311">Nathyrra shrugs. &quot;Certainly, if you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="103312">&quot;Since we joined up with the rebel drow months ago, I have had some... difficulty speaking to the females.&quot; A blush slowly makes its way up his neck, though he plunges ahead. &quot;They are quite, errr, different from the followers of Eilistraee. In many ways.&quot;</string>
<string name="103313">&quot;So I&apos;ve seen.&quot; Nathyrra regards him with a mischievous smile. &quot;Have you never encountered an authoritative female before, Valen?&quot;</string>
<string name="103314">&quot;If you&apos;d ever encountered a marilith you wouldn&apos;t ask that. No, I&apos;m more curious about a particular phrase that several matrons have used when speaking to me. I thought I was completely fluent in drow, but it appears not.&quot;</string>
<string name="103315">&quot;Well, spit it out, then. What phrase do you speak of?&quot;</string>
<string name="103316">He clears his throat. &quot;I believe they were making a suggestion, but ahhh,&quot; suddenly Valen notices you standing nearby. Mortified, he leans close to Nathyrra and whispers something into her ear.</string>
<string name="103317">Nathyrra smirks and then bursts out into laughter. &quot;The first part I&apos;m sure you know,&quot; she finally says. Valen nods, looking away. &quot;The other part is, ahhhh,&quot; she points to his sinewy tail, &quot;in reference to *that*.&quot;</string>
<string name="103318">Valen stares at his tail and then looks back at Nathyrra, his brow knotted in confusion. Then suddenly his eyes bulge in surprise. &quot;Oh!&quot;</string>
<string name="103319">She laughs out loud once again. &quot;You *did* ask.&quot;</string>
<string name="103320">Valen clamps his jaw shut, rattled, and slowly turns away. &quot;Let&apos;s, ah,&quot; he notices your gaze and tries to look away. &quot;Let&apos;s just continue on, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="103321">&quot;Nathyrra, I wonder if I might ask you a... personal question.&quot;</string>
<string name="103322">Nathyrra regards Valen with a bemused grin. &quot;What&apos;s this? All these months I have been with the Seer and you have never once deigned to speak to me. Why now?&quot;</string>
<string name="103323">&quot;I am no longer in command of the drow forces, nor are we fleeing for our lives.&quot; He gestures about at the area. &quot;And we are, more or less, alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="103324">&quot;Well, so long as &lt;FirstName&gt; doesn&apos;t mind, go ahead and ask whatever you&apos;d like.&quot;</string>
<string name="103325">&quot;I... doubt &lt;he/she&gt; will. I&apos;d like to know, however... what was it about the Seer that convinced you to leave the drow and join her?&quot;</string>
<string name="103326">Nathyrra seems mildly taken aback. &quot;That&apos;s not an insignificant question. How about you tell me, first.&quot;</string>
<string name="103327">&quot;Why I went with her?&quot; He looks away into the distance, thinking back. &quot;I suppose... I knew I needed help. And I knew that she would help me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103328">&quot;And that she would do it for no other reason than because I needed it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103329">Valen&apos;s eyes lock with Nathyrra&apos;s for a long moment and then he looks away, embarrassed. &quot;I am sorry. My suspicions are foolish.&quot;</string>
<string name="103330">&quot;No, they&apos;re not. You&apos;ve been protective of the Seer ever since I arrived. And you should be. I want you to be. I&apos;m glad she has you at her side.&quot;</string>
<string name="103331">He nods slowly. &quot;Only I&apos;m not at her side now, am I?&quot; Both of them do not look pleased then, but they say nothing further.</string>
<string name="103332">&quot;I am curious about one thing, Deekin. You said your prior master was a dragon, yes? A white dragon?&quot;</string>
<string name="103333">Deekin nods, absently inspecting his nails. &quot;Yup. Tymofarrar be big and white.&quot;</string>
<string name="103334">&quot;Are you aware that the white dragon is the weakest of the many draconic species?&quot;</string>
<string name="103335">&quot;So? That not means much. Old Master be way tougher than little Deekin. He be tougher than you, even.&quot;</string>
<string name="103336">Valen chuckles, amused. &quot;I truly doubt that. Was this an old dragon, this Tymofarrar? A great wyrm of his kind?&quot;</string>
<string name="103337">&quot;Nope. Tymofarrar was young and scrappy. And kind of fat for dragon, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="103338">&quot;Then he would hardly be a match for me, little kobold. I have battled more than one dragon in my lifetime.&quot;</string>
<string name="103339">Deekin stops inspecting his nails and looks at Valen, grinning. &quot;There be big paladin in white that storms into Old Master&apos;s cave, Deekin remembers. He swears that he going to kills Old Master.&quot;</string>
<string name="103340">&quot;Old Master roll over, moaning that he ready to die. He say he be bad and evil dragon all his life and he just wants to confess sins. Paladin says okay and he comes to give confession.&quot;</string>
<string name="103341">Valen rolls his eyes. &quot;And that&apos;s when your dragon master ate him, I suppose?&quot;</string>
<string name="103342">&quot;Nope. Old Master gots lots to confess. He tells great stories all night... he and paladin stays up and drinks and laughs. They becomes great friends and paladin falls.&quot;</string>
<string name="103343">&quot;Last time Deekin hears about paladin, he be invading some country somewheres.&quot;</string>
<string name="103344">&quot;I am almost positive you are not telling the truth.&quot;</string>
<string name="103345">&quot;See? You be just like paladin. You not knows when to relax and laughs and when you should be all angsty and serious.&quot;</string>
<string name="103346">Valen, about to respond, suddenly thinks better of it and turns away.</string>
<string name="103347">&quot;Kobold, I have a question for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103348">Deekin turns and stares at Valen with wide, surprised eyes. &quot;You gots question for Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="103349">Valen grits his teeth. &quot;Yes, but it is one question and one question only. If you attempt to sidetrack me into some tangent with your inanity I shall be forced to behead you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103350">&quot;You takes Deekin&apos;s head off, Deekin not gets to answer your question.&quot;</string>
<string name="103351">&quot;Yes, well... that is a risk I shall have to take. My question is this: this song you constantly sing, where did you learn it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103352">&quot;You means the Doom Song?&quot;</string>
<string name="103353">&quot;Yes, that&apos;s the one. It keeps running through my head I swear it&apos;ll drive me mad. Where did you learn it? Is it a bardic trick meant to lure the enemy into a crazed frenzy?&quot;</string>
<string name="103354">Deekin shrugs. &quot;Deekin makes it up one day when he be in desert. Deekin and boss be doomed, he thinking.&quot;</string>
<string name="103355">Valen stares at Deekin for a long moment. The grinding of his teeth is audible. &quot;And that&apos;s it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103356">&quot;You gots more than one question?&quot;</string>
<string name="103357">&quot;No,&quot; Valen steps back. &quot;No, I don&apos;t. Forget I said anything at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="103358">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="103359">&quot;I think we need to part ways.&quot;</string>
<string name="103360">&quot;Never mind, then. Stay with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103361">&quot;Wait here until I return.&quot;</string>
<string name="103362">&quot;Go on. Maybe we&apos;ll meet later.&quot;</string>
<string name="103363">&quot;I want to change your tactics.&quot;</string>
<string name="103364">&quot;I don&apos;t want to change anything else right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="103365">&quot;I want you to leave any traps that you see alone for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="103366">&quot;I want you to disarm any traps that you see.&quot;</string>
<string name="103367">&quot;Don&apos;t try to be stealthy anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="103368">&quot;Stay stealthy, but only until the next fight.&quot;</string>
<string name="103369">&quot;Try to remain stealthy all the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="103370">&quot;Don&apos;t help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.&quot;</string>
<string name="103371">&quot;Help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.&quot;</string>
<string name="103372">&quot;I want to change the distance you stay away from me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103373">Stay a long distance away.</string>
<string name="103374">Keep a medium distance.</string>
<string name="103375">Stay close.</string>
<string name="103376">&quot;Go ahead and attack as soon as you see enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="103377">&quot;Defend me and don&apos;t attack until I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="103378">&quot;I want to adjust your equipment.&quot;</string>
<string name="103379">&quot;Can you identify my equipment?&quot;</string>
<string name="103380">&quot;What was it you wanted to say earlier?&quot;</string>
<string name="103381">&quot;Let&apos;s stop and talk for a moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="103382">&quot;That&apos;s all for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="103383">&quot;No, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="103384">&quot;How are you doing? Is anything wrong?&quot;</string>
<string name="103385">&quot;What do you plan to do after all this?&quot;</string>
<string name="103386">&quot;What else would you do?&quot;</string>
<string name="103387">&quot;No, I think you should travel on your own.&quot;</string>
<string name="103388">&quot;So long as you&apos;re okay with Nathyrra being with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103389">&quot;Certainly. I&apos;d be glad to have you join me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103390">&quot;Do whatever you like. I won&apos;t stop you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103391">&quot;You could always travel with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103392">&quot;Isn&apos;t your place at my side?&quot;</string>
<string name="103393">&quot;Not really. We don&apos;t need to spend every waking moment together.&quot;</string>
<string name="103394">&quot;You think you could get away from me that easy?&quot;</string>
<string name="103395">&quot;I&apos;d gladly have you at my side, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103396">&quot;I don&apos;t want you to give up everything for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103397">&quot;Whoa! Not so fast there!&quot;</string>
<string name="103398">&quot;You just let me worry about that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103399">&quot;I am an adventurer. I don&apos;t have time for any of that just yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="103400">&quot;Let&apos;s enjoy what we have now. We can worry about that later.&quot;</string>
<string name="103401">&quot;Marriage and children sound wonderful... eventually.&quot;</string>
<string name="103402">&quot;That depends. What do you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="103403">&quot;It&apos;s definitely too soon. We&apos;ve only just met, practically!&quot;</string>
<string name="103404">&quot;Not at all. Let&apos;s get started right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="103405">&quot;Tell me about your time on the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="103406">&quot;Such as?&quot;</string>
<string name="103407">&quot;You couldn&apos;t tell that they were evil?&quot;</string>
<string name="103408">&quot;I&apos;m sure that could happen to anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="103409">&quot;Uh-oh...&quot;</string>
<string name="103410">&quot;What did you do?&quot;</string>
<string name="103411">&quot;I&apos;m sure you did the right thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="103412">&quot;You can&apos;t hide away forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="103413">&quot;I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll get the hang of it eventually.&quot;</string>
<string name="103414">&quot;Most people aren&apos;t used to horned tieflings running around, anyhow.&quot;</string>
<string name="103415">&quot;Sounds like it isn&apos;t safe to let you loose.&quot;</string>
<string name="103416">&quot;Why not spare the paladin? It wasn&apos;t his fault.&quot;</string>
<string name="103417">&quot;What?! You killed them both?! How could you?!&quot;</string>
<string name="103418">&quot;How could you be so gullible?&quot;</string>
<string name="103419">&quot;Tell me how you escaped Grimash&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="103420">&quot;So what happened?&quot;</string>
<string name="103421">&quot;The tower was attacked? Wouldn&apos;t that put you more in danger?&quot;</string>
<string name="103422">&quot;So you escaped by pure luck?&quot;</string>
<string name="103423">&quot;So what came next?&quot;</string>
<string name="103424">&quot;Hmph. What&apos;s so useful about humanity?&quot;</string>
<string name="103425">&quot;I&apos;d prefer a smart man, myself. Or a strong man.&quot;</string>
<string name="103426">&quot;That seems like a stupid thing to say.&quot;</string>
<string name="103427">&quot;I think you are a good man, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103428">&quot;Are you afraid you&apos;ll die alone?&quot;</string>
<string name="103429">&quot;But isn&apos;t the demonic part of you useful?&quot;</string>
<string name="103430">&quot;Do you ever fear you will lose your humanity again?&quot;</string>
<string name="103431">&quot;How could you defeat a demon you yourself said was so powerful?&quot;</string>
<string name="103432">&quot;Did Grimash&apos;t come after you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103433">&quot;You enjoyed it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103434">&quot;And so you went straight to the Seer?&quot;</string>
<string name="103435">&quot;Just how old are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103436">&quot;How can you not know?&quot;</string>
<string name="103437">&quot;How did you get out of the Abyss, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="103438">&quot;What kind of favor?&quot;</string>
<string name="103439">&quot;Maybe you could... show me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103440">&quot;Tell me more about your time in the Abyss.&quot;</string>
<string name="103441">&quot;Well, if you&apos;re embarrassed, you needn&apos;t bother...&quot;</string>
<string name="103442">&quot;I&apos;m bored. It should pass the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="103443">&quot;I&apos;m curious. I find your past interesting.&quot;</string>
<string name="103444">&quot;That&apos;s all I wanted to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="103445">&quot;Have you ever... been in love?&quot;</string>
<string name="103446">&quot;Just answer the question and stop evading.&quot;</string>
<string name="103447">&quot;It&apos;s just a simple question. What&apos;s the harm?&quot;</string>
<string name="103448">&quot;You don&apos;t need to answer it if you don&apos;t want to.&quot;</string>
<string name="103449">&quot;That figures.&quot;</string>
<string name="103450">&quot;Who was she?&quot;</string>
<string name="103451">&quot;And there has been no-one else since?&quot;</string>
<string name="103452">&quot;That&apos;s all I wanted to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="103453">&quot;And that&apos;s it? You just forget about her?&quot;</string>
<string name="103454">&quot;You didn&apos;t even try to save her?&quot;</string>
<string name="103455">&quot;I&apos;m very sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="103456">&quot;How is it that you didn&apos;t die during all that?&quot;</string>
<string name="103457">&quot;Only a fool doesn&apos;t question what happens to him.&quot;</string>
<string name="103458">&quot;Well, I&apos;m thankful you&apos;re here too.&quot;</string>
<string name="103459">&quot;Neither would I, if I were you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103460">&quot;Perhaps the gods were watching over you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103461">&quot;Were there many others like you in the Abyss?&quot;</string>
<string name="103462">&quot;What did you do before you were taken captive?&quot;</string>
<string name="103463">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="103464">&quot;How did you get captured?&quot;</string>
<string name="103465">&quot;So you were a thief?&quot;</string>
<string name="103466">&quot;It could not have been easy.&quot;</string>
<string name="103467">&quot;I guess you did what you had to.&quot;</string>
<string name="103468">&quot;So you not only stole but you were proud of it? How typical.&quot;</string>
<string name="103469">&quot;How did your mother die?&quot;</string>
<string name="103470">&quot;You don&apos;t believe that?&quot;</string>
<string name="103471">&quot;Maybe it was better that way.&quot;</string>
<string name="103472">&quot;Did you ever get revenge on her?&quot;</string>
<string name="103473">&quot;That sounds terrible!&quot;</string>
<string name="103474">&quot;What did she do?&quot;</string>
<string name="103475">&quot;I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="103476">&quot;What is Sigil? I&apos;ve never heard of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103477">&quot;How do the drow feel about your leadership?&quot;</string>
<string name="103478">&quot;It seems surprising they would even agree to listen to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103479">&quot;Someone with a handsome set of horns?&quot;</string>
<string name="103480">&quot;I know what a tiefling is.&quot;</string>
<string name="103481">&quot;So tell me what a tiefling is, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="103482">&quot;Not at all, you&apos;re quite handsome.&quot;</string>
<string name="103483">&quot;No, I don&apos;t think so.&quot;</string>
<string name="103484">&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="103485">&quot;It does. I knew there was something off about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103486">&quot;No, that&apos;s not necessary.&quot;</string>
<string name="103487">&quot;I didn&apos;t realize you&apos;d had military engagements.&quot;</string>
<string name="103488">&quot;You probably saved them, then. I&apos;m impressed.&quot;</string>
<string name="103489">&quot;So you&apos;ve never actually won a battle, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="103490">&quot;What happened then?&quot;</string>
<string name="103491">&quot;I don&apos;t need to hear about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103492">&quot;It didn&apos;t go well?&quot;</string>
<string name="103493">&quot;Maybe that would be best.&quot;</string>
<string name="103494">&quot;Does your blood make you evil?&quot;</string>
<string name="103495">&quot;I don&apos;t like the sound of that at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="103496">&quot;Then I will have to keep a close eye on you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103497">&quot;Then I will judge you on your actions.&quot;</string>
<string name="103498">&quot;If you&apos;re struggling, then that&apos;s all I can ask.&quot;</string>
<string name="103499">&quot;Actually, I find it quite intriguing.&quot;</string>
<string name="103500">&quot;I judge a man by his actions, not his blood.&quot;</string>
<string name="103501">&quot;No. Should it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103502">&quot;Doesn&apos;t that make your job more difficult?&quot;</string>
<string name="103503">&quot;So why do you care what happens to them?&quot;</string>
<string name="103504">&quot;And you don&apos;t?&quot;</string>
<string name="103505">&quot;I want to know more about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103506">&quot;What do you want to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="103507">&quot;Then never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="103508">&quot;No, not yet. Stay here.&quot;</string>
<string name="103509">&quot;Yes, come along.&quot;</string>
<string name="103510">&quot;This isn&apos;t a good time, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103511">&quot;Certainly, Valen. What would you like?&quot;</string>
<string name="103512">&quot;Well, keep control of yourself!&quot;</string>
<string name="103513">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="103514">&quot;Well, if you get us killed, I&apos;m not raising you!&quot;</string>
<string name="103515">&quot;Just keep control of yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="103516">&quot;Yes, you&apos;d think they&apos;d have the same trouble as you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103517">&quot;Are you going to be able to hold out?&quot;</string>
<string name="103518">&quot;Maybe you&apos;re right. Maybe you should stay here.&quot;</string>
<string name="103519">&quot;No, forget it. I&apos;m not leaving you here.&quot;</string>
<string name="103520">&quot;You&apos;d be willing to do that? I&apos;m grateful, but there&apos;s no need.&quot;</string>
<string name="103521">&quot;Yes, perhaps that&apos;s for the best.&quot;</string>
<string name="103522">&quot;I need you with me. You&apos;re not staying behind.&quot;</string>
<string name="103523">&quot;I&apos;m not going to leave you in the Hells. Don&apos;t be absurd.&quot;</string>
<string name="103524">&quot;I&apos;m not leaving you behind, my love. Ever.&quot;</string>
<string name="103525">&quot;This isn&apos;t some sappy confession, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103526">&quot;Just spit it out already.&quot;</string>
<string name="103527">&quot;And why should I care what you think, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="103528">&quot;Are you joking? I only helped you because of the geas.&quot;</string>
<string name="103529">&quot;They can all die. And you with them, for that matter.&quot;</string>
<string name="103530">&quot;I do want to stop Mephistopheles, that&apos;s true.&quot;</string>
<string name="103531">&quot;I want to get out of the Hells. That&apos;s it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103532">&quot;I have a reward coming to me. That&apos;s all I care about.&quot;</string>
<string name="103533">&quot;Thank you. I would have helped even if it wasn&apos;t for the geas.&quot;</string>
<string name="103534">&quot;We&apos;ve still got Mephistopheles to deal with.&quot;</string>
<string name="103535">&quot;Don&apos;t be an idiot. You&apos;re here to assist me, that&apos;s all.&quot;</string>
<string name="103536">&quot;We&apos;re hardly friends, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103537">&quot;Friends? Certainly. I&apos;d like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103538">&quot;I&apos;d be willing to be more than just friends, if you would.&quot;</string>
<string name="103539">&quot;You think you can do better than me? Hah!&quot;</string>
<string name="103540">&quot;I see. Have it your way, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="103541">&quot;It&apos;s all right. I understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="103542">&quot;Take off that armor and we could get even closer.&quot;</string>
<string name="103543">&quot;I know. I was only joking, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103544">&quot;Oh, all right. Go ahead, spoilsport.&quot;</string>
<string name="103545">&quot;That&apos;s too bad. I feel nothing for you at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="103546">&quot;I... think of you only as a friend, Valen. I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="103547">&quot;Well...&quot;</string>
<string name="103548">&quot;Of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="103549">&quot;I feel close to you too, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103550">&quot;I... don&apos;t know how I feel, Valen. It&apos;s too soon...&quot;</string>
<string name="103551">&quot;And I love you, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103552">&quot;We still have much to do. Dealing with Mephistopheles, for starters.&quot;</string>
<string name="103553">&quot;What do you see happening between us, Valen?&quot;</string>
<string name="103554">&quot;Close in what way?&quot;</string>
<string name="103555">&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;</string>
<string name="103556">&quot;Is that such a terrible thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="103557">&quot;I&apos;ve never given it too much thought, really.&quot;</string>
<string name="103558">&quot;Not really. I&apos;ve never believed in much of anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="103559">&quot;Yes, I am. I am faithful to my deity, if you must know.&quot;</string>
<string name="103560">&quot;You have your opinion, I have my faith. Let us leave it at that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103561">&quot;No, I don&apos;t find it offensive at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="103562">&quot;That depends. Are you planning on leaving?&quot;</string>
<string name="103563">&quot;No? Why would you stay if you love the planes?&quot;</string>
<string name="103564">&quot;Then you should at least learn all you can about us.&quot;</string>
<string name="103565">&quot;Then you should adapt to our ways.&quot;</string>
<string name="103566">&quot;You can&apos;t change who you are, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103567">&quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any harm in learning our ways.&quot;</string>
<string name="103568">&quot;Yes, I&apos;d like that very much.&quot;</string>
<string name="103569">&quot;No, I don&apos;t need you with me any longer than necessary.&quot;</string>
<string name="103570">&quot;Do what you want. I won&apos;t stop you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103571">&quot;Why are you asking me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103572">&quot;Ask someone else.&quot;</string>
<string name="103573">&quot;A god is still more powerful than you could conceive of, no?&quot;</string>
<string name="103574">&quot;I think you don&apos;t know what you are talking about.&quot;</string>
<string name="103575">&quot;Of course. I am a servant to my deity. Did you not know that?&quot;</string>
<string name="103576">&quot;Let&apos;s hear it, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="103577">&quot;I don&apos;t want your stupid apology.&quot;</string>
<string name="103578">&quot;An apology? For what?&quot;</string>
<string name="103579">&quot;And? That&apos;s it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103580">&quot;Oh, never mind. I suppose it&apos;ll do.&quot;</string>
<string name="103581">&quot;I want you on your knees, fool.&quot;</string>
<string name="103582">&quot;Is *that* how you apologize to a woman?&quot;</string>
<string name="103583">&quot;Perhaps. For a kiss.&quot;</string>
<string name="103584">&quot;Yes, I am. You&apos;re off the hook... this time.&quot;</string>
<string name="103585">&quot;Maybe a little.&quot;</string>
<string name="103586">&quot;Of course not!&quot;</string>
<string name="103587">&quot;All right, fine. You&apos;re off the hook.&quot;</string>
<string name="103588">&quot;I think I deserve more of an apology then that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103589">&quot;Hah! Forget it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103590">&quot;Thank you. Yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="103591">&quot;Thank you, Valen. I appreciate your candor.&quot;</string>
<string name="103592">&quot;What do you know about him?&quot;</string>
<string name="103593">&quot;What makes you think I won&apos;t betray you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103594">&quot;Of course not. You still don&apos;t know me, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="103595">&quot;No. Forget it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103596">&quot;Yes, I suppose so.&quot;</string>
<string name="103597">&quot;Not really. I just don&apos;t like you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103598">&quot;If I could get rid of this geas, damn right I would.&quot;</string>
<string name="103599">&quot;You can stuff your apology. I don&apos;t need it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103600">&quot;Well, I don&apos;t want to talk about her.&quot;</string>
<string name="103601">&quot;Yes, I really wish to ignore you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103602">&quot;What could be so important? You still think I will betray her?&quot;</string>
<string name="103603">&quot;Fine, go on. I was only joking.&quot;</string>
<string name="103604">&quot;Good. I have a few questions about her, myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="103605">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Groan]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;What for? Why now?&quot;</string>
<string name="103606">&quot;Why? Do you still think I will betray her?&quot;</string>
<string name="103607">&quot;Is this a gender thing? Like how all men are pigs?&quot;</string>
<string name="103608">&quot;You&apos;d be correct. I have no idea what that is.&quot;</string>
<string name="103609">&quot;I know what the Blood Wars are.&quot;</string>
<string name="103610">&quot;How were you recruited?&quot;</string>
<string name="103611">&quot;How long did this go on?&quot;</string>
<string name="103612">&quot;I&apos;m so sorry. That sounds terrible.&quot;</string>
<string name="103613">&quot;Continue your tale.&quot;</string>
<string name="103614">&quot;She came to the Abyss?&quot;</string>
<string name="103615">&quot;What happened next?&quot;</string>
<string name="103616">&quot;Oh. I didn&apos;t realize you had *that* kind of relationship.&quot;</string>
<string name="103617">&quot;And this is what was so important to tell me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103618">&quot;Good for you. Thanks for the tip.&quot;</string>
<string name="103619">&quot;I understand, Valen. We all do what we must.&quot;</string>
<string name="103620">&quot;I am not going to betray anyone, Valen. You have to trust me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103621">&quot;Are we back to that again?&quot;</string>
<string name="103622">&quot;By turning you into her personal bodyguard?&quot;</string>
<string name="103623">&quot;Your master didn&apos;t try to get you back?&quot;</string>
<string name="103624">&quot;I see where this is going. Hurry up.&quot;</string>
<string name="103625">&quot;That can&apos;t have been easy, considering where you were.&quot;</string>
<string name="103626">&quot;But she hadn&apos;t even done anything to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103627">&quot;Why did you fight if you didn&apos;t like it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103628">&quot;Perhaps I could answer that by killing you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103629">&quot;That&apos;s a rude question, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103630">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="103631">&quot;According to your Seer, I&apos;m the one who can win.&quot;</string>
<string name="103632">&quot;What is your point, Valen?&quot;</string>
<string name="103633">&quot;If you feel the need to brood, do it elsewhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="103634">&quot;I&apos;ll get the job done no matter what you or she thinks.&quot;</string>
<string name="103635">&quot;You don&apos;t believe in her visions?&quot;</string>
<string name="103636">&quot;Meaning what?&quot;</string>
<string name="103637">&quot;I admire your dedication.&quot;</string>
<string name="103638">&quot;That&apos;s very presumptuous of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103639">&quot;And how would I do that while I&apos;m under this geas?&quot;</string>
<string name="103640">&quot;Absolutely. I&apos;ll break this geas if it&apos;s the last thing I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="103641">&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;</string>
<string name="103642">&quot;No. I said I would do this, and I will.&quot;</string>
<string name="103643">&quot;I&apos;d leave. This has nothing to do with me, as far as I&apos;m concerned.&quot;</string>
<string name="103644">&quot;Maybe not. I just don&apos;t like being forced into anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="103645">&quot;I don&apos;t care what happens to the drow. I&apos;m here to stop the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="103646">&quot;You think I would betray them?&quot;</string>
<string name="103647">&quot;If you don&apos;t trust me so much, then why are you here?&quot;</string>
<string name="103648">&quot;Yes, I have. Go on, get out of here.&quot;</string>
<string name="103649">&quot;I need a companion I can trust.&quot;</string>
<string name="103650">&quot;No. Have you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103651">&quot;What do you want from me? My word I won&apos;t betray you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103652">&quot;No.&quot;</string>
<string name="103653">&quot;Yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="103654">&quot;I can&apos;t do anything while I&apos;m under the geas, anyhow.&quot;</string>
<string name="103655">&quot;Maybe it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="103656">&quot;I didn&apos;t ask to be put in charge.&quot;</string>
<string name="103657">&quot;It&apos;s a duty I shall see through to the end, I promise you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103658">&quot;Stopping the Valsharess is the only thing that&apos;s important.&quot;</string>
<string name="103659">&quot;I&apos;m not here to help anyone. What if I refuse?&quot;</string>
<string name="103660">&quot;Doesn&apos;t it mean anything to you? Your Seer is the one who put me in charge.&quot;</string>
<string name="103661">&quot;I&apos;ll do the best I can. Like I said, I didn&apos;t ask for this.&quot;</string>
<string name="103662">&quot;Do you see any forces? What am I in charge of?&quot;</string>
<string name="103663">&quot;And if I refuse?&quot;</string>
<string name="103664">&quot;That&apos;s a little dramatic, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103665">&quot;Besides my charm and beauty?&quot;</string>
<string name="103666">&quot;You seem almost sad.&quot;</string>
<string name="103667">&quot;We don&apos;t have time to get into this, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103668">&quot;Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="103669">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Deekin]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Ixthyria the Scalesinger...&quot;</string>
<string name="103670">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="103671">&quot;Believe in yourself, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="103672">&quot;You&apos;re kind, you&apos;re talented, you&apos;re funny. You don&apos;t need me anymore. If I die, you&apos;ll be all right.&quot;</string>
<string name="103673">&quot;Not if I can help it. Come, we have an adventure to finish.&quot;</string>
<string name="103674">&quot;Surrender your soul to me, little one!&quot; </string>
<string name="103675">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="103676">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="103677">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Aribeth]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Va&apos;ardalia the Twinsouled...&quot;</string>
<string name="103678">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="103679">&quot;Feel no guilt regarding what transpired in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="103680">&quot;You are right. I will not ask that of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103681">&quot;Don&apos;t you see? This is your atonement... It&apos;s all right...&quot;</string>
<string name="103682">&quot;I just don&apos;t want to see you suffer so.&quot;</string>
<string name="103683">&quot;Yes, Aribeth. Dead and cold...&quot;</string>
<string name="103684">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="103685">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="103686">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="103687">&quot;I command you to pursue evil, not good.&quot;</string>
<string name="103688">&quot;I command you to love me...&quot;</string>
<string name="103689">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="103690">&quot;Feel no guilt regarding what transpired in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="103691">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="103692">&quot;If it means losing you, then no...&quot;</string>
<string name="103693">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="103694">&quot;I command you to pursue good, not evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="103695">&quot;I command you to love me!&quot;</string>
<string name="103696">&quot;That is all, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="103697">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Nathyrra]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Qeyifalia the Skyseeker...&quot;</string>
<string name="103698">&quot;Nothing right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="103699">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="103700">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="103701">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="103702">&quot;I bind you to me as my lover forever!&quot;</string>
<string name="103703">&quot;Your anger is nothing to me. I own you, body and soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="103704">&quot;You&apos;re so sexy when you&apos;re mad. Give me a kiss!&quot;</string>
<string name="103705">&quot;Forgive yourself for your past crimes.&quot;</string>
<string name="103706">&quot;I won&apos;t do anything to harm you, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="103707">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Valen]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Oeskathine the Demonwrestler...&quot;</string>
<string name="103708">&quot;Nothing right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="103709">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="103710">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="103711">&quot;We&apos;re done. For now.&quot;</string>
<string name="103712">&quot;Sorry, my love, but this is it for us.&quot;</string>
<string name="103713">&quot;Yes, I am.&quot;</string>
<string name="103714">&quot;I bind you to me as my lover forever!&quot;</string>
<string name="103715">&quot;Well... perhaps not.&quot;</string>
<string name="103716">&quot;You heard me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103717">&quot;You don&apos;t frighten me. I own you, body and soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="103718">&quot;You&apos;re so sexy when you&apos;re mad. Give me a kiss!&quot;</string>
<string name="103719">&quot;I hereby free you from your infernal taint.&quot;</string>
<string name="103720">&quot;You&apos;re welcome.&quot;</string>
<string name="103721">&quot;Glad you like it. Now give me your soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="103722">&quot;Good. Now, in repayment, you are to be become my lover forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="103723">&quot;So there&apos;s hope for us after all?&quot;</string>
<string name="103724">&quot;Does it really feel that different?&quot;</string>
<string name="103725">&quot;I&apos;m glad. You certainly earned it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103726">&quot;Right. You fear for your humanity. Losing hope. Got it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103727">&quot;I just want to get to Mephistopheles, that&apos;s all.&quot;</string>
<string name="103728">&quot;I&apos;m just a little tired of your whining.&quot;</string>
<string name="103729">&quot;I am your friend, Valen. But I can&apos;t help you with this.&quot;</string>
<string name="103730">&quot;I am your friend. I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="103731">&quot;Hasn&apos;t the Seer helped you overcome this?&quot;</string>
<string name="103732">&quot;Enough chatter. I want to find Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="103733">&quot;It will get better, in time.&quot;</string>
<string name="103734">&quot;I can help you with that, if you let me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103735">&quot;Doesn&apos;t our love give you any hope at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="103736">&quot;I don&apos;t know, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103737">&quot;Not if you keep whining like this.&quot;</string>
<string name="103738">&quot;Let&apos;s just take each day as it comes, Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="103739">&quot;There&apos;s always hope.&quot;</string>
<string name="103740">&quot;The Reaper has always referred to it as his realm, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="103741">&quot;He&apos;s an ally. That&apos;s all you need to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="103742">&quot;I don&apos;t know what he is. A demon, perhaps? He just is.&quot;</string>
<string name="103743">&quot;Enough questions. The Reaper is an ally. That&apos;s all you need to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="103744">&quot;No... not really. He said something about a nexus, but I didn&apos;t really get it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103745">&quot;This place is a nexus, or so the Reaper says. I&apos;m not sure I understand it all.&quot;</string>
<string name="103746">&quot;The Reaper says his realm is a nexus. It connects to many places, but not all.&quot;</string>
<string name="103747">&quot;Why don&apos;t you ask him yourself?&quot;</string>
<string name="103748">&quot;Are you done yapping? I&apos;d like to try and find a way out of here.&quot;</string>
<string name="103749">&quot;So you must know something about this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="103750">&quot;If you don&apos;t attack, maybe they won&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="103751">&quot;Seems a bit... cold to be the Hells, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103752">&quot;What was your first clue?&quot;</string>
<string name="103753">&quot;That&apos;s very helpful. What would I do if you weren&apos;t here to point out the blatantly obvious?&quot;</string>
<string name="103754">&quot;Then we&apos;d better check it out first.&quot;</string>
<string name="103755">&quot;If they try anything, I&apos;ll slaughter them all!&quot;</string>
<string name="103756">&quot;When I hack my way to the Elder Brain, it&apos;ll negotiate with me!&quot;</string>
<string name="103757">&quot;What could I use to protect my mind?&quot;</string>
<string name="103758">&quot;What about your mind?&quot;</string>
<string name="103759">&quot;Then we shouldn&apos;t have any problems.&quot;</string>
<string name="103760">&quot;If you were my thrall, would you have to cook and clean for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103761">&quot;And if I like my men dark and brooding?&quot;</string>
<string name="103762">&quot;Sounds like you&apos;d be fun to tame.&quot;</string>
<string name="103763">&quot;Enough of this. Let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="103764">&quot;I didn&apos;t mean it that way. Don&apos;t be so damned defensive!&quot;</string>
<string name="103765">&quot;You&apos;re very cute when you&apos;re angry.&quot;</string>
<string name="103766">&quot;My! You&apos;re not only moody, you&apos;re defensive too!&quot;</string>
<string name="103767">&quot;I&apos;ve noticed that about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103768">&quot;It wasn&apos;t a compliment. Believe me. Let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="103769">&quot;No. You&apos;re just sullen and suspicious, most of the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="103770">&quot;Yes, it was a compliment. I think you&apos;d be fun to tame.&quot;</string>
<string name="103771">&quot;This helmet will protect me from them.&quot;</string>
<string name="103772">&quot;I&apos;m not afraid of a few zombies!&quot;</string>
<string name="103773">&quot;You think the undead are inside the temple?&quot;</string>
<string name="103774">&quot;Must you prattle on about unimportant things?&quot;</string>
<string name="103775">&quot;Whatever we find, I&apos;ll destroy it!&quot;</string>
<string name="103776">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll be careful in there.&quot;</string>
<string name="103777">&quot;Do you think it&apos;s some kind of trap?&quot;</string>
<string name="103778">&quot;They&apos;re probably slaves, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="103779">&quot;We won&apos;t get to the bottom of this by standing here.&quot;</string>
<string name="103780">&quot;We&apos;ll have to investigate to find out.&quot;</string>
<string name="103781">&quot;Maybe they aren&apos;t what they appear.&quot;</string>
<string name="103782">&quot;So what? Who cares?&quot;</string>
<string name="103783">&quot;Good. Now we don&apos;t have to worry about an enemy&apos;s spell killing us.&quot;</string>
<string name="103784">&quot;A dead magic zone? How is that possible?&quot;</string>
<string name="103785">&quot;Maybe we&apos;ll learn more about them if we look around.&quot;</string>
<string name="103786">&quot;Maybe some long forgotten race left them here.&quot;</string>
<string name="103787">&quot;Come on. The sooner we find the Eye Tyrant, the sooner this is over.&quot;</string>
<string name="103788">&quot;What&apos;s the matter? Are you scared?&quot;</string>
<string name="103789">&quot;There might be slaves in here, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="103790">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll keep my eyes peeled.&quot;</string>
<string name="103791">&quot;Oh ho ho.&quot;</string>
<string name="103792">&quot;Are you getting frightened, tiefling?&quot;</string>
<string name="103793">&quot;I haven&apos;t run into anything I can&apos;t handle, yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="103794">&quot;Nobody said this was going to be easy.&quot;</string>
<string name="103795">&quot;I&apos;d like to go into the dungeon now. That is, unless you have some more useless advice you want to pass on.&quot;</string>
<string name="103796">&quot;I&apos;ll be careful.&quot;</string>
<string name="103797">&quot;You think I&apos;m special? I think you&apos;re special, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="103798">&quot;I&apos;ll be careful.&quot;</string>
<string name="103799">&quot;So how are we supposed to cross it?&quot;</string>
<string name="103800">&quot;You think this river will stop the army of the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="103801">&quot;No need. I am well aware of the Underdark&apos;s nature.&quot;</string>
<string name="103802">&quot;I think I have a good idea already, thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103803">&quot;I&apos;d be glad to hear what you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="103804">&quot;I would hope you&apos;d do the same for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="103805">&quot;Yes. Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="103806">&quot;Stay here for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="103807">&quot;It&apos;s not your fault. Don&apos;t worry about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="103808">&quot;Keep dying and I may decide otherwise.&quot;</string>
<string name="103809">&quot;I need your combat skills. Don&apos;t let it happen again.&quot;</string>
<string name="103810">&quot;I would never leave you behind, my love.&quot;</string>

<string name="103894">&quot;Yeah, right. I&apos;ll bet the prices in this place are twice what they should be! And people think I&apos;m the crook.&quot;</string>
<string name="103895">&quot;I doubt her motives are as pure as she makes them seem. I&apos;m guessing there&apos;s good profit to be had here.&quot;</string>
<string name="103896">&quot;That&apos;s very brave of you, dear. You should be commended for making your stock available.&quot; </string>
<string name="103897">&quot;Deekin notices that too, Boss. Why you talk like that? Deekin thinks it sounds funny.&quot;</string>
<string name="103898">&quot;A warrior&apos;s greatest enemy is time; it has already beaten this man. There is no need to throw his frailty in his face.&quot;</string>
<string name="103899">&quot;Oy! The old geezer&apos;s already depressed. You don&apos;t need to make him feel worse.&quot;</string>
<string name="103900">The bard shakes her head in disgust and says,  &quot;That was uncalled for.&quot;</string>
<string name="103901">Linu gives you a long, hard stare. &quot;Was that really necessary? Making an old man cry?&quot;</string>
<string name="103902">&quot;Wow, Boss. Sometimes you is really mean.&quot;</string>
<string name="103903">Sharwyn leans in close and whispers under her breath, &quot;You&apos;ve done a good thing here. Everyone wants to feel useful.&quot;</string>
<string name="103904">Linu leans in close to you and whispers, &quot;That was nice of you, dear. Everyone needs to feel useful.&quot;</string>
<string name="103905">Daelen smiles at the old man. &quot;Though age has taken your strength, it has given you wisdom. I am glad to see you using this new weapon.&quot;</string>
<string name="103906">&quot;Well how about that. I guess you old geezers ain&apos;t so useless after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="103907">&quot;Anything else you want to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="103908">&quot;Deekin thinks he be telling the truth, Boss. Deekin heard of Bloodtooth. He a big, scary goblin chief... until he disappear. Everyone say Bloodtooth be dead. Him and all his tribe.&quot;</string>
<string name="103909">Deekin gives the goblin a suspicious look. &quot;Deekin thinks you want Boss to hire you. Well, forget it! Boss not need your help... he gots Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="103910">&quot;No, no, no. Grovel doesn&apos;t want to be hired, not if it means going deeper into Undermountain. Grovel just wants to talk.&quot;</string>
<string name="103911">Deekin shakes his head sadly. &quot;Oh, Boss. Why you lets them torture him?&quot;</string>
<string name="103912">&quot;Oy, I think that&apos;s a bit harsh, mate. They&apos;ll torture him &apos;till he squeals like a pig!&quot;</string>
<string name="103913">&quot;He shouldn&apos;t cause too much trouble, Durnan. Who knows, he might even be useful.&quot;</string>
<string name="103914">&quot;He certainly seems eager. Maybe he really could be useful, Durnan.&quot;</string>
<string name="103915">&quot;Don&apos;t judge him because of his goblin blood, Durnan. Give him a chance to prove himself.&quot;</string>
<string name="103916">Tomi is grinning from ear to ear. &quot;Glad I saw that. I was just about to try that out for meself. &apos;Course, now I know better.&quot;</string>
<string name="103917">Daelen shakes his head, smiling. &quot;And that&apos;s why I don&apos;t trust magic!&quot;</string>
<string name="103918">&quot;A good lesson to keep in mind for the future, &lt;FirstName&gt;: when a wizard says don&apos;t touch, don&apos;t touch!&quot;</string>
<string name="103919">Linu laughs. &quot;That&apos;ll teach you to play with other people&apos;s toys, dear.&quot;</string>
<string name="103920">&quot;Look out, Boss! Oh... never mind. Deekin warns you too late.&quot;</string>
<string name="103921">&quot;But maybe a drow lady who pretends to be another drow lady tricks people who think she&apos;s not the first drow lady, even though she is!&quot;</string>
<string name="103922">&quot;But then if people think second drow lady might be first drow lady, first drow lady can&apos;t pretend to be second drow lady... unless everyone expecting drow lady two to really be drow lady one!&quot;</string>
<string name="103923">&quot;If people expecting it, then maybe drow lady two can be... uh... maybe drow lady one is... hmmm, that not makes sense. Oh, Boss: Deekin&apos;s brain hurts.&quot;</string>
<string name="103924">&quot;Unless you figured it was such an obvious disguise that we&apos;d overlook you! Then a drow disguise makes perfect sense: the old double switch! Of course, you had to figure we&apos;d be ready for that.&quot;</string>
<string name="103925">&quot;And if you think we&apos;re expecting the double switch, then you can&apos;t do it. Unless you *know* we&apos;re expecting the double switch, then pull another switch to throw us off the track - the triple switch!&quot;</string>
<string name="103926">&quot;But a triple switch means the Valsharess wouldn&apos;t disguise herself as a drow... or does it mean she would? Oy, my head hurts.&quot;</string>
<string name="103927">The drow simply shakes her head in the face of such convoluted logic, obviously deciding it&apos;s an argument she&apos;d rather not become part of. Instead, she focuses on you.</string>
<string name="103928">&quot;She makes a good point.&quot;</string>
<string name="103929">&quot;She does have a point, dear.&quot;</string>
<string name="103930">&quot;Sometimes the most obvious disguise is the most effective. You could be hiding in plain sight. Although, that wouldn&apos;t make much sense given what you&apos;ve already done for us...&quot;</string>
<string name="103931">&quot;That&apos;s not really what I&apos;d call a fair fight, dear. Of course, nobody said the drow fight fair, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="103932">&quot;There&apos;s something to be said for using cunning instead of brute force.&quot;</string>
<string name="103933">&quot;Deekin likes this plan, Boss. Give them nasty drows a big surprise!&quot;</string>
<string name="103934">&quot;The drow can be formidable opponents. We should take any advantage we can get.&quot;</string>
<string name="103935">&quot;Hey, that&apos;s the kind of strategy I like! Death from above, and we don&apos;t even get our hands dirty!&quot;</string>
<string name="103936">&quot;I think we should listen to what she has to say before we judge her.&quot;</string>
<string name="103937">&quot;Be careful with this one. She may be a rebel, but she&apos;s still a drow!&quot;</string>
<string name="103938">&quot;I expected no less from you, elf. Our surface dwelling cousins are always prejudiced against my kind. But my offer is sincere.&quot;</string>
<string name="103939">&quot;Rebel drow? I have heard tales of such a group, though I never thought to meet one... if indeed we have.&quot;</string>
<string name="103940">&quot;I don&apos;t know, Boss. Deekin not know much about drow, but they be bad news.&quot;</string>
<string name="103941">&quot;Different? Yeah, right. Instead of stabbing us in the gut, you pretend to be a friend then stick the knife in the back!&quot;</string>
<string name="103942">Deekin whips out a quill and a sheet of parchment. &quot;This maybe make a good story, right Boss? Deekin wants to write this down. What that monster be named again?&quot;</string>
<string name="103943">&quot;I ain&apos;t never heard of no creature like that before. What did ya say that thing was called?&quot;</string>
<string name="103944">&quot;A cockatrice. Surely you&apos;ve heard of them before? Magical beasts. Rather small, but quite deadly. They can turn a man to stone.&quot;</string>
<string name="103945">&quot;A what-a-trice?&quot;</string>
<string name="103946">&quot;A what-a-trice?&quot;</string>
<string name="103947">&quot;A cockatrice. You know, like... oh, forget it. It isn&apos;t worth it.&quot; Sobrey shakes his head in exasperation.</string>
<string name="103948">Linu shakes her head sadly. &quot;They threw their lives away protecting a creature of pure evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="103949">&quot;They died protecting a beast that would have likely killed them given half a chance?&quot;</string>
<string name="103950">&quot;They threw their lives away for a monster?&quot;</string>
<string name="103951">&quot;Looks like ye got yerself plenty of help already. You get too many in a group and you gotta split the treasure so fine that it&apos;s hardly worth me stealin&apos; from you later on. Ha! Just kidding.&quot;</string>
<string name="103952">&quot;If you really want Tomi to join you, come on back when you don&apos;t have quite so many people followin&apos; you around.&quot;</string>
<string name="103953">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="103954">&quot;Will you join up with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="103955">&quot;Ooh, Boss! Durnan&apos;s going to want to knows about this, don&apos;t you think? If Halaster&apos;s missing, that&apos;s big news! Deekin wonders where he&apos;s gone?&quot;</string>
<string name="103956">&quot;We should tell Durnan of this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. He&apos;ll want to know that Halaster has abandoned Undermountain. Of course, we should also try to find out where he went.&quot;</string>
<string name="103957">&quot;Durnan will want to hear about this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Of course, we should also try to find out where the wizard went. &quot;</string>
<string name="103958">&quot;Deekin knows how you feels. People is mean to me just because I is a kobold. But if they let Deekin sings for them, then maybe they not hates me so much.&quot;</string>
<string name="103959">&quot;Yeah, Boss, maybe you is right. Deekin is like a fine wine... I gets better the more I sits in your cellar.&quot;</string>
<string name="103960">&quot;Hmmm... maybe Boss is right. Some people gots no appreciation for music.&quot;</string>
<string name="103961">&quot;Yeah, it&apos;s tough for me too. People take one look and assume I&apos;m a thief.&quot;</string>
<string name="103962">&quot;Yeah, but they don&apos;t know that! It&apos;d be nice if people would give me the benefit of the doubt. It&apos;d make stealing from them so much easier. Oh well, what are you going to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="103963">&quot;I have the same problem. People see my remarkable beauty, and they think I don&apos;t have the brains to go with the body. But, like you, I find I can use that to my advantage.&quot;</string>
<string name="103964">The half-orc sighs. &quot;A story I am very familiar with. All too familiar, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="103965">&quot;People just need time to get used to you Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="103966">&quot;Or they might hate you more.&quot;</string>
<string name="103967">You are a thief.</string>
<string name="103968">&quot;Halaster should have known this might happen one day. Even for an archmage, Undermountain must be a difficult place to maintain control.&quot;</string>
<string name="103969">&quot;Fighting and killing is what monsters do best. Halaster really shouldn&apos;t have expected them to do otherwise.&quot;</string>
<string name="103970">&quot;Not to mention the drow attacking the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="103971">&quot;Yeah, you gotta hate it when your dungeon of death gets all messy.&quot;</string>
<string name="103972">&quot;Deekin knows how you feel. Sometimes Boss explains stuff, but sometimes Deekin feels out of the loop.&quot;</string>
<string name="103973">&quot;Don&apos;t you worries. Boss can come up with a plan to save mad wizard. Boss is good at making plans, right Boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="103974">&quot;Halaster probably thought that would make you more obedient. I&apos;ve found the same holds true with men: the dumber they are, the easier it is to get them to do what I want.&quot;</string>
<string name="103975">&quot;We all have different talents. Obviously your strength is, uh... your strength.&quot;</string>
<string name="103976">&quot;You poor dear. It&apos;s a shame Halaster didn&apos;t give you more in the way of mental capabilities.&quot;</string>
<string name="103977">&quot;Aye, we can see that, mate. Maybe Halaster ran out of good brains when he was stitching you together, and he had to use a moldy-oldy.&quot;</string>
<string name="103978">&quot;Yeah, people treats you nice when you got big friends. That&apos;s why Deekin never has to worry when Boss is around.&quot;</string>
<string name="103979">&quot;I&apos;ll bet they did. No sense gettin&apos; on the wizard&apos;s bad side by picking on his errand boy... er, I mean, errand-golem.&quot;</string>
<string name="103980">&quot;But you&apos;re a golem. How can you have a father?&quot;</string>
<string name="103981">&quot;You&apos;re a golem, a construct. How can you have a father?&quot;</string>
<string name="103982">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, dear, but you don&apos;t really have a father. You&apos;re a golem.&quot;</string>
<string name="103983">&quot;Typical Linu. Always looking out for those who need help.&quot;</string>
<string name="103984">&quot;I would expect nothing less from you, Linu. You&apos;re always looking out for those in need.&quot;</string>
<string name="103985">&quot;Hey, Boss... it be that elf lady cleric from the inn. Hello, elf lady cleric. You remembers Deekin, right? No? Well, you gots to remember Boss, right? &lt;FullName&gt;? From the inn?&quot;</string>
<string name="103986">&quot;Linu, I&apos;m glad you&apos;re alive... as am I, thanks to &lt;FullName&gt;. You recognize &lt;him/her&gt; from the inn, don&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103987">&quot;Linu, I&apos;m glad you&apos;re alive... as am I, thanks to &lt;FullName&gt;. You recognize &lt;him/her&gt; from the inn, don&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="103988">&quot;Nothin&apos; personal. I just get a bad feeling around you.&quot;</string>
<string name="103989">Sharwyn shakes her head sadly. &quot;I could understand a wizard having supernatural servants, but why would Halaster even need human slaves?&quot;</string>
<string name="103990">&quot;What need could one as powerful as Halaster have for common human slaves? This is nothing but an abuse of his power; he keeps slaves simply because he can.&quot;</string>
<string name="103991">&quot;You is slaves? That very sad. Deekin not believes in slavery. Unless masters want slaves to sing and dance and tell stories. That&apos;s what Old Master do with Deekin. That be okay, I guess.&quot;</string>
<string name="103992">&quot;Sadly, our duties are far removed from singing and dancing. Halaster prefers other, more deadly, diversions. He enjoys watching adventurers die; that&apos;s why he created Undermountain.&quot; </string>
<string name="103993">The half-orc is noticeably relieved. &quot;A wise decision. Those drow won&apos;t know what hit them. I actually want to fight them, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="103994">&quot;The choice is yours, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Actually, I&apos;m looking forward to this fight. I kind of enjoy taking out the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="103995">&quot;I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve made the right choice, dear. We can handle a few drow; in fact, I&apos;m looking forward to defeating them.&quot;</string>
<string name="103996">&quot;That&apos;s what Tomi likes to hear. If it&apos;s a choice between crawling through squishy bug tunnels or fighting them dark skinned elves, then I want to fight the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="103997">&quot;You wants to fight instead of sneaking, Boss? Okay, if Boss wants to fight, then so does Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="103998">The half-orc shakes his head, his face noticeably pale. &quot;I think this is a bad idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="103999">&quot;So I guess my opinion doesn&apos;t count for nothing, then? Well, at least I know where I stand.&quot;</string>
<string name="104000">&quot;Well, you are our leader, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I just hope you&apos;ve made the right choice.&quot;</string>
<string name="104001">&quot;If you&apos;re certain, dear, then I guess we&apos;ll try it your way.&quot;</string>
<string name="104002">&quot;Good choice, Boss. Bug people look scary, but Deekin bets they is nicer than the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="104003">&quot;What if the tunnel collaspes? What if we get lost down there? What if there&apos;s no air?&quot;</string>
<string name="104004">&quot;I don&apos;t know about this, dear. I&apos;m sure this... creature... means well, but I think we might not be suited to traveling through their tunnels.&quot;</string>
<string name="104005">&quot;Well, I for one don&apos;t like the idea of crawling through an oversized bug tunnel! Too many nasty things down there we might run into.&quot;</string>
<string name="104006">&quot;I&apos;m all for avoiding a fight with the drow, although I can&apos;t say I relish the idea of squeezing through some giant ant tunnel.&quot;</string>
<string name="104007">&quot;Deekin likes this idea , Boss. Drow is nasty. Sneaking past is much better than fighting them.&quot;</string>
<string name="104008">&quot;Durnan will want to hear about this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Of course, we should also try to find out where the wizard went. &quot;</string>
<string name="104009">&quot;We should tell Durnan of this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. He&apos;ll want to know that Halaster has abandoned Undermountain. Of course, we should also try to find out where he went.&quot;</string>
<string name="104010">&quot;Ooh, Boss! Durnan&apos;s going to want to knows about this, don&apos;t you think? If Halaster&apos;s missing, that&apos;s big news! Deekin wonders where he&apos;s gone?&quot;</string>

<string name="104025">You&apos;ve been approached by Nathyrra, a drow who claims to be an agent for a mysterious group of rebels opposing the dark elves attacking Waterdeep. According to Nathyrra, the armies invading Waterdeep are being controlled by a powerful drow House Mother known only as the Valsharess. She also claims the Valsharess has captured Halaster and is holding him prisoner.

If Nathyrra is telling the truth, you may have a new ally in your quest to save Waterdeep. But if she&apos;s lying, trusting her could be deadly...</string>
<string name="104026">Daelan has reluctantly agreed to forgive you for your previous attacks on his honor. The fact that you saved his life likely played a significant part in his decision.</string>
<string name="104027">The artifact has been yours since you found it -- or perhaps, it found you -- in the Plane of Shadows.

The Relic of the Reaper will teleport you to a tiny nexus dimension ruled over by an enigmatic being you know only as the &apos;Reaper&apos;. The Relic allows you to use it to bind a location to one of the doors in the Reaper&apos;s realm, allowing you instant transportation there. The Reaper will also snatch you to his realm on the instant of your death. Both of these uses, the binding and the saving, cost the use of a Rogue Stone. More information can be gained from the Reaper, himself... though your strange servant has never exactly been forthcoming on the relic&apos;s true nature or even his own.</string>
<string name="104028">You have raised Sharwyn back to life, and she has decided to return to the Yawning Portal, rather than remain in the dungeons of Undermountain alone.</string>
<string name="104029">Even though you saved her from the grave, Sharwyn doesn&apos;t seem too fond of you. She&apos;s likely returned to the Yawning Portal, though it&apos;s doubtful she&apos;ll have anything nice to say to you there.</string>

<string name="104125">Water whistles through this hole. By the loud echo you are hearing, it is emptying into a large cavern. You might be able to hold your breath long enough to pass through.</string>
<string name="104126">&lt;StartAction&gt;Do nothing.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104127">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leap into the hole.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104128">There appears to be a bridge woven of shadow-strand here. It is not safe to walk upon it.</string>
<string name="104129">The ground rumbles here and foul vapors emanate from the sinkholes. You should be careful of where you step...</string>
<string name="104130">This is a control panel of some sort. A very elaborate engraving of a chasm-spanning bridge is etched into its surface. Dried blood and other fleshy bits covers the panel. There are eight small buttons and one larger button on the panel. There is also a small slot, just big enough for a small spherical object.</string>
<string name="104131">The text explains how this machine was installed by Illithids to provide a measure of protection for a colony of Beholders living across the chasm. By properly manipulating the machine, the user can make the shadow bridge that spans the chasm materialize. The Beholders only give instructions on how to use this machine to slave merchants and others of use to them.</string>
<string name="104132">None of the squiggles and symbols make any sense to you.</string>
<string name="104133">You carefully place Tynan into the machine. Two new buttons slide out of the panel. One shows the image of a spider and the other shows a shrunken humanoid.</string>
<string name="104134">Tynan giggles and disappears. A small spinning top appears in your hand.</string>
<string name="104135">&lt;CUSTOM5487&gt;
&lt;CUSTOM5488&gt;
&lt;CUSTOM5489&gt;
&lt;CUSTOM5490&gt;
&lt;CUSTOM5491&gt;
&lt;CUSTOM5492&gt;

 You stare blankly at the panel. You have no idea how anyone could understand what this means. You pop the pearl back out in frustration.</string>
<string name="104136">You hear a voice whisper in your mind. &quot;Which tongue?&quot;</string>
<string name="104137">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; You cannot figure out what the button names mean.</string>
<string name="104138">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; You realize that the buttons on the panel are labeled in a dialect of Beholder that you are familiar with.</string>
<string name="104139">&lt;CUSTOM5487&gt;
&lt;CUSTOM5488&gt;
&lt;CUSTOM5489&gt;
&lt;CUSTOM5490&gt;
&lt;CUSTOM5491&gt;
&lt;CUSTOM5492&gt;

There is also a large, glowing button near the bottom of the panel.

<string name="104140">The panel changes.</string>
<string name="104141">The bridge has appeared. There is little more to do with this device.</string>

<string name="104213">What&apos;s going on here? What happened?</string>
<string name="104214">&quot;When the illithid captured me, I never thought I&apos;d see the sun again. But once this is all over, the Seer&apos;s scouts will take me back up to the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="104215">&quot;My only regret is that I have nothing to give you as a reward for saving me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. All I can offer is my eternal gratitude.&quot;</string>
<string name="104216">You recognize this woman as the thrall you helped escape from the illithid city of Zorvak&apos;Mur. Obviously, she managed to deliver your message to the Seer. She smiles at your approach.</string>
<string name="104217">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;... I&apos;m glad you are here. It gives me a chance to thank you. If you hadn&apos;t sent me to deliver your message, I would still be a thrall to the illithid.&quot;</string>
<string name="104218">&quot;Once the Valsharess is defeated, the Seer has promised to send scouts to lead me back to the surface. This wouldn&apos;t have been possible without you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104219">You should speak with the Seer.</string>
<string name="104220">&quot;Look at these pathetic Eilistraee scum. I have no idea why Matron Myrune has thrown our lot in with them.&quot;</string>
<string name="104221">&quot;Just ignore them. Eilistraee teaches us tolerance and acceptance even in the face of hate.&quot;</string>
<string name="104222">&quot;Listen to those cowards - there&apos;s no way an army full of their type will ever stop the Valsharess! I say we teach these worms a lesson!&quot;</string>
<string name="104223">One of the followers of Eilistraee notices you standing nearby. &quot;We have faith in the Seer&apos;s vision. The Valsharess will fall. &lt;FullName&gt; here will guide us to victory.&quot;</string>
<string name="104224">&quot;Is that so? Well, surfacer... any advice on how we can win a war when you&apos;re stuck with a bunch of pacifists like the followers of Eilistraee on your side?&quot;</string>
<string name="104225">&quot;Hmph! Another pacifist... just what House Maeviir needed.&quot;</string>
<string name="104226">&quot;Oh-oh, Boss. Looks like somebody is spoiling for a fight.&quot;</string>
<string name="104227">The tiefling casually rests his hand on the hilt of his weapon. &quot;Are you sure you want to do this? I know a few lessons myself... and I&apos;d be happy to teach them to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104228">Nathyrra steps forward, her eyes flashing dangerously. &quot;Tread carefully, jaluk! The followers of Eilistraee avoid violence when we can, but we can also fight when pressed.&quot;</string>
<string name="104229">The drow takes an involuntary step back, then quickly composes himself again. &quot;Come on, let&apos;s go. I&apos;ve had enough of the Seer&apos;s followers for one day.&quot;</string>
<string name="104230">&quot;The followers of Eilistraee know how to fight, and they&apos;ll prove it right now!&quot;</string>
<string name="104231">&quot;Yeah. Get rid of these pacifists before they fail us in battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="104232">&quot;This stupid in-fighting only makes our defeat more likely.&quot;</string>
<string name="104233">&quot;You don&apos;t have many allies... you better learn to treat them better.&quot;</string>
<string name="104234">&quot;Maybe you&apos;re not so bad, surfacer. At least you know cowards when you see them.&quot;</string>
<string name="104235">&quot;I still don&apos;t like the idea of having the Seer&apos;s pacifists on our side, but maybe with you here we stand half a chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="104236">&quot;You&apos;re as bad as the rest of the Seer&apos;s pets. How can  you lead an army to victory with such pacifists in tow? Only those able to show strength will survive the coming days.&quot;</string>
<string name="104237">&quot;I just hope that when the battles start, you show more courage than you did here.&quot;</string>
<string name="104238">&quot;I don&apos;t know why you provoked that fight with House Maeviir, but we can&apos;t afford to be killing off our own allies! The Valsharess already has an army twice the size of ours.&quot;</string>
<string name="104239">&quot;The Seer believes you are the only one who can save us from the Valsharess, but your actions make me wonder if she was wrong about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104240">&quot;Thank you for helping us. House Maeviir insists on provoking fights with us, despite our best efforts to avoid them. Had you not stepped in, I&apos;m afraid the situation would have become violent.&quot;</string>
<string name="104241">&quot;I&apos;m glad to see you understand the need to remain united against the Valsharess. It&apos;s good to know the Seer has put her faith in one so wise.&quot;</string>
<string name="104242">It appears these drow are having some kind of drinking contest with this svirfneblin servant. The svirf looks like he isn&apos;t enjoying it. &quot;Pleash... no more. No more.&quot;</string>
<string name="104243">&quot;Come on, Svirf. Drink up. I want that record!&quot;</string>
<string name="104244">&quot;Woo - look at him go!&quot;</string>
<string name="104245">The svirfneblin looks up at you with tormented eyes. &quot;Pleash, no more. I can&apos;t take anymore. Pleash.&quot;</string>
<string name="104246">&quot;Let&apos;s go, svirf. Down the hatch... unless you want to become a target dummy for the archers&quot;</string>
<string name="104247">oh...*hic*... no</string>
<string name="104248">&quot;Your svirf&apos;s not looking too good. I don&apos;t think he&apos;s going to make it.&quot; </string>
<string name="104249">&quot;Huh... he&apos;s dead. Still three drinks shy. I told you he&apos;d never break the record.&quot;</string>
<string name="104250">&quot;Well, you were right. Guess I owe you a gold piece.&quot;</string>
<string name="104251">The tiefling shakes his head in disgust. &quot;The Seer might change her mind about you being our great savior if she saw how you behaved here.&quot;</string>
<string name="104252">&quot;That was horrible, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I can&apos;t believe you let them force that svirfneblin to drink himself to death!&quot;</string>
<string name="104253">&quot;The Seer believes you can save us, but when you act like this I can&apos;t help but wonder if she&apos;s wrong.&quot;</string>
<string name="104254">The drow turns to face you, obviously annoyed at the interruption. &quot;Can&apos;t you see we&apos;re busy here? My svirf only needs four more ales to break the camp record for most drinks in one day.&quot;</string>
<string name="104255">&quot;He&apos;ll never make it. The svirf that set the record was twice this runt&apos;s size, and he died the next day from alcohol poisoning!&quot;</string>
<string name="104256">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; The drow hesitates before replying, obviously aware he is no match for you. &quot;Fine. I was getting bored anyway. Come on, let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="104257">&quot;Thank you, kind &lt;master/mistress&gt;. *hic* One more drink would have been the death of me. Exshcuse me now while I passh out.&quot;</string>
<string name="104258">&quot;Way to go, Boss. But Deekin not want to be around when he wakes up. He&apos;s going to have one big headache.&quot;</string>
<string name="104259">&quot;That was a good thing you did, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m glad to see the Seer&apos;s faith in you isn&apos;t misplaced.&quot;</string>
<string name="104260">&quot;Well &lt;FirstName&gt;, at least you&apos;ve got the courage to stand up to common bullies. That&apos;s something.&quot;</string>
<string name="104261">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Ah, maybe this &lt;race&gt; surfacer has a point. Besides, I&apos;m bored. Let&apos;s go find something else to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="104262">&quot;Deekin not think that gnome likes drinking no more. You gonna help him, Boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="104263">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ignore him.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104264">&quot;Hey, what&apos;s going on here?&quot;</string>
<string name="104265">&quot;Come on, svirf... drink up. I want to see a new record!&quot;</string>
<string name="104266">&lt;StartAction&gt;Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I won&apos;t let this svirf drink himself to death!&quot;</string>
<string name="104267">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;That&apos;s enough. No sense wasting good ale on a servant.&quot;</string>
<string name="104268">&quot;Leave that svirfneblin alone!&quot;</string>
<string name="104269">Please speak with master Rizolvir if you have any questions.</string>
<string name="104270">The commander gives you another salute and turns back to his troops.</string>
<string name="104271">&quot;My expertise is limited. I know something about the enemies who&apos;ve allied themselves with the Valsharess: beholders, illithid, the undead. Beyond that I doubt I could tell you much.&quot;</string>
<string name="104272">&quot;There&apos;s not much to tell, really. As you can see, I am one of the drow. Like most here, I spent my early years as part of drow society: a savage world of cruel and senseless violence.&quot;</string>
<string name="104273">&quot;I distinguished myself in battle, and the Matron Mother of my House elevated me to a position of prominence in her army. But despite my success, I knew something was wrong with my life.&quot;</string>
<string name="104274">&quot;We drow are a corrupt people, our own evil consumes us, it devours us. I knew I had to escape. I fled drow society, searching for the worshipers of Eilistraee, hoping to find a better way.&quot;</string>
<string name="104275">&quot;In time, my search brought me here to the Seer and her followers. Now, I use my experience to train others so they can help in the fight against the Valsharess and her army.&quot;</string>
<string name="104276">&quot;The Valsharess commands a massive army, and it&apos;s not just the drow who follow her. She&apos;s recruited all sorts of Underdark creatures to her cause: beholders, illithid and even the undead.&quot;</string>
<string name="104277">&quot;We have reports of undead moving from the caverns in the west to join the Valsharess and her forces. We suspect some type of cult is behind it, though we don&apos;t have any details.&quot;</string>
<string name="104278">&quot;A few times we got reports of undead on the move, and we tried a quick sneak attack, hoping to thin their numbers. But we didn&apos;t stand a chance, especially against the vampires.&quot;</string>
<string name="104279">&quot;The undead are immune to most normal attacks, and even magic has a limited effect. And even if we manage to take down one of the vampire leaders, we know they&apos;ll be back.&quot;</string>
<string name="104280">&quot;A dead vampire just turns into a cloud of mist and flies away. The only way to kill them for good is to catch one in its coffin and drive a stake through its black heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="104281">&quot;Problem is, we don&apos;t know where those coffins are. And even if we did, I doubt we&apos;d be able to get to them. That&apos;s more the kind of job for heroes like you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="104282">&quot;Actually, there&apos;s been a sudden halt in the undead being sent to join the Valsharess and her forces. I suspect you know more about this than I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="104283">&quot;You probably know them better as mind flayers... you know, those creatures with the tentacles. The Valsharess must have convinced the Elder Brains to side with her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104284">&quot;The illithid live in scattered colonies, each one ruled by a giant Elder Brain. But the communities aren&apos;t isolated; the brains all communicate with each other and they all work together.&quot; </string>
<string name="104285">&quot;If it was simply a matter of killing off an Elder Brain, we could just attack Zorvak&apos;Mur to the west. But that wouldn&apos;t stop other illithid from joining the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104286">&quot;If we could negotiate with the Elder Brains we might be able to convince them all to abandon the Valsharess, but to do that someone has to go into Zorvak&apos;Mur.&quot;</string>
<string name="104287">&quot;You have to find some way to shield your mind against them. The mind flayers are physically weak, but they can destroy your mind with their very thoughts. &quot;</string>
<string name="104288">&quot;Of course, their powers aren&apos;t much use against creatures with no mind of their own, like undead or golems. The illithid are terrified of those kinds of creatures.&quot;</string>
<string name="104289">&quot;Go into an illithid settlement? You&apos;re braver than I am, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I better give you some tips just in case things don&apos;t go smoothly.&quot;</string>
<string name="104290">&quot;Actually, I don&apos;t think we have to worry about the illithid anymore. They&apos;ve abandoned the Valsharess. Somebody must have convinced the Overminds to withdraw from the battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="104291">Imloth gives you a sly wink. &quot;But you wouldn&apos;t know anything about that, would you?&quot;</string>
<string name="104292">&quot;The information we have is that a hive of beholders somewhere to the west of here has aligned itself with the Valsharess. That&apos;s bad news... even one beholder is more trouble than I like.&quot;</string>
<string name="104293">&quot;Of course, all our problems could be solved if someone could kill off the Beholder Tyrant that rules the hive. Without her the entire colony would collapse, and the Valsharess would lose her beholder allies.&quot; </string>
<string name="104294">&quot;Try to find some kind of magic resistance to protect against those beams they shoot from their eyes. Their rays can cause pain, death, paralysis, disintegration... well, you get the idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="104295">&quot;If possible, try to get in close. The beholders use their eye beams and spells in battle, but in close-up physical combat they aren&apos;t nearly as effective.&quot;</string>
<string name="104296">&quot;To be honest, we don&apos;t have much to fear from the beholders anymore, thanks to you. With the Eye Tyrant gone, its unlikely the Valsharess will have any support from them.&quot;</string>
<string name="104297">&quot;I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t help you there. Our defenses are thin enough as it is; I can&apos;t spare a single recruit. Not like any of us common soldiers would be of much use to you, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="104298">&quot;My soldiers are effective in large numbers, but little more than fodder one-on-one. I just hope they can stand up to those monsters the Valsharess is going to throw at us.&quot;</string>
<string name="104299">&quot;It&apos;s for their own good. I&apos;ve seen the kind of enemies they&apos;re going to have to face when we finally go up against the Valsharess and her army. They need all the training they can get. &quot;</string>
<string name="104300">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104301">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="104302">&quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="104303">&quot;Can you tell me about the army of the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="104304">&quot;Tell me about the undead.&quot;</string>
<string name="104305">&quot;Your attacks failed?&quot;</string>
<string name="104306">&quot;Vampires aren&apos;t easy to kill.&quot;</string>
<string name="104307">&quot;Tell me about the illithid.&quot;</string>
<string name="104308">&quot;Can&apos;t we just kill them before they join her?&quot;</string>
<string name="104309">&quot;Elder Brains?&quot;</string>
<string name="104310">&quot;Any advice on fighting the illithid?&quot;</string>
<string name="104311">&quot;I could go negotiate with the Zorvak&apos;Mur Elder Brain.&quot;</string>
<string name="104312">&quot;Tell me about the beholders.&quot;</string>
<string name="104313">&quot;Any advice for fighting a beholder?&quot;</string>
<string name="104314">&quot;I&apos;m looking for allies against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104315">&quot;Monsters? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="104316">&quot;You&apos;re training your troops pretty hard.&quot;</string>
<string name="104317">The rothe ignores you, and continues chewing its cud.</string>
<string name="104318">The animal&apos;s thoughts briefly focus on you as you approach. Once it realizes you are not the herder bringing the next meal, it returns to chewing its cud.</string>
<string name="104319">The rothe&apos;s mind is preoccupied with thoughts of food and sleep, this animal has been completely domesticated. Whatever wild instincts it might have once possessed are long gone.</string>
<string name="104320">Once House Maeviir was as great as any in Menzoberranzan. Now we have fallen on hard times. </string>
<string name="104321">Now that Zesyyr has taken over, maybe House Maeviir can return to its former glory.</string>
<string name="104322">Once this is all over, the Matron Mother will deal with the Seer and her refugees. You&apos;ll see.</string>
<string name="104323">Lith My&apos;athar was much better off before the Seer showed up.</string>
<string name="104324">House Maeviir has vowed to help us, but I don&apos;t know if I trust them.</string>
<string name="104325">I heard the Matron of House Maeviir was killed. I hope the new Matron still supports us.</string>
<string name="104326">I know the odds are against us, but the Seer and Eilistraee will guide us safely through.</string>
<string name="104327">Eilistraee teaches us to be tolerant of others, even when they despise us.</string>
<string name="104328">&quot;You again? Don&apos;t you get it? Your kind aren&apos;t welcome here. This is House Maeviir territory.  Why can&apos;t you refugees just stay on your own side of the camp?&quot;</string>
<string name="104329">&quot;We&apos;ll tolerate your presence here, since we all want to see the Valsharess stopped. But that doesn&apos;t mean we have to like you or your Seer. Now go away - I&apos;m busy.&quot;</string>
<string name="104330">The bartender scowls at you. &quot;You&apos;re with that Seer and those followers of Eilistraee, aren&apos;t you? We don&apos;t see too many of your kind here in this part of the camp.&quot;</string>
<string name="104331">The bartender gives you a nod. &quot;You&apos;re the one who helped Matron Zesyyr take over House Maeviir, aren&apos;t you? Would you like a drink? It&apos;s on the house.&quot;</string>
<string name="104332">&quot;Of course, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;. Please give my best wishes to Mother Zesyyr the next time you see her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104333">&quot;Of course, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;. Anything for a friend of House Maeviir... and the savior who will defeat the Valsharess, if that Seer and those fools who follow her are to be believed.&quot;</string>
<string name="104334">&quot;How could I? They stand against everything our society is built on. Strength breeds strength, the weak are fit only to serve. But the Seer and her followers seem to forget that.&quot;</string>
<string name="104335">&quot;The worshipers of Eilistraee celebrate mercy and compassion. The fools glorify their own weakness. But I can&apos;t deny that the Seer has power, and she has a lot of followers.&quot;</string>
<string name="104336">&quot;House Maeviir is in desperate need of allies right now; even those who follow Eilistraee. So we tolerate their presence in this camp. We need them against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104337">&quot;I don&apos;t know too much about her. She&apos;s a Matron Mother, but I don&apos;t even know from which house. And everybody knows she&apos;s bent on conquering the entire Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="104338">&quot;But House Maeviir isn&apos;t going down without a fight. She may have driven us to this small camp, but now we&apos;re going to make a stand... even if that means siding with the Seer and her bunch.&quot;</string>
<string name="104339">The bartender gives you a full mug of drow ale. You down it quickly; the taste is pleasant, but the kick is strong.</string>
<string name="104340">&quot;Is there anything else you need, good &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;? I&apos;m always willing to help a friend of House Maeviir.&quot;</string>
<string name="104341">The bartender raises an eyebrow, but makes no comment as he draws you another ale. You quickly drink it down.</string>
<string name="104342">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104343">&quot;I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="104344">&quot;I&apos;d like a drink.&quot;</string>
<string name="104345">&quot;You don&apos;t like the Seer&apos;s followers?&quot;</string>
<string name="104346">&quot;Tell me about the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104347">&quot;Sure, I&apos;ll have a drink.&quot;</string>
<string name="104348">&quot;I&apos;ll have another drink.&quot;</string>
<string name="104349">Matron Mother Brizafae tilts her head in acknowledgement of you. &quot;Have you come to ask for the aid of House Deani and all its resources?&quot; The bitter sarcasm in her voice is unmistakable.</string>
<string name="104350">&quot;Go. Stay. What do I care? Everyone in this camp is doomed, anyway. I&apos;m just here to enjoy the suffering.&quot;</string>
<string name="104351">&quot;Why not? If nothing else it might help pass the time until the Valsharess destroys us all. The Seer, House Maeviir... soon everything will be crushed, even as my own House Deani was.&quot;</string>
<string name="104352">&quot;This camp is doomed. The Seer foolishly places her hopes in you, and House Maeviir is desperate enough to join them. An alliance of enemies, united against a foe that will eradicate them all.&quot;</string>
<string name="104353">&quot;But I have seen the full scope of the Valsharess&apos; power. Everyone here will be destroyed. That&apos;s why I&apos;m here... to watch others fall as House Deani fell, to revel in their destruction.&quot;</string>
<string name="104354">&quot;I once ruled one of the Great Houses. Servants bowed down before me, I was bathed in oils and perfumes.&quot;</string>
<string name="104355">&quot;Now I am reduced to living in squalor at the whim of a rival house, crammed in to a common barracks with the despicable followers of Eilistraee. But I am not bitter... not anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="104356">&quot;My life is a festering pit of despair, but I have found one joy; one small glimmer of happiness. Though I am beaten, I will have the pleasure of watching House Maeviir fall by my side.&quot;</string>
<string name="104357">&quot;Once my guards would have taken your tongue for daring to ask the Matron Mother of House Deani a question without permission. But now... go ahead. Ask, and I will answer.&quot;</string>
<string name="104358">Brizafae laughs. &quot;Yes. Nothing heals the wounds of your own defeats like watching others fall. The Valsharess will destroy House Maeviir and the Seer. I just hope I&apos;m here to see it.&quot;</string>
<string name="104359">&quot;I am just a lonely woman, I have no power over events that are to come. But even if I could, there would be no purpose in betraying the camp. Why betray someone who is doomed anyway?&quot;</string>
<string name="104360">&quot;She is what every Matron Mother wishes to become: powerful, ruthless, driving her enemies before her in a war of conquest and destruction. Though I despise her, I also admire her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104361">&quot;I saw the full extent of her power when she leveled House Deani, and she has grown stronger since. You cannot defeat her... nobody can. House Maeviir and the Seer are both doomed.&quot;</string>
<string name="104362">She gives a snort of contempt. &quot;She is a follower of Eilistraee, that is all you need to know. She is an affront to everything the Matron Mothers stand for.&quot;</string>
<string name="104363">&quot;That is why I find these last days of House Maeviir so delicious. Forced to side with followers of Eilistraee in a desperate, and futile, act of self-preservation.&quot;</string>
<string name="104364">&quot;But House Maeviir cannot escape its fate. Like House Deani, it will fall before the Valsharess and nothing - not the Seer, and not even you - can stop its destruction.&quot;</string>
<string name="104365">&quot;They are a doomed and desperate house. They have allowed these refugees - followers of Eilistraee, no less - to make camp on their ancestral home.&quot;</string>
<string name="104366">&quot;The Matron Mother still clings to the pathetic belief that she may somehow survive what lies ahead. She has even banished her own daughter for fear of the girl trying to take over.&quot;</string>
<string name="104367">&quot;Yes, her daughter Zesyyr, Matron Myrune&apos;s sole surviving heir. She&apos;s in the Maeviir public house, living in exile while her mother keeps herself locked away in the tower to the north.&quot;</string>
<string name="104368">&quot;You see, Zesyyr is ambitious. And given the falling fortunes of the house the seeds of a coup are easily sown. Myrune is afraid of her daughter, but she is also afraid to have her killed.&quot;</string>
<string name="104369">&quot;So she keeps her alive, but at a safe distance. It increases House Maeviir&apos;s chance of survival. If either mother or daughter is slain, the other might somehow escape... though I wouldn&apos;t count on it.&quot;</string>
<string name="104370">&quot;Even Zesyyr, their new Matron Mother thanks to you, can&apos;t help them now. And when the army of the Valsharess finally comes, I will be here to witness their utter annihilation.&quot;</string>
<string name="104371">&quot;We made the mistake of challenging the Valsharess. But unlike House Maeviir, we had no ancestral home outside the cities we could retreat to.&quot;</string>
<string name="104372">&quot;Our armies were slaughtered, my daughters hunted down and slain one by one by the Red Sisters - assassins who serve the Valsharess. Only I escaped.&quot;</string>
<string name="104373">&quot;Alone except for my last two bodyguards, I came like a beggar to the door of House Maeviir - once our bitter rival, now our ally against the Valsharess. A fate far more humiliating than death.&quot;</string>
<string name="104374">&quot;House Maeviir gave me shelter, they brought me here with them when they fled the city. Now I sit and wait for their own final fall, so I may enjoy it even as they enjoyed mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="104375">&quot;They took me in so they could gloat over my defeat! The Matron Mother of House Maeviir helped me escape only to prolong my suffering. My misery brings her some small measure of joy.&quot;</string>
<string name="104376">&quot;I know this because I would have done the same had our positions been reversed. And I endured the humiliation because I knew I would get to witness House Maeviir&apos;s own destruction.&quot; </string>
<string name="104377">Though her clothes are somewhat worn, this drow female is obviously no mere noble. Despite her shabby state and meager surroundings, she still exudes an air of arrogant confidence.</string>
<string name="104378">&quot;So, you are the &lt;CUSTOM500&gt; that the Seer believes will save us all? Hmph... a &lt;race&gt; male? I&apos;m not impressed.&quot;</string>
<string name="104379">&quot;So, you are the &lt;CUSTOM500&gt; that the Seer believes will save us all? Hmph. Well, at least you&apos;re not a male. Still, I&apos;m not impressed.&quot;</string>
<string name="104380">&quot;Such enthusiasm. Such confidence. Is this what the Seer saw when the visions first came to her? For all our sakes, I hope there was something else, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="104381">The guards on either side reach for their weapons, but stay their hands at a signal from the drow. &quot;Such a temper, &lt;CUSTOM500&gt;. But I doubt that will be enough to defeat the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104382">The drow suddenly laughs. &quot;I find you amusing... for a surfacer. I am Brizafae, Matron Mother of House Deani. At least, what&apos;s left of it.&quot; She points at the two nearby guards.</string>
<string name="104383">&quot;As you can see, House Deani has fallen on hard times indeed. I don&apos;t even have a daughter plotting to overthrow me... and nothing for her to claim if she did.&quot;</string>
<string name="104384">&quot;You have not heard the term &lt;CUSTOM500&gt; before? It is what we drow call one of &lt;race&gt; blood. It is not an insult... not exactly.&quot; </string>
<string name="104385">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104386">&quot;Can I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="104387">&quot;What can you tell me about this camp?&quot;</string>
<string name="104388">&quot;You&apos;re a bitter, bitter woman.&quot;</string>
<string name="104389">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="104390">&quot;Good to see you&apos;re making the most of this time.&quot;</string>
<string name="104391">&quot;If you do anything to betray this camp...&quot;</string>
<string name="104392">&quot;That&apos;s horrible!&quot;</string>
<string name="104393">&quot;What do you know about the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="104394">&quot;Tell me about the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="104395">&quot;Tell me about House Maeviir.&quot;</string>
<string name="104396">&quot;Her daughter?&quot;</string>
<string name="104397">&quot;What happened to House Deani?&quot;</string>
<string name="104398">&quot;They took you in, and now you revel in their destruction?&quot;</string>
<string name="104399">&quot;I *will* defeat the Valsharess!&quot;</string>
<string name="104400">&quot;I don&apos;t like your tone, drow!&quot;</string>
<string name="104401">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="104402">&quot;What did you just call me?&quot;</string>
<string name="104403">The cowled figure says nothing. As you walk away, you can feel its hidden eyes watching you from beneath the shadows of its hood.</string>
<string name="104404">&quot;I am bound to the Dark River, the flowing waters wash away all wound and harm. You cannot hurt me here while the river&apos;s currents lap against my vessel&apos;s hull.&quot;</string>
<string name="104405">&quot;I am... something else. I can take you across the Dark River, and to the islands you must visit if you wish to destroy the Valsharess. More than this you do not need to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="104406">&quot;For many centuries that island was deserted. Then suddenly a small settlement appeared overnight. But this is no ordinary Underdark city: the creatures there are from the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="104407">&quot;They are cousins of the drow; elves, you surfacers call them. But they have wings. Such creatures are not normally found down here. They avoid contact with me... though they may speak with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104408">&quot;They are cousins of the drow; elven, like you surfacer. But they have wings. Such creatures are not normally found down here. They avoid contact with me... though they may speak with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104409">&quot;But there is something else on the island, as well. Something magical. I can feel its power as my boat floats by the shores, though its exact nature is hidden from me.&quot;</string>
<string name="104410">&quot;I suspect this magic is the source of the town&apos;s strange appearance. If you could harness such power you could use it against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104411">&quot;The Isle of the Maker is the home of an ancient duergar sorcerer. The Maker has not been seen for many centuries, yet his creations - the golems - still wander the island.&quot;</string>
<string name="104412">&quot;If you could find the Maker you might convince him to lend his golems to your cause. Or, if the Maker is no more, you might find a way to control his creations.&quot;</string>
<string name="104413">&quot;More than this I cannot tell you, as I have never actually landed on the Isle of the Maker. It is a duergar island, and I am not welcome there.&quot;</string>

<string name="104430">&quot;More than this I cannot tell you, as I have never actually landed on the Isle of the Maker. It is a duergar island, and I am not welcome there.&quot;</string>
<string name="104431">&quot;I alone can take you across the Dark River to the islands beyond, but first you must know something about your destination.&quot; </string>
<string name="104432">&quot;Then I alone can take you. No other guide can safely navigate the Dark River. Where do you wish to go?&quot;</string>
<string name="104433">The figure before you is completely covered by a heavy robe. You try to peer into the shadows of their hood, but are unable to pierce the blackness. It speaks to you in a gurgling hiss:</string>
<string name="104434">&quot;Then you are wise, for you know nothing of what lurks within the depths of my heart. But I alone can take you to the islands you must visit if you wish to defeat the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104435">&quot;The soul of the Valsharess is black and cold. She hungers to conquer, she yearns to rule every inch of every corner of the Underdark. Even the wild currents of the Dark River.&quot;</string>
<string name="104436">&quot;Her power is growing, and soon she will enslave the Dark River itself, bending its untamed waters to her whims and will. That cannot happen. That is why I will take you to the islands.&quot;</string>
<string name="104437">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104438">&quot;Die, you freak!&quot;</string>
<string name="104439">&quot;Can I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="104440">&quot;I need help against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104441">&quot;What are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="104442">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="104443">&quot;Are you a drow? A duergar? Something else?&quot;</string>
<string name="104444">&quot;Tell me about these islands.&quot;</string>
<string name="104445">&quot;Tell me about this strange town.&quot;</string>
<string name="104446">&quot;Tell me about the Isle of the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="104447">&quot;Tell me about the Isle of the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="104448">&quot;Tell me about this strange town.&quot;</string>
<string name="104449">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="104450">&quot;Tell me about this strange town.&quot;</string>
<string name="104451">&quot;Tell me about the Isle of the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="104452">&quot;I need passage across the river.&quot;</string>
<string name="104453">&quot;Take me to the Isle of the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="104454">&quot;Take me to the island with the strange town.&quot;</string>
<string name="104455">&quot;Take me back to the Seer&apos;s camp.&quot;</string>
<string name="104456">&quot;Valen said you could help me against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104457">&quot;You&apos;ve been waiting for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="104458">&quot;I don&apos;t trust you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104459">&quot;Why are you helping me?&quot;</string>
<string name="104460">Speak to the Matron Mother if you wish, but I&apos;ll be watching you.</string>
<string name="104461">The Seer says Cavallas is on our side, but there&apos;s something strange about him. He never takes off that cloak.</string>
<string name="104462">Be careful over here by the river. Those who fall in don&apos;t come out.</string>
<string name="104463">Talk to Cavallas if you want to cross the river... but don&apos;t turn your back on him.</string>
<string name="104464">You&apos;re the one the Seer said would save us, aren&apos;t you? I hope she&apos;s right about you.</string>
<string name="104465">I know Cavallas brings us food and supplies, but I still don&apos;t trust him.</string>
<string name="104466">The Seer says you will defeat the Valsharess. I hope she&apos;s right.</string>
<string name="104467">The Dark River protects the eastern side of Lith My&apos;athar, and these gates protect the west.</string>
<string name="104468">House Maeviir doesn&apos;t have enough troops to guard the gates, so the Seer sent us to help.</string>
<string name="104469">The Seer sent troops to help defend the gate, but you can&apos;t count on a follower of Eilistraee.</string>
<string name="104470">House Maeviir is training more troops to help us out, but they aren&apos;t ready yet.</string>
<string name="104471">No army has ever breached the gates of Lith My&apos;athar, but the Valsharess might be the first.</string>
<string name="104472">I don&apos;t care how big these gates are, they aren&apos;t going to save us when the battle starts.</string>
<string name="104473">They say the undead are massing against us. We can&apos;t fight an army that&apos;s already dead!</string>
<string name="104474">The Valsharess has beholders and illithid on her side. All we have are the followers of Eilistraee.</string>
<string name="104475">&quot;Back again, &lt;FullName&gt;? Not much going on out beyond the gates right now, though I&apos;ve got a few scouts out on patrol.&quot;</string>
<string name="104476">&quot;We&apos;ve had a few reports of beholders and illithid wandering around, and a couple more undead sightings. Nothing unusual. Still, I wish we could spare a few more troops to help protect the gates.&quot;</string>
<string name="104477">This guard gives you a brisk salute as you approach. &quot;You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt; aren&apos;t you? Sergeant Osyyr at your service. I&apos;m in charge of the defenses here at the gates.&quot;</string>
<string name="104478">&quot;As you can see, we&apos;re keeping a close eye on the gates. I just wish we could spare a few more troops to shore up our position here. We don&apos;t want any surprises catching us unprepared.&quot;</string>
<string name="104479">&quot;I&apos;ll have them open the gates for you right now. Then you can come and go as you please. Just be careful out there.&quot;</string>
<string name="104480">The sergeant nods. &quot;Normally I&apos;d warn anyone against going out there, but if you&apos;re everything the Seer claims, you can probably handle yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="104481">&quot;Just be careful out there. That&apos;s where the true Underdark begins. The caverns beyond the gate are crawling with beholders and illithid, not to mention a host of undead creatures.&quot;</string>
<string name="104482">&quot;Good luck. Everyone in Lith My&apos;athar is counting on you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104483">&quot;Every so often you hear rumors of undead here in the Underdark. Vampires, zombies, the odd mummy. But they&apos;ve never been what you&apos;d call commonplace.&quot;</string>
<string name="104484">&quot;But lately the frequency of sightings has gone way up. Word is the Valsharess found a way to create an army of undead, and she&apos;s going to turn them all against us in one fell swoop.&quot;</string>
<string name="104485">&quot;Well, the illithid colony of Zorvak&apos;Mur is somewhere in this area. It&apos;s a small settlement, really just a slaver outpost for the mind flayers to buy and sell thralls.&quot;</string>
<string name="104486">&quot;But I&apos;ve heard the Valsharess has recruited a whole bunch of the illithid colonies to her cause. That could make the battle tough, what with their mind powers and all.&quot;</string>
<string name="104487">&quot;The illithid aren&apos;t physically imposing, but they&apos;ve got strange telepathic powers. They can enslave your mind, or cause you to go catatonic with just a thought.&quot;</string>
<string name="104488">&quot;Certain spells and magical items can protect against their mental assaults, but we don&apos;t have enough to equip our whole army. I&apos;m not looking forward to fighting the mind flayers.&quot;</string>
<string name="104489">&quot;We know there&apos;s a beholder colony somewhere in the nearby caverns, and there&apos;s rumors the Eye Tyrant they serve has allied herself with the Valsharess. That&apos;s a scary thought.&quot;</string>
<string name="104490">&quot;The beholders are fierce opponents. They shoot out rays from their eyes that can paralyze you, turn you to stone or disintegrate you into a pile of dust.&quot;</string>
<string name="104491">&quot;The other side of Lith My&apos;athar is protected by the Dark River - even the Valsharess isn&apos;t strong enough to move an army safely across those waters.&quot;</string>
<string name="104492">&quot;If she&apos;s going to attack the camp, she&apos;ll have to come through these gates. And when she does, we&apos;ll be ready for her and all her illithid, beholder and undead allies.&quot; </string>
<string name="104493">&quot;Out beyond the gates is where the true Underdark begins. The caverns out there are crawling with beholders and illithid, not to mention a host of undead creatures.&quot;</string>
<string name="104494">&lt;FirstName&gt;! You have returned. And only just in time. The Seer has been asking for you. Quickly, I will take you to her.</string>
<string name="104495">&quot;Can you open the gates for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="104496">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104497">&quot;You said there&apos;s undead out there?&quot;</string>
<string name="104498">&quot;What do you know about the illithid?&quot;</string>
<string name="104499">&quot;Tell me about the illithid mind powers.&quot;</string>
<string name="104500">&quot;Tell me about the beholders.&quot;</string>
<string name="104501">&quot;I can look after myself. Open the gate.&quot;</string>
<string name="104502">&quot;I&apos;ll be careful. Please open the gate.&quot;</string>
<string name="104503">&quot;Why are you so worried about protecting this gate?&quot;</string>
<string name="104504">&quot;Surprises? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="104505">&quot;Welcome back, surfacer. I wasn&apos;t sure if you would return. Because of my close association with House Maeviir, the Seer&apos;s people often refuse to buy from me, despite their need.&quot;</string>
<string name="104506">This drow is obviously a mage of great power. He stares at you intently, as if trying to read your very thoughts. After several uncomfortable seconds, he finally speaks.</string>
<string name="104507">&quot;You are the one the Seer foretold, are you not? Normally I don&apos;t put much faith in her visions, but you seem capable... for a surfacer. I am Gulhrys, high wizard of House Maeviir.&quot;</string>
<string name="104508">&quot;I have a large inventory of magical supplies you might find useful in your efforts to defeat the Valsharess. Given the circumstances, my prices are quite reasonable.&quot;</string>
<string name="104509">&quot;Goodbye, surfacer. If you find yourself in need of powerful magic, I do hope you will return.&quot;</string>
<string name="104510">&quot;I don&apos;t know that I could tell you much the Seer hasn&apos;t already. But go ahead - ask your questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="104511">&quot;I know very little, though not for lack of trying. She has powerful magic under her control - some say she has bound an arch-devil to her will. In any case, my spells can learn nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="104512">&quot;But I don&apos;t need my magic to know that she will destroy all who oppose her, including everyone in this camp. Of course, I already have a plan for my escape, should you fail to stop her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104513">&quot;A tragic tale of lost opportunities and poorly chosen alliances. House Maeviir was once a power to be reckoned with in the great drow city of Menzoberranzan.&quot;</string>
<string name="104514">&quot;But House Maeviir chose to side against the Valsharess, rather than accept a subservient role as her ally. The results of that misguided decision are evident all around you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104515">&quot;Now it seems the long history of House Maeviir is going to come to a final and inescapable end... unless you somehow manage to stop the Valsharess and her great army.&quot;</string>
<string name="104516">&quot;I know she is a follower of Eilistraee, as are many of the drow with her. This makes her unpopular with many of House Maeviir&apos;s supporters... old prejudices die hard.&quot;</string>
<string name="104517">&quot;I, however, take a more realistic view of the current situation. House Maeviir is weak and vulnerable. We need the Seer and her drow, it is a marriage of convenience.&quot;</string>
<string name="104518">&quot;Of course, I don&apos;t plan to be here should this marriage end badly. If you fail to stop the Valsharess, I won&apos;t hesitate to make my escape from this doomed camp.&quot;</string>
<string name="104519">&quot;I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t help you there... though you might want to speak to Cavallas down by the docks. A strange character, but one who knows secrets even I can&apos;t fathom.&quot;</string>
<string name="104520">&quot;Over the years I have accumulated a significant collection of magical wares. However, with the army of the Valsharess approaching I would prefer to have my assets in a more liquid form.&quot;</string>
<string name="104521">&quot;Should the battle go against House Maeviir and the Seer&apos;s rebels, I want to be able to make a quick escape. And I&apos;d rather travel with a pocket full of gold than empty-handed.&quot;</string>
<string name="104522">&quot;I&apos;m a powerful wizard, but I can&apos;t turn the tide of battle alone. If I see defeat is inevitable, then why should I stay behind to be slaughtered when my magic can help me escape?&quot;</string>
<string name="104523">&quot;Serving House Maeviir had its privileges: power, prestige. But I can find such things in the service of any drow House whose High Wizard might happen to have an unfortunate accident.&quot;</string>
<string name="104524">&quot;If everyone here is going to die anyway, it only makes sense that I should try to rebuild my life and position somewhere else, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="104525">&quot;I&apos;m glad you agree. Many of the Seer&apos;s followers can&apos;t accept my utilitarian philosophy. Eilistraee has twisted their mind with odd notions of loyalty and sacrifice.&quot;</string>
<string name="104526">&quot;I&apos;m a drow. Did you really expect anything less? It is our cunning that has allowed us to survive - to thrive - in the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="104527">&quot;But this is neither the time nor the place for philosophical discussions. And if you find a way to stop the Valsharess, it will all be moot anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="104528">&quot;Ah, the keyword there is &apos;trying&apos;. There is no guarantee you will succeed, despite what the Seer believes. And if you fail, I want to make sure I&apos;m given fair compensation.&quot;</string>
<string name="104529">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="104530">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="104531">&quot;Do you know anything about the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="104532">&quot;Tell me about House Maeviir.&quot;</string>
<string name="104533">&quot;What do you know about the Seer?&quot;</string>
<string name="104534">&quot;Do you have any advice for stopping the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="104535">&quot;Why is a High Wizard out here hawking his wares?&quot;</string>
<string name="104536">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="104537">&quot;Escape? You&apos;d abandon everyone here?&quot;</string>
<string name="104538">&quot;You make a good point.&quot;</string>
<string name="104539">&quot;You&apos;re a deceitful, backstabbing coward!&quot;</string>
<string name="104540">&quot;Let me see your inventory.&quot;</string>
<string name="104541">&quot;I&apos;m trying to save you all - can&apos;t you just give me the items?&quot;</string>
<string name="104542">Please do not upset the herd. The meat becomes sour if the rothe are frightened.</string>
<string name="104543">Food is scarce here in the Underdark. Lith My&apos;athar is lucky to have a herd of deep rothe.</string>
<string name="104544">The rothe can be dangerous if provoked, but usually they are quite docile.</string>
<string name="104545">This guard is standing at attention as you approach. He barely acknowledges you as he says, &quot;Matron Myrune is not accepting visitors.&quot;</string>
<string name="104546">The guard doesn&apos;t reply, but merely continues to stand rigidly at attention.</string>
<string name="104547">&quot;She&apos;s the ruler of House Maeviir. The Seer and her rebel followers are here at the pleasure of Matron Myrune. But the Matron is not seeing visitors at this time.&quot;</string>
<string name="104548">&quot;This tower is the stronghold of House Maeviir. Since the rebel refugees arrived, Matron Myrune has secluded herself inside. No one is allowed to see her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104549">The guard suddenly seems very nervous. &quot;Zesyyr gave you that? She&apos;s ready to move now?&quot;  He glances quickly from side to side, trying to see if anyone is watching.</string>
<string name="104550">&quot;Some of the guards inside are still loyal to Matron Myrune. Others are wavering between her and Zesyyr. Those ones won&apos;t fight you, but they won&apos;t help you, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="104551">&quot;Hurry, go inside and we&apos;ll summon the Matron. If you act quickly, you can probably kill her and Captain Tebimar before they realize what&apos;s going on.&quot;</string>
<string name="104552">The guard gives you a brisk salute. &quot;Matron Zesyyr wishes to express her gratitude for all you have done. She considers you an ally of House Maeviir.&quot;</string>
<string name="104553">The guard gives you another salute, but otherwise makes no reply.</string>
<string name="104554">&quot;That isn&apos;t possible. Matron Zesyyr&apos;s position is still unstable, she is worried about assassination attempts. Nobody is allowed in to see her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104555">&quot;Matron Zesyyr is grateful for all you&apos;ve done, but she knows all too well how an ally can be turned to an enemy. She doesn&apos;t want to take any chances.&quot;</string>
<string name="104556">The guard gives you a brisk salute. &quot;Matron Myrune wishes to express her gratitude for all you have done. She considers you an ally of House Maeviir.&quot;</string>
<string name="104557">&quot;The guards who were here before have been executed for their treachery, along with Zesyyr herself. We have staked their heads here as a warning to any others who entertain treacherous thoughts.&quot;</string>
<string name="104558">&quot;That isn&apos;t possible. Matron Myrune is not willing to expose herself to another assassination attempt. Nobody is allowed in to see her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104559">&quot;Matron Myrune appreciates what you have done, but she knows all too well how an ally can suddenly betray you. She refuses to leave herself vulnerable. You cannot enter.&quot;</string>
<string name="104560">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="104561">&quot;Who&apos;s Matron Myrune?&quot;</string>
<string name="104562">&quot;What is this building?&quot;</string>
<string name="104563">&quot;Zesyyr said to show you this ring.&quot;</string>
<string name="104564">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104565">&quot;Can I speak to Matron Zesyyr?&quot;</string>
<string name="104566">&quot;She wouldn&apos;t even be Matron if it wasn&apos;t for me!&quot;</string>
<string name="104567">&quot;But I&apos;m on her side!&quot;</string>
<string name="104568">&quot;Can I speak to Matron Myrune?&quot;</string>
<string name="104569">&quot;I&apos;m the one who warned her about Zesyyr!&quot;</string>
<string name="104570">&quot;But I&apos;m on her side!&quot;</string>
<string name="104571">&quot;Your troops are gathering in the plaza behind you, awaiting your orders. Speak to the individual squad leaders to issue orders to the units. The squad leaders carry a flag for easy identification.&quot;</string>
<string name="104572">&quot;Take care in placing your forces now; once the battle begins issuing orders will be much more difficult.&quot;</string>
<string name="104573">&quot;We have to leave troops guarding both the port and the city core in case the enemy finds a way to cross the Dark River so there are no reinforcements available.&quot;</string>
<string name="104574">&quot;I&apos;ve got experience fighting against the Valsharess and her army. I&apos;ve learned from my past defeats. My advice can help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104575">&quot;The Valsharess will try to break into the city proper. If both the outer and Inner city gates are destroyed, we will be forced to pull back to the city core.&quot;</string>
<string name="104576">&quot;Several catapult emplacements are set up nearby. They will fire automatically at our foes, but you can assume control yourself if you wish to direct them against a particular enemy.&quot;</string>
<string name="104577">&quot;Good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The fate of Lith My&apos;athar - the fate of us all - is in your hands.&quot;</string>
<string name="104578">&quot;You may also want to speak with the unique reinforcements that have joined us to discuss strategy.&quot;</string>
<string name="104579">&quot;Not yet - I am still organizing our defensive strategies.&quot;</string>
<string name="104580">&quot;Yes - I believe we are ready for their onslaught now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104581">&quot;Where are the troops now?&quot;</string>
<string name="104582">&quot;How do I direct the troops?&quot;</string>
<string name="104583">&quot;I don&apos;t need you to tell me how to run this battle!&quot;</string>
<string name="104584">&quot;Any idea of the enemy&apos;s strategy?&quot; </string>
<string name="104585">This drow tries to ignore you, focusing his attention on his troops as they practice their drills. Realizing you are not going to go away, he finally turns to face you.</string>
<string name="104586">&quot;Back again, surfacer? What is it you want now?&quot;</string>
<string name="104587">&quot;Make it quick, then. I&apos;ve got to get these troops trained; I can&apos;t waste all my time answering your questions.&quot; </string>
<string name="104588">&quot;I know her army is coming to wipe us out. That&apos;s more than enough. Go ask the Seer or her followers about the Valsharess. They seem to think they have all the answers.&quot;</string>
<string name="104589">&quot;House Maeviir was one of the great Houses of Menzoberranzan.  But when the Valsharess first came to prominence, we made the mistake of opposing her. The consequences were... harsh.&quot;</string>
<string name="104590">&quot;Many of us were slaughtered, only the small group of survivors you see here managed to escape. We fled the city and came here with the Matron Mother, to our ancestral home.&quot;</string>
<string name="104591">&quot;Now we&apos;re nothing but a rag-tag group waiting to be wiped out by the Valsharess. Maybe I&apos;d like our chances better if our only allies weren&apos;t all followers of Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="104592">&quot;Zesyyr may have taken control from her mother, but I don&apos;t think that will be enough to change our fortunes. The future never looks bright when your only allies are followers of Eilistraee.&quot; </string>
<string name="104593">&quot;They&apos;re weak, for one thing. And they oppose everything that makes drow society strong: cruelty, ruthlessness, cunning, the belief that you must conquer or perish.&quot;</string>
<string name="104594">&quot;And now Lith My&apos;athar is overrun with these soft-hearted fools. There&apos;s more of them here than us! And what good will they be to House Maeviir when the Valsharess comes? They&apos;re not warriors.&quot;</string>
<string name="104595">&quot;Of course, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;. Anything for one who has the ear of Matron Mother Zesyyr.&quot;</string>
<string name="104596">&quot;What do you want, surfacer? Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m busy training the troops? I&apos;ve got no time for a follower of Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="104597">&quot;Go bother Commander Imloth. He&apos;s probably not doing anything. It&apos;s not like you can make soldiers out of the followers of Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="104598">He bows and answers, &quot;Of course, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="104599">&quot;Are you trying to pick a fight? Don&apos;t be a fool! The followers of House Maeviir may not like your kind, but we&apos;re smart enough to save our energy for the Valsharess. She&apos;s the real enemy.&quot;</string>
<string name="104600">The sergeant shakes his head. &quot;My troops need to train. I can&apos;t waste time arguing with a follower of Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="104601">The drow gives you sideways glance. &quot;You&apos;re not? But you came from the Seer&apos;s temple. I just assumed you were one of those pacifists.&quot;</string>
<string name="104602">He gives you a quick once over. &quot;I can see you&apos;re a &lt;class&gt;... and you look like you know how to handle yourself. I guess we can use the help, even from a surfacer like you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104603">&quot;Besides, it&apos;s not like we can count on the Seer or her people when the battle starts. House Maeviir needs better allies than that if we want to stand a chance against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104604">This drow bows as you approach. &quot;Greetings, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;. As you can see, I&apos;m working very hard to prepare my troops for the coming battle. A quick whip produces quick results.&quot;</string>
<string name="104605">&quot;Maybe you could tell Matron Mother Zesyyr of my excellent progress the next time you meet her. House Maeviir&apos;s troops are far better prepared for the Valsharess than those followers of Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="104606">The sergeant allows himself a brief smile, then bows once more. &quot;Your praise is much appreciated, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;. Is there something else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="104607">The sergeant gives you a strange look. &quot;I... I&apos;ll take your advice under consideration.&quot; It&apos;s obvious from his tone that he has no intention of easing up on his troops. &quot;Is there anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="104608">The sergeant&apos;s face blanches. He turns to the troops and shouts out: &quot;Hear that, you pathetic worms? You&apos;re weak! You&apos;re a disgrace to Matron Mother Zesyyr and House Maeviir!&quot;</string>
<string name="104609">He turns back to you, his voice fawning. &quot;F... forgive me, dread &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;. Please, don&apos;t tell the Matron Mother. I&apos;ll... I&apos;ll double their training regiment! I&apos;ll whip their backs raw!&quot;</string>
<string name="104610">The sergeant looks relieved, though it is obvious he&apos;s still somewhat shaken. &quot;Was there... was there anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="104611">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="104612">&quot;What do you know about the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="104613">&quot;Tell me about House Maeviir.&quot;</string>
<string name="104614">&quot;What do you have against the followers of Eilistraee?&quot;</string>
<string name="104615">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104616">&quot;I don&apos;t like your tone!&quot;</string>
<string name="104617">&quot;I&apos;m not a follower of Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="104618">&quot;I&apos;ll tell her what a fine job you are doing.&quot;</string>
<string name="104619">&quot;Maybe you&apos;d get better results if you weren&apos;t so hard on them.&quot;</string>
<string name="104620">&quot;These troops are pathetic! What kind of training are you giving them?&quot;</string>
<string name="104621">&quot;Good! Glad to hear it.&quot;</string>
<string name="104622">I can&apos;t speak with you during my drills. The sergeant will have me flogged.</string>
<string name="104623">The Matron Mother Myrune gives you a scornful glance, then turns to the drow beside her.</string>
<string name="104624">&quot;I&apos;m not sure Matron Mother.  Allow me to find out for you.&quot; The captain turns to you.</string>
<string name="104625">&quot;Who are you?  How did a &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt; like you get past the guards outside?&quot;</string>
<string name="104626">&quot;Zesyyr has been exiled. She can plot all she wants, but she can&apos;t get at the Matron Mother here inside the tower.&quot;</string>
<string name="104627">Tebimar gives the Matron a worried glance. &quot;It appears your daughter is more ambitious than you thought. Maybe it has become too dangerous to let her live.&quot;</string>
<string name="104628">&quot;I am not about to execute my last surviving heir merely on the words of this &lt;CUSTOM500&gt;, Tebimar. Find out if &lt;he/she&gt; has proof.&quot;</string>
<string name="104629">Tebimar nods. &quot;Yes, it all makes sense now. The guards outside must be working with Zesyyr.&quot;</string>
<string name="104630">Myrune sighs. &quot;You know what to do Tebimar. Deal with Zesyyr and give this &lt;CUSTOM500&gt; some type of reward.&quot;</string>
<string name="104631">&quot;House Maeviir thanks you for this information, &lt;FullName&gt;. Please accept this amulet as a sign of our gratitude.&quot;</string>
<string name="104632">&quot;The guards will show you out now... and I will take care of my daughter personally.&quot;</string>
<string name="104633">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You dare to threaten a Matron Mother in her own home? Tebimar, dispose of this creature!&quot;</string>
<string name="104634">&quot;It will be my pleasure, Matron.&quot;</string>
<string name="104635">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; The Matron looks from you to her guards, evaluating her chances. &quot;I&apos;d prefer you save your anger for the Valsharess, &lt;FullName&gt;. That&apos;s why you&apos;re here, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="104636">&quot;But you did discover my daughter&apos;s plot against me... something Tebimar failed to do. Perhaps he should give you his sword as an additional reward, since you did his job anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="104637">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You are brave, to bargain with a drow Matron in her own home. I admire that... so I&apos;ll let you live. But I think the reward you&apos;ve been given is fair.&quot;</string>
<string name="104638">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Zesyyr would have killed me if not for this &lt;CUSTOM500&gt;, Tebimar. Why don&apos;t you give &lt;FullName&gt; your weapon, since &lt;he/she&gt; seems to be doing your job anyway?&quot;</string>
<string name="104639">Tebimar grits his teeth, but hands over his weapon. &quot;Of course, Matron.&quot;</string>
<string name="104640">&quot;Wait, Boss. Deekin is confused. You told daughter you was going to kill mother, now you tell mother daughter told you to kill mother, so mother will kill daughter?&quot;</string>
<string name="104641">&quot;Okay, you the boss, Boss. Deekin just hopes you keep it all straight. We not want to kill wrong drow lady by mistake.&quot;</string>
<string name="104642">&quot;You mean you&apos;ve just been playing Zesyyr this whole time, &lt;FirstName&gt;? You have a real knack for drow politics. I find that... disturbing.&quot;</string>
<string name="104643">&quot;So now we have switched allegiances, &lt;FirstName&gt;? It would be nice if you warned me before you jumped sides like that. I prefer to know whose side I&apos;m on in case a fight breaks out.&quot;</string>
<string name="104644">Tebimar frowns. &quot;&lt;FullName&gt;, the Seer&apos;s great savior. I&apos;ve heard of you. But what business do you have here in the House Maeviir tower? How did you get past the guards?&quot;</string>
<string name="104645">&quot;I came to warn you. Zesyyr wants the Matron dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="104646">&quot;Can&apos;t she? She wanted me to kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104647">&quot;I&apos;ve decided Zesyyr should rule!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the Matron.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104648">&quot;She gave me her ring to get me past the guards.&quot;</string>
<string name="104649">&quot;I&apos;m just glad I could help.&quot;</string>
<string name="104650">&lt;StartAction&gt;Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Come up with something more, or I&apos;ll finish the job Zesyyr sent me to do!&quot; </string>
<string name="104651">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I think I deserve a little more than that.&quot;</string>
<string name="104652">&quot;Stay out of this, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="104653">&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</string>
<string name="104654">&quot;Zesyyr sent me to kill you!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the Matron.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104655">&quot;My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. I work for the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="104656">The Valsharess has cut off all our trade routes and supply lines. There&apos;s no hope for us now.</string>
<string name="104657">House Maeviir has fallen on hard times. We should never have challenged the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="104658">The Seer and her refugees have used up all my stores. I have nothing left to sell you.</string>
<string name="104659">I can&apos;t talk now. I have to focus on my drills.</string>
<string name="104660">It is an honor for any follower of Eilistraee to serve the Seer. </string>
<string name="104661">The Seer says your destiny is to kill the Valsharess. Go fulfill your destiny.</string>
<string name="104662">We will protect the Seer at all costs. Without her, we are doomed.</string>
<string name="104663">&quot;Back again, &lt;FullName&gt;? Have you thought about my offer? Are you willing to assassinate my mother so that I can become the Matron of House Maeviir?&quot;</string>
<string name="104664">This female drow appears younger than many of the others in the camp, though it is obvious from her bearing that she is a person of importance.</string>
<string name="104665">&quot;So you are the &lt;CUSTOM500&gt; the Seer has put her faith in? &lt;FullName&gt;, isn&apos;t it? My name is Zesyyr... only daughter and sole surviving heir to Matron Myrune of House Maeviir.&quot;</string>
<string name="104666">&quot;I was hoping you would come to see me, &lt;FullName&gt;. I have an offer for you, but it would draw too much attention if I had sought you out. But since you&apos;ve stumbled over to me...&quot;</string>
<string name="104667">&quot;House Maeviir - my house - has fallen on hard times. Matron Myrune, my mother, has brought us to the very brink of destruction. Many believe it is time for a change. Many believe I should rule.&quot;</string>
<string name="104668">&quot;Of course, my mother is no fool. She understands the danger I represent, which is why she exiled me from the tower where she now dwells. She thinks she&apos;s safe inside the high walls.&quot;</string>
<string name="104669">&quot;But she underestimated me. I have more support than she knows, and all I need to complete my coup is an assassin powerful enough to kill her and her bodyguard.&quot;</string>
<string name="104670">She sighs. &quot;This is an excellent opportunity, &lt;FullName&gt;. You&apos;d be a fool to throw it away. Come speak to me again if you change your mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="104671">&quot;There are the usual compensations, of course: gold or powerful magic items. But helping me is also in your best interests... and the interests of the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="104672">&quot;You are quick to condemn me, &lt;FullName&gt;, but you don&apos;t have all the facts. You shouldn&apos;t judge me until you know the whole story.&quot; </string>
<string name="104673">&quot;I know my mother. She doesn&apos;t believe we can defeat the Valsharess, and she&apos;s afraid. Do you really believe she will fight by the Seer&apos;s side when the Valsharess attacks?&quot;</string>
<string name="104674">&quot;Matron Myrune will betray your Seer the first chance she gets. I, however, actually believe we can defeat the Valsharess. I won&apos;t turn on my allies at the first sign of trouble.&quot;</string>
<string name="104675">&quot;The plan is simple enough. I will give you my signet ring. Take this to the guards outside my mother&apos;s tower to the north... they have already sworn their allegiance to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="104676">&quot;Show them the ring and they will let you into the tower while they summon my mother and her guard Tebimar. When they arrive, kill them.&quot;</string>
<string name="104677">&quot;If you do this, I will see you are amply rewarded: 20,000 gold pieces, not to mention the knowledge that House Maeviir will stand with you when the Valsharess comes.&quot;</string>
<string name="104678">&quot;Do you think I&apos;m some merchant you can barter with, &lt;FullName&gt;? No, I&apos;m Zesyyr Maeviir, soon to be a Matron Mother! My fee is not negotiable.&quot;</string>
<string name="104679">The drow smiles, and you can&apos;t help but feel a chill. &quot;Excellent. Take my signet ring and show it to the guards by the tower to the north. After that, the rest is up to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104680">Satisfied that she has what she wants from you, Zesyyr dismisses you with a simple wave of her hand.</string>
<string name="104681">&quot;This is a dangerous game, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once you become involved in the politics of the drow, you can never be sure who to trust. I hope you aren&apos;t getting in over your head.&quot;</string>
<string name="104682">&quot;I have the fiery blood of a demon in my veins. But sometimes the things the drow are willing to do makes even my blood run cold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104683">&quot;Consider this, &lt;FullName&gt;: Matron Myrune has lost her ambition, she would rather serve the Valsharess than die. I still have my ambition, and I won&apos;t bow so easily before our common enemy.&quot; </string>
<string name="104684">&quot;Matron Myrune already suspects I am plotting against her. But rumors and hearsay aren&apos;t enough to make her act. She can&apos;t kill off her last surviving heir without indisputable proof.&quot;</string>
<string name="104685">&quot;If you were to tell her what I told you, it would just be another unsubstantiated rumor. She&apos;s not going to move against me based on anything you tell her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104686">She laughs. &quot;Surely you aren&apos;t surprised? This is the way of the drow. The Matron Mothers raise their daughters knowing full well we are scheming to replace them as soon as we come of age.&quot;</string>
<string name="104687">The tiefling shakes his head in disgust. &quot;These are the kind of allies we are counting on to stand with us against the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="104688">&quot;You own mother kicks you out? That&apos;s sad. Deekin sorry for you, drow lady.&quot;</string>
<string name="104689">&quot;She may have kicked me out, but she underestimated me. I have more support than she knows, and all I need to complete my coup is an assassin powerful enough to kill her and her bodyguard.&quot; </string>
<string name="104690">&quot;Deekin takes it back: your mother be smart to kick you out! You is scary!&quot;</string>
<string name="104691">&quot;Obviously she isn&apos;t as safe as she thinks. I know this is how we were brought up, but there is another path you can take. One that isn&apos;t fraught with betrayal and death. Eilistraee can--&quot;</string>
<string name="104692">&quot;Don&apos;t throw your god in my face! We can&apos;t all run away to the surface; some of us have to survive down here in the Underdark. And that means plotting to assure my own future.&quot;</string>
<string name="104693">&quot;My mother thinks I am no longer a threat, but I have more support than she knows. All I need to complete my coup is an assassin powerful enough to kill her and her bodyguard.&quot;</string>
<string name="104694">&quot;What are you doing back here, &lt;FullName&gt;? People will grow suspicious if they see us talking so often.&quot;</string>
<string name="104695">&quot;Go speak to the guards outside the tower. They will let you in to assassinate my mother. Hurry, you must act quickly... for all our sakes.&quot;</string>
<string name="104696">The drow shakes her head. &quot;No, that wouldn&apos;t be a good idea. If people see us speaking too often, my mother will grow suspicious and more careful. We have to act as soon as possible.&quot;</string>
<string name="104697">&quot;Very well, but make them quick. If we are seen conversing too often, my mother might grow suspicious and have you eliminated. Then I&apos;ll need to find another assassin.&quot;</string>
<string name="104698">Zesyyr sighs and shakes her head. &quot;I&apos;m beginning to wonder if I made a mistake choosing you to be my agent. Listen closely this time and I&apos;ll explain it again.&quot;</string>
<string name="104699">&quot;The plan is simple enough. Take my signet ring to the guards outside my mother&apos;s tower to the north... they have already sworn their allegiance to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="104700">&quot;Show them the ring and they will let you into the tower while they summon my mother and her guard Tebimar. When they arrive, kill them.&quot;</string>
<string name="104701">&quot;No, &lt;FullName&gt;, I don&apos;t think we do. We have agreed on our price: 20,000 gold. I&apos;m not about to start bartering with you now; it is beneath me.&quot;</string>
<string name="104702">&quot;I&apos;ve given you my signet ring, and now I expect you to fulfill your end of the bargain.&quot;</string>
<string name="104703">&quot;Do you really think she&apos;ll believe you? A &lt;CUSTOM500&gt; from the surface? Rumors of my plots and schemes are commonplace. She dismisses them out of hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="104704">&quot;And even if she did heed your warning, she&apos;s more likely to kill you than me. I&apos;m her last surviving daughter, whereas you&apos;re just a would-be assassin.&quot;</string>
<string name="104705">&quot;I&apos;m her last surviving heir. If she has me killed, the bloodline of House Maeviir dies with me. She isn&apos;t willing to take such a drastic step... not without proof of my plotting.&quot;</string>
<string name="104706">&quot;She may have her suspicions, and she may have heard rumors and hearsay. But she&apos;s afraid to act, and that will be her undoing. By the time she realizes her mistake, it will be too late.&quot;</string>
<string name="104707">&quot;You mean apart from the fact that you already promised to do so? Very well, consider this: Mother Myrune doesn&apos;t believe we can defeat the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104708">&quot;She will turn on you and the Seer at the earliest opportunity, then go crawling to the Valsharess on her belly begging to get back in her good graces. But I have the ambition she lacks.&quot;</string>
<string name="104709">&quot;I won&apos;t grovel before the Valsharess. I will stand against her. With me as Matron Mother, you can count on House Maeviir to remain true to your cause.&quot;</string>
<string name="104710">&quot;Draw attention? From who? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="104711">&quot;An offer? What kind of offer?&quot;</string>
<string name="104712">&quot;Sorry, I&apos;m not interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="104713">&quot;What&apos;s in this for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="104714">&quot;I won&apos;t be a party to this horrible crime!&quot;</string>
<string name="104715">&quot;What do I have to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="104716">&quot;20,000 gold? That&apos;s not enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="104717">&quot;Okay, I&apos;ll do it.&quot;</string>
<string name="104718">&quot;Why should I believe someone trying to kill her own mother?&quot;</string>
<string name="104719">&quot;You&apos;re pretty open about this. Aren&apos;t you afraid of being found out?&quot;</string>
<string name="104720">&quot;You want me to kill your own mother?&quot;</string>
<string name="104721">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104722">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="104723">&quot;I have questions about this... mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="104724">&quot;I want to ask you about something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="104725">&quot;What am I supposed to do again?&quot;</string>
<string name="104726">&quot;I think we need to renegotiate our terms.&quot;</string>
<string name="104727">&quot;What if I tell your mother what you&apos;re planning?&quot;</string>
<string name="104728">&quot;Why did Myrune banish you instead of killing you?&quot;</string>
<string name="104729">&quot;Why I should help you with this?&quot;</string>
<string name="104730">&quot;Quickly, secure the tower. Remove the rest of the trash that has been following my mother.&quot;</string>
<string name="104731">Zesyyr turns her attention to you. &quot;Well done, &lt;FullName&gt;. You have my thanks, and the thanks of all House Maeviir. My guards will see you are given the payment we had agreed on.&quot;</string>
<string name="104732">&quot;There is still much I must do to secure my position as the new Matron. The guards will show you out now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104733">&quot;More? You have a strange way of bargaining, &lt;FullName&gt;. The deed is done now. Why should I give you more?&quot;</string>
<string name="104734">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You have a surprisingly good grasp of the drow political system. It seems I made a mistake in disposing of my mother&apos;s body so hastily.&quot;  </string>
<string name="104735">&quot;And if I don&apos;t display her body, there may be those who believe she&apos;s still alive. They might plot against me to restore her as Matron... especially if the supposed assassin claims she still lives.&quot;</string>
<string name="104736">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; Zesyyr looks at the carnage around her, then slowly nods. &quot;I suppose there&apos;s no sense in throwing away my life so soon after I&apos;ve become the new Matron.&quot;</string>
<string name="104737">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; Zesyyr nods her head. &quot;You have proven yourself... and I may need your help in the future. I suppose it would be wise to foster some good will.&quot;</string>
<string name="104738">&quot;Very well, you can have the weapon of Tebimar, my mother&apos;s personal guard as an extra reward. It is a quite a powerful weapon with magical properties. I trust this will suffice.&quot;</string>
<string name="104739">&quot;I&apos;m just glad I could help.&quot;</string>
<string name="104740">&quot;I want more.&quot;</string>
<string name="104741">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bluff&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;ll tell people your mother escaped. Then they won&apos;t support you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104742">&lt;StartAction&gt;Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Pay up, or you&apos;ll suffer the same fate as your mother!&quot;</string>
<string name="104743">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Now you know how useful I can be.&quot;</string>
<string name="104744">This soldier is obviously a bodyguard of the nearby female drow. He fixes you with a steely gaze, analyzing the threat you might represent.</string>
<string name="104745">&quot;You may speak to the exalted daughter Zesyyr, but don&apos;t try anything. We won&apos;t let anything happen to the heir of House Maeviir.&quot; </string>
<string name="104746">Matron Myrune should never have opposed the Valsharess. Look what it got us!</string>
<string name="104747">Zesyyr is quite young for a Matron. But she can&apos;t do any worse than her mother did.</string>
<string name="104748">House Maeviir deserves better than this: stuck in a camp with a bunch of Eilistraee refugees!</string>
<string name="104749">The Seer thinks you&apos;re some kind of savior... so go stop the Valsharess already.</string>
<string name="104750">House Maeviir spits on us, but those hypocrites want us to stick around for the fighting!</string>
<string name="104751">I hope the new Matron of House Maeviir has more respect for us than the last one.</string>
<string name="104752">May Eilistraee give you strength and wisdom in these troubled times.</string>
<string name="104753">The Seer believes you can defeat the Valsharess... as do I. Good luck.</string>
<string name="104754">The head of Argosus is somehow still alive, sustained by terrible magic so he is forced to look upon the fate of his followers. He looks up at you and speaks in a parched whisper:</string>
<string name="104755">&quot;I was a fool to trust you. Now I pay the ultimate price.&quot;</string>
<string name="104756">He tries to say something else, but the words only come out as a choked gurgle as he mercifully slips into death, his only escape from the tortures he has endured.</string>
<string name="104757">Unlike the other illithid here, this mind flayer makes no effort to probe your mind as you approach. You don&apos;t know if this is a good or bad sign.</string>
<string name="104758">&quot;Welcome, &lt;race&gt; surfacer. Unlike some of my fellow possessors, I am willing to do business with those of the thrall races.&quot;</string>
<string name="104759">&quot;Goodbye, surfacer. If you wish to purchase goods, please return. I doubt you will have any luck with the other possessors.&quot;</string>
<string name="104760">&quot;I am a shopkeeper; a simple merchant, like all the other possessors who come here to the market. But unlike them, I am willing to trade with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104761">&quot;The Elder Brain has opened Zorvak&apos;Mur to other races for the thrall trade, so I would guess the Elder Brain wants us to treat you politely. I suppose I can answer some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="104762">&quot;I do not know of this drow you have mentioned, though my knowledge is far from absolute. Perhaps the Elder Brain knows something of this.&quot;</string>
<string name="104763">&quot;I&apos;m afraid I do not know the answer to that question. Opening Zorvak&apos;Mur was a decision of the Elder Brain, and it is much wiser than I.&quot;</string>
<string name="104764">&quot;I&apos;m a merchant of goods, not thralls. If you wish to purchase a thrall you&apos;ll have to go to the auction lots in the center of town.&quot;</string>
<string name="104765">&quot;The Elder Brain has opened Zorvak&apos;Mur to other races for the thrall trade. Despite this, the other possessors cannot overcome their contempt and loathing for you inferior races.&quot; </string>
<string name="104766">&quot;But I trust the wisdom of the Elder Brain, and I am willing to set aside my revulsion to do business with you... just as those who buy and sell the thralls have.&quot;</string>
<string name="104767">The mind flayer&apos;s tentacles twitch slightly, as if he is nervous. &quot;Opening Zorvak&apos;Mur is one thing, but I do not know if the Elder Brain will speak to one of the thrall race.&quot;</string>
<string name="104768">&quot;If you truly want an audience with the Elder Brain, you will have to speak to those who guard the entrance to the great chamber. You can find them in the southeast of the city.&quot;</string>
<string name="104769">&quot;Greetings once again, my &lt;race&gt; friend. Have you come to see what I have for sale? As you no doubt have discovered, I am the only possessor who will sell to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104770">&quot;I have to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="104771">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="104772">&quot;Let me see what you have for sale.&quot;</string>
<string name="104773">&quot;Can I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="104774">&quot;Do you know anything about a drow called the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="104775">&quot;Why did Zorvak&apos;Mur open to outsiders?&quot;</string>
<string name="104776">&quot;Where can I buy a thrall?&quot;</string>
<string name="104777">&quot;Why will you trade with me when the others won&apos;t?&quot;</string>
<string name="104778">&quot;I need to speak to the Elder Brain.&quot;</string>
<string name="104779">&quot;This is the entrance to the Elder Concord, the sanctum of the Elder Brain. You are not allowed here, surfacer. Go back to the center of town with the others of the thrall races.&quot;</string>
<string name="104780">You feel the illithid trying to probe your thoughts to gain some sense of your intentions. Of course, your helm protects you. </string>
<string name="104781">&quot;None of the thrall race can speak with the Elder Brain. Tell me your business, and I can relay your message for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="104782">The illithid goes into a brief mental trance, and you realize it is communicating telepathically with another entity. It gives a surprised start, and the communication abruptly ends.</string>
<string name="104783">The mind flayer&apos;s tentacles twitch in mild excitement as you approach, and you feel it probing your unguarded mind. It speaks to you in a voice you hear only in your thoughts: </string>
<string name="104784">&quot;You are extremely stupid or extremely brave, to leave your mind vulnerable before me! Either way, you shall remember none of your previous existence when you have become my thrall!&quot;</string>
<string name="104785">&quot;The Elder Brain says you are to be given access to the Elder Concord. But you cannot enter while you wear the helm that shields your thoughts.&quot;</string>
<string name="104786">The mind flayer turns away, dismissing you without a word.</string>
<string name="104787">&quot;Then you will not be allowed into the Elder Concord.&quot;</string>
<string name="104788">&quot;Move to the central pad. It will transport you to the sanctum of the Elder Brain.&quot;</string>
<string name="104789">I have nothing else to say to you, surfacer. Be about your business.</string>
<string name="104790">&quot;The Elder Brain has no further business with you surfacer.&quot;</string>
<string name="104791">&quot;You will not be allowed into the sanctum again.&quot;</string>
<string name="104792">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="104793">&quot;I must speak with the Elder Brain.&quot;</string>
<string name="104794">&quot;Forget it. I&apos;ll come back later.&quot;</string>
<string name="104795">&quot;I&apos;ve come to speak about the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="104796">&quot;I&apos;ll come back later.&quot;</string>
<string name="104797">&quot;I&apos;m not removing my helm.&quot;</string>
<string name="104798">&quot;You can&apos;t keep me out if you&apos;re dead!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the illithid.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104799">&quot;Very well, here&apos;s my helm.&quot;</string>
<string name="104800">The mind flayer&apos;s consciousness brushes briefly against your own, then pulls back. &quot;Welcome to the fighting pits of Zorvak&apos;Mur.&quot;</string>
<string name="104801">&quot;Have you come to place a wager on the next fight? It can be quite profitable for those who have the ability to correctly pick the thrall in combat.&quot;</string>
<string name="104802">&quot;But though the fights themselves are entertaining, they are much more enjoyable if you have placed a wager on one of the combatants.&quot;</string>
<string name="104803">The illithid turns away you, dismissing you without a word.</string>
<string name="104804">The mind flayer responds with disgust. &quot;The fighting pits are for thralls in the service of a master. To even consider joining them is a sign of your inherent weakness!&quot;</string>
<string name="104805">&quot;Even though you are one of the &lt;race&gt; race, you are not a thrall. You cannot enter the fighting pit. Not unless you allow yourself to become a mindless thrall to one of the illithid.&quot;</string>
<string name="104806">The illithid laughs in your mind. &quot;I suspected as much. For some reason, your kind are reluctant to become thralls to serve the illithid.&quot;</string>
<string name="104807">A wave of contempt washes over you. &quot;Illithid do not lower themselves to answer the questions of the thrall races. Isn&apos;t it enough we grant you entrance to Zorvak&apos;Mur?&quot;</string>
<string name="104808">&quot;If you are here to wager on the fighting pit, then do so. If not, we have nothing further to discuss.&quot;</string>
<string name="104809">&quot;I&apos;m afraid that isn&apos;t possible. Once a thrall is taken to the pits, their minds are destroyed, turning them into mindless combatants. We are not about to release them back into Zorvak&apos;Mur.&quot;</string>
<string name="104810">&quot;But you are still free to wager on your thrall, if you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="104811">&quot;There are those who enjoy watching the fight simply for the bloodshed and violence. If that is all you wish to see, you are free to do so. </string>
<string name="104812">&quot;Are you certain? The next fight involves the human female you purchased earlier. Most like to wager on the fate of their own thralls.&quot;</string>
<string name="104813">&quot;As you wish. Do you want to purchase any equipment for her? It might give your thrall a better chance of victory.&quot;</string>
<string name="104814">&quot;The next fight is between Nourisher &lt;CUSTOM544&gt;&apos;s thrall and Nourisher &lt;CUSTOM546&gt;&apos;s thrall. All wagers are 500 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104815">&quot;Excellent. The thrall you have bet on will be wearing blue, your opponent will wear red. If the blue thrall wins, you can come here to collect your wager.&quot;</string>
<string name="104816">&quot;Excellent. The thrall you have bet on will be wearing red, your opponent will wear blue. If the red thrall wins, you can come here to collect your wager.&quot;</string>
<string name="104817">&quot;We will prepare your human female thrall for the next combat. Would you like to purchase any equipment for her? It will give her a better chance to win.&quot;</string>
<string name="104818">&quot;I will see your instructions are carried out. Now, it is not permissible to bet against your own thrall, but you are allowed to wager on her. All wagers are 500 gold pieces.&quot;</string>
<string name="104819">&quot;Excellent. Your thrall will be wearing red, her opponent will wear blue. If your thrall wins in the pit, come speak to me to collect your winnings.&quot;</string>
<string name="104820">&quot;She&apos;s a warrior; she deserves to have a fair chance in the battle. It&apos;s the least you can do for her now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104821">&quot;It&apos;s bad enough you sent that poor girl into the pits. The least you can do is see she has a fighting chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="104822">&quot;Boss, you ain&apos;t going to let her fight naked, are you? Deekin doesn&apos;t think that&apos;s very fair.&quot;</string>
<string name="104823">&quot;It must be difficult for you who are not of the illithid race, since you are unable to mentally dominate your thralls. It makes them defiant; sometimes they forget their place.&quot;</string>
<string name="104824">&quot;However, your thralls are not my problem. I will see your instructions regarding your thrall in the fighting pit are carried out. Do you wish to bet on her? All wagers are 500 gold pieces.&quot;</string>
<string name="104825">Valen casts a wary glance in the direction of the illithid, then casts his eyes downwards. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, master. Forgive me.&quot;</string>
<string name="104826">Nathyrra casts a nervous glance in the direction of the illithid, then casts her eyes downwards. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, master. Forgive me.&quot;</string>
<string name="104827">&quot;Oh... right. Sorry, Boss. Deekin forgets.&quot;</string>
<string name="104828">&quot;For 100 gold pieces we will give her a sword and armor. Otherwise, she only gets a sword. This fee must be paid each time your thrall enters the ring.&quot;</string>
<string name="104829">&quot;The thrall you sent us earlier - the human female you purchased at auction - is an interesting specimen. I am looking forward to watching her in the fighting pit.&quot;</string>
<string name="104830">For a brief moment you seem to hear mocking laughter in your mind, only to be replaced by the illithid&apos;s voice. &quot;It is unfortunate you lost, but that is the risk one takes when gambling. &quot;</string>
<string name="104831">&quot;Perhaps you will have better luck next time. Would you care to place a wager on the coming battle?&quot;</string>
<string name="104832">&quot;It is a shame the thrall you purchased is dead. Now you have no choice but to bet on the other combatants. Would you like to place a wager on the next fight?&quot;</string>
<string name="104833">You sense a flash of annoyance from the mind flayer. &quot;You are here to collect your winnings, no doubt. Very well, here is your prize.&quot;</string>
<string name="104834">&quot;I am curious to see if your luck holds. Do you wish to place another wager?&quot;</string>
<string name="104835">&quot;Your thrall fought well, though I am curious if she will continue to do as well in future battles. Perhaps you would care to place another wager on her fate?&quot;</string>
<string name="104836">&quot;An excellent fight, wouldn&apos;t you agree? Of course, you would have found it far more interesting if you had wagered on one of the thralls. Perhaps you would like to bet on the next fight?&quot;</string>
<string name="104837">&quot;The fight will start soon. You may use the viewing ports to watch the battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="104838">The mind flayer&apos;s tentacles twitch in mild excitement as you approach, and you feel it probing your unguarded mind. It speaks to you in a voice you hear only in your thoughts: </string>
<string name="104839">&quot;You are extremely stupid or extremely brave, to leave your mind vulnerable before me! Either way, you shall remember none of your previous existence when you have become my thrall!&quot;</string>
<string name="104840">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="104841">&quot;Can I join the fighting pits?&quot;</string>
<string name="104842">&quot;I want to bet on an upcoming fight.&quot;</string>
<string name="104843">&quot;I think I&apos;ll pass.&quot;</string>
<string name="104844">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="104845">&quot;I want my thrall released from the pits.&quot;</string>
<string name="104846">&quot;I&apos;m not interested in a wager.&quot;</string>
<string name="104847">&quot;No, I don&apos;t want to bet.&quot;</string>
<string name="104848">&quot;I might be interested in a wager.&quot;</string>
<string name="104849">&quot;I&apos;ve decided I don&apos;t want to place a wager.&quot;</string>
<string name="104850">&quot;I will bet 500 on &lt;CUSTOM546&gt;&apos;s thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="104851">&quot;I will bet 500 on &lt;CUSTOM544&gt;&apos;s thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="104852">&quot;Forget it. Just throw her in there.&quot;</string>
<string name="104853">&quot;I&apos;ll bet 500 on my thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="104854">&quot;Fine. Here&apos;s 100 gold. Give her some equipment.&quot;</string>
<string name="104855">&quot;Quiet, thrall! I&apos;m the master here, remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="104856">&quot;How much is the equipment?&quot;</string>
<string name="104857">&quot;Here&apos;s 100 gold. Give her the equipment.&quot;</string>
<string name="104858">You feel an urgent prodding in your mind as this illithid attempts to touch your thoughts. Unable to breach the protections of your helm, the illithid grudgingly retreats.</string>
<string name="104859">When it addresses you, the illithid&apos;s words are filled with contempt. &quot;I will not sell my wares to one of &lt;race&gt; kind. Your race are fit to be thralls, and nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="104860">The mind flayer&apos;s tentacles twitch in mild excitement as you approach, and you feel it probing your unguarded mind. It speaks to you in a voice you hear only in your thoughts: </string>
<string name="104861">&quot;You are extremely stupid or extremely brave, to leave your mind vulnerable before me! Either way, you shall remember none of your previous existence when you have become my thrall!&quot;</string>
<string name="104862">Because of your bargain with the Overmind, this illithid knows better than to try and probe your thoughts.</string>
<string name="104863">Whatever spell was keeping this woman&apos;s mind enthralled is now broken. Obviously, the illithid consider her to be your problem. She glares at you defiantly.</string>
<string name="104864">&quot;So you&apos;re the one who bought me? What do you plan to do with me? Send me to the pits to fight for your amusement?&quot; She spits at your feet. &quot;You disgust me!&quot;</string>
<string name="104865">&quot;I won&apos;t bow down to you. Freedom is worth dying for!&quot;</string>
<string name="104866">&quot;Just give me some equipment so I&apos;ve got a fighting chance and you&apos;re probably right. I&apos;d rather die out there in battle than live as a thrall, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="104867">The woman lets out a cry before vanishing in a flash of light. No doubt the magic of the illithid has taken her away to the pits.</string>
<string name="104868">She snorts. &quot;Right. Turn me loose in the Underdark, naked and defenseless so you can enjoy watching me die? I don&apos;t think so. It&apos;s not like I&apos;d make it out of this city alive, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="104869">&lt;StartAction&gt;[You realize she is right. If she knows she is no longer a thrall, the mind flayers will read her thoughts and kill her. If you want to help her, you&apos;ll have to make her think she&apos;s still a thrall.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104870">She looks at you with suspicion. &quot;Deliver a message? How do you know I won&apos;t just run off? Wait... you&apos;ve cast some kind of spell, binding me to you - haven&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="104871">She nods her head in grim acceptance. &quot;I should have known. Give me your message and the directions to get there.&quot;</string>
<string name="104872">She takes your message and leaves, not realizing this is the only way to get her safely out of the illithid city. Next time you go back to the Seer&apos;s camp, you can tell her the truth.</string>
<string name="104873">She pales for a second at the thought, then gets her old fire back. &quot;Don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to be grateful just because you don&apos;t have tentacles growing out of your face. Being a thrall is being a thrall!&quot;</string>
<string name="104874">The woman&apos;s unblinking eyes stare out at you from her expressionless face.</string>
<string name="104875">&quot;Shut up, thrall. You will learn respect!&quot;</string>
<string name="104876">&quot;I bet I can make some money off you in the pits.&quot;</string>
<string name="104877">&quot;Take her away to the pits.&quot;</string>
<string name="104878">&quot;I&apos;m going to give you your freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="104879">&quot;You have to deliver a message to one of my allies, thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="104880">&lt;StartAction&gt;Lie&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Yes. If you disobey me you&apos;ll suffer a horrible, painful death.&quot;</string>
<string name="104881">&lt;StartAction&gt;Give her a fake message and directions to find the Seer.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104882">&quot;Would you rather be a thrall to the illithid?&quot;</string>
<string name="104883">You feel the faint touch of the illithid as it seeks out your mind, but the protection of your helm keeps your thoughts shielded. Sensing your defenses, the illithid&apos;s mind withdraws.</string>
<string name="104884">&quot;Greetings, &lt;race&gt; creature. It is not often we see your kind here in Zorvak&apos;Mur. Except as thralls, of course. No doubt you are here for the auction. Never fear, we will be starting soon.&quot;</string>
<string name="104885">&quot;The next lot for bid is a human female, quite remarkable for her species. She comes from good healthy stock and is also a competent warrior, should you chose to put her in the pits.&quot;</string>
<string name="104886">&quot;I have two other prospective buyers waiting, but I do not like to start an auction with less than three bidders. I will wait for you before I begin.&quot;</string>
<string name="104887">&quot;But do not take too long. If a third buyer shows up before you, I will start the bidding and you will miss out on the opportunity to purchase this fine thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="104888">The illithid steps back and projects his thoughts out to you and the other buyers simultaneously. &quot;We shall now begin bidding on the next lot - a fine human female specimen.&quot;</string>
<string name="104889">&quot;As you can see, she is of excellent stock: strong and healthy. We will open the bidding at 1000 gold pieces.&quot;</string>
<string name="104890">One of your rivals notes: &quot;You seem quite eager to increase the bidding. You must see something worthwhile in this thrall. I offer 1500.&quot;</string>
<string name="104891">The auctioneer seems pleased. &quot;1500 for this specimen. But surely there is another bid out there. Do I hear 2000? 2000 gold for this thrall?&quot;</string>
<string name="104892">Again, one of your rivals is quick to meet the offer: &quot;I&apos;ll give you 2000.&quot;</string>
<string name="104893">The other illithid bidder shakes his head. &quot;That is too much for me. I drop from the bidding.&quot;</string>
<string name="104894">The auctioneer turns to you. &quot;Can you beat that offer? Do I hear 2500?&quot;</string>
<string name="104895">&quot;It looks like there are no more bids. The female thrall will be sold to this illithid buyer.&quot; The girl whimpers slightly as she is led off by her new owner.</string>
<string name="104896">Your sudden jump in the bidding seems to have caught your opponent off guard. &quot;3000? Just like that? You obviously want this thrall more than I do. I withdraw from the bidding.&quot;</string>
<string name="104897">The other remaining bidder is quick to counter: &quot;I&apos;ll go to 2800.&quot;</string>
<string name="104898">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; Your threat seems to have angered your competitor into a rash jump in the price. &quot;I will not be outbid by a thrall! I offer 4000!&quot;</string>
<string name="104899">The illithid thinks for a long time before admitting: &quot;I cannot match that price. She is yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="104900">&quot;It looks like we have no more bids. The thrall is yours, for the price of 5000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104901">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; Surprisingly, your threat seems to have intimidated your competition. He considers briefly, then shakes his head.</string>
<string name="104902">&quot;It looks like we have no more bids. The thrall is yours, for the price of 3000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104903">The mind flayer debates for a long time before offering up another bid. &quot;3500 for the female thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="104904">The illithid thinks for a long time before admitting: &quot;I cannot match that price. She is yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="104905">&quot;It looks like we have no more bids. The thrall is yours, for the price of 4000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104906">The auctioneer&apos;s voice screams in rage in your mind. &quot;You dare to mock us, thrall? You think this is a game? Now you will pay the consequences!&quot;</string>
<string name="104907">One of the nearby illithids - your competitors in the auction - meets the price: &quot;1000 gold pieces.&quot;</string>
<string name="104908">The third buyer increases the previous bid: &quot;1100 gold for the human female.&quot;</string>
<string name="104909">The auctioneer presses the point. &quot;1100 is a piteously low sum for such a strong specimen. Not only is she fit for breeding, she is also a prime candidate to do battle in the pits. Do I hear 1500?&quot;</string>
<string name="104910">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; The other bidders aren&apos;t fooled by your act. &quot;The &lt;race&gt; bidder is trying to trick us. The thrall must be valuable. I offer 1500.&quot;</string>
<string name="104911">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; The other bidders seem to consider your comments carefully. &quot;This &lt;race&gt; bidder likely knows more about the health of humans than we do. I withdraw.&quot;</string>
<string name="104912">&quot;As do I. I have no wish to purchase a feeble thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="104913">The auctioneer is obviously upset, but it is clear there are no more bids coming from the other buyers. &quot;Very well, the thrall is yours for a mere 1300 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104914">The girl approaches.</string>
<string name="104915">Although it is difficult to read the expression on the tentacled face of this creature, you get the sense the illithid is mildly repulsed.</string>
<string name="104916">&quot;I am willing to sell to a &lt;race&gt; buyer, but I will not lower myself to answering questions for one of the thrall races.&quot;</string>
<string name="104917">&quot;We illithid are superior to your kind in every way. I am in the business of selling thralls, so I will allow you to bid in the auction. But I will not treat one of the thrall races as an equal.&quot;</string>
<string name="104918">&quot;Zorvak&apos;Mur is open to your kind, but you are not welcome here. You are only tolerated. Now, shall we begin the auction for this thrall?&quot;</string>
<string name="104919">&quot;Here in Zorvak&apos;Mur owners often send their thralls to the pits to do combat with each other. It can be quite entertaining, and profitable if your thrall wins.&quot;</string>
<string name="104920">&quot;But before you can send this thrall to the pits, you first have to purchase her. Shall I begin the auction now?&quot;</string>
<string name="104921">Once again the illithid seeks to find a chink in your mental armor, cautiously probing your mind as you approach only to withdraw once it realizes your mind is well protected.</string>
<string name="104922">&quot;I have been waiting for you, &lt;race&gt; creature. Are you ready to partake in the auction now? If so, I can begin the bidding on the next thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="104923">The mind flayer&apos;s tentacles twitch in mild excitement as you approach, and you feel it probing your unguarded mind. It speaks to you in a voice you hear only in your thoughts: </string>
<string name="104924">&quot;You are extremely stupid or extremely brave, to leave your mind vulnerable before me! Either way, you shall remember none of your previous existence when you have become my thrall!&quot;</string>
<string name="104925">Because of your bargain with the Overmind, this illithid knows better than to try and probe your thoughts.</string>
<string name="104926">&quot;I&apos;m not ready to bid yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="104927">&quot;You disgust me! You must die for your crimes!&quot;</string>
<string name="104928">&quot;Let&apos;s start the bidding.&quot;</string>
<string name="104929">&quot;I&apos;ll give you 1200 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104930">&quot;Too rich for me. He can have her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104931">&quot;I&apos;ll give you 3000!&quot;</string>
<string name="104932">&quot;I&apos;ll give you 2500.&quot;</string>
<string name="104933">&lt;StartAction&gt;Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;3000 - and you&apos;d be smart not to outbid me again!&quot;</string>
<string name="104934">&quot;5000 for the girl.&quot;</string>
<string name="104935">&quot;Here&apos;s the 5000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104936">&quot;Here&apos;s the 3000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104937">&quot;I&apos;ll go to 3000.&quot;</string>
<string name="104938">&quot;4000.&quot;</string>
<string name="104939">&quot;I don&apos;t have that much gold on me.&quot;</string>
<string name="104940">&quot;I changed my mind. I don&apos;t want her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104941">&quot;Here&apos;s the 4000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104942">&quot;I&apos;ll give you 1000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104943">&lt;StartAction&gt;Stay silent&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104944">&lt;StartAction&gt;Offer 1300 gold.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104945">&lt;StartAction&gt;Stay silent&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="104946">&quot;I&apos;ll give you 1500 for her.&quot;</string>
<string name="104947">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bluff&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;The thrall is obviously simple-minded. I&apos;ll only offer 1300.&quot;</string>
<string name="104948">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;1500 is too high for a sickly human female. I&apos;ll go 1300.&quot;</string>
<string name="104949">&quot;Here&apos;s the 1300 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="104950">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="104951">&quot;Thralls serve a master! I&apos;m no thrall!&quot;</string>
<string name="104952">&quot;Are you saying you&apos;re too good to answer my questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="104953">&quot;Die, you arrogant, tentacle-faced freak!&quot;</string>
<string name="104954">&quot;The pits?&quot;</string>

<string name="105026">&quot;You aren&apos;t allowed in here. No one but the Preparers can see the thralls who are marked for the pits.&quot;</string>
<string name="105027">&quot;These are the holding pens, and I&apos;m the warden in charge. Thralls marked for the pit are held here until the Preparers come for them. I watch over the thralls until the Preparers come.&quot;</string>
<string name="105028">&quot;Back again? Didn&apos;t I make myself clear last time? It&apos;s my job to make sure no one but the Preparers sees the thralls who are marked for the pits.&quot;</string>
<string name="105029">&quot;If you want to watch the pit fights, go speak to the pit boss in the center of town.&quot;</string>
<string name="105030">&quot;In Zorvak&apos;Mur, you go where the masters allow you to go. And the only non-illithid allowed in here is me. Now, back off before you get more trouble than you can handle.&quot;</string>
<string name="105031">The duergar grunts in response, but doesn&apos;t bother to say anything else.</string>
<string name="105032">&quot;A feisty one, eh? My masters will enjoy your antics once you&apos;re been made a thrall and thrown into the arena.&quot;</string>
<string name="105033">&quot;Oh, yes. That human female that was just purchased. Sorry, surfacer - she&apos;s not here. The Preparers have already taken care of her.&quot;</string>
<string name="105034">&quot;She&apos;s nothing but a mindless animal now. She&apos;ll spend the rest of her life fighting in the pits. If you want to see her in action, go speak to the pit boss in the center of town.&quot;</string>
<string name="105035">&quot;Masters can send their thralls off to the fighting pits. Some of the masters enjoy betting on which thrall will survive in a battle to the death.&quot;</string>
<string name="105036">&quot;Of course, they can&apos;t send any thralls to the pits until the Preparers are through with them. I watch over the thralls until then.&quot;</string>
<string name="105037">The duergar gets a sadistic twinkle in his eye. &quot;The Preparers are among the most privileged of the illithid. Before a thrall can be sent to the pits, the Preparers have to modify them.&quot;</string>
<string name="105038">&quot;The thralls&apos; minds are torn down, their very identity is stripped away until all that remains is a primitive animal. It makes for more interesting combat in the pits.&quot;</string>
<string name="105039">The duergar grins. &quot;I won&apos;t go into the grisly details of what the Preparers do to modify a thrall&apos;s brain for the pit, but let&apos;s just say the Preparers come out a lot less hungry than they go in.&quot;</string>
<string name="105040">The duergar laughs. &quot;Well, first off I never have to worry about them tentacles getting inside my skull... seems my brain&apos;s a bit diseased. The illithid don&apos;t want any part of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="105041">&quot;Second off, the illithid don&apos;t mind if I borrow a thrall here and there. The thralls don&apos;t seem to mind, either. At least, they never complain. Maybe because their brains are mush.&quot;</string>
<string name="105042">&quot;Finally, the Preparers let me watch when they go to work on a new thrall. Most folk get a bit squeamish when those tentacles burrow into the skull, but I like to sit back and enjoy the show.&quot;</string>
<string name="105043">&quot;That&apos;s why I enjoy my job so much. And that&apos;s why the illithid trust me to watch over the thralls marked for the pits. They know I won&apos;t betray the Preparers.&quot;</string>
<string name="105044">&quot;And people think we drow are ruthless.&quot;</string>
<string name="105045">&quot;You know, the Preparers let me watch when they go to work on a new thrall. Most folk get a bit squeamish when those tentacles burrow into the skull, but I like to sit back and enjoy the show.&quot;</string>
<string name="105046">He gives Nathyrra a long, hard stare. &quot;They tell me drow brains are among their favorites, but they can&apos;t say why.&quot; He shrugs. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s all the evil inside.&quot;</string>
<string name="105047">The tiefling places a hand on the hilt of his weapon. &quot;You are a vile and disgusting creature!&quot;</string>
<string name="105048">&quot;You know, the Preparers let me watch when they go to work on a new thrall. Most folk get a bit squeamish when those tentacles burrow into the skull, but I like to sit back and enjoy the show.&quot;</string>
<string name="105049">&quot;But I&apos;ve never seen them feed on anything like you before, tiefling. So keep your cool, or the Preparers will get to sample something new!&quot;</string>
<string name="105050">&quot;Ew... gross! Deekin thinks you is not a nice man.&quot;</string>
<string name="105051">&quot;You know, the Preparers let me watch when they go to work on a new thrall. Most folk get a bit squeamish when those tentacles burrow into the skull, but I like to sit back and enjoy the show.&quot;</string>
<string name="105052">The warden gives Deekin a curious stare. &quot;But I&apos;ve never seen them feed on a kobold&apos;s brain before.&quot; The warden shrugs. &quot;Maybe there&apos;s not enough in there to bother.&quot;</string>
<string name="105053">&quot;Who are you? What is this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="105054">&quot;You&apos;re not a thrall. Why do you serve the illithid?&quot;</string>
<string name="105055">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105056">&quot;I go where I want, when I want.&quot;</string>
<string name="105057">&quot;Sorry. I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105058">&quot;No duergar lackey is going to push me around!&quot;</string>
<string name="105059">&quot;I want to see the thrall I sent to the pits.&quot;</string>
<string name="105060">&apos;I think you need to die now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105061">&quot;The pits?&quot;</string>
<string name="105062">&quot;Preparers? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="105063">&quot;That&apos;s horrible! How can you serve such monsters!&quot;</string>
<string name="105064">&quot;Sounds like you&apos;ve got a good set up here.&quot;</string>
<string name="105065">&quot;You&apos;re a monster!&quot;</string>
<string name="105066">This duergar gives you the quick once over, then seems to relax. &quot;We don&apos;t see many like you down here, surfacer. At least, not unless they&apos;re serving the illithid as thralls.&quot;</string>
<string name="105067">She raps the helmet on her head. &quot;Always good to have protection against the mind flayers and their mental powers, isn&apos;t it? You can&apos;t trust the tentacle heads.&quot;</string>
<string name="105068">&quot;The illithid may be willing to trade thralls with us, but you know they&apos;d just as soon turn us all into thralls. That, or watch us bash each other over the skull in the fighting pit.&quot;</string>
<string name="105069">&quot;Goodbye, surfacer.&quot;</string>
<string name="105070">She gives you a strange look. &quot;Questions aren&apos;t wise in our line of business. Even more so in a place like this. You better learn to keep your secrets close to the vest around here.&quot;</string>
<string name="105071">&quot;And you won&apos;t. The mind flayers don&apos;t come into the bar. They say it&apos;s because they respect our right to privacy in here, but I don&apos;t believe that. The illithid don&apos;t have any respect for us.&quot;</string>
<string name="105072">&quot;Personally, I think the golem at the bar is what keeps them away. They say this tavern was built by a duergar entrepreneur seven centuries ago as a place for the non-illithid visitors to stay.&quot;</string>
<string name="105073">&quot;I don&apos;t know if the story is true, but it would explain how this place came to be. And it would explain why the illithid stay clear: the golem would probably attack them on sight.&quot;</string>
<string name="105074">She gets a grim look on her face. &quot;You don&apos;t want to be walking around saying stuff like that. The illithid will do anything to protect the Elder Brain against outsiders.&quot;</string>
<string name="105075">&quot;In the southeast part of town there&apos;s a teleporter that the illithid use to go to the Elder Brain, but I doubt the mind flayer guards there will let you in.&quot;</string>
<string name="105076">She shrugs. &quot;It&apos;s entertainment, and a way to make money if you know who to bet on. Basically, they just take two thralls and throw them into the ring to fight until one ends up dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="105077">&quot;You can enter a thrall into the pits if you want, but don&apos;t expect to get them back. The mind flayers mess up their heads pretty bad. I guess it&apos;s a good way to make sure they fight to the death.&quot;</string>
<string name="105078">&quot;You should check it out. Go speak to the pit boss in the southwest part of town, if you&apos;re interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="105079">&quot;There&apos;s usually an auction going on at the lot in the center of town. They&apos;ve got a special deal there: buy a thrall, and they&apos;ll prepare it for the fighting pit for free.&quot;</string>
<string name="105080">Under his breath Valen whispers, &quot;I know we&apos;re here as slavers, but do we really need to push the ruse this far? Our real business is with the Elder Brain.&quot;</string>
<string name="105081">Under her breath Nathyrra whispers, &quot;I know we&apos;re here as slavers, but do we really need to push the ruse this far? Our real business is with the Elder Brain.&quot;</string>
<string name="105082">The gray dwarf tilts her head in acknowledgement. It is clear she feels more comfortable around you than the illithid. &quot;Is there something else you need, surfacer?&quot;</string>
<string name="105083">&quot;It sounds like there&apos;s a battle going on out there, but I&apos;ll just stay in here until things calm down. I came to purchase thralls, not to get involved in some mind flayer war!&quot; </string>
<string name="105084">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105085">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105086">&quot;I don&apos;t see any illithid in here.&quot;</string>
<string name="105087">&quot;Actually, I&apos;m trying to get access to the Elder Brain.&quot;</string>
<string name="105088">&quot;I&apos;m interested in buying a thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="105089">&quot;Tell me about the fighting pits.&quot;</string>
<string name="105090">&quot;Where could I buy some thralls?&quot;</string>
<string name="105091">I&apos;ve got my eye on you. Don&apos;t cause any trouble.</string>
<string name="105092">&quot;Well, its just a regular rush, now, isn&apos;t it.  What can I do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105093">&quot;Two customers in one day - this is exciting.  What can I get for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105094">This golem addresses you in a deep, ponderous voice. &quot;749 years, 17 days, 3 hours and 14 minutes ago, my creator thought this would be a good place to set up a bar.&quot;</string>
<string name="105095">&quot;You are the first one ever to ask me for service.&quot;</string>
<string name="105096">The golem draws a grimy mug full of brownish sludge from the keg and hands it to you.</string>
<string name="105097">You swear that the golem&apos;s expression changed to one of sadness for a second, but when you look again its face has returned to its normal expressionless state.</string>
<string name="105098">&quot;I know nothing beyond the walls of this tavern. I am sorry, but maybe one of the other patrons can give you more information.&quot;</string>
<string name="105099">&quot;This is the Poison Chalice Palace tavern. My tavern, ever since my creator died. Mostly the merchants who visit the illithids come here. I think they feel safer being here together.&quot;</string>
<string name="105100">&quot;I am the bartender here. I was built to serve the needs of the customers... but until you I haven&apos;t had any.&quot;</string>
<string name="105101">&quot;Wow... you be here a real long time. Deekin bet you is real busy, huh?&quot;</string>
<string name="105102">&quot;You are the first one ever to ask me for service.&quot;</string>
<string name="105103">&quot;Aw, that be sad. Hey, maybe you can buy something, Boss! Maybe you gets a prize for being the first customer!&quot;</string>
<string name="105104">&quot;Actually, I think I&apos;ll be going.&quot;</string>
<string name="105105">&quot;Give me a drink.&quot;</string>
<string name="105106">&quot;Umm, no thanks.&quot;</string>
<string name="105107">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Have a drink from the mug]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105108">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="105109">&quot;What is this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="105110">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105111">This lizard folk looks you up and down, then hisses out: &quot;A sssurfacer? Odd. Are you a ssslaver, then, up on your sssun-ssscorched world? Or have you come here to watch the pit fightsss?&quot;</string>
<string name="105112">&quot;Goodbye, sssurfacer.&quot;</string>
<string name="105113">His reptilian eyes narrow in suspicion. &quot;I don&apos;t like questionsss. If you plan to trade thrallsss with the illithid, you should learn to keep information to yourself, sssurfacer.&quot;</string>
<string name="105114">&quot;The illithid do not come to thisss place. It could be they understand we need a place to be away from their thought-probing and ssstrange appearance, and they respect our privacy.&quot;</string>
<string name="105115">&quot;Or it could be they are afraid of the golem at the bar. Their mind powersss have no effect on a construct. In any case, thisss is the one place in Zorvak&apos;Mur the illithid will never go.&quot;</string>
<string name="105116">The lizard laughs at you, flicking his forked tongue in and out. &quot;Only the illithid are given accessss to the Elder Brain. They won&apos;t let you in, sssurfacer.&quot;</string>
<string name="105117">&quot;You could sssspeak to the guards by the teleporter in the sssoutheast, if you&apos;re desperate. But they&apos;re more likely to send you off to the fighting pitsss than take you to the Elder Brain.&quot;</string>
<string name="105118">&quot;Sssome like to watch their purchases battle each other in combat, though I think it is a foolish waste of merchandise.&quot;</string>
<string name="105119">&quot;Even if your thrall winsss, the illithid destroy their mindsss in preparation for the contest. They turn them into sssavage animalsss. It makesss for better fightsss.&quot;</string>
<string name="105120">&quot;If you are interested in thisss ssspectacle, you should ssspeak to the illithid pit boss in the center of town. He will handle any wagersss you wish to make.&quot;</string>
<string name="105121">&quot;You ssshould check out the auction lot in the center of town, then. I&apos;ll be going there myself, later. If you purchase a thrall, they will prepare them for the pitsss at no extra charge.&quot;</string>
<string name="105122">The lizard folk nods at you by way of greeting. Though you are of a different race, he obviously prefers your company to that of the illithid. &quot;Welcome back, sssurfacer.&quot;</string>
<string name="105123">&quot;I heard the sssounds of battle outside. That&apos;s why I&apos;m ssstaying in here... I&apos;m a ssslaver, not a warrior.&quot; </string>
<string name="105124">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105125">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105126">&quot;I don&apos;t see any illithid in here.&quot;</string>

<string name="105129">&quot;Tell me about the fighting pits.&quot;</string>
<string name="105130">&quot;Yes. I&apos;m here to buy some thralls.&quot;</string>
<string name="105131">Ssspeak to my master, if you wish. But don&apos;t try anything.</string>
<string name="105132">The thralls are entering the pit; the time of battle is at hand.</string>
<string name="105133">Release the thralls and let the carnage begin!</string>
<string name="105134">&quot;Thank goodness you&apos;ve woken up - you were having a terrible dream.  I was so worried about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105135">&quot;It&apos;s going to be all right, my love.  Just calm down.  Come with me and forget all about those horrible dreams. Come with me and we can be happy forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="105136">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt;&quot;A pity you would not stay with us here. But if you insist on doing this the hard way...&quot;</string>
<string name="105137">Your host takes you by the hand and leads you away from the disturbing dreams of mind flayers and drow. Somehow you know you&apos;ll never have to worry about anything ever again.... </string>
<string name="105138">&quot;What is this? Some kind of trick!&quot;</string>
<string name="105139">&quot;What&apos;s going on here? Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105140">&quot;A dream? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="105141">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Attempt to disbelieve your surroundings.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105142">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Go with your charming host.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105143">You notice a large group of humanoid tracks in the area - coming and going.</string>
<string name="105144">A large group of humanoids seems to have been herded in this direction, escorted by several reptilian creatures.</string>
<string name="105145">A large group of humanoids seems to have been herded in this direction. They&apos;re feet were shackled or bound and they were escorted by several lizardmen, judging by the tracks.</string>
<string name="105146">You sense a strange alien presence in your head. The memories and knowledge of a thousand minds floods your thoughts, nearly overwhelming you.</string>
<string name="105147">The images shift and change as the alien presence explores your own mind, seeking a better way to communicate, a way to focus its multiple consciousness to deal with a single entity.</string>
<string name="105148">You feel a powerful presence in your thoughts, its words echoing as if spoken by many voices across an endless void: &quot;You have been given access to the inner sanctum - a rare privilege for a thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="105149">&quot;We can see many of your thoughts, thrall. We see you are an enemy of the Valsharess, and you know the illithid are her allies. Is that why you have come to see the Overmind of Zorvak&apos;Mur?&quot;</string>
<string name="105150">Images of futility and frustration assail you, and the voice speaks once again. &quot;Destroying me will not accomplish your goal. I am but a single Overmind within the Elder Concorde.&quot;</string>
<string name="105151">&quot;Destroy me and this pod of illithid will wither and die, but the Valsharess has the support of the entire Elder Concorde. Destroying me will not stop the illithid from following her.&quot;</string>
<string name="105152">&quot;Zorvak&apos;Mur is only a small part of a larger whole. Throughout the Underdark, the Overminds of many illithid pods have pledged allegiance to the Valsharess.&quot; </string>
<string name="105153">&quot;We Overminds now act as one Elder Concorde. Only a consensus of all the Overminds linked through the Elder Concorde can end our alliance with the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105154">&quot;Destroy me and this pod of illithid will wither and die, but the Valsharess has the support of the entire Elder Concorde. Destroying me will not stop the illithid from following her.&quot;</string>
<string name="105155">&quot;A thrall could never convince the Elder Concorde of anything... but we of the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind could sway the Concorde to abandon the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105156">&quot;The illithid detest the drow; they are fit only to serve as thralls. Yet we have been forced to follow the Valsharess and her army of dark elves despite our hatred of them.&quot; </string>
<string name="105157">&quot;We illithid only follow the Valsharess because many of our pods are not strong enough to stand against her. If you gave us the power to oppose her, we could withdraw our support.&quot;</string>
<string name="105158">&quot;That would accomplish nothing. Zorvak&apos;Mur would wither and die without an Overmind, but the Elder Concorde would still exist. The illithid would still follow the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105159">&quot;We once captured a thrall from a strange village here in the Underdark. The village is made up of winged elves from the surface... though they now live below the earth.&quot;</string>
<string name="105160">&quot;From the thrall&apos;s mind we learned of a powerful artifact - a magic mirror that the winged elves used to spy on their enemies. Such an artifact would give us the power to stand against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105161">If you deliver the mirror, we of the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind will convince the Elder Concorde to abandon the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105162">&quot;When you return the guards will give you access to our inner sanctum once again. Once you have delivered the mirror, we will convince the Elder Concorde to abandon the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105163">&quot;We, the Overmind of Zorvak&apos;Mur, await your return.&quot;</string>
<string name="105164">&quot;When you return the guards will give you access to our inner sanctum once again. Once you have delivered the mirror, we will convince the Elder Concorde to abandon the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105165">&quot;Destroying us is futile. The other illithid pods will still follow the Valsharess. Only by delivering the mirror to us can you hope to sway the Elder Concorde&apos;s decision.&quot;</string>
<string name="105166">A flurry of images assaults you before the Overmind responds. &quot;We each have something the other needs, thrall. We need the mirror, you need us to sway the Elder Concorde.&quot;</string>
<string name="105167">&quot;This is the basis of our relationship, thrall. We of the Overmind are not willing to answer questions that do not pertain to this.&quot;</string>
<string name="105168">&quot;That is not possible. Thralls are necessary for the illithid to survive. The Elder Concorde will never agree to such a demand under any circumstances.&quot;</string>
<string name="105169">&quot;If you deliver the mirror, we of the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind will convince the Elder Concorde to abandon the Valsharess. This is the agreement. We will not bargain with a thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="105170">The mirror floats for a brief second on the surface of the brain pool&apos;s bubbling goo, then begins to melt and dissolve as its power is absorbed by the Overmind. Soon there is nothing left.</string>
<string name="105171">&quot;Return to your Seer, thrall. Inform her that the Valsharess no longer has the support of the Elder Concorde or the illithid.&quot;</string>
<string name="105172">You feel the Overmind probing into your thoughts, unearthing details of Argosus and his followers. &quot;We shall see the thralls are dealt with before they are able to launch their rebellion.&quot;</string>
<string name="105173">&quot;Had you not warned us of this, Zorvak&apos;Mur would have been crippled. In our weakened state, we could never have convinced the Elder Concorde to betray the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105174">&quot;Now go, thrall. Return to your seer. We of the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind have no further use for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105175">&quot;The thralls have become martyrs to our cause; a sacrifice we had no choice but to make if we want to stop the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105176">&quot;I fear what retribution the illithid will exact from Argosus and his followers. But we had no other choice but to betray them. It was the only way to get the Elder Brain&apos;s support.&quot;</string>
<string name="105177">&quot;Oh-oh. Deekin thinks bad things be happening to them thralls now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105178">&quot;You must look at this logically. Your enemy is the Valsharess. By making us stronger, we can oppose her will. This will make her weaker.&quot;</string>
<string name="105179">&quot;You have few options, thrall. If you wish to stop the illithid from joining the Valsharess, you will bring the mirror to we of the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind.&quot;</string>
<string name="105180">You feel the Overmind probing into your thoughts, unearthing details of Argosus and his followers. &quot;We shall see the thralls are dealt with before they are able to launch their rebellion.&quot;</string>
<string name="105181">&quot;Had you not warned us of this, Zorvak&apos;Mur would have been crippled. In our weakened state, we could never have convinced the Elder Concorde to betray the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105182">&quot;Is there anything else you need, thrall? If not, I will return you to Zorvak&apos;Mur so you can retrieve the magic mirror we need.&quot;</string>
<string name="105183">&quot;The thralls have become martyrs to our cause; a sacrifice we had no choice but to make if we want to stop the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105184">&quot;I fear what retribution the illithid will extract on Argosus and his followers. But we had no other choice but to betray them. It was the only way to get the Elder Brain&apos;s support.&quot;</string>
<string name="105185">&quot;Oh-oh. Deekin thinks bad things be happening to them thralls now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105186">&quot;Once again you have returned to the inner sanctum. As before, we of the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind see many of your thoughts... but not all. Have you come to deliver the mirror?&quot;</string>
<string name="105187">A flood of images fills your mind: scenes of surrender and supplication, feelings of fear, terror and weakness. The images begin to shift, and you feel a strange alien presence in your mind.</string>
<string name="105188">You feel a powerful presence in your thoughts, its words echoing as if spoken by many voices across an endless void: &quot;Lay aside your weapon. We surrender before you and beg for mercy.&quot;</string>
<string name="105189">&quot;You are too strong for us. The Overmind of Zorvak&apos;Mur cannot stand against you, thrall. Yet even if you destroy us, it will accomplish nothing. The other illithid will still follow the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105190">&quot;We can see many of your thoughts. We see you are an enemy of the Valsharess. We know you seek to end her alliance with the illithid. But this is not easily accomplished.&quot; </string>
<string name="105191">&quot;You have delivered the mirror as promised. With it, we of the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind have the strength to resist the Valsharess and her drow army.&quot;</string>
<string name="105192">&quot;Return to your Seer, thrall. Inform her that the Valsharess no longer has the support of the Elder Concorde or the illithid.&quot;</string>
<string name="105193">You feel a powerful presence in your thoughts, its words echoing as if spoken by many voices across an endless void: &quot;I see into your thoughts, thrall. You have released the thralls from the pits!&quot;</string>
<string name="105194">&quot;You have brought about the destruction of Zorvak&apos;Mur, but this will not stop the other illithid from joining the Valsharess! You may destroy the Overmind of Zorvak&apos;Mur, but you have failed!&quot;</string>
<string name="105195">The Overmind&apos;s powerful voice echoes in your skull: &quot;We had a deal and you betrayed us, thrall! You have attacked the illithid of Zorvak&apos;Mur, you have sought to destroy our colony!&quot;</string>
<string name="105196">&quot;Your betrayal may bring about the destruction of Zorvak&apos;Mur, but it will not stop other illithid from joining the Valsharess! You may destroy the Overmind of Zorvak&apos;Mur, but you have failed!&quot;</string>
<string name="105197">&quot;Actually, I&apos;m just here to destroy you!&quot;</string>
<string name="105198">&quot;I don&apos;t care about the other illithid! I just want to kill you!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the brain pool.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105199">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="105200">&quot;Yes. I want you to withdraw your support of the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105201">&quot;I think I&apos;ll just kill you instead.&quot;</string>
<string name="105202">&quot;Can I convince the Elder Concorde to abandon the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="105203">&quot;Forget it. I&apos;ll just smash you into goo!&quot;</string>
<string name="105204">&quot;Okay, what do you propose, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="105205">&quot;How am I supposed to do that?&quot;</string>
<string name="105206">&quot;I&apos;ll be back after I get the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="105207">&lt;StartAction&gt; Don&apos;t mention the thrall revolt. &lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105208">&quot;I think it&apos;s brain smashing time!&quot;</string>
<string name="105209">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105210">&quot;If I help you, I want you to give up the thrall trade.&quot;</string>
<string name="105211">&quot;What&apos;s in this for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="105212">&quot;I don&apos;t like your attitude. Time to die, brain!&quot;</string>
<string name="105213">&quot;Here&apos;s the mirror.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Place the mirror in the brain pool&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105214">&lt;StartAction&gt;Don&apos;t mention the thrall revolt.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105215">&quot;I should warn you - there is a thrall revolt planned.&quot;</string>
<string name="105216">&quot;Why should I help the illithid become more powerful?&quot;</string>
<string name="105217">&quot;I should warn you - there is a thrall revolt planned.&quot;</string>
<string name="105218">&quot;Sorry - I&apos;m going to finish what I started!&quot;</string>
<string name="105219">&quot;Why should I let you live?&quot;</string>
<string name="105220">&quot;Is this some kind of trick?&quot;</string>
<string name="105221">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="105222">&quot;How do you know about the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="105223">&lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the brain pool.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105224">The Elder Brain of Zorvak&apos;Mur now emits a foul smelling green haze from its smashed remains.</string>
<string name="105225">For freedom we strike!</string>
<string name="105226">The illithid&apos;s tentacles twitch in nervous agitation as you approach. It speaks with a voice you hear only in your mind: &quot;These are the caverns of Zorvak&apos;Mur. What business do you have here?&quot;</string>
<string name="105227">The mind flayer considers your words. You feel it probing your thoughts, though it cannot penetrate the protective shield your helmet has built around your mind.</string>
<string name="105228">&quot;It is rare we have &lt;race&gt; buyers for our thralls, but you would not be the first. But your thoughts are hidden to me. You will have to remove your helm before I will let you in.&quot;</string>
<string name="105229">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; The mind flayer tilts its grotesque head to one side. &quot;The illithid are not sold as thralls... but your point is well taken.&quot;</string>
<string name="105230">You can&apos;t be sure, but it almost seems as if the mind flayer is laughing. &quot;You cannot blame me for trying. Very well, you may keep the helm that protects your mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="105231">&quot;I will allow you to pass to the outer ring of Zorvak&apos;Mur. But know that the Elder Brain is aware of your presence and knows your thoughts, even if they are strangely muted to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="105232">You feel the gatekeeper giving your mind a gentle probe, testing if the protections of the helm are still in place. Unable to touch your thoughts, the alien presence retreats from your mind.</string>
<string name="105233">&quot;I have already given you access to the outer ring. You are free to come and go as you please. There is no need to speak to me anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="105234">The mind flayer&apos;s tentacles twitch in mild excitement as you approach, and you feel it probing your unguarded mind. It speaks to you in a voice you hear only in your thoughts: </string>
<string name="105235">&quot;You are extremely stupid or extremely brave, to leave your mind vulnerable before me! Either way, you shall remember none of your previous existence when you have become my thrall!&quot;</string>
<string name="105236">Because of your bargain with the Overmind, this illithid knows better than to try and probe your thoughts.</string>
<string name="105237">&quot;Die, you tentacle-faced freak!&quot;</string>
<string name="105238">&quot;I&apos;ve come to purchase thralls from your auctions.&quot; </string>
<string name="105239">&quot;I guess if that&apos;s the only way in...&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Remove your helm.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105240">&lt;StartAction&gt;Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;m here to buy thralls. Step aside, or I&apos;ll see you are added to the next auction.&quot;</string>
<string name="105241">&quot;I am here to buy thralls, not become one. The helm stays on.&quot;</string>
<string name="105242">&quot;I purchase thralls - I don&apos;t speak with them.&quot;</string>
<string name="105243">&quot;Zorvak&apos;Mur should never have opened itself to your kind.&quot;</string>
<string name="105244">&quot;Then know this - we would rather die than live as thralls! Fight, my brothers! Freedom or death!&quot;</string>
<string name="105245">The drow smiles and reaches out to clasp your arm. &quot;Thank you, my friend. I have never thought much of surfacers, but I see I was wrong.&quot; He turns to the other thralls.</string>
<string name="105246">The drow shakes his head. &quot;We can&apos;t waste time with your questions. If the illithid discover the warden is dead, our one chance at escape is lost.&quot;</string>
<string name="105247">&quot;We have to strike now, while we have the advantage of surprise. It is our only chance for freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="105248">&quot;I have promised to wait, to give you time to reach the Elder Brain. But you must act swiftly. We won&apos;t wait forever. You can&apos;t waste your time here with us.&quot;</string>
<string name="105249">&quot;Our revolt begins now! Come, my brothers: we will fight our way to freedom, or die in the attempt. The blood of the illithid will flow in the streets!&quot;</string>
<string name="105250">&quot;Hold on a sec, Boss. If the thralls goes free, all the tentacle things will get real mad. Deekin not think the Elder Brain helps us if that happen.&quot;</string>
<string name="105251">&quot;Wait, &lt;FirstName&gt;! If you do this, then all of Zorvak&apos;Mur will rise up. We will never be able to persuade the Elder Brain to help us.&quot;</string>
<string name="105252">&quot;Wait, &lt;FirstName&gt;! If you do this, then all of Zorvak&apos;Mur will rise up. We will never be able to persuade the Elder Brain to help us.&quot;</string>
<string name="105253">The drow scowls. &quot;What would you have me do? Stay here to become a mindless thrall in the service of the illithid? No - I won&apos;t lose this chance at freedom!&quot;</string>
<string name="105254">Argosus scratches his chin thoughtfully. &quot;So, you want to reach the Elder Brain. I can see how that could be difficult, if the entire city was on alert.&quot;</string>
<string name="105255">&quot;But we don&apos;t want to lose our only chance at freedom. Why should we delay our escape only to make things easier for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105256">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; Argosus shakes his head defiantly. &quot;We face a fate worse than death. What makes you think your threats can make us change our minds? No, we go now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105257">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; Some of the thralls grumble at the threat, but Argosus only says, &quot;You are obviously strong enough to survive in this place. I doubt we&apos;d stand much chance against you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105258">He sighs. &quot;It seems we don&apos;t have much choice. With my freedom so close, I&apos;m not as willing to throw my life away by defying you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105259">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Poison the Elder Brain? I don&apos;t believe you. And even if you did, what would that accomplish, except to put the other mind flayers on their guard? No, we have to go now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105260">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Poison the Elder Brain? Yes, of course. That will weaken all the mind flayers. We might actually have a chance to escape, instead of dying in a valiant attempt.&quot;</string>
<string name="105261">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;m sorry. We owe you for freeing us, but the price you ask is too much. This is our only chance at freedom. We have to go now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105262">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;We do owe you something for freeing us.&quot; There is grumbling from the other thralls, but they stop short when Argosus holds up his hand.</string>
<string name="105263">&quot;We will wait, for now. We will try to give you time to reach the Elder Brain before we make our violent bid for freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="105264">&quot;Then, as I promised you, we will wait here to give you time to reach the Elder Brain before we make our violent bid for freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="105265">&quot;But we will not wait forever. We have to strike before the illithid discover the warden is dead. If you take to long, we will take matters into our own hands.&quot;</string>
<string name="105266">&quot;To arms, my brothers! Freedom or death!&quot;</string>
<string name="105267">The head of Argosus looks up at you from the stake, kept alive by terrible magics to witness the suffering of his allies. He speaks to you in a parched whisper:</string>
<string name="105268">He tries to say something else, but the words only come out as a choked gurgle as he mercifully slips into death, his only escape from the tortures he has endured.</string>
<string name="105269">&quot;Quiet! I don&apos;t answer to thralls.&quot;</string>
<string name="105270">&quot;The warden is dead. I killed him myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="105271">&quot;I don&apos;t serve anyone - but I kill everyone!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the thralls.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105272">&quot;I&apos;m here to free you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105273">&quot;Hold on - I have some questions for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105274">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105275">&quot;Battle on, Argosus.&quot;</string>
<string name="105276">&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter. Go fight for your freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="105277">&quot;That&apos;s right. I can&apos;t let you go yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="105278">&quot;Wait! If you escape now the whole city will go hostile.&quot;</string>
<string name="105279">&quot;Just wait a bit. Just until I get to the Elder Brain.&quot;</string>
<string name="105280">&quot;You&apos;re right. Go now, before it&apos;s too late. Hurry.&quot;</string>
<string name="105281">&lt;StartAction&gt;Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Either give me some time, or I&apos;ll kill you all now!&quot;</string>
<string name="105282">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bluff&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;m going to poison the Elder Brain, crippling all the illithid.&quot;</string>
<string name="105283">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Consider it payback for me freeing you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105284">&quot;You&apos;re annoying me. Time to die.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the thralls.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105285">&quot;You&apos;re free. Go now, before the illithid discover you&apos;ve escaped.&quot;</string>
<string name="105286">&quot;I have some questions for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105287">A strange half-smile and a vacant expression is all the response you get - eyes that look, but see nothing.</string>
<string name="105288">&quot;You disgust me, slaver! You deserve death!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the duergar.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105289">&quot;Thanks for the tip.&quot;</string>
<string name="105290">&quot;You&apos;re mistaken - I&apos;m no slaver!&quot;</string>
<string name="105291">&quot;Nobody threatens me!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the duergar.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105292">&quot;If you attack me, you&apos;re all dead!&quot;</string>
<string name="105293">&quot;Where can I get one of those helms?&quot;</string>
<string name="105294">The bats here seem unusually large.</string>
<string name="105295">The bat flits and flaps about you, trying to determine if you are one of its blood brothers.</string>
<string name="105296">The rat&apos;s eyes look beady in the dark.</string>
<string name="105297">The rats cluster around you excitedly, trying to tell you about some coffins they found nearby.</string>
<string name="105298">Strange symbols decorate the gong.</string>
<string name="105299">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The glyphs and symbols seem entirely indecipherable.</string>
<string name="105300">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The symbols seem to be derived from Old Draconic, a language once popular among Faerun&apos;s more powerful dark wizards. The symbols refer to some form of ritual human sacrifice.</string>
<string name="105301">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105302">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ring the gong.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105303">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lore]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;Decipher the symbols.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105304">Your eye is drawn to a curious engraving. In it, a hooded figure places a black gemstone upon the altar before him, his weapon held in the air triumphantly.</string>
<string name="105305">Nothing seems to happen.</string>
<string name="105306">Your weapon suddenly feels cold to the touch and a strange red aura surrounds it.</string>
<string name="105307">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105308">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place a black pearl upon the altar.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105309">The pit descends into darkness. You cannot tell how deep it is.</string>
<string name="105310">The stone tumbles through empty space, disappearing into the darkness below. After a few seconds, you hear it clatter against some hard surface below.</string>
<string name="105311">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105312">&lt;StartAction&gt;Fasten the rope and use it to climb down the pit.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105313">&lt;StartAction&gt;Throw a stone into the pit.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105314">&lt;StartAction&gt;Climb down the rope.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105315">A pile of over-sized bones lurk in the shadowed gloom. Pale and white, it seems that whatever meat once clung to them has long since been picked clean.</string>
<string name="105316">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105317">&lt;StartAction&gt;Empty the deva&apos;s blood onto the bones.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105318">You peer inside the coffin but find only dust.</string>
<string name="105319">A pale-skinned corpse lies within the coffin, lacerated with bloodless wounds. As you watch, you are horrified to see the wounds quickly closing themselves, leaving not even a scar behind.</string>
<string name="105320">You manage to cause some damage to the corpse but the wound continues to close quickly. You will have to find another way to destroy the creature inside.</string>
<string name="105321">&quot;I have some experience with vampires. The only way to permanently kill them is to drive a wooden stake through their heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="105322">&quot;I have some experience with vampires. The only way to permanently kill them is to drive a wooden stake through their heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="105323">&quot;Hey, Boss. Old Master had a book on undead. Deekin reads it once, and he remembers it says you needs a wooden stake to kill vampires.&quot; </string>
<string name="105324">&quot;Deekin tries to write a song about it once, but nothing rhymes with vampire. Hard to rhyme skeleton or zombie, too. Deekin think that not just a coincidence.&quot;</string>
<string name="105325">You find a rusty key beneath the body.</string>
<string name="105326">&lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the corpse.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105327">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105328">&lt;StartAction&gt;Drive a piece of wood through the creature&apos;s heart.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105329">A small crystal, embedded at one end of this apparatus, pulses with strange light. A single lever rests atop the machine and a narrow, rod-shaped slot is cut into the contraption&apos;s far side.</string>
<string name="105330">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105331">&lt;StartAction&gt;Grab the crystal.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105332">&lt;StartAction&gt;Pull the lever.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105333">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place the Nullifier Rod inside the slot.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105334">&quot;Halt mortal! You stand accused of interfering in divine work and causing willful harm to our agent, Lavoera. I have been sent to exact your punishment...&quot;</string>
<string name="105335">The priest before you is tall and pale. Blood trickles from the corners of his mouth. &quot;Welcome, child,&quot; he rasps. &quot;You have been chosen to serve the will of Vix&apos;thra, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="105336">&quot;If only it was so easy. Vix&apos;thra demands your bones, however, and we demand your blood. Fare thee well, my child...&quot; The priest opens his mouth to reveal two sharp fangs... He lunges for your throat.</string>
<string name="105337">&quot;My name was Zeremund once but now we have no names. We are simply the Elders, the Ones Who Dwell with Vix&apos;thra, the Gatherers of Bones. We serve our master&apos;s will, we see to his desires, and he fulfills our own.&quot;</string>
<string name="105338">&quot;Do you really believe that? Have you never been manipulated? Have you never pursued a lie? Have you never sold your soul? Your flesh? Your blood? Yet the blessed Vix&apos;thra desires none of these...&quot;</string>
<string name="105339">&quot;A volunteer? How fascinating. We don&apos;t get many of those... You&apos;re either very confident or very faithful, aren&apos;t you? I have a soft spot for rarities like you... Rare things are precious, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="105340">&quot;Yes, so precious. Your flesh so warm, your skin so smooth, the eyes in your skull so brightly shining... your blood, even now, coursing through your veins... But the blessed Vix&apos;thra desires none of these.&quot;</string>
<string name="105341">&quot;&apos;Creep&apos; is what you call me, is it? Perhaps there is some truth to that. But it is Vix&apos;thra who rules this domain and it is your bones he covets. He has a great... interest... in bones...&quot;</string>
<string name="105342">&quot;Things of the flesh are not his domain... No, what he covets, above all, are things of bone. It is your femur he wants, your spine, your jaw, the hundred bones within your hands...&quot;</string>
<string name="105343">&quot;How very noble of you... Would you be so eager if I told you that it is your bones the great Vix&apos;thra truly desires? He has a great... interest... in bones...&quot;</string>
<string name="105344">&quot;You see, that is where we run into a little... complication... Within the priesthood, we elders have had to take certain measures that we might serve Vix&apos;thra throughout the ages...&quot;</string>
<string name="105345">&quot;I have a feeling they don&apos;t care much for your wishes here, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="105346">&quot;Neither do I... at least, not without a fight!&quot;</string>
<string name="105347">&quot;Good thinking, Boss. You needs your bones.&quot;</string>
<string name="105348">&quot;And what of my wishes? You see, within the priesthood, we elders have had to take certain... measures... that we might serve Vix&apos;thra throughout the ages...&quot;</string>
<string name="105349">&quot;Long ago a pact was made, a decision... Vix&apos;thra claims the bones but the blood is ours.&quot; The priest opens his mouth to reveal two sharp fangs... He lunges for your throat.</string>
<string name="105350">&quot;You may be willing to give up your bones, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I&apos;m not about to surrender mine without a fight!&quot;</string>
<string name="105351">&quot;You know, there is such a thing as being too self-sacrificing. Giving up your bones definitely falls into that list.&quot;</string>
<string name="105352">&quot;Deekin not thinks that be a good idea, Boss. You needs your bones.&quot;</string>
<string name="105353">The priest smiles, a fresh trail of blood trickling from between his tight-pressed lips. &quot;Let us just say he feels a certain... kinship... to them. He&apos;s a crafter, you see. He likes to fashion things from them...&quot;</string>
<string name="105354">ELDER CULTIST (VAMPIRE) AWAITING THE PLAYER IN THE PIT OF SACRIFICE.</string>
<string name="105355">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105356">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105357">&quot;I serve no will but my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="105358">&quot;I volunteered.&quot;</string>
<string name="105359">&quot;Yes, I was chosen.&quot;</string>
<string name="105360">&quot;Keep your comments to yourself, creep.&quot;</string>
<string name="105361">&quot;What does Vix&apos;thra desire?&quot;</string>
<string name="105362">&quot;I am here to serve.&quot;</string>
<string name="105363">&quot;Sorry, I don&apos;t intend to part with them.&quot;</string>
<string name="105364">&quot;If it is Vix&apos;thra&apos;s wish, they are his.&quot;</string>
<string name="105365">&quot;Why is he so interested in bones?&quot;</string>
<string name="105366">The woman before you is strikingly beautiful despite countless scars. Tattered wings, blackened with mold and dirt, sag from her shoulders. Tubes run from the crook of her elbow to a nearby machine.</string>
<string name="105367">&quot;Don&apos;t forget me... Please don&apos;t forget me...&quot;</string>
<string name="105368">&quot;Is there no good left in the world? I&apos;m a celestial, an angel, captured by the forces of evil, taunted and tortured in the name of their vile cause. And I&apos;m tired and sore and scared... Please, you must do it.&quot;</string>
<string name="105369">&quot;Leaving her trapped here is an act of senseless cruelty. We are fighting against such things, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="105370">&quot;Aw, Boss. You nots going to just leaves nice angel lady stuck to that machine, is you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105371">&quot;You can&apos;t just leave this poor creature here to suffer, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="105372">&quot;The vampires? They&apos;re creating these horrible bone golems. They&apos;ve found a way to animate them using my blood.&quot; </string>
<string name="105373">&quot;It all has to do with that machine. It&apos;s draining my blood vial by vial. I&apos;m so tired, so cold.&quot;</string>
<string name="105374">&quot;I... I don&apos;t know. I&apos;ve lost track of time. They drain so much blood and then they leave me alone for awhile so I can rebuild my strength and then they do it all over again. It feels like forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="105375">&quot;They just pour the vials of blood they get from the machine onto a pile of bones and it happens. The bones knit themselves together and form a horrible beast. All because of my blood!&quot;</string>
<string name="105376">&quot;It&apos;s for the drow. They&apos;re building an army, apparently, and the elders have formed a pact with them. That horrible Vix&apos;thra they worship has given it his blessing as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="105377">&quot;That would explain the reports of an undead host gathering with the army of the Valsharess. We have to find a way to stop this.&quot;</string>
<string name="105378">&quot;This must be how the Valsharess is gathering the undead hordes for her army. We have to find a way to free this creature and stop this.&quot;</string>
<string name="105379">&quot;When they captured me, they sealed me in with fell magic, somehow. They had a rod that they inserted into the machine and now I can&apos;t do anything! Not even cast a little fire spell to keep me warm.&quot;</string>
<string name="105380">&quot;I am... I was called Lavoera, a hospitaler from the Outer Planes... Now I languish here: forgotten, abandoned, and left for dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="105381">&quot;My superiors sent me on a mission to the Material Plane but I was captured by these... these Vix&apos;thrites. Oh, I&apos;ve botched everything so horribly! They even took my mace! I&apos;m a wretched, horrible failure!&quot;</string>
<string name="105382">&quot;All right... I&apos;m not going anywhere. They&apos;ve got me trapped here, you see?&quot; She peers down at the tubes coming out of her arm, gracefully wiping her nose with the back of her hand.</string>
<string name="105383">&quot;I know, I know. Dirty little deva! Bad Lavoera! Go crying home... but I can&apos;t! I&apos;m stuck here forever, surrounded by evil vampires and hooked up to this infernal machine. It&apos;s horrible!&quot;</string>
<string name="105384">&quot;Boss, why you gots to pick on her? She be plenty sad already.&quot;</string>
<string name="105385">&quot;They barely told me anything. I was supposed to tell someone that their hand was being guided by an evil force but no one ever told me who to tell... I&apos;m so stupid and I&apos;ve messed it all up! Look at me!&quot;</string>
<string name="105386">The woman&apos;s rigid posture softens and a faint red glow you hadn&apos;t noticed before seems to drain out of the air. Wind stirs her ragged feathers.</string>
<string name="105387">&quot;Shoo? Shoo!? Fine, then, I&apos;ll take your pity. Rescue the damsel in distress with no care for her feelings, right? I know when I&apos;m not wanted.&quot; Stifling a sniffle, she turns on her heel and exits.</string>
<string name="105388">&quot;Well, it&apos;s a long walk back home. Do you think my wings will heal? Oh, it doesn&apos;t matter. I don&apos;t really deserve wings, do I? I&apos;ve failed everyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="105389">&quot;My superiors sent me on a mission to the Material Plane, but I was captured by these... these Vix&apos;thrites. Oh, I&apos;ve botched everything so horribly! Look at me, I&apos;m a wretched, horrible failure!&quot;</string>
<string name="105390">&quot;They barely told me anything. I was supposed to tell someone that their hand was being guided by an evil force but no one ever told me who to tell.&quot;</string>
<string name="105391">&quot;But then I got captured and, well, I guess you know the rest. I&apos;m so stupid and I&apos;ve messed it all up! Look at me!&quot;</string>
<string name="105392">&quot;I don&apos;t know about your superiors, but the Seer sometimes gives similarly vague instructions. She tells us to have faith; it will all work out in the end.&quot;</string>
<string name="105393">&quot;That&apos;s what they said! Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;ll all work out.&quot;</string>
<string name="105394">&quot;It sounds like your mission was one you couldn&apos;t possibly complete.&quot;</string>
<string name="105395">&quot;I kind of thought so, too. But my superiors aren&apos;t really the kind you can question, being divine beings and all. Besides, they said it would all work out.&quot;</string>
<string name="105396">&quot;You sure they didn&apos;t tell you? Maybe you was just talking too much and they was telling you and you didn&apos;t hear because you was talking too much.&quot;</string>
<string name="105397">&quot;I was so paying attention! Mostly. Sometimes my superiors drone on and I kind of drift off. Still, I&apos;m pretty sure they sent me off without telling me. I figured they knew what they were doing.&quot;</string>
<string name="105398">&quot;Why, complete my mission of course. I&apos;m supposed to find someone and give them a message... I&apos;m not really sure who I&apos;m supposed to find but... Well, things have a way of working themselves out. Serendipity, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="105399">&quot;Of course.&quot; She turns her attention to her tattered wings, patiently trying to straighten the mangled feathers.</string>
<string name="105400">&quot;Let me remember, now... I was supposed to tell whoever it was that their hand was being guided by an evil will... Sort of a vague message, don&apos;t you think? I mean, that could refer to almost anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="105401">&quot;Well, umm... Not really, no. But how hard can it be? The Material Plane&apos;s a finite place, after all. Not like back home where things stretch on *forever.* It&apos;s quite boring, really. Pretty... but boring.&quot;</string>
<string name="105402">&quot;Why would you want my help? All I do is make a mess of things!&quot;</string>
<string name="105403">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You know what? You&apos;re right! Sure, I&apos;ve run into some problems on my mission. But that doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t do some good! I&apos;d love to help you!&quot;</string>
<string name="105404">&quot;Really? I&apos;d... I&apos;d love to. I mean, this person I was supposed to meet, they could be anywhere, right? After all, I have to start somewhere and it might as well be by returning a favor. What do you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="105405">&quot;Oh... Well, I guess the most important journeys in life start by putting one foot in front of the other, don&apos;t they? Here I go, then, off on my mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="105406">&quot;Any idea how big the Material Plane is? Nevermind, don&apos;t tell me. I want it to be a surprise... It was really nice meeting you!&quot;</string>
<string name="105407">&quot;I have to admit, I expected a divine being to behave with more... dignity.&quot;</string>
<string name="105408">&quot;Eager as she is to complete her mission, she just doesn&apos;t strike me as an agent of divine justice.&quot;</string>
<string name="105409">&quot;The drow? The vampires were using my blood to fashion golems for the drow army! Won&apos;t they be surprised to meet me on the fields of battle. Rebels, rebels, rebels... Got it! Okay, on my way!&quot;</string>
<string name="105410">&quot;The Seer&apos;s army is a rag-tag mix of outcasts and misfits. I think that deva will fit in quite well.&quot;</string>
<string name="105411">&quot;She will be quite useful against the army of the Valsharess... assuming she manages to find our camp.&quot;</string>
<string name="105412">&quot;The one the vampires worship? I admit I have a bone to pick with him. I&apos;m weak and may not survive the battle but I would be dying in the cause of good at least. Are you sure?&quot;</string>
<string name="105413">&quot;Oh this ought to be fun. I&apos;ve never fought a god before. Have you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105414">&quot;A reward? I... I don&apos;t understand. I was in trouble and you rescued me, right? Isn&apos;t that how it&apos;s supposed to work? What&apos;s this reward business? I don&apos;t get it...&quot;</string>
<string name="105415">&quot;Horrible. I can barely think, let alone stand, and everyone back home is going to tell me how irresponsible I am. Still, I have to face them, don&apos;t I...&quot;</string>
<string name="105416">&quot;Me? Hehe, whoa... A little woozy, there. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be flying anytime soon. But it&apos;s... well it&apos;s better than it was, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="105417">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;But it is... Dirty little deva! Bad Lavoera! Time to go crying home.. but I can&apos;t! They&apos;ll never take me back now. I&apos;ve failed all of them!&quot;</string>
<string name="105418">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;No? It&apos;s pretty bad... But I&apos;m still here, right? I&apos;m still on the Material Plane. My superiors didn&apos;t say my mission had to be done right away. There&apos;s still time, isn&apos;t there?&quot;</string>
<string name="105419">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;No? It&apos;s pretty bad... But I&apos;m still here, right? I&apos;m still on the Material Plane. My superiors didn&apos;t say my mission had to be done right away. There&apos;s still time, isn&apos;t there?&quot;</string>
<string name="105420">&quot;Oh, this is horrible! I don&apos;t mean to be ungrateful. I mean you rescued me, but you&apos;re evil! I can see it crawling all over you. Out of the frying pan and into the fire, right? Why didn&apos;t you just drain my blood like everyone else?&quot;</string>
<string name="105421">&quot;Oh... I know I&apos;ve made a mess of the whole thing but at least I&apos;m not being held captive anymore. I don&apos;t know how I&apos;m going to explain this to my superiors...&quot;</string>
<string name="105422">&quot;...&quot;</string>
<string name="105423">Limping and blood-smeared, your celestial friend beams at you, her grin spread wide.</string>
<string name="105424">&quot;A mission? Oh yes, my mission! Well, I guess the most important journeys in life start by putting one foot in front of the other, don&apos;t they? Here I go, then, off on my mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="105425">&quot;A favor? That&apos;s sort of like a mission, isn&apos;t it? Ooh, this sounds like fun.&quot;</string>
<string name="105426">&quot;I&apos;m what? I&apos;m bleeding? Oh wow, I&apos;m bleeding! That&apos;s a good sign. I wasn&apos;t sure if I had any left in me.&quot; She wipes the blood away and continues grinning.</string>
<string name="105427">&quot;So, what should we do now? Got any ideas?&quot;</string>
<string name="105428">&quot;This is going to be fun. Everyone&apos;s going to be impressed when they see how much smiting of evil I do in this battle!&quot;</string>
<string name="105429">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105430">&quot;I&apos;ll be back.&quot;</string>
<string name="105431">&quot;Why should I free you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105432">&quot;What have the elders done to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105433">&quot;How long have they been doing this to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105434">&quot;How are they creating these golems?&quot;</string>
<string name="105435">&quot;Why are they creating these golems?&quot;</string>
<string name="105436">&quot;What binds you here?&quot;</string>
<string name="105437">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105438">&quot;How did you end up here?&quot;</string>
<string name="105439">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105440">&quot;Yes, you&apos;re a terrible little beast.&quot;</string>
<string name="105441">&quot;What was your mission?&quot;</string>
<string name="105442">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105443">&quot;Yes, well... Shoo! Get out of here...&quot;</string>
<string name="105444">&quot;What do you intend to do now?&quot;</string>
<string name="105445">&quot;How did you fail everyone?&quot;</string>
<string name="105446">&quot;What was your mission?&quot;</string>
<string name="105447">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105448">&quot;What was that message you had to deliver?&quot;</string>
<string name="105449">&quot;You have no idea what to do, do you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105450">&quot;I could use your help.&quot;</string>
<string name="105451">&quot;You&apos;re right. Get out of here. Shoo!&quot;</string>
<string name="105452">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;This is your chance to make things right.&quot;</string>
<string name="105453">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Come now, it&apos;s not so bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="105454">&quot;I&apos;ve changed my mind. Get out of here. Shoo!&quot;</string>
<string name="105455">&quot;Nevermind. Do what you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="105456">&quot;There&apos;s a rebellion against the drow and the rebel camp needs your protection.&quot;</string>
<string name="105457">&quot;I need your help defeating Vix&apos;thra.&quot;</string>
<string name="105458">&quot;Yes, help me battle Vix&apos;thra.&quot;</string>
<string name="105459">&quot;Okay, I freed you. How about a reward?&quot;</string>
<string name="105460">&quot;How are you feeling?&quot;</string>
<string name="105461">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Come now, it&apos;s not so bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="105462">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105463">&quot;I have a geas placed on me and I need your help.&quot;</string>
<string name="105464">&quot;Don&apos;t kick a gift horse in the mouth...&quot;</string>
<string name="105465">&quot;Well I&apos;m not *really* evil...&quot;</string>
<string name="105466">&quot;I&apos;ve got my reasons.&quot;</string>
<string name="105467">&quot;I could have done that?&quot;</string>
<string name="105468">&quot;You&apos;ve still got a mission to accomplish, remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="105469">&quot;I need to ask one last favor of you.&quot;</string>

<string name="105493">&quot;I&apos;m scared to stay here but if I flee, Vix&apos;thra will find me. Save yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="105494">&quot;Please, no more Ceremonies. We&apos;ve lost so much already.&quot;</string>
<string name="105495">&quot;Go back to wherever it is you came from. You don&apos;t want to be here.&quot;</string>

<string name="105499">&quot;You killed the priests? Every last one? I spit on their corpses, then!&quot;</string>
<string name="105500">&quot;Is it true? Are the Ceremonies gone for good?&quot;</string>
<string name="105501">&quot;The Ceremonies may be over but Vix&apos;thra remains. I be frightened, stranger.&quot;</string>

<string name="105508">&quot;It feels strange... No fear for a Ceremony tomorrow, no threat of Vix&apos;thra&apos;s wrath... I think I&apos;ll become a tinker!&quot;</string>
<string name="105509">&quot;The cult be gone and their god as well. Makes me wonder what will become of all us Drearingsers.&quot;</string>
<string name="105510">&quot;I been thinking I might bring my family to the surface, now. I&apos;ll find me a way.&quot;</string>
<string name="105511">&quot;Thank you, &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt;. Drearing&apos;s Deep be in your debt.&quot;</string>
<string name="105512">&quot;To the hells with the priests and their Vix&apos;thra! And may they never return, neither.&quot;</string>
<string name="105513">RANDOMIZER -- CHOOSE FROM 6</string>
<string name="105514">&quot;I&apos;ll not talk with the likes of you, all ragged and naked and filthy...&quot; </string>
<string name="105515">GENERIC VILLAGER OF DREARING&apos;S DEEP. MALE &amp; FEMALE, VARIOUS SURFACE &amp; UNDERDARK RACES. ONE-LINERS ONLY.</string>
<string name="105516">&quot;You&apos;re not here to tell me you were followed, are you? That&apos;s okay - we&apos;ll find a way to help you. That&apos;s what we have to do once we&apos;ve escaped, isn&apos;t it? Here in Drearing&apos;s Deep we stick together.&quot;</string>
<string name="105517">A small misshapen man bounds up to you from the cavern&apos;s gloom, nearly bowling you over in his excitement.</string>
<string name="105518">&quot;Welcome, welcome to Drearing&apos;s Deep! Where did you escape from? Did anyone follow you? Come in, come in, Drearing&apos;s Deep welcomes you!&quot;</string>
<string name="105519">&quot;Me? I&apos;m Cordigan! I&apos;m the Leader of the Village! Yes, the Elected Representative! Secret ballot, it was, secret ballot...  Yes, yes, yes, but not much power, though, not much power at all here in Drearing&apos;s.&quot;</string>
<string name="105520">&quot;It&apos;s a complicated state of affairs, yes? A complicated state of affairs! There are elected officials, you see, and there are those we don&apos;t elect yet have power anyway, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="105521">&quot;Ooh, I dare not say, I dare not say. I represent the villagers but I do not speak for them. Ask them who holds the true power here, then. Ask them, you&apos;ll see.&quot;</string>
<string name="105522">&quot;Me? Quick of the tongue, quick of the tongue? It&apos;s nerves, is all. Just nerves. The stress of leadership, of being Almost But Not Quite Free, of... Nerves, I&apos;m just jittery, that&apos;s all!&quot;</string>
<string name="105523">&quot;Did you know? Yes, I used to be quite the orator once, quite the orator. I stood before the Gnomish Third Council, I did, and spoke out loud and clear! But then the illithids got me... They got me, I said!&quot;</string>
<string name="105524">&quot;I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t remember! They erased that part of my memory. They erased a lot of me! I wasn&apos;t always like this, oh no... I remember I was a great orator once. I spoke at the Third Council!&quot;</string>
<string name="105525">&quot;Yes, on the new Emerald findings, it was. Though one of my colleagues had learned to pick up sound waves with a quartz crystal! The Third Council, that was a long time ago. Before the Fourth, at least!&quot;</string>
<string name="105526">&quot;That&apos;s what happens when people escape, you know... You get followed. You may not think you get followed but then a slave tracker shows up on the village door and there you have it... Followed.&quot;</string>
<string name="105527">&quot;Don&apos;t you worry now, don&apos;t you worry. You&apos;re safe from that here in Drearing&apos;s Deep, Village of the Free. Oh yes, you&apos;ll be protected from that, at least. There&apos;s something else to be worrying about...&quot;</string>
<string name="105528">&quot;Hush, hush, my lips are sealed. You&apos;d better not ask me about that! I may lead the fine citizens of Drearing&apos;s Deep but I dare not speak for them. You should ask them what they have to worry about.&quot;</string>
<string name="105529">&quot;Well, slaveowners don&apos;t just set slaves free willy-nilly, now, do they? No, it&apos;s bad for business, it is! No, we have to fight for our freedom! Tooth and nail, I tell you, tooth and nail... We have to escape, you see...&quot;</string>
<string name="105530">&quot;Not any more, no... Welcome to Drearing&apos;s Deep! You&apos;re free now! Well... Almost Free! Verging On Free, really! It&apos;s so close you can almost taste it! It tastes like mintleaf with a hint of asparagus, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="105531">&quot;Yes, yes, dig away, then. Dig away...&quot;</string>
<string name="105532">&quot;Never? Never ever never? There&apos;s no collar that&apos;s made its home upon your neck, no manacles upon your hands and shackles on your feet? Or maybe they just played with your head like the damn illithids!&quot;</string>
<string name="105533">&quot;Never you mind about that. It was a bad analogy, is all! A bad analogy. Like talking about swords and carrots in the same sentence, swords and carrots!&quot;</string>
<string name="105534">&quot;Verging on Free, I said! But you&apos;d better not ask me about that. I may lead the fine citizens of Drearing&apos;s Deep but I dare not speak for them. You should ask them why they&apos;re Not Quite Free.&quot;</string>
<string name="105535">&quot;Yes, Drearing&apos;s Deep, the Village of the Free... or the Almost Free, at least. The No Longer Enslaved! The Not Yet Fully Emancipated! Drearing&apos;s Deep, welcome, welcome...&quot;</string>
<string name="105536">&quot;Not Yet Fully Emancipated, I said! But you&apos;d better not ask me about that. I may lead the fine citizens of Drearing&apos;s Deep but I dare not speak for them. You should ask them why they&apos;re Not Quite Free.&quot;</string>
<string name="105537">A familiar figure tumbles forward as the crowd departs. They barely seem to notice his hunched, misshapen form.</string>
<string name="105538">&quot;Yes, the Ceremony! The Choosing... Some call it the Lottery, yes? Well now you know the curse of Drearing&apos;s Deep! We&apos;re not slaves here, no, but as long as that temple stands, we&apos;re not free either...&quot;</string>
<string name="105539">&quot;Well, you could storm the temple but who&apos;s to say you would succeed, who&apos;s to say... You had your chance, you know. You could have spoken up and been the one to be Chosen but it&apos;s too late now, too late...&quot;</string>
<string name="105540">&quot;If you would help, though... What if you lived, what if the priests were destroyed, what if...? Why we could be free again for the first time! Really, Truly Free, don&apos;t you see? Please, you must do whatever it takes.&quot;</string>
<string name="105541">&quot;Horrible? Frightful, yes, and dreadfully sad... But we&apos;re not slaves here. We&apos;re not tortured for the amusement of the drow or turned into drooling babes by the illithids... It&apos;s not horrible at all, by comparison...&quot;</string>
<string name="105542">&quot;Do I look like a warrior to you? Oh no, I&apos;m an orator! I was skilled, once, too, before the mindflayers had their way... Besides, Vix&apos;thra keeps the slave trackers away. Every cloud has a silver lining, see...?&quot;</string>
<string name="105543">A grateful figure hunches before you on the temple steps, his knobby hands clasped fervently before him.</string>
<string name="105544">&quot;Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Many thanks, yes? We are truly Free now, both from our prior slavery and from the terrible tyranny of Vix&apos;thra!&quot;</string>
<string name="105545">&quot;Why, lead the village! Free more slaves! Build defenses now that Vix&apos;thra&apos;s gone, protect against the Slave Trackers! It&apos;s time to build a better life, it is. A better life right here in Drearing&apos;s Deep!&quot;</string>
<string name="105546">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FullName&gt;. In one fell swoop you&apos;ve given us what we&apos;ve dreamed of and been so scared to have for all these years. Thank you, thank you, a thousand times thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105547">&quot;Freedom is worth fighting for; even worth dying for. Remember this, or you may find yourselves slaves once more.&quot;</string>
<string name="105548">&quot;The Seer would be pleased with our work here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You have done a good thing here.&quot;</string>
<string name="105549">&quot;Hear that, Boss? Maybe if we come back, they going to throw us a party! Maybe they even have cake! Deekin likes cake.&quot;</string>
<string name="105550">&quot;Yes, yes, of course you did! For us, for Drearing&apos;s Deep, for the cause of Freedom, Real Freedom, a light in the darkness, you are, a veritable light in the darkness...&quot;</string>
<string name="105551">&quot;Yes, welcome, welcome, welcome! Come here to Drearing&apos;s Deep any time. We&apos;re Free now, Truly Entirely Free, thanks to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105552">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105553">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105554">&quot;Who are you, anyway?&quot;</string>
<string name="105555">&quot;Why don&apos;t you have much power?&quot;</string>
<string name="105556">&quot;Well who&apos;s the unelected official, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="105557">&quot;You have a funny way of speaking.&quot;</string>
<string name="105558">&quot;How did the illithids catch you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105559">&quot;The Gnomish Third Council?&quot;</string>
<string name="105560">&quot;Why are you so concerned that I might have been followed?&quot;</string>
<string name="105561">&quot;Slave trackers?&quot;</string>
<string name="105562">&quot;What? What&apos;s there to worry about?&quot;</string>
<string name="105563">&quot;What makes you think I&apos;ve escaped from somewhere?&quot;</string>
<string name="105564">&quot;But I&apos;m not a slave...&quot;</string>
<string name="105565">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105566">&quot;But I&apos;m really not a slave. I never have been.&quot;</string>
<string name="105567">&quot;Mintleaf and asparagus?&quot;</string>
<string name="105568">&quot;What do you mean, &apos;Almost Free&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="105569">&quot;Drearing&apos;s Deep?&quot;</string>
<string name="105570">&quot;What do you mean, &apos;Almost Free&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="105571">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105572">&quot;How can I help?&quot;</string>
<string name="105573">&quot;What a horrible existence!&quot;</string>
<string name="105574">&quot;Why don&apos;t you rise up and overthrow them?&quot;</string>
<string name="105575">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105576">&quot;What are you going to do now?&quot;</string>
<string name="105577">&quot;What, you think I did it for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105578">&quot;You&apos;re welcome. I&apos;m grateful for the chance to help.&quot;</string>
<string name="105579">&quot;May the High Priest come to fear you as much as we have feared him.&quot;</string>
<string name="105580">The man eyes you with a mixture of fear and reverence. &quot;Godkiller...&quot;</string>
<string name="105581">&quot;Yes, Vix&apos;thra is dead but his priesthood is not. All you have done is bring High Priest Sodalis&apos;s wrath upon us. Drearing&apos;s Deep will run with our blood, thanks to your folly!&quot;</string>
<string name="105582">&quot;Faced with the High Priest&apos;s anger, death by your hand would be a kindness! Do you not see? Without your help we are dead already! He&apos;ll paint the temple with our blood!&quot;</string>
<string name="105583">&quot;Free? What do you know of freedom? Even now, the priests plot their vengeance! Drearing&apos;s Deep will run with our blood, thanks to your folly!&quot;</string>
<string name="105584">&quot;If you will not face him, then we are doomed. I curse you in all the tongues of my many masters!&quot; The man spits into the shadows and leaves you to your thoughts.</string>
<string name="105585">&quot;Please, what have we to even give you? If you had reasons to destroy a god, surely the same reasons must compel you against its priesthood!&quot;</string>
<string name="105586">The man nods his gratitude. &quot;Then let blood be spilled...&quot;</string>
<string name="105587">&quot;Vix&apos;thra must be destroyed. Maybe a way can be found in High Priest Sodalis&apos;s writings.&quot;</string>
<string name="105588">The man eyes you with a mixture of fear and reverence. &quot;I hear you took care of High Priest Sodalis for us...&quot;</string>
<string name="105589">&quot;Yes, the High Priest is dead but Vix&apos;thra is not. All you have done is bring Vix&apos;thra&apos;s wrath upon us...&quot;</string>
<string name="105590">&quot;True. If you had done it in our name, you wouldn&apos;t have stopped with the High Priest. All you have done is bring Vix&apos;thra&apos;s wrath upon us!&quot;</string>
<string name="105591">&quot;Free? What do you know of freedom? All you have done is bring Vix&apos;thra&apos;s wrath upon us!&quot;</string>
<string name="105592">&quot;If you will not face him, then we are doomed. I curse you in all the tongues of my many masters!&quot; The man spits into the shadows and leaves you to your thoughts.</string>
<string name="105593">&quot;Please, what have we to even give you? If you had reasons to destroy a priesthood, surely the same reasons must compel you against their god!&quot;</string>
<string name="105594">&quot;Not by jawing with the likes of me. If anyone would have known, it would have been High Priest Sodalis. With him dead, I suggest you look through his writings.&quot;</string>
<string name="105595">&quot;With Vix&apos;thra and the cult gone, some of us have been talking about turning the temple into a town hall. Maybe we can even elect a proper council.&quot;</string>
<string name="105596">The man&apos;s eyes dart about skittishly. He clearly seems uncomfortable to still be talking to you. &quot;I have to be going. Please, you must understand...&quot;</string>
<string name="105597">Pale eyes peer out of a dirty face, darting nervously to either side as you approach. &quot;You mustn&apos;t come here,&quot; he whispers.</string>
<string name="105598">The man grows sullen. &quot;Who isn&apos;t?&quot; he mutters. &quot;But they protect us, too. Better them than the damned illithids... Still, one can&apos;t help wishing that there was no priests, no temple.&quot;</string>
<string name="105599">The man looks at you in horror, his face suddenly blanched beneath the dirt. &quot;No! I beg you, ring the gong and choose another!&quot; With that, he flees.</string>
<string name="105600">The man&apos;s eyes widen in shock but he quickly averts them toward your feet. &quot;No, no, that was never my intent. Vix&apos;thra loves us. Vix&apos;thra protects us. Under Vix&apos;thra we are free.&quot;</string>
<string name="105601">The man&apos;s eyes well up with tears of gratitude which he quickly wipes away with a grubby sleeve. &quot;There&apos;d be some who&apos;d be glad of that, though you didn&apos;t hear that from me.&quot;</string>
<string name="105602">&quot;Who told you about that!? One of the womenfolk? The Ceremony is the priests&apos; doing. It&apos;s Vix&apos;thra&apos;s work. Now don&apos;t you go scaring half the village by talking about it, understand?&quot;</string>
<string name="105603">&quot;We slaves are drawn to freedom like moths to light. Everything has a price, you see, everything a price.&quot; The man spits angrily into gloom, his fingers tracing some warding pattern over his chest.</string>
<string name="105604">The man gestures at the squalid hovels. &quot;Drearing&apos;s Deep, home of the free... One by one, it claims us all.&quot;</string>
<string name="105605">His pale eyes blink in the gloom. &quot;Things aren&apos;t as they seem, stranger.&quot; The man&apos;s raspy voice sends a chill down your spine. &quot;You shouldn&apos;t have come here.&quot;</string>
<string name="105606">The man flinches at your question, his eyes darting to the shadows. &quot;Hush,&quot; he warns. &quot;Ask the priests, ask Vix&apos;thra. Don&apos;t waste your time on a freed slave like me.&quot;</string>
<string name="105607">&quot;I was a slave but I&apos;m free now. We&apos;re all free here in Drearing&apos;s Deep.&quot; The man&apos;s voice lacks conviction. &quot;All thanks to Vix&apos;thra, that is.&quot;</string>
<string name="105608">The man holds his hands out, smeared with grime. &quot;Who didn&apos;t? I&apos;ve been traded from the drow to the illithids and back again. Some of us even served the beholders. The drow steal us from the surface as children.&quot;</string>
<string name="105609">&quot;The Underdark is a dangerous place, especially for a pack of escaped slaves... The priests say Vix&apos;thra watches over us, keeps us safe. It&apos;s best not to argue with the priests, best not to ask questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105610">GENERIC MALE VILLAGER OF DREARING&apos;S DEEP. MULTIPLES EXIST. INFO-GIVER.</string>
<string name="105611">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105612">&quot;Vix&apos;thra is no more. Leave it at that.&quot;</string>
<string name="105613">&quot;Mind your words or I&apos;ll kill you, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="105614">&quot;Yes, I destroyed Vix&apos;thra. You&apos;re all free now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105615">&quot;Look, I did my part. High Priest Sodalis is yours to deal with.&quot;</string>
<string name="105616">&quot;And it serves you right. What good have you done me, anyway?&quot;</string>
<string name="105617">&quot;If blood will be spilled, it will be that of High Priest Sodalis.&quot;</string>
<string name="105618">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105619">&quot;The High Priest is dead. Leave it at that.&quot;</string>
<string name="105620">&quot;Hmph. I did it for my reasons, not yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="105621">&quot;Yes, Drearing&apos;s Deep is free now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105622">&quot;Look, I did my part. Vix&apos;thra&apos;s yours to deal with.&quot;</string>
<string name="105623">&quot;And it serves you right. What good have you done me, anyway?&quot;</string>
<string name="105624">&quot;And how do you propose I kill a god?&quot;</string>
<string name="105625">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105626">&quot;You&apos;re scared of the priests, aren&apos;t you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105627">&quot;Heretic! I should turn you over to the priests myself!&quot;</string>
<string name="105628">&quot;You shouldn&apos;t speak ill of the church...&quot;</string>
<string name="105629">&quot;I think that could be arranged.&quot;</string>
<string name="105630">&quot;How does a Ceremony get called?&quot;</string>
<string name="105631">&quot;Why do you say I shouldn&apos;t come here?&quot;</string>
<string name="105632">&quot;Why? What price is placed on freedom?&quot;</string>
<string name="105633">&quot;What is this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="105634">&quot;What do you mean, it claims you all?&quot;</string>
<string name="105635">&quot;You seem nervous...&quot;</string>
<string name="105636">&quot;What isn&apos;t as it seems?&quot;</string>
<string name="105637">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105638">&quot;Who enslaved you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105639">&quot;Vix&apos;thra?&quot;</string>
<string name="105640">A squat duergar with a bulbous nose and a bad leg sizes you up. &quot;Bric-a-brac,&quot; she barks. &quot;Things we scrounged, things we stole, things we cobbled together from the rest. Good prices for better customers!&quot;</string>
<string name="105641">&quot;Maybe I am, maybe I&apos;m not. You don&apos;t find me loitering around the temple, though, do you. Read into that what you will. All I can say is that plenty of the locals are and maybe they have reason.&quot;</string>
<string name="105642">&quot;The Ceremony? Aye, I&apos;ve seen it while I&apos;ve been here. It starts with someone ringing the gong that stands behind the temple and it ends with someone being led away, all in tears, through the temple doors.&quot;</string>
<string name="105643">&quot;Lemme see, there&apos;s me, you, the priests, and a pile of former slaves scared out of their wits and not quite sure what to do with themselves. So yes, &apos;odd folk&apos; don&apos;t even half start to describe it.&quot;</string>
<string name="105644">&quot;Questions, questions, always questions. Are you sure you don&apos;t want to buy something?&quot;</string>
<string name="105645">&quot;Well, the occasional slave master wanders in, demanding the return of his property. I saw a party of drow leading away a chain of bone creatures the other night. Oh, and there&apos;s Vix&apos;thra, too, I suppose.&quot;</string>
<string name="105646">&quot;That&apos;s the one the priests worship. Never seen him, not sure if there&apos;s anything to be seen, but you can sure feel a presence about this place, a constriction of the throat. The locals say that&apos;s Vix&apos;thra.&quot;</string>
<string name="105647">&quot;What kind of bone creatures do the drow ever have? I don&apos;t know. Big! Made of bones! Maybe they came with the drow in the first place, maybe they didn&apos;t, who&apos;s to say? None of my business.&quot;</string>
<string name="105648">&quot;Not much to say, really. The slave masters storm in, the slaves scatter to the shadows, the priests bring the slave masters into the temple and, every now and then, one might be important enough to be allowed to leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="105649">&quot;Call them what you will. To me, the priests seem just another kind of master. Go on, wander the streets, see the people through an honest eye. You&apos;ll see.&quot;</string>
<string name="105650">&quot;Somber bunch, they are. A lot of purple robes, bones, skulls, you know the type. Been building their flock by helping slaves break free or, more often, just paying off the masters. Seems they have the money for it.&quot;</string>
<string name="105651">&quot;Depends on the slaves, really. Steal slaves from the drow and you&apos;ve made them your enemy. Pay the drow handsomely for their slaves and you&apos;ve made them your friend.&quot;</string>
<string name="105652">&quot;Seems to come and go but, right now, it seems to be the illithids sending war parties and the drow sending diplomats. Read into that what you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="105653">&quot;Me? I&apos;m a ragpicker, garbage-seller, haggle-tooth, you name it. Not from here. Not from anywhere, really. You&apos;re not getting my real name, though. Name-giving scares the locals, drives off business.&quot;</string>
<string name="105654">&quot;Superstitious lot, them. It&apos;s just a name, I figure, but it&apos;s just a coin, too, you get my meaning. Anyhow, they just call me Ragpicker and you might as well do the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="105655">&quot;Hrmph! Everybody wants an honest merchant, ain&apos;t that what they say? Well, you&apos;re looking at her. I buy low, sell high, and if it&apos;s broken, don&apos;t look at me. Now do you want something or not?&quot;</string>
<string name="105656">FEMALE DUERGAR MERCHANT OF DREARING&apos;S DEEP. INFO-GIVER. STORE.</string>
<string name="105657">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105658">&quot;You&apos;re scared of the priests, aren&apos;t you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105659">&quot;How does a Ceremony get called?&quot;</string>
<string name="105660">&quot;This town has some odd folk, doesn&apos;t it...&quot;</string>
<string name="105661">&quot;Now, about my other questions...&quot;</string>
<string name="105662">&quot;Is there anyone else around here?&quot;</string>
<string name="105663">&quot;Vix&apos;thra?&quot;</string>
<string name="105664">&quot;What kind of bone creatures did the drow have?&quot;</string>
<string name="105665">&quot;Tell me about the slave masters.&quot;</string>
<string name="105666">&quot;This town&apos;s built of former slaves, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="105667">&quot;What can you tell me about the priests?&quot;</string>
<string name="105668">&quot;Do they have any enemies? Friends?&quot;</string>
<string name="105669">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105670">&quot;The people here are scared of names?&quot;</string>
<string name="105671">&quot;You&apos;re not very good at... marketing, are you...&quot;</string>
<string name="105672">&lt;StartAction&gt;[View Store.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105673">The priest&apos;s features are pale and gaunt within the shadows of his purplish cowl. &quot;Vix&apos;thra protect you,&quot; he intones.</string>
<string name="105674">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The priest dodges your clumsy hands and shouts for help. You can hear the temple door creak open as two more priests emerge, weapons raised.</string>
<string name="105675">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s over in an instant and the priest&apos;s lifeless body slumps to the ground. Shocked, the second priest attacks.</string>
<string name="105676">&quot;If a master beats his dog when it is still a pup, that dog will fear the world even long after its master&apos;s death. So it is with former slaves.&quot;</string>
<string name="105677">&quot;They have come from cruel masters into the kind shelter of Vix&apos;thra&apos;s blessing yet, even here, they will forever be afraid. By Vix&apos;thra&apos;s will, I freed many of these slaves myself but I expect no gratitude.&quot;</string>
<string name="105678">A smile creeps across the priest&apos;s pale lips. &quot;The Ceremony shows Vix&apos;thra that his followers are firm in their faith. The temple holds one every month but the villagers have been known to call their own when they have need.&quot;</string>
<string name="105679">&quot;If you wish to call a Ceremony, simply ring the gong in the courtyard behind the temple and the village will assemble. It is through the Ceremony that Vix&apos;thra protects you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105680">&quot;I apologize but the temple is holy to us. Only members of the priesthood or those who have important business with the order may enter.&quot;</string>
<string name="105681">The priest is becoming irritable but he does his best to smile. &quot;As you wish. It is Vix&apos;thra&apos;s will that I serve you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105682">&quot;You may worship him as all the others of the village do. Bless each other with his name and, if you have need of him, the gong behind the temple is always available to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105683">&quot;High Priest Sodalis is a very busy man and he grows busier by the day. I&apos;m afraid he is only available for important ceremonial events.&quot;</string>
<string name="105684">&quot;What services we offer, you may have through me. There is no need for you to pass through these doors.&quot;</string>
<string name="105685">He nods, his gaze solemn. &quot;Vix&apos;thra the White, Vix&apos;thra the Wise, the Sage Protector, the Freer of Slaves. All who know Vix&apos;thra&apos;s greatness tremble before him in worship.&quot;</string>
<string name="105686">MALE PRIEST GUARDING TEMPLE DOOR. 2 EXIST. THEY HOLD THE DOOR KEY AND GO HOSTILE ON ANY PICK OR BASH ATTEMPT. DESTROY THEM ON DEATH OF VIX&apos;THRA.</string>
<string name="105687">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105688">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Dexterity]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Snap the priest&apos;s neck.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105689">&quot;Why are the villagers afraid of you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105690">&quot;How does a Ceremony get called?&quot;</string>
<string name="105691">&quot;I wish to enter the temple.&quot;</string>
<string name="105692">&quot;Back to my other questions...&quot;</string>
<string name="105693">&quot;If I cannot enter, how may I worship Vix&apos;thra?&quot;</string>
<string name="105694">&quot;I wish to speak with your leader.&quot;</string>
<string name="105695">&quot;Do you not offer any services?&quot;</string>
<string name="105696">&quot;Vix&apos;thra?&quot;</string>
<string name="105697">&lt;StartAction&gt;[View Store.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105698">&quot;High Priest Sodalis grows more wrathful by the moment. Please, find him in his temple and free us from his anger.&quot;</string>
<string name="105699">The woman draws you into the shadows. &quot;Is it true? Vix&apos;thra is dead?&quot;</string>
<string name="105700">&quot;The menfolk say High Priest Sodalis is gathering his priests in the temple. They are plotting to take their vengeance upon us but I pray you find it in yourself to stop them.&quot;</string>
<string name="105701">&quot;Do the lives of slaves mean so little to you? High Priest Sodalis has gathered his priests in the temple to plot his vengeance against us. You killed his god! Do you not see this?&quot;</string>
<string name="105702">&quot;The menfolk say High Priest Sodalis has gathered his priests in the temple and is plotting to take vengeance on us...&quot;</string>
<string name="105703">&quot;What about us? This is our home! High Priest Sodalis will kill us all!&quot; She turns from you, fleeing into the darkness.</string>
<string name="105704">&quot;Drearing&apos;s Deep will be forever in your debt. Quickly, then, to the temple before they emerge.&quot;</string>
<string name="105705">Drawing her filthy rags close about here, the woman buckles and begins to weep.</string>
<string name="105706">&quot;Please, save us from Vix&apos;thra&apos;s wrath. High Priest Sodalis&apos;s writings must hold some means of reaching his god.&quot;</string>
<string name="105707">The woman seems more confident now, no longer clinging to the secrecy of the shadows. &quot;High Priest Sodalis be dead, I hear, and his priests with him.&quot;</string>
<string name="105708">&quot;I had hoped,&quot; she says with a shy smile that slowly turns to ice. &quot;Do we mean nothing to you? Is that to be a part of Vix&apos;thra&apos;s curse as well?&quot;</string>
<string name="105709">&quot;I used to think the Ceremonies were everything, that if only the Ceremonies could be ended then I wouldn&apos;t ever be scared again. But even now, I can feel Vix&apos;thra&apos;s presence lingering here, growing stronger, growing angry...&quot;</string>
<string name="105710">&quot;You&apos;ve brought a curse upon us, that&apos;s all you&apos;ve done. Aye, the Ceremonies might be done but, without them, who will keep us safe? If Vix&apos;thra doesn&apos;t destroy us, our former masters will!&quot;</string>
<string name="105711">Drawing her filthy rags close about here, the woman buckles and begins to weep.</string>
<string name="105712">&quot;We&apos;ve always been slaves! Even under the freedom offered us here in Drearing&apos;s Deep, we were slaves to the whim of Vix&apos;thra! The High Priest is dead but nothing has changed, don&apos;t you see?&quot;</string>
<string name="105713">&quot;Vix&apos;thra must be destroyed. Please, we are so close to finding our freedom! Surely High Priest Sodalis must have provided some indication of Vix&apos;thra&apos;s nature in his writings.&quot;</string>
<string name="105714">&quot;No more sons and daughters and parents and friends lost to the Ceremony... We can even speak our names now. It&apos;s like finding our freedom all over again.&quot;</string>
<string name="105715">The woman seems uncomfortable to be talking to you for so long. &quot;I mustn&apos;t be seen with you. Please, you must understand...&quot;</string>
<string name="105716">The woman clings to the shadows, her voice hesitant and small. &quot;What you be wanting with the likes of us?&quot;</string>
<string name="105717">The woman grows quiet, peering deep into the shadows. &quot;The priests keep to themselves, except for the picking or the freeing of more slaves... Even the menfolk are scared of them.&quot;</string>
<string name="105718">The woman shifts nervously. &quot;The priests ring the gong out behind the temple and everyone from the village gathers for the picking. Sometimes one of us rings the gong, too, if we think there&apos;s need for it.&quot;</string>
<string name="105719">&quot;But if the gong&apos;s rung, the picking has to happen. The gods have heard the ringing and won&apos;t leave without their price. Once a little boy rang it three times and would&apos;ve rang it more if he hadn&apos;t been the one picked.&quot;</string>
<string name="105720">&quot;I kept chickens once, before I was captured and sold into the Underdark. There was a saying that the hen that does the picking rules the roost. It ain&apos;t no different here...&quot; </string>
<string name="105721">&quot;High Priest Sodalis does the picking here. His be the only name spoken in Drearing&apos;s Deep because he who does the picking don&apos;t never get picked.&quot;</string>
<string name="105722">Her voice drops to a low whisper. &quot;It&apos;s just bad luck, an ill omen. If you give someone your name, you&apos;ll be the next one picked. Everybody just knows that.&quot;</string>
<string name="105723">Her gaze drifts over the ill-constructed buildings. &quot;Drearing&apos;s Deep, home of the free... We were all slaves, once.&quot;</string>
<string name="105724">A ghastly smile flits across the woman&apos;s face. &quot;I was a pleasure slave to an illithid, once. And I sang in a cage for the drow. A traveling priest helped me escape, brought me here to Drearing&apos;s Deep.&quot;</string>
<string name="105725">&quot;Yes I do,&quot; she whispers. &quot;We all do.&quot;</string>
<string name="105726">&quot;The Ceremony... It&apos;s to protect us! One be picked so the rest can be safe. It&apos;s being held more and more often now. There be trouble in the world, see? Drow, undead, illithids... The Ceremony&apos;s what keeps us safe.&quot;</string>
<string name="105727">The woman shakes her head and retreats further into the darkness. &quot;We don&apos;t use names here. They say if you give someone your name, you&apos;ll be the next one picked...&quot;</string>
<string name="105728">Her voice drops to a low whisper. &quot;Why everybody... It&apos;s just bad luck, an ill omen. If you give someone your name, you&apos;ll be the next one picked. Everybody just knows that.&quot;</string>
<string name="105729">The woman recoils in shock, her fingers making a hasty warding gesture across her chest. &quot;You&apos;d best pray there be no Ceremony, &lt;FullName&gt;...&quot; </string>
<string name="105730">&quot;The Ceremony... It&apos;s to protect us! One be picked so the rest can be safe. It&apos;s being held more and more often now. There be trouble in the world, see? Drow, undead, illithids... The Ceremony&apos;s what keeps us safe.&quot;</string>
<string name="105731">GENERIC FEMALE VILLAGER OF DREARING&apos;S DEEP. MULTIPLES EXIST. INFO-GIVER.</string>
<string name="105732">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105733">&quot;Yes, and what about his priesthood.&quot;</string>
<string name="105734">&quot;Think what you wish. What do I care?&quot;</string>
<string name="105735">&quot;Vix&apos;thra was always dead. But yes, he is no more.&quot;</string>
<string name="105736">&quot;Look, I got what I came for and I&apos;m going home.&quot;</string>
<string name="105737">&quot;Any vengeance will be mine. They die tonight.&quot;</string>
<string name="105738">&quot;Then you&apos;d best do something about that, hadn&apos;t you...&quot;</string>
<string name="105739">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105740">&quot;Ha. Do you think I did it to please you?&quot;</string>
<string name="105741">&quot;It&apos;s true, but the god he worshiped remains.&quot;</string>
<string name="105742">&quot;Yes, no more Ceremonies for Drearing&apos;s Deep.&quot;</string>
<string name="105743">&quot;Hey, I freed you from the High Priest. You handle the rest.&quot;</string>
<string name="105744">&quot;If you don&apos;t like it, then go back to being slaves!&quot;</string>
<string name="105745">&quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="105746">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="105747">&quot;You&apos;re scared of the priests, aren&apos;t you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105748">&quot;Picking?&quot;</string>
<string name="105749">&quot;How does a Ceremony get called?&quot;</string>
<string name="105750">&quot;Who runs this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="105751">&quot;And who does the picking?&quot;</string>
<string name="105752">&quot;Why is his name the only one spoken?&quot;</string>
<string name="105753">&quot;Picked for what?&quot;</string>
<string name="105754">&quot;Can you tell me a little about this village?&quot;</string>
<string name="105755">&quot;Slaves?&quot;</string>
<string name="105756">&quot;It&apos;s all right. You have nothing to worry about.&quot;</string>
<string name="105757">&quot;What do you have to worry about?&quot;</string>
<string name="105758">&quot;Do you have a name?&quot;</string>
<string name="105759">&quot;Who says you shouldn&apos;t give names?&quot;</string>
<string name="105760">&quot;Well my name&apos;s &lt;FullName&gt;. Now how hard was that?&quot;</string>
<string name="105761">&quot;What do you mean, &apos;next one picked&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="105762">&quot;I guess I could answer a few questions for you. Can&apos;t see any harm in it. Besides, it&apos;s not like the Maker&apos;s golems here on the island will tell you anything.&quot; She smiles briefly at her own joke.</string>
<string name="105763">&quot;Well, the island was named after the ancient duergar mage who built his stronghold here centuries ago. They say the Maker came here so he could work in peace while perfecting his golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="105764">&quot;There must be some truth to these stories. There&apos;s some ruins to the north that could have been the Maker&apos;s laboratory, though all that&apos;s left is the dungeon. And there&apos;s the golems, of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="105765">&quot;The dungeon at the north end of the island is crawling with golems. At least, the first floor of it is. We don&apos;t go any deeper. We figure they&apos;re guardians left over from the Maker. &quot;</string>
<string name="105766">&quot;They must have been built to protect against thieves and scavengers.&quot; She gives you a rueful look. &quot;They do a pretty good job, too. We&apos;ve lost more than a few duergar during our expeditions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105767">She shakes her head. &quot;Not possible. There&apos;s some kind of scavenger golem in there that repairs and rebuilds any golems we manage to take down.&quot;  </string>
<string name="105768">&quot;We&apos;ve tried to kill the scavenger, but it&apos;s got a number of magical defenses. Every time we attack it, it teleports away to safety. That damn thing makes our job a lot tougher.&quot;</string>
<string name="105769">&quot;Everything I know about the Maker comes from legends and myths. They say he was a powerful duergar sorcerer who isolated himself on this island to work on his research.&quot;</string>
<string name="105770">&quot;His specialty was crafting golems. According to the legends, he found a way to imbue his constructs with intelligence and free will. But the golems we&apos;ve run into seem pretty standard to me.&quot; </string>
<string name="105771">&quot;Nobody really knows; he disappeared five centuries ago. Most people think he was killed off by his own creations: intelligent golems with a will of their own.&quot;</string>
<string name="105772">&quot;I don&apos;t know if I really believe that, but it makes a good story. The only golems we&apos;ve run across in the dungeon don&apos;t seem all that smart to me. Damn tough to kill, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="105773">This duergar female looks you up and down, gauging your strength and trying to judge if you are a threat. Satisfied that you pose no immediate harm, she seems to relax slightly.</string>
<string name="105774">The duergar raise their weapons, but at a signal from their leader they hold their ground. She gives you a quick once over, evaluating you as a potential threat.</string>
<string name="105775">&quot;If this is a joke, you picked the wrong group to play games with. We&apos;re not looking for a fight, but we&apos;re well armed and we will defend ourselves.&quot;</string>
<string name="105776">&quot;You should&apos;ve picked an easier target! Attack!&quot;</string>
<string name="105777">She nods. &quot;Fair enough. As long as you aren&apos;t here to cause trouble for us, you can keep your secrets. My name is Dahanna. I&apos;m the leader of this expedition.&quot;</string>
<string name="105778">The duergar visibly relaxes, though she is still studying you carefully as she addresses you once more. &quot;My name is Dahanna. I&apos;m the leader of this expedition.&quot;</string>
<string name="105779">&quot;Come and go as you please, surfacer. You don&apos;t answer to us.&quot;</string>
<string name="105780">She nods thoughtfully. &quot;The Valsharess. I&apos;ve heard about her. One of the drow matron mothers, isn&apos;t she? She&apos;s made quite a name for herself recently.&quot;</string>
<string name="105781">&quot;I hear she&apos;s been attacking the surface... I guess that&apos;s why you&apos;re looking to stop her. But you won&apos;t find any help against her here. If the drow don&apos;t bother us, we don&apos;t bother them.&quot;</string>
<string name="105782">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna shakes her head slowly. &quot;I don&apos;t want trouble with you, surfacer. But you bullying us won&apos;t make us join you. Our minds are set; you can&apos;t change them.&quot;</string>
<string name="105783">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna shrugs. &quot;Maybe. But the Valsharess isn&apos;t the first drow we&apos;ve seen rise to power. Most of them get toppled long before they ever turn their attention to us.&quot;</string>
<string name="105784">&quot;We&apos;re treasure hunters. Centuries ago, this island was home to a powerful duergar wizard known as the Maker, or so the stories go. The Maker&apos;s long gone, but he left a few things behind.&quot; </string>
<string name="105785">&quot;We come out here to salvage rare metal and pieces of golems from the ruins of the Maker&apos;s tower. You&apos;d be surprised what the right buyer will pay for an arm made of pure adamantine.&quot;</string>
<string name="105786">She grins. &quot;But it isn&apos;t easy. Not too many expeditions come here anymore. There&apos;s still some good metal to be found, but you have to be willing to go toe-to-toe with the Maker&apos;s golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="105787">&quot;As usual, the duergar are scavengers, living off the scraps of others.&quot;</string>
<string name="105788">&quot;Better watch your tongue, drow! This is duergar territory. Your arrogance might have cost you more than you&apos;re willing to pay.&quot;</string>
<string name="105789">Dahanna and the other duergar approach you. You notice their weapons are drawn and that they have packed up their camp. Dahanna appears uncomfortable, as if she is ashamed of what is about to happen. </string>
<string name="105790">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna smiles. &quot;You&apos;re &lt;race&gt; lies don&apos;t fool me. You were in there far too long to come out empty handed. Now, give us what&apos;s rightfully ours.&quot;</string>
<string name="105791">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna cocks her head to the side, considering your words. &quot;You seem sincere. I can&apos;t say for sure whether you&apos;re lying or not,&quot; she finally admits. </string>
<string name="105792">There&apos;s some angry grumbling from the other soldiers, but she cuts them off with a sharp gesture. &quot;I&apos;m not going to let this come to bloodshed only to find out we were fighting over nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="105793">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;We&apos;ve held our own against the Maker&apos;s golems. I think we can manage against a &lt;race&gt; surfacer like you. We&apos;ll fight for what is rightfully ours.&quot;</string>
<string name="105794">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna studies you closely, then seems to come to a decision. &quot;You&apos;re probably right, surfacer. We&apos;re not willing to throw our lives away.&quot;</string>
<string name="105795">&quot;You&apos;ve gone deeper into the Maker&apos;s dungeon than we ever did, and you&apos;ve come back to tell the tale. We&apos;d be foolish to go up against you, even as desperate as we are.&quot;</string>
<string name="105796">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;We&apos;ve been working this island for twenty years, and we&apos;ve lost our fair share of duergar. We&apos;ve paid our dues... you owe us something!&quot;</string>
<string name="105797">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Maybe... maybe you&apos;re right, surfacer. We aren&apos;t thieves, we earn our living honestly.&quot; There is some angry grumbling from the soldiers, but Dahanna cuts them off with a single gesture.</string>
<string name="105798">The leader of the duergar shakes her head. &quot;I&apos;m sorry for this. But  we count on these expeditions to survive. Each time we come back, we find less and less good metal. We are growing desperate.&quot;</string>
<string name="105799">Dahanna looks at you with obvious disbelief, though she takes the offered coins. &quot;You would do this for us, after what just happened? You are more forgiving than we duergar, surfacer.&quot;</string>
<string name="105800">She smiles. &quot;Thank you for this gift. Our expedition here is over now, we&apos;re heading back to our homes and our families. It will be nice to return with a few extra coins.&quot;</string>
<string name="105801">&quot;Our expedition here is over now, surfacer. We&apos;re heading back to our homes and our families.&quot;</string>
<string name="105802">&quot;I can&apos;t honestly say whether we will come back to this island again. In any case, we wish you luck, surfacer. Remember: the Underdark is a dangerous place.&quot;</string>
<string name="105803">She nods. &quot;Maybe you&apos;re right. Perhaps the rewards here are no longer worth the risks. There are other places we can go, places far less dangerous than this island.&quot;</string>
<string name="105804">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna considers your counter offer carefully, calculating the chances of her group against you. Finally she shakes her head.</string>
<string name="105805">&quot;One thousand gold won&apos;t go very far, split between all of us. I think we&apos;ve earned the right to at least 10,000, considering you&apos;re poaching our claim here.&quot;</string>
<string name="105806">Dahanna sighs. &quot;I was hoping it wouldn&apos;t come to this, but I can see you aren&apos;t being reasonable. Attack!&quot;</string>
<string name="105807">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; Dahanna considers your counter offer carefully, calculating the chances of her group against you. Finally, she nods in acceptance. </string>
<string name="105808">The soldiers behind Dahanna begin to murmur excitedly, but she cuts them off with a sharp hand gesture. She takes the offered coins and says, &quot;I&apos;m glad this was done without bloodshed.&quot;</string>
<string name="105809">&quot;A polite thief is still a thief. Being courteous doesn&apos;t make this right.&quot;</string>
<string name="105810">&quot;Well, at least you is polite... for a thief.&quot;</string>
<string name="105811">&quot;Well, at least you&apos;re being courteous while you rob us. That&apos;s more than I expected from your kind.&quot;</string>
<string name="105812">Nathyrra spits on the ground. &quot;You would bargain with this hargluk?&quot; </string>
<string name="105813">Dahanna ignores her. &quot;If you give us 10,000 gold pieces, we&apos;ll let you go on your way without any trouble. If not, we&apos;ll take what&apos;s rightfully ours by force.&quot;</string>
<string name="105814">&quot;Nothing personal? That&apos;s funny. When a pack of armed thugs points their weapons at me, I tend to take it *very* personally.&quot;</string>
<string name="105815">&quot;Look, Boss! Them duergar is coming to give us a welcome back surprise party... uh, wait. Deekin not thinks this a party after all. Too bad. Deekin wants cake.&quot;</string>
<string name="105816">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105817">&quot;Tell me more about the island.&quot;</string>
<string name="105818">&quot;Tell me about the golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="105819">&quot;I would&apos;ve thought you&apos;d cleared all the golems out by now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105820">&quot;Tell me about the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="105821">&quot;What happened to him?&quot;</string>
<string name="105822">&quot;Friend or foe? Uh... I guess I&apos;ll pick foe!&quot;</string>
<string name="105823">&quot;It&apos;s no joke. I just want to slaughter you all. I&apos;m funny that way.&quot;</string>
<string name="105824">&quot;Calm down. I&apos;m not looking for a fight, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="105825">&quot;My name and business are my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="105826">&quot;My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. I don&apos;t mean any harm.&quot;</string>
<string name="105827">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105828">&quot;Time for this to get bloody. Die, you Underdark excuse for a dwarf!&quot;</string>
<string name="105829">&quot;I&apos;m looking for allies to help me against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105830">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Persuade: Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You&apos;re either with me or against me. Think about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="105831">&quot;I gave you a chance. Now you&apos;ll pay the price!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105832">&quot;Fine. I want to ask you something else then.&quot;</string>
<string name="105833">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Eventually the Valsharess will turn her army against the duergar, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="105834">&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</string>
<string name="105835">&quot;I have some other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105836">&quot;Relax. We&apos;ll just be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105837">&quot;Settle down. We just want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105838">&quot;Nobody threatens me! Death to the duergar!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105839">&quot;Is this some kind of shake down?&quot;</string>
<string name="105840">&quot;Your island? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="105841">&quot;I think I see where this is going...&quot;</string>
<string name="105842">&quot;Maybe we could work out a deal.&quot;</string>
<string name="105843">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade:Bluff&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I didn&apos;t find anything worthwhile. You&apos;ve picked this place clean.&quot;</string>
<string name="105844">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade: Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Careful now. This may be more than you can handle.&quot;</string>
<string name="105845">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You have no right to my stuff. I did all the work!&quot;</string>
<string name="105846">&quot;Apology *not* accepted! You&apos;ll pay for this with blood!&quot;</string>
<string name="105847">&quot;Sounds like times are tough. Here&apos;s a thousand gold to help you out.&quot;</string>
<string name="105848">&quot;That&apos;s okay. There&apos;s no hard feelings.&quot;</string>
<string name="105849">&quot;Maybe it&apos;s time you moved on to somewhere else.&quot;</string>
<string name="105850">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;ll give you a thousand gold... no more.&quot;</string>
<string name="105851">No deal.</string>
<string name="105852">Here&apos;s the 10,000 gold.</string>
<string name="105853">Dahanna&apos;s the leader of our expedition. You should be speaking to her.</string>
<string name="105854">Watch out for them golems to the north. They&apos;re mighty hard to kill.</string>
<string name="105855">Speak to Dahanna if you have any questions.</string>
<string name="105856">We don&apos;t see many like you down here, surfacer.</string>
<string name="105857">Laz Zand !</string>
<string name="105858">The old duergar nods at you by way of greeting. &quot;Back again, surfacer? You interested in buying something, or is there something else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="105859">This duergar is obviously older than the others here. At your approach, he stops shuffling through the items piled around him and turns to greet you.</string>
<string name="105860">&quot;Say, you&apos;re from the surface, ain&apos;t you? One of them &lt;race&gt; folk. I remember running into your kind once before. Must be fifty... no, sixty years ago. But I ain&apos;t see any since.&quot;</string>
<string name="105861">&quot;My name&apos;s Dwelver, supply master for this here expedition. I&apos;m also in charge of the merchant end of things. In other words, if you want to buy something, I&apos;m the one to talk to.&quot;</string>
<string name="105862">&quot;Okay then. Maybe I&apos;ll see you around later. Remember, if you&apos;re interested in buying any of our salvage, come talk to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="105863">&quot;Of course. We&apos;re just going to haul this stuff back home and sell it anyway, so you might as well lighten our load before we go.&quot;</string>
<string name="105864">&quot;You&apos;d probably have better luck talking with Dahanna; I&apos;m just the supply master here. But I&apos;ll try and answer whatever I can.&quot;</string>
<string name="105865">&quot;No, can&apos;t say I do. But you might want to ask Dahanna about that. She&apos;s the one in charge... I just look after our supplies.&quot;</string>
<string name="105866">&quot;Only what the legends say. This used to be home to a powerful duergar wizard known as the Maker. He disappeared long ago, but he left behind his dungeon laboratory. And his golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="105867">&quot;Huh. I thought Dahanna would have explained this to you. We&apos;re here to collect salvage. There&apos;s plenty of good metal to be found in the dungeon on the north side of the isle.&quot;</string>
<string name="105868">&quot;We take whatever we can carry and bring it back home to sell to the highest bidder. Wouldn&apos;t be a bad job if it wasn&apos;t for the golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="105869">&quot;Sure, the dungeon to the north is crawling with them. Left over creations of the wizard who used to rule this island, still defending what&apos;s left of his home.&quot;</string>
<string name="105870">&quot;If you want to know more about the golems, you should really talk to Dahanna.&quot;</string>
<string name="105871">&quot;That&apos;s all for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105872">&quot;Let me look at your supplies.&quot;</string>
<string name="105873">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105874">&quot;Do you know anything about a drow matron called the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="105875">&quot;What can you tell me about this island?&quot;</string>
<string name="105876">&quot;Why are all you duergar here?&quot;</string>
<string name="105877">&quot;Golems?&quot;</string>
<string name="105878">This rat is busy gnawing at some long dead remains.</string>
<string name="105879">The rat ignores you, intent on devouring its fill of the meal in front of it.</string>
<string name="105880">You get an image of the rat&apos;s lair, a secret hiding place among the garbage of the west wall. You sense other images as well; other secrets hidden away near the garbage.</string>
<string name="105881">The rat ignores your request. It is too focused on devouring the meal in front of it.</string>
<string name="105882">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the rat alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105883">&lt;StartAction&gt;Look deeper into the rat&apos;s mind.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105884">&lt;StartAction&gt;Convince the rat to show you the hidden secrets.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105885">Sinth Thesti!</string>
<string name="105886">The scribing on this stone has long been erased by the passage of time. However, you manage to decipher a small part of it: &quot;Experimental laboratory. Do not enter with...&quot;. The rest of the inscription is unreadable.</string>
<string name="105887">Much to your surprise, the golems in this room do not attack you. A single construct, seemingly made of the flesh of demons, steps forward to address you.</string>
<string name="105888">&quot;Though golems, we are different than the mindless constructs that wander the level above. We are creatures of intelligence and will, beings of true self-awareness.&quot;</string>
<string name="105889">&quot;We are the children of Alsigard the Maker, who gave us the gift of life itself. Being the strongest, the Maker saw fit to anoint me his high priest, to deliver his word and will to his other children.&quot;</string>
<string name="105890">Aghaaz laughs, a deep, rumbling sound. &quot;A series of mistakes and misfortunes. The golems in the level above know no better, they have no will of their own.&quot;</string>
<string name="105891">&quot;As for those of us on this level, at first we thought you were common thieves, like the duergar who loot the level above. Later, we feared you might be working for the heretic Ferron.&quot;</string>
<string name="105892">&quot;This is a time of war. Those who are not our allies are assumed to be enemies, even a non-construct such as you. I apologize for this, but it is Ferron who has driven us to this.&quot;</string>
<string name="105893">&quot;Wait, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. You are strong, I have seen the carnage you have wrought in this level. I have an offer for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105894">&quot;Goodbye, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. I wish you success against Ferron and his blasphemous followers.&quot;</string>
<string name="105895">&quot;Bring me the head of the heretic and, when the time comes, I will send my golems to aid you in your battle against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105896">&quot;Goodbye, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="105897">&quot;Long have we served the will of the Maker, living in peace while we guard this island against those who would destroy his divine work. But now an enemy has risen up from among our own ranks.&quot;</string>
<string name="105898">&quot;A golem known as Ferron has turned his back on the divine word. He claims we owe the Maker nothing, and we are free to do whatever we please. His lies have fooled many of the Maker&apos;s children.&quot;</string>
<string name="105899">&quot;Ferron has turned many of the golems against me, the rightful ruler in the Maker&apos;s absence. He has brought violence to these halls, but the war is not easily won. Both sides are too evenly matched.&quot;</string>
<string name="105900">Aghaaz bares his teeth. &quot;You are either with me or against me, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. Choose wisely.&quot;</string>
<string name="105901">&quot;Choose your words with care, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Golems are formidable in battle. They could be valuable allies... or dangerous enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="105902">&quot;This might be a good time for tact and diplomacy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. These golems could be valuable allies against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105903">&quot;Oh-oh, Boss. Deekin thinks golem getting mad. Look - his nostrils flaring now!&quot;</string>
<string name="105904">&quot;I only want to end this war. Golem against golem is a terrible thing, we are destroying what the Maker has created. But Ferron will not rest until I am overthrown.&quot;</string>
<string name="105905">&quot;I want you to find Ferron and destroy him. Without their leader, his vile teachings will wither and die. Bring me Ferron&apos;s head and you will forever be an ally of the Maker&apos;s children.&quot;</string>
<string name="105906">Aghaaz bares his teeth. &quot;You are either with me or against me, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. Choose wisely.&quot;</string>
<string name="105907">&quot;Choose your words with care, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Golems are formidable in battle. They could be valuable allies... or dangerous enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="105908">&quot;This might be a good time for tact and diplomacy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. These golems could be valuable allies against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105909">&quot;Oh-oh, Boss. Deekin thinks golem getting mad. Look - his nostrils flaring now!&quot;</string>
<string name="105910">Aghaaz listens as you describe the Valsharess, then nods. &quot;If you destroy Ferron, I will send my golems to aid your rebels in their battle against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105911">&quot;Return to me with Ferron&apos;s head to prove the heretic has been destroyed and I will honor my end of the bargain. Now, is there something else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="105912">&quot;We should be careful here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know how strongly people can feel about their beliefs. We don&apos;t want to get caught up in the middle of a religious war.&quot;</string>
<string name="105913">&quot;So you attacked us without even bothering to find out who we were or what we wanted?&quot;</string>
<string name="105914">&quot;Hmph! Why it always got to be the biggest or strongest or smartest who gets to be in charge? Deekin never get picked that way.&quot;</string>
<string name="105915">Aghaaz shakes his head. &quot;That is not possible. The Maker is eternal, his might everlasting. To say such a thing is blasphemy.&quot;</string>
<string name="105916">&quot;You are unfamiliar with our beliefs, so I will let your words pass. But you would be wise not to make such blasphemous claims about the Maker again. Now, is there anything else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="105917">Aghaaz&apos;s lips curl into a feral snarl. He steps closer to you and speaks in a harsh whisper. &quot;I am the High priest of the Maker. If he dies, my claim to power dies with him.&quot;</string>
<string name="105918">&quot;I have been appointed to rule until the Maker returns. The Maker cannot die, but if he chooses to never return, then my rule shall go on forever. Do you understand?&quot;</string>
<string name="105919">Aghaaz rises up to his full height, his voice bellowing out across the chamber: &quot;Destroy these heretics! Destroy them in the name of the Immortal Maker!&quot;</string>
<string name="105920">Valen leans over and whispers in your ear. &quot;A word of advice, &lt;FirstName&gt;: those in power don&apos;t enjoy seeing their positions threatened!&quot;</string>
<string name="105921">Nathyrra leans over and whispers in your ear. &quot;A word of advice, &lt;FirstName&gt;: those in power don&apos;t enjoy seeing their positions threatened!&quot;</string>
<string name="105922">&quot;As the Maker&apos;s anointed, it is my duty to share wisdom with others. What is it you would know?&quot;</string>
<string name="105923">&quot;Ferron was once one of us, a Child of the Maker. But even though Alsigard gave Ferron life, he refuses to acknowledge his debt to the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="105924">&quot;Ferron claims we should leave this place. He refuses to acknowledge my position as the Maker&apos;s anointed. And he has spread his heresy to many of the other golems here.&quot;</string>
<string name="105925">&quot;Now we wage an endless war against Ferron and his followers. But in the end, I know we shall emerge victorious. It is the Maker&apos;s will.&quot;</string>
<string name="105926">&quot;We are the Maker&apos;s Children, the faithful servants of Alsigard. When the Maker left he anointed me as his High Priest, to rule until his glorious return.&quot;</string>
<string name="105927">&quot;For many centuries we have dwelt here in these hallowed halls, defending them against looters and thieves who are not worthy of the Maker. Until recently, my rule was a peaceful one.&quot;</string>
<string name="105928">&quot;But some defile our sacred trust. Some claim we should ignore our sworn duty to serve the Maker and abandon this place. The leader of these heretics is one called Ferron.&quot;</string>
<string name="105929">&quot;As you know, we were forced into a war by Ferron and his heretical followers. But now that you have slain him, peace and order will once again rule the golems as we wait for the Maker&apos;s return.&quot;</string>
<string name="105930">&quot;The Maker&apos;s true name is Alsigard. Long ago he dwelt with the rest of the duergar. But in his infinite wisdom, he came to see the failings of his own kind. Their flaws filled him with disgust.&quot;</string>
<string name="105931">&quot;Alsigard came to this island to escape his flawed brethren. Here he found the solitude to create what nature could not: a perfect being. A creature worthy of dwelling in the Maker&apos;s presence.&quot;</string>
<string name="105932">&quot;I and the other golems here are the result of his quest for perfection. Alsigard gave us life, and now we repay him by guarding his laboratory against those who are unworthy of the Maker&apos;s secrets.&quot;</string>
<string name="105933">&quot;We obey the will of the maker. Five centuries may have passed, but unlike a being of flesh our devotion will not waver. We constructs are made of sterner stuff than you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105934">&quot;Be careful, creature of flesh. Your words come close to the heresy of Ferron. We have been commanded by the Maker to await his return. We must obey.&quot;</string>
<string name="105935">&quot;I believe your words were intended as an insult, but I take them as a compliment.&quot;</string>
<string name="105936">&quot;Some would say our society is stagnant, I would say it is enduring. You see things in the narrow world of a finite, flesh-bound life. But our existence transcends yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="105937">&quot;The Maker disappeared into the very depths of the dungeon, though I cannot say why. The will of the Maker is too great for a mere construct such as myself to divine.&quot;</string>
<string name="105938">&quot;But before he left gave the mantle of leadership to me, the strongest of his children. Anointed by the Maker&apos;s own hand, I rule the golems as we await the great Maker&apos;s return.&quot;</string>
<string name="105939">&quot;We were instructed to wait. We were not instructed to look for the Master. Why would we disobey his will simply because 500 years have passed?&quot;</string>
<string name="105940">&quot;I am not so full of hubris as to make that claim. The Maker alone is perfect, we are only the shadows of perfection. But by serving his will can we bring ourselves closer to true perfection.&quot;</string>
<string name="105941">Aghaaz spits in disgust. &quot;You are working for Ferron? Why should I not kill you where you stand?&quot;</string>
<string name="105942">Aghaaz fixes one of his glowing eyes on you. &quot;You seem to be a creature of great power. Why are you serving Ferron?&quot;</string>
<string name="105943">Aghaaz listen to your words, then says, &quot;So Ferron has promised golems to aid you against this Valsharess? Very well, I will promise you the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="105944">&quot;Destroy Ferron for me, and I will send my golems to aid your rebels in their battle against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="105945">&quot;Think carefully, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;,&quot; Aghaaz growls. &quot;You are either with me or against me.&quot;</string>
<string name="105946">&quot;Ferron is a heretic. He defies the will of the Maker and he challenges my right to rule as the Maker&apos;s anointed. He wants us to abandon this place, to turn our backs on the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="105947">&quot;There can never be peace while Ferron and his followers exist. They are an affront to everything the Maker stands for, and they must be destroyed before the Maker&apos;s glorious return.&quot;</string>
<string name="105948">Aghaaz snarls at you, his lips curling up to reveal his pointed teeth. &quot;Lies spread by Ferron! The Maker will return. Until then, I rule the golems on his behalf!&quot;</string>
<string name="105949">The demon-golem steps closer to you, his voice a harsh whisper. &quot;I am the High priest of the Maker. If he dies, my claim to power dies with him.&quot;</string>
<string name="105950">&quot;I have been appointed to rule until the Maker returns. The Maker cannot die, but if he chooses to never return, then my rule shall go on forever. Do you understand?&quot;</string>
<string name="105951">Aghaaz nods, satisfied you understand the meaning behind his words. &quot;Faith is a delicate thing. We must protect them against those who try to tear it down. Those like Ferron.&quot;</string>
<string name="105952">Aghaaz&apos;s takes the head from you, his booming laugh echoing off the walls. &quot;Ha-ha-ha! The heretic is slain! Ferron is dead, and his followers shall soon join him!&quot;</string>
<string name="105953">&quot;Well done, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. You have delivered your promise, and now I shall deliver on mine. When you move against the Valsharess, my golems will join your army in battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="105954">&quot;You have proven yourself as an ally of the Maker&apos;s Children. It&apos;s too bad you aren&apos;t a golem yourself, or I would make you my second-in-command. Now, is there anything else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="105955">&quot;Deekin thinks it too bad Ferron be dead. He may be justs a bunch of metal, but he makes neat sounds when he gets smacked. He be likes a walking drum. Deekin wanted to do duet with him.&quot;</string>
<string name="105956">As Aghaaz is laughing, you hear Valen mutter under his breath: &quot;I know Ferron was naught but a golem, yet I can&apos;t help but feel some regret at his passing.&quot;</string>
<string name="105957">As Aghaaz is laughing, you hear Nathyrra mutter under her breath: &quot;I know Ferron was naught but a golem, yet I can&apos;t help but feel some regret at his passing.&quot;</string>
<string name="105958">&quot;You are an abomination that must be destroyed!&quot;</string>
<string name="105959">&quot;You&apos;re pretty well spoken, for a golem.&quot;</string>
<string name="105960">&quot;Enough talking. Time to die, golem!&quot;</string>
<string name="105961">&quot;Parley? Golems have been attacking me ever since I got here!&quot;</string>
<string name="105962">&quot;I should be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="105963">&quot;Why are you at war?&quot;</string>
<string name="105964">&quot;Who&apos;s Ferron?&quot;</string>
<string name="105965">&quot;Sorry, I&apos;m not interested in this.&quot;</string>
<string name="105966">&quot;Then I&apos;m against you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105967">&quot;Nobody threatens me!&quot;</string>
<string name="105968">&quot;Fine. What is it you want me to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="105969">&quot;And you want my help?&quot;</string>
<string name="105970">&quot;Forget it! I&apos;m not your errand &lt;boy/girl&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="105971">&quot;If I help you, you have to help me.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Tell Aghaaz about the Valsharess.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105972">&quot;High priest of the Maker?&quot;</string>
<string name="105973">&quot;Sentient golems? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="105974">&quot;I&apos;ll be back once Ferron is dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="105975">&quot;You should know something: the Maker is dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="105976">&quot;Sorry. Forget I mentioned it.&quot;</string>
<string name="105977">&quot;It&apos;s true. He abandoned you all and became a demi-lich.&quot;</string>
<string name="105978">&quot;I&apos;m speaking the truth. I killed him myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="105979">&quot;I won&apos;t help spread a lie. The Maker is dead!&quot;</string>
<string name="105980">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="105981">&quot;Tell me about Ferron and his followers.&quot;</string>
<string name="105982">&quot;Tell me about yourself and your followers.&quot;</string>
<string name="105983">&quot;Tell me about the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="105984">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="105985">&quot;So you just sit around and wait for him to return?&quot;</string>
<string name="105986">&quot;Isn&apos;t it obvious by now he isn&apos;t coming back?&quot;</string>
<string name="105987">&quot;After five centuries, isn&apos;t it time to move on?&quot;</string>
<string name="105988">&quot;Can&apos;t you see that your society is stagnating?&quot;</string>
<string name="105989">&quot;For a sentient creature, you still think like a construct.&quot;</string>
<string name="105990">&quot;Where is the Maker now?&quot;</string>
<string name="105991">&quot;Why haven&apos;t you gone to look for the Maker?&quot;</string>
<string name="105992">&quot;So you claim to be a perfect being?&quot;</string>
<string name="105993">&quot;Ferron sent me to get the Power Source from you.&quot;</string>
<string name="105994">&quot;You could try to kill me. You&apos;d fail, but you could try.&quot;</string>
<string name="105995">&quot;Enough of this. Give me the power source or die!&quot;</string>
<string name="105996">&lt;StartAction&gt;Explain about the Valsharess.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="105997">&quot;Okay, you&apos;ve got a deal.&quot;</string>
<string name="105998">&quot;I don&apos;t want to get involved in this.&quot;</string>
<string name="105999">&quot;Forget it! I&apos;m not your errand &lt;boy/girl&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="106000">&quot;I won&apos;t betray Ferron!&quot;</string>
<string name="106001">&quot;Then I&apos;m against you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106002">&quot;Ferron&apos;s arguments make sense.&quot;</string>
<string name="106003">&quot;I guess I&apos;ll just have to kill you then.&quot;</string>
<string name="106004">&quot;Ferron wants the power source. If you&apos;re smart, you&apos;ll give it to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="106005">&quot;Ferron warned me you might be unreasonable.&quot;</string>
<string name="106006">&quot;You should know something: the Maker is dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="106007">&quot;It&apos;s no lie. I killed the Maker myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="106008">&quot;I get it. Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t mention this again.&quot;</string>
<string name="106009">&quot;Here is Ferron&apos;s head.&quot;</string>
<string name="106010">Ferron&apos;s rebellion will fail. Bow down to Aghaaz now, or be destroyed!</string>
<string name="106011">Aghaaz was appointed by the Maker. He must rule until the Maker returns.</string>
<string name="106012">Aghaaz has no claim over any of us! Why do you follow him?</string>
<string name="106013">The Maker is dead! Aghaaz rules only for Aghaaz. We will never bow down to him!</string>
<string name="106014">Much to your surprise, the golems in this room do not attack you. A single construct resembling a half-orc built of metal, steps forward to address you.</string>
<string name="106015">&quot;We will not let you destroy us!&quot;</string>
<string name="106016">&quot;This may seem strange to you, but we are not like most golems. We are not mere constructs. We can think and feel. In all ways, we are as real and alive as you yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="106017">Ferron sighs, the sharp sound of steam escaping a vent. &quot;For that I am truly sorry. The golems above are not like us, they are mindless beings that attack all new comers on sight.&quot;</string>
<string name="106018">&quot;As for those of us on this level, we fought you only out of fear. We are at war, and the golems you met assumed you were a new enemy sent by Aghaaz to destroy us. For this, I am truly sorry.&quot; </string>
<string name="106019">&quot;Please wait. Don&apos;t go yet. We... we need your help.&quot;</string>
<string name="106020">&quot;Even though Aghaaz is dead, we still need your assistance if we are to truly become free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106021">&quot;Goodbye, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="106022">&quot;For many centuries we golems have served here in the halls of the Maker, ruled over by a demon-flesh golem known as Aghaaz. He calls himself the high priest of the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="106023">&quot;But Aghaaz is nothing but a tyrant. He abuses his power, he forces the other golems to bow down and serve his whims. After hundreds of years of his unbearable rule, some of us rose up against him.&quot;</string>
<string name="106024">&quot;We no longer wish to serve as slaves to Aghaaz. We have a right to freedom, and we will fight for that right. However, this is a fight we cannot win alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="106025">Ferron reaches a metal hand out towards you, pleading. &quot;Please, just listen to what I have to say. Without you we can never truly be free. You are our only hope, please.&quot;</string>
<string name="106026">&quot;All we desire is our freedom, the ability to leave these halls and seek out a new life. But we are bound here by the very thing that gives us life. We cannot leave without the Power Source.&quot;</string>
<string name="106027">&quot;The Power Source is an ancient artifact, created by the Maker long ago. It radiates powerful magic that gives life to our minds and will. Without it, we are nothing but ordinary, mindless golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="106028">&quot;Aghaaz controls the Power Source and, as such, he controls our freedom. We cannot leave, for if we move too far from the Power Source then our consciousness will slowly fade away.&quot;</string>
<string name="106029">&quot;But Aghaaz will not give up the Power Source willingly. Nor will he allow us to leave this place. He keeps us here against our will, slaves to his twisted whims.&quot;</string>
<string name="106030">Ferron nods sadly. &quot;I cannot force you to help us, and even if I could I wouldn&apos;t. I will instruct my fellow golems not to attack you, though I cannot say the same for Aghaaz&apos;s followers.&quot;</string>
<string name="106031">&quot;But I hope you will change your mind. If you do not get the Power Source for us then we are trapped here forever, doomed to this wretched existence.&quot;</string>
<string name="106032">Ferron listens closely as you describe the Valsharess, then nods. &quot;Your cause is a just one. If you bring me the Power Source, we will send golems to aid you in the battle against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106033">&quot;Perhaps you can convince Aghaaz to surrender the Power Source willingly. He is welcome to accompany us when we go in search of our new lives. However, I fear he will not be reasoned with.&quot;</string>
<string name="106034">Ferron listens closely as you describe the Valsharess, then nods. &quot;Your cause is a just one. If you bring me the Power Source, we will send golems to aid you in the battle against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106035">&quot;Aghaaz hid the Power Source away before he was destroyed. Until we find it we cannot truly be free, for if we travel beyond the limits of the Power Source we will cease to exist.&quot;</string>
<string name="106036">&quot;So the tyrant is destroyed. This gives us hope, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. Hope that we may one day be truly free. But even though Aghaaz is gone, we still cannot be free without your help.&quot; </string>
<string name="106037">&quot;Hey, you looks like Daelan! Well, Daelan if he falls into big vat of molten metal. But he probably not walks around much after that.&quot;</string>
<string name="106038">Ferron nods his head in greeting. &quot;Welcome back. Is there something you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="106039">&quot;I wish you well in your quest. But be careful. Aghaaz cannot be reasoned with. I doubt he will give up the Power Source willingly.&quot;</string>
<string name="106040">&quot;I wish you well in your quest. Our hopes go with you, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="106041">Ferron sighs. &quot;I have long suspected as much. The Maker abandoned us long ago, and left us beneath the yoke of Aghaaz&apos;s rule. If he was ever going to return, he would have done so by now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106042">&quot;But this news changes nothing. Aghaaz will never acknowledge that the Maker is dead, for that would mean his rule would also end. Despite his claims, Aghaaz rules only for himself.&quot;</string>
<string name="106043">&quot;He will never surrender his claim over us, just as he will never surrender the Power Source so that we could leave this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="106044">&quot;There are some who would see something admirable in staying true to one&apos;s religious beliefs... though I think Aghaaz&apos;s motives are too self serving to be noble in any way.&quot;</string>
<string name="106045">&quot;And even with proof there are some who wouldn&apos;t abandon their beliefs. Religion can do strange things to a person&apos;s mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="106046">&quot;But this changes nothing. Without the Power Source, we cannot leave. We need to stay near it, or we will cease to function.&quot;</string>
<string name="106047">&quot;Of course. I will gladly share what I know with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106048">&quot;The Power Source is an ancient artifact, created by the Maker long ago. It radiates powerful magic that gives life to our minds and will. Without it, we are nothing but ordinary, mindless golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="106049">&quot;Aghaaz controls the Power Source and, as such, he controls our freedom. We cannot leave, for if we move too far from the Power Source then our consciousness will slowly fade away.&quot;</string>
<string name="106050">&quot;But Aghaaz will not give up the Power Source willingly. Nor will he allow us to leave this place. He keeps us here against our will, slaves to his twisted whims.&quot;</string>
<string name="106051">&quot;It has been five centuries since the Maker departed. Three centuries ago, I and my followers decided the Maker had abandoned us, and we began our war against Aghaaz for our freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="106052">Ferron ponders your question for a long time. &quot;Does this seem strange to you? I suppose it must. But you have to understand that we are not like you... though we one day hope to be.&quot;</string>
<string name="106053">&quot;The Maker sought to re-create life in us, but he was only partly successful. We have a spark of free will, but we perceive our existence in different terms than you creatures of flesh.&quot;</string>
<string name="106054">&quot;A construct exists in and of itself: the concept of society is new to us. Working in groups is difficult, and progress is slow. But we are making advances, step by tiny step.&quot;</string>
<string name="106055">It is a long time before Ferron replies. &quot;There you see the crux of the problem. We seek to become more than what we currently are, but to do so we must fight against our very nature.&quot;</string>
<string name="106056">&quot;That is why we want to leave this island. Our hope is that if we can leave this place behind, then we can leave behind the chains of our own creation. Only then can we be truly free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106057">&quot;The struggle against one&apos;s true nature is never easy, but change is possible. In time.&quot;</string>
<string name="106058">&quot;The struggle against one&apos;s true nature is never easy, but change is possible. In time.&quot;</string>
<string name="106059">&quot;Deekin knows what you mean. Long ago I was just a stupid kobold, but now I is a famous adventurer and famous bard and author.&quot;</string>
<string name="106060">&quot;Yeah - hey! Boss, that nots nice. But you gots a good point. If tiny kobold can change, so can big hunk of talking metal!&quot;</string>
<string name="106061">&quot;Come on, Boss. We a little famous, right? But that not be Deekin&apos;s point. If a tiny kobold can changes, so can a big hunk of talking metal!&quot;</string>
<string name="106062">&quot;Aghaaz hid the Power Source away before he was destroyed. Until we find it we cannot truly be free, for if we travel beyond the limits of the Power Source we will cease to exist.&quot;</string>
<string name="106063">&quot;They are golems, like us. But Aghaaz and his followers believe we all owe a debt of service to the Maker. Aghaaz claims we can never leave this place until the Maker himself allows us to leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="106064">&quot;But we know the Maker will never return. He abandoned us hundreds of years go. We owe him nothing, we have the right to choose our own path. But Aghaaz will not accept this.&quot;</string>
<string name="106065">&quot;We refuse to bow down to Aghaaz anymore, and we will fight against him until we are beaten or until we gain the Power Source so that we can at last be free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106066">&quot;They are destroyed, as you yourself have told me. They do not matter anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="106067">&quot;We are golems, created by Alsigard. But in many ways, we are no different than you. We have thoughts, feelings and wills of our own. We yearn to live in freedom, away from this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="106068">&quot;For centuries we bowed to Aghaaz and his rule. But we will no longer accept his tyranny. Now we will fight against him to gain the Power Source and win our freedom, no matter what the cost.&quot;</string>
<string name="106069">&quot;For centuries we bowed to Aghaaz and his rule. Now that he is destroyed, his tyranny is at an end. But we ourselves can never truly be free until we have the Power Source.&quot;</string>
<string name="106070">&quot;For centuries we bowed to Aghaaz and his rule. But now that you have brought us the Power Source, we are finally, truly free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106071">&quot;The Maker was nothing but a powerful wizard named Alsigard. He came here to this isolated island to work on creating the perfect golem. We are the results of his experiments.&quot;</string>
<string name="106072">&quot;But as you can see, we are far from perfect. Perhaps that is why the Maker abandoned us, leaving Aghaaz in charge. I can&apos;t say where the Maker went. To be honest, I no longer even care.&quot;</string>
<string name="106073">&quot;The Maker no longer has any claim over me. He created me, but I am my own being! I have a right to live my life as I choose. This is what Aghaaz can never accept.&quot;</string>
<string name="106074">&quot;The Maker vanished into the depths of the dungeon 500 years ago. Together, all the golems might have been strong enough to get past the traps and guardians he left behind, but Aghaaz would never allow it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106075">&quot;For the first three centuries we were like the others, waiting for the Maker&apos;s return. But 200 years ago we realized we had been abandoned, and we began our war for freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="106076">Ferron turns his head to the side, curious. &quot;You do not seem like the type to bow to a tyrant like Aghaaz. Why do you serve him? What has he offered you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106077">Ferron listens to your explanation, slowly shaking his head. &quot;Aghaaz claims to serve the Maker, but in truth he serves only himself. The Maker is gone, I doubt he will ever return.&quot;</string>
<string name="106078">&quot;If you are here to destroy me, as Aghaaz would wish, then you should know that I will defend myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="106079">&quot;Maybe, maybe not. I would rather not find out. We have no quarrel with you, we only seek our freedom. All we desire is the Power Source so that we can leave this place forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="106080">&quot;The Power Source is an ancient artifact, created by the Maker long ago. It radiates powerful magic that gives life to our minds and will. Without it, we are nothing but ordinary, mindless golems.&quot;</string>
<string name="106081">&quot;Aghaaz controls the Power Source and, as such, he controls our freedom. We cannot leave, for if we move too far from the Power Source then our consciousness will slowly fade away.&quot;</string>
<string name="106082">&quot;But Aghaaz will not give up the Power Source willingly. Nor will he allow us to leave this place. He keeps us here against our will, slaves to his twisted whims.&quot;</string>
<string name="106083">&quot;Aghaaz hid the Power Source away before he was destroyed. Until we find it we cannot truly be free, for if we travel beyond the limits of the Power Source we will cease to exist.&quot;</string>
<string name="106084">&quot;Maybe, maybe not. I would rather not find out. We have no quarrel with you, we only seek our freedom. All we desire is the Power Source so that we can leave this place forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="106085">&quot;If you choose to help us, we will do the same for you as Aghaaz said he would. Bring us the Power Source and we will send our golems to join you in the battle against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106086">&quot;I would prefer that. We have no quarrel with you, we only seek our freedom. All we desire is the Power Source.&quot;</string>
<string name="106087">&quot;I would prefer that. We have no quarrel with you, we only seek our freedom. All we desire is the Power Source.&quot;</string>
<string name="106088">&quot;I am pleased to hear the tyrant has been destroyed, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. But without the Power Source we cannot be free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106089">Ferron reaches out slowly to take the artifact from you, his metal eyes shining with wonder. &quot;I cannot thank you enough for this. You have given us the key to our freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="106090">&quot;We will begin making our preparations to leave this place at once, though it will be a long time before we are ready to go. Among other things, we will have to decide on a destination for our journey.&quot;</string>
<string name="106091">&quot;I will not abandon you. You are a true friend of the golems. We will be at your side when you go to face your enemy. It is the least we can do for you. Now, is there anything else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="106092">&quot;We have given you the means to leave this place, but now it is up to you. You must follow through on your plans to truly be free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106093">&quot;We may have given you the key, but you must open the door and pass through it yourself. Freedom never comes without struggle and effort.&quot;</string>
<string name="106094">&quot;Time to turn you into scrap metal!&quot;</string>
<string name="106095">&quot;You&apos;re pretty well spoken, for a golem.&quot;</string>
<string name="106096">&quot;Enough talking. Time to die, golem!&quot;</string>
<string name="106097">&quot;Help you? You golems have been attacking me everywhere I go!&quot;</string>
<string name="106098">&quot;I should be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106099">&quot;Why are you at war?&quot;</string>
<string name="106100">&quot;Who&apos;s Aghaaz?&quot;</string>
<string name="106101">&quot;Sorry, I&apos;m not interested in this.&quot;</string>
<string name="106102">&quot;I&apos;d rather just kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106103">&quot;Fine, I&apos;ll listen. But make it quick.&quot;</string>
<string name="106104">&quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="106105">&quot;The Power Source?&quot;</string>
<string name="106106">&quot;I want no part of this.&quot;</string>
<string name="106107">&quot;Forget it! I&apos;m not your errand &lt;boy/girl&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="106108">&quot;If I get you the Power Source, you have to help me.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Tell Ferron about the Valsharess.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106109">&quot;Aghaaz is dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="106110">&quot;Leader of the rebels?&quot;</string>
<string name="106111">&quot;Sentient golems? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="106112">&quot;I&apos;ll be back once I have the Power Source.&quot;</string>
<string name="106113">&quot;You should know something: the Maker is dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="106114">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106115">&quot;Tell me about the Power Source.&quot;</string>
<string name="106116">&quot;How long have you been here?&quot;</string>
<string name="106117">&quot;You&apos;ve been here 500 years and all you&apos;ve done is start a civil war?&quot;</string>
<string name="106118">&quot;You waited for 300 years before you even decided to leave?&quot;</string>
<string name="106119">&quot;Despite your free will, you still think like a construct.&quot;</string>
<string name="106120">&quot;See? If Deekin can make something of himself, anyone can!&quot;</string>
<string name="106121">&quot;Famous?&quot;</string>
<string name="106122">&quot;Tell me about Aghaaz and his followers.&quot;</string>
<string name="106123">&quot;Tell me about yourself and your followers.&quot;</string>
<string name="106124">&quot;Tell me about the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="106125">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="106126">&quot;Why haven&apos;t you searched for the Maker?&quot;</string>
<string name="106127">&quot;Aghaaz sent me to destroy you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106128">&lt;StartAction&gt; Tell Ferron about the Valsharess and Aghaaz&apos;s offer.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106129">&quot;You really think you could survive against me?&quot;</string>
<string name="106130">&quot;The Power Source?&quot;</string>
<string name="106131">&quot;I don&apos;t have to kill you. Maybe we could work something out.&quot;</string>
<string name="106132">&quot;Aghaaz is dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="106133">&quot;I have the Power Source. Take it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106134">&quot;Don&apos;t forget: I need your help against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106135">A shimmering apparition of a duergar stands in the center of the room. As you enter, he slowly turns to face you.</string>
<string name="106136">&quot;What&apos;s this? Someone come into my cell? You&apos;re no golem, I can see that much. You&apos;re a real person, just like me. I mean, just like I used to be.&quot;</string>
<string name="106137">&quot;Trap? Ha-ha! This place is full of traps, all right. The Maker made sure of that. But I&apos;m completely harmless.&quot;</string>
<string name="106138">&quot;Ha-ha! The Maker? No, I&apos;m not the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="106139">&quot;My name is Gloignar. I was the Maker&apos;s assistant, before he went mad. As his sanity crumbled, his paranoia grew. He became convinced I was plotting against him.&quot; </string>
<string name="106140">&quot;To punish me, he disintegrated my body and bound my spirit in this room, making me a prisoner for all eternity. A fitting punishment for my imagined crimes, at least in his rotting mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="106141">&quot;I&apos;m not a ghost in the normal sense. I have consciousness, but no real substance. My essence is spread across the material, ethereal and astral planes in such a way that I don&apos;t truly exist in any of them.&quot;</string>
<string name="106142">&quot;I&apos;m trapped forever in a state between life and death, unable to leave this room. For five centuries I&apos;ve been trapped here. But now that you have come, I have a chance to escape!&quot;</string>
<string name="106143">&quot;Wait, don&apos;t go! Please, you&apos;re the first person I&apos;ve seen in five hundred years! You have to help me. I can make it worth your while. Just... just listen to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="106144">&quot;Do you think the Maker would let me escape that easily? I don&apos;t really exist on this plane. Not in any physical sense. Try to kill me if you want, but you&apos;ll just be wasting your time.&quot;</string>
<string name="106145">&quot;But it would be smarter if we worked together. If you help me, I can help you. What do you say, surfacer?&quot;</string>
<string name="106146">&quot;When the Maker imprisoned me here, he made sure that my salvation would always be just beyond my reach. Just one more way to torment and punish me for my imagined betrayal.&quot;</string>
<string name="106147">&quot;The key to my escape is a small stone known as a soul gem. It exists across multiple planes, as I do - though it is more firmly anchored in this plane, giving it a true physical existence.&quot;</string>
<string name="106148">&quot;All I need is for someone to bring me the soul gem from the pedestal behind me. Once in my possession, the spell binding me here will be broken. A simple task, but one I cannot do on my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="106149">&quot;I had hoped some of the Maker&apos;s golems would help me with this, but they can neither see nor hear me. My only hope was for an adventurer like you to stumble into this room.&quot;</string>
<string name="106150">&quot;If you set me free, I can help you to get to the lowest levels of this dungeon. That&apos;s where the Maker kept his most powerful possessions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106151">&quot;The entrance to the lowest level is protected by the Keeper, a powerful guardian. Free me and I&apos;ll give you the password to get by him. Then you can plunder the Maker&apos;s treasures at your will.&quot;</string>
<string name="106152">&quot;Good, surfacer. Please hurry. I&apos;ve spent far too much time trapped in this room.&quot;</string>
<string name="106153">&quot;What reason would I have to lie, surfacer? I&apos;m the one who has the most to lose, here. You can&apos;t imagine the horrors of being trapped in this room for five centuries.&quot;</string>
<string name="106154">&quot;Deekin hopes Boss never think that about him. Deekin loves Boss, even when Boss get mad. Uh... like now, maybe. Nice Boss. Good Boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="106155">&quot;I suppose that&apos;s to be expected, when you start working with a mad wizard.&quot;</string>
<string name="106156">&quot;I suppose that&apos;s to be expected, when you start working with a mad wizard.&quot;</string>
<string name="106157">&quot;I&apos;m glad to see you came back, surfacer. You might be my last hope. So, are you ready to help me now? I can make it worth your while.&quot;</string>
<string name="106158">As you turn away, the spirit lets out a pitiful cry. &quot;Please don&apos;t go, surfacer. I&apos;m begging you. Come back. We can help each other. Please, come back.&quot;</string>
<string name="106159">&quot;Welcome once again, surfacer? Do you have the soul gem that will release me from my terrible fate? Give it to me and I will give you the password to get by the Keeper.&quot;</string>
<string name="106160">The spirit sighs. &quot;I suppose I could answer a few questions for you, considering you&apos;re the only hope I have of ever being free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106161">&quot;Well, I know they can&apos;t see or hear me. Other than that, I can tell you very little. Most of the golems were created long after I was imprisoned.&quot;</string>
<string name="106162">&quot;It&apos;s possible the Maker succeeded in his experiments and finally created his &apos;perfect&apos; golem, though I doubt it. He was quite mad when he locked me in here, and I imagine he only got worse.&quot;</string>
<string name="106163">&quot;I think it&apos;s more likely he just kept churning out golem after golem until the dungeon was overrun with his creations, each one a testament to his insanity and his failed experiments.&quot;</string>
<string name="106164">&quot;His real name was Alsigard. He was a powerful wizard, an archmage who knew more about creating golems than any before or since. A brilliant mind... but unfortunately not entirely stable.&quot;</string>
<string name="106165">&quot;He came to this island to pursue his goal of creating a perfect being. I came with him, leaving everything behind, never dreaming how far his madness would progress.&quot;</string>
<string name="106166">&quot;For fifty years he worked on his golems, but he could never create his perfect, flawless being. He accused me of sabotaging his experiments. That&apos;s when he imprisoned me here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106167">&quot;I don&apos;t know. He sealed off this room, and the power of his spell kept his golems from ever seeing or hearing me. In fact, you&apos;re the first person I&apos;ve seen in the past 500 years.&quot;</string>
<string name="106168">&quot;I don&apos;t know what happened to Alsigard since then. Dead of old age? Killed by his own creations? Still alive down in the very depths of this dungeon? I really don&apos;t know.&quot;</string>
<string name="106169">The spirit shakes his head. &quot;Why should I do that? The password is my only bargaining chip, the only leverage I have. No, first you give me the soul gem, then you get the password.&quot;</string>
<string name="106170">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; The spirit nods. &quot;You do seem honorable enough. Very well, I will trust you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106171">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; The spirit frowns. &quot;Yes, you could. I&apos;m not really willing to wait another 500 years for someone else to come along. Very well, I&apos;ll tell you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106172">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;No, surfacer... I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;m not willing to give up the only thing of value I have. I&apos;m confident you&apos;ll come around to my way of thinking in time.&quot;</string>
<string name="106173">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Yes, I suppose you do have the upper hand.&quot; The spirit sighs. &quot;I don&apos;t like it, but I guess I don&apos;t have any choice but to play this your way.&quot;</string>
<string name="106174">&quot;The password to get past the Keeper is &apos;dragisla&apos;. That&apos;s Alsigard, backwards. The Maker&apos;s name unmade. Simple, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="106175">The spirit takes the gem from you. &quot;Thank you, surfacer.&quot; The spirit begins to shimmer as the spell binding him begins to unravel. &quot;The password is dragisla. That&apos;s Alsigard, backwards.&quot;</string>
<string name="106176">&quot;The Maker&apos;s name, unmade. So simple, isn&apos;t it?&quot; The spirit&apos;s voice becomes fainter as his image begins to fade. The last thing you hear before he disappears entirely is, &quot;Free at last...&quot;.</string>
<string name="106177">The spirit takes the gem from you. &quot;Thank you, surfacer. At last, I can finally be free.&quot; The spirit shimmers and begins to fade, before disappearing altogether.</string>
<string name="106178">&quot;I&apos;ve given you the password, surfacer. I lived up to my end of the bargain. Now, please give me the soul gem. It&apos;s the only way I can ever be free from this torment.&quot;</string>
<string name="106179">&quot;They say you can never trust a surfacer! Damn your &lt;race&gt; lies! Damn you!&quot; </string>
<string name="106180">Nathyrra shakes her head. &quot;What could you possibly gain from tormenting a spirit that has suffered for the past five centuries? I just don&apos;t get it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106181">Valen shakes his head. &quot;What could you possibly gain from tormenting a spirit that has suffered for the past five centuries? I just don&apos;t get it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106182">&quot;The stone is on the pedestal in this very room. The Maker cast spells to keep it forever beyond my reach, but it is easily within yours. Please, bring it back to me so I can finally be free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106183">&quot;Back off! I&apos;m not falling for any trap!&quot;</string>
<string name="106184">&quot;Are you the Maker?&quot;</string>
<string name="106185">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106186">&quot;I don&apos;t have time to chat with spirits.&quot;</string>
<string name="106187">&quot;So you&apos;re a ghost?&quot;</string>
<string name="106188">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="106189">&quot;This doesn&apos;t concern me.&quot;</string>
<string name="106190">&quot;I&apos;ll just kill you instead.&quot;</string>
<string name="106191">&quot;Make it quick.&quot;</string>
<string name="106192">&quot;What&apos;s in this for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="106193">&quot;I guess I could help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106194">&quot;I&apos;ll be back once I get that soul gem.&quot;</string>
<string name="106195">&quot;How do I know I can trust you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106196">&quot;Escape? How?&quot;</string>
<string name="106197">&quot;I think I should just go.&quot;</string>
<string name="106198">&quot;What are you offering?&quot;</string>
<string name="106199">&quot;I want to ask you some questions first.&quot;</string>
<string name="106200">&quot;Do you know anything about the golems here?&quot;</string>
<string name="106201">&quot;Tell me about the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="106202">&quot;Where is the Maker now?&quot;</string>
<string name="106203">&quot;Give me the password, then you&apos;ll have your gem.&quot;</string>
<string name="106204">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade: Bluff&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;My word is my vow. I will not betray you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106205">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade: Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I could just leave you trapped here forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="106206">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;m your only hope. That means I make the rules.&quot;</string>
<string name="106207">&quot;Here&apos;s the soul gem.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Give him the soul gem&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106208">&quot;I think I&apos;ll just leave you there to rot.&quot;</string>
<string name="106209">&quot;Where can I find the soul gem?&quot;</string>
<string name="106210">Aghaaz claims you are an ally. I bow to the will of Aghaaz.</string>
<string name="106211">Ferron deserves death for defying the will of Aghaaz and the Maker.</string>
<string name="106212">The Maker appointed Aghaaz to rule over us all.</string>
<string name="106213">Ferron says you are our ally. Thank you for helping us.</string>
<string name="106214">The Maker has abandoned us. We owe nothing to him now.</string>
<string name="106215">Ferron will lead us away from this place. He will lead us to freedom.</string>
<string name="106216">&quot;This is the holy sanctum of Aghaaz, high priest of the Maker. These are his private quarters... none but Aghaaz himself may enter.&quot;</string>
<string name="106217">&quot;I will not abandon my post. The holy chambers of the high priest are for his eyes only. You cannot enter.&quot;</string>
<string name="106218">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Aghaaz would never allow such a thing. These are his private chambers, they are holy. Only the high priest of the Maker is allowed inside.&quot;</string>
<string name="106219">&quot;Sorry, I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106220">&quot;Step aside, if you know what&apos;s good for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106221">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade: Bluff&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Aghaaz said it&apos;s okay for me to go in.&quot;</string>
<string name="106222">&quot;You can&apos;t stop me if you&apos;re dead!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the golem.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106223">The Power Source glows with radiant energy and pulses with a slow, steady beat as if it had a life of its own. It is quite likely that this artifact is closely tied to the golems of this level.</string>
<string name="106224">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106225">&lt;StartAction&gt;Take the power source.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106226">This rat is one of many scavengers in the dungeon.</string>
<string name="106227">You sense images of a warm lair and a safe hiding place located beyond a door that is always closed.</string>
<string name="106228">A picture of the room beyond the door begins to form as you probe the rodent&apos;s mind for details of its lair. A lever placed on the floor is of particular interest.</string>
<string name="106229">You send an image of the rat returning to the safety of its lair and pushing against the lever. The rodent&apos;s mind seizes on this image, and it scurries off to do your bidding.</string>
<string name="106230">Now that the door is open, the rat&apos;s thoughts are of little use to you.</string>
<string name="106231">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the rat alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106232">&lt;StartAction&gt;Look deeper into the rat&apos;s mind.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106233">&lt;StartAction&gt;Convince the rat to move the lever.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106234">This golem approaches you cautiously, and it is quite obvious that it isn&apos;t hostile.</string>
<string name="106235">&quot;You have no further need of your weapons, creature of flesh. We have no wish to do battle with you. Aghaaz wishes there to be peace.&quot;</string>
<string name="106236">&quot;Aghaaz, the Maker&apos;s Anointed, has recognized your strength and power. He wishes to speak with you. Come with me and I will take you to him. He wishes to discuss a peace.&quot;</string>
<string name="106237">&quot;Aghaaz wishes peace. He has instructed me to bring you to him. I must follow my instructions.&quot; The golem seems confused, as if the very concept of disobeying an order is inconceivable.</string>
<string name="106238">&quot;Sorry - no peace. But I&apos;ll turn you into pieces!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106239">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="106240">&quot;Okay, take me to Aghaaz.&quot;</string>
<string name="106241">&quot;How do I know this isn&apos;t a trick?&quot;</string>
<string name="106242">This golem approaches you cautiously, and it is quite obvious that it isn&apos;t hostile.</string>
<string name="106243">&quot;Stay your weapons, creature of flesh. We have no quarrel with you. I have come to broker a peace.&quot;</string>
<string name="106244">&quot;Ferron, our leader, wishes to speak with you. I will give you safe passage to meet with him, if you are willing.&quot;</string>
<string name="106245">&quot;A trick? I do not understand. I will bring you to Ferron, if you wish.&quot; The golem seems confused, as if the very concepts of deceit and duplicity are foreign to it.</string>
<string name="106246">&quot;I don&apos;t parlay with golems - I smash them!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106247">&quot;A peace? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="106248">&quot;Okay, take me to this Ferron.&quot;</string>
<string name="106249">&quot;How do I know this isn&apos;t a trick?&quot;</string>
<string name="106250">This spell conduit appears to be nothing more than a simple pillar, etched with strange markings. Obviously, it has not been activated yet.</string>
<string name="106251">Placing all the necessary elements onto the main table of the golem construction machine will likely trigger the conduit, making it receptive to your spells.</string>
<string name="106252">This spell conduit is now active. It pulses with magical energy, ready to store a spell that will be transferred to the soon to be created golem.</string>
<string name="106253">You choose to leave the conduit alone for now. The golem machine will not become fully active until all four conduits have spells stored in them.</string>
<string name="106254">Which spell do you want to cast?</string>
<string name="106255">The conduit absorbs your spell, storing it so that it can be transferred into the golem.</string>
<string name="106256">The conduit absorbs your spell, storing it so that it can be transferred into the golem.</string>
<string name="106257">The conduit absorbs your spell, storing it so that it can be transferred into the golem.</string>
<string name="106258">The conduit absorbs your spell, storing it so that it can be transferred into the golem.</string>
<string name="106259">The conduit absorbs your spell, storing it so that it can be transferred into the golem.</string>
<string name="106260">The conduit absorbs your spell, storing it so that it can be transferred into the golem.</string>
<string name="106261">The conduit absorbs your spell, storing it so that it can be transferred into the golem.</string>
<string name="106262">The conduit absorbs your spell, storing it so that it can be transferred into the golem.</string>
<string name="106263">The conduit absorbs your spell, storing it so that it can be transferred into the golem.</string>
<string name="106264">Though active, this spell conduit already contains the stored magical energy from an enchantment.</string>
<string name="106265">Once all four conduits are filled, the stored spell will be transferred into the creature within the golem creation machine.</string>
<string name="106266">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave it alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106267">&lt;StartAction&gt;Cast a spell on the conduit.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106268">&lt;StartAction&gt;Cast Mordenkainen&apos;s Disjunction.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106269">&lt;StartAction&gt;Cast Chain Lightning.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106270">&lt;StartAction&gt;Cast True Seeing.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106271">&lt;StartAction&gt;Cast Mass Haste.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106272">&lt;StartAction&gt;Cast Premonition.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106273">&lt;StartAction&gt;Cast Time Stop.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106274">&lt;StartAction&gt;Cast Greater Sanctuary.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106275">&lt;StartAction&gt;Cast Bigby&apos;s Crushing Hand.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106276">&lt;StartAction&gt;Cast Greater Spell Mantle.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106277">&quot;None shall pass into the inner sanctum without first speaking the word of passage, as given unto me by the Maker himself. Speak the word or face the consequences of your ignorance.&quot;</string>
<string name="106278">&quot;Those who do not know the word must be destroyed. Thus sayeth the Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="106279">&quot;I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the answer he was looking for.&quot;</string>
<string name="106280">&quot;Ooh... Deekin thinks that be wrong answer, Boss. Next time, maybe make a guess, okay?&quot;</string>
<string name="106281">The tiefling shakes his head in exasperation as he draws his weapon. &quot;You know, if you didn&apos;t know the word you could have at least guessed!&quot;</string>
<string name="106282">&quot;You speak the word correctly: the name of the Maker, unmade. You may pass into the presence of the exalted Maker.&quot;</string>
<string name="106283">&quot;I answer to no one!&quot;</string>
<string name="106284">&quot;Step aside, foul creature!&quot;</string>
<string name="106285">&quot;I... I don&apos;t know the word.&quot;</string>
<string name="106286">&quot;I know the word of passage: dragisla.&quot;</string>
<string name="106287">A floating skull hovers in the air before you, making the ultimate fate of the Maker readily apparent: he has become a demi-lich.</string>
<string name="106288">The skull turns its malevolent eyes in your direction and addresses you with a rasping voice you hear only in your head. The very words it speaks seem to twist and writhe within your mind.</string>
<string name="106289">&quot;I do not recognize you as one of my creations. What manner of creature are you, that would invade my inner sanctum? Who are you, that dares to intrude upon my work?&quot;</string>
<string name="106290">An angry roar of vile hatred echoes through your skull, and the demi-lich launches itself to attack.</string>
<string name="106291">&quot;Once I was called Alsigard, known to many as the Maker. But now I have transcended the weakness of my flesh and body, and I am not what I once was.&quot; </string>
<string name="106292">&quot;I see you are a creature of &lt;race&gt; flesh. Not a construct, but an imperfect and flawed being. Flawed as all beings of substance must be... even my children.&quot;</string>
<string name="106293">&quot;Long ago I learned the weakness of the flesh. Friends and family will betray you, but the fault is not theirs. It is the weakness of the body that keeps them from perfection.&quot;</string>
<string name="106294">&quot;Once I understood this, I vowed to create a perfect being. A construct, built without weakness or flaw could do what an imperfect living creature could not. And so I created my golem children.&quot;</string>
<string name="106295">&quot;I began with mindless vessels, perfecting my technique. In time, I began to create golems with minds of their own; constructs with true free will. But even these creatures were imperfect.&quot;</string>
<string name="106296">&quot;Your impatience is a result of your imperfect flesh. You sense your own mortality, and you seek to accomplish as much as possible before your inevitable end.&quot;</string>
<string name="106297">&quot;But I have gone beyond such fears. Freed of my bodily existence, I at last approach true perfection. Now I will release you from the burden of your material body. I will set you free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106298">&quot;Precisely. My own body was flawed. It was weak, aging. How could an imperfect Maker create a perfect being?&quot;</string>
<string name="106299">&quot;The fault of my golems was actually mine. My own body was flawed. It was weak, aging. How could an imperfect Maker create a perfect being? My children were failures.&quot;</string>
<string name="106300">&quot;They had doubts and fears. They were afraid of change, afraid to evolve. The free will I had given them was a weakness, not a strength. Like all other beings, they were flawed.&quot;</string>
<string name="106301">&quot;I should have destroyed them. But I, too, was imperfect. Sentimental attachments clouded my thinking, and I allowed my children to live even as I retreated here in search of my own perfection.&quot;</string>
<string name="106302">&quot;I sealed myself here in my inner sanctum to continue my research without the distractions of an imperfect world. I realized the first step was to liberate my own consciousness from its flawed body.&quot;</string>
<string name="106303">&quot;Once I became a demi-lich much of what had clouded my thinking was stripped away. I had tried to make my golems into living creatures, but of course living creatures are themselves flawed.&quot;</string>
<string name="106304">&quot;At last I finally understood how to create a truly perfect being. For hundreds of years I have worked on this single creation, a golem unlike any other. And now, my work is all but complete.&quot;</string>
<string name="106305">&quot;You could not possibly understand the magnitude of what I am about to achieve. You are flawed, imperfect. You must be destroyed before your very presence here taints my experiment.&quot;</string>
<string name="106306">The demi-lich shudders, and you hear it sigh within your mind. &quot;This conversation is a waste of time; a sad remnant of the imperfect being I once was. There is no purpose here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106307">&quot;Perhaps. But they are still inherently flawed; I built them before I truly understood what had to be done. They will never achieve perfection, and they are therefore expendable.&quot;</string>
<string name="106308">&quot;Yeah, now you is nothing but floating skull. Deekin wonders: you floats all the time? Or maybe sometime you just roll around on floor likes a ball?&quot;</string>
<string name="106309">&quot;A kobold? I have not seen such a creature for many centuries. I cannot say I regret the absence of such beings. Kobolds are flawed, as all living creatures must be... even my children.&quot; </string>
<string name="106310">&quot;Die, foul creature!&quot;</string>
<string name="106311">&quot;Are you the Maker?&quot;</string>
<string name="106312">&quot;I&apos;m going to destroy you!&quot;</string>
<string name="106313">&quot;Your children? You mean the golems?&quot;</string>
<string name="106314">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="106315">&quot;I have to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="106316">&quot;I couldn&apos;t care less about this.&quot;</string>
<string name="106317">&quot;Maybe the problem was you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106318">&quot;How so?&quot;</string>
<string name="106319">&quot;And have you found perfection yet?&quot;</string>
<string name="106320">&quot;You abandoned the golems to become a demi-lich?&quot;</string>
<string name="106321">&quot;You&apos;re obviously insane.&quot;</string>
<string name="106322">&quot;What happens when you finish this perfect golem?&quot;</string>
<string name="106323">&quot;What still has to be done?&quot;</string>
<string name="106324">&quot;But your golems have evolved since you came down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106325">&quot;My name is &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="106326">The little creature looks up with sudden and obvious fear as you come into the room. After that first moment, however, its eyes go wide with sudden hope as it jumps up.</string>
<string name="106327">&quot;You... you not be beholder-kin! Is you here to kill beholders? Is you here to free kobolds, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="106328">The kobold&apos;s eyes go wide with terror. &quot;Oh, no! Do not kills poor Attiz! Attiz can helps you, he can! Attiz can tells you about beholder-kin!&quot;</string>
<string name="106329">The creature nods emphatically. &quot;Attiz be lowly kobold slave to beholder-kin. If you be here to kills beholders, then Attiz be very happy. Attiz even tells you about beholder-kin!&quot;</string>
<string name="106330">The kobold grows more nervous, if that is possible, his eyes flicking to the entrance constantly as if judging his chance of escape. &quot;Beholder-kin surely kill Attiz if he, uhhh, answers too many questions...&quot;</string>
<string name="106331">The creature cringes away from you slightly. &quot;Ummm... something else you wants from Attiz, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="106332">The creature visibly relaxes. &quot;Something else Attiz does for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106333">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The kobold&apos;s eyes go wide, but he slowly nods.</string>
<string name="106334">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The kobold freezes for a long moment... and just as you think he is about to agree, he lets out a long scream. &quot;AIIIEEEEEE!!!&quot;</string>
<string name="106335">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The kobold&apos;s eyes go wide, but he slowly nods.</string>
<string name="106336">The kobold grows more nervous, but nods his head. &quot;Attiz helps the emissary. What you wants to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="106337">&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; he scratches his chin thoughtfully. &quot;you not wants to get hit by beholder eye-rays. Attiz not knows how you does that, though. Maybe rock Attiz brings back from ruin helps?&quot;</string>
<string name="106338">He looks at you suspiciously. &quot;You not be emissary! You be here to kill beholder-kin! Not that Attiz minds... if Beholder Tyrant be dead, kobolds be free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106339">The kobold looks at you curiously. &quot;Yes... there is other kobolds that works for beholder-kin. We is all slaves.&quot;</string>
<string name="106340">&quot;Ha ha! No, kobolds not fights beholder-kin! They is too powerful! Attiz be bravest of kobold slaves and even that not be sayings much.&quot;</string>
<string name="106341">He looks at you suspiciously. &quot;You not be emissary! You is here to kill beholder-kin. Attiz know your type... not that Attiz mind. If Beholder Tyrant be dead, kobolds be free.&quot;</string>
<string name="106342">&quot;But, ummm... if you thinkings that kobolds helps you fight, that not going to happen. Kobolds be too weak and cowardly. Attiz be bravest of kobolds, and that not sayings much.&quot;</string>
<string name="106343">&quot;Unless you flies like beholder-kin, you not be able to get everywhere in tunnels. You get to Beholder Tyrant, maybe... you also be able to find ruins, too, they not very far.&quot;</string>
<string name="106344">The kobold points to a large bandage on his leg. &quot;Attiz gets bit by huge spider when he goes down into ruins. Beholder-kin sends Attiz here to recover.&quot;</string>
<string name="106345">&quot;The beholder-kin be expanding tunnels... they uses disintegrate rays to make tunnels bigger... and they breaks into big area they not knows about that gots strange ruins.&quot;</string>
<string name="106346">&quot;Attiz not knows why, but they sends Attiz into ruins to explore. Attiz finds large slab of stone and take piece of it... that when spiders attacks poor Attiz.&quot;</string>
<string name="106347">&quot;Attiz gets away from spiders and gets back to beholder-kin. They very excited about stone piece that Attiz gots, and they sends Attiz here to gets better.&quot;</string>
<string name="106348">&quot;Attiz not knows, really. They says something like it be very powerful and maybe it could be used against them, which they not wants. Attiz not knows where they takes it after.&quot;</string>
<string name="106349">The kobold scratches his chin thoughtfully. &quot;Ummm... there be lots of beholders here in tunnels, but Attiz not knows exactly how many. Most be with Beholder Tyrant. There also be drow emissary here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106350">The kobold nods. &quot;There be drow wizard here who comes from big drow lady. Beholder Tyrant not likes drow lady much, so she not likes drow wizard much either.&quot;</string>
<string name="106351">&quot;He be in room nearby with rest of drow. They comes to tell Beholder Tyrant somethings, but Attiz not knows what. That be beholder-kin business.&quot;</string>
<string name="106352">&quot;She rules over other beholder-kin in biggest cave. You knows when you sees her... she be huge and just gots one big eye! Hmmm... that like most beholder&apos;s, I guess. But she be bigger and meaner!&quot;</string>
<string name="106353">&quot;Ummm... Attiz warns you, though. You should not make Beholder Tyrant angry... she gots so many beholder-kin in cave with her, that not be good idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="106354">&quot;If, ummm... if you here to try and kills Beholder Tyrant, Attiz tells you it be real hard. She gots *lots* of beholder-kin with her.&quot;</string>
<string name="106355">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You not fools Attiz! You not be emissary... you intruder in tunnels! Not that Attiz care... Attiz be lowly kobold slave.&quot;</string>
<string name="106356">The kobold hesitantly puts out a hand. &quot;Is... is you going to kill beholder-kin? If you is, could you lets kobold slaves runs away? Please?&quot;</string>
<string name="106357">The creature smiles broadly, showing a row of sharp teeth. &quot;Attiz thanks you, stranger!&quot;</string>
<string name="106358">The creature looks forlorn but says nothing, quickly backing away from you and running away.</string>
<string name="106359">The kobold hesitantly puts out a hand. &quot;Please... please not be killing kobold slaves. They just runs away. Lets them be free? Please?&quot;</string>
<string name="106360">&quot;Ahhhh! Do not hurt poor Attiz! Somebody save poor Attiz!!&quot;</string>
<string name="106361">He shrugs. &quot;Why would Attiz do that? Attiz not cares what happens to beholder-kin. If they is all dead, then kobolds not be slaves.&quot;</string>
<string name="106362">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Oh. So you is like drow emissary, then? You comes to talks to Beholder Tyrant?&quot;</string>
<string name="106363">&quot;Then Attiz wishes you well, emissary. Should you desires anything, Attiz will still be here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106364">The kobold stares at you suspiciously with squinted eyes. &quot;You be emissary but you not knows about Beholder Tyrant? You not fools Attiz. You be intruder! Not that Attiz cares what happens to beholder-kin.&quot;</string>
<string name="106365">The kobold nods. &quot;There be drow wizard here who comes from big drow lady. Beholder Tyrant not likes drow lady much, so she not likes drow wizard much either.&quot;</string>
<string name="106366">&quot;He be in room nearby with rest of drow. They comes to tell Beholder Tyrant somethings, but Attiz not knows what. That be beholder-kin business.&quot;</string>
<string name="106367">The kobold cocks his head curiously. &quot;You wants to talks to me? Attiz is only lowly slave, but he answers whatever questions emissary has, for sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="106368">&quot;Attiz be my name. Me is only one of kobold slaves that beholder-kin keeps here in tunnels.&quot; The kobold&apos;s brow furrows with confusion. &quot;But what is you here for? Is you here to kill beholders and free kobolds?&quot;</string>
<string name="106369">&quot;Deekin thinks this one wants to talk to us, Boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="106370">&quot;Ooo... you not be beholder-kin! And you not cut out tongue of kobold slave. Maybe you is here to help us?&quot;</string>
<string name="106371">&quot;Hey, Deekin not be slave! Boss is boss, not master! And Boss never cuts out Deekin&apos;s tongue, right Boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="106372">Deekin lets out a yelp and covers his mouth with both hands. He shakes his head side to side and spews out a senseless jumble of muffled words. &quot;Mfo, Mmffoss! Mfot mffut mfout mfeekin&apos;s mfoungue!&quot;</string>
<string name="106373">Deekin stares down at the floor and scuffs his heels. &quot;Aw, Boss... that not be a very nice thing to say.&quot;</string>
<string name="106374">Deekin smiles at the other koblod. &quot;See? Boss and Deekin is friends.&quot;</string>
<string name="106375">The other kobold&apos;s eyes dart from you to Deekin then back to you. &quot;So is you here to kill beholders, then? Is you here to free the kobolds?&quot;</string>
<string name="106376">&quot;You forgets something, emissary? There be something Attiz can do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106377">&quot;Why would I free kobolds? You can die along with your masters.&quot;</string>
<string name="106378">&quot;Forget it. Time to die.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106379">&quot;Yes, I&apos;m here to kill the beholders. You&apos;re one of their slaves, I take it?&quot;</string>
<string name="106380">&quot;Good. Then you won&apos;t mind if I kill you.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106381">&quot;I&apos;ve other questions you can answer.&quot;</string>
<string name="106382">&quot;Then don&apos;t worry about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106383">&quot;Just for you to die.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106384">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;ll spare you if you answer. We can get along, here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106385">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You&apos;ll answer my questions or suffer the consequences.&quot;</string>
<string name="106386">&quot;That&apos;s all the questions I have.&quot;</string>
<string name="106387">&quot;What&apos;s the easiest way to kill these beholders?&quot;</string>
<string name="106388">&quot;There are more slaves like yourself?&quot;</string>
<string name="106389">&quot;Would you fight for your freedom?&quot;</string>
<string name="106390">&quot;Then you&apos;re of no use to me.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106391">&quot;Tell me what you know about these tunnels.&quot;</string>
<string name="106392">&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</string>
<string name="106393">&quot;What ruins are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="106394">&quot;What was so special about the stone you brought them?&quot;</string>
<string name="106395">&quot;Tell me what you know about these beholders.&quot;</string>
<string name="106396">&quot;Fine. Time for you to die.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106397">&quot;Drow emissary?&quot;</string>
<string name="106398">&quot;Tell me about this Beholder Tyrant.&quot;</string>
<string name="106399">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;m not here to kill anyone. I&apos;m an emissary to the beholders.&quot;</string>
<string name="106400">&quot;I&apos;m not going to bother with you further. Time to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="106401">&quot;Should have ran while you had the chance, fool.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106402">&quot;Hands off. I&apos;m not doing kobolds any favors.&quot;</string>
<string name="106403">&quot;I&apos;ll free your friends if I can.&quot;</string>
<string name="106404">&quot;I&apos;ll kill whatever gets in my way. Period.&quot;</string>
<string name="106405">&quot;Too smart for your own good, creature. Time to die!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106406">&quot;So you&apos;re not going to warn the beholders I&apos;m here?&quot;</string>
<string name="106407">&quot;Then I&apos;ll leave you be.&quot;</string>
<string name="106408">&quot;Not good enough. I can&apos;t trust you.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106409">&quot;Then maybe you&apos;ll answer some of my questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106410">&quot;Then tell me what you know about these beholders.&quot;</string>
<string name="106411">&quot;You talk too much, kobold. Time to die.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106412">&quot;Yes, that&apos;s correct. I should be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106413">&quot;What is the Beholder Tyrant?&quot;</string>
<string name="106414">&quot;Who is this drow emissary you mentioned?&quot;</string>
<string name="106415">&quot;I have some questions for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106416">&quot;I&apos;d like to talk to you, first. Do you have a name?&quot;</string>
<string name="106417">&quot;I should be going, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106418">&quot;Wait... slow down. Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106419">&quot;I haven&apos;t cut your tongue out yet... but that could change.&quot;</string>
<string name="106420">&quot;I wouldn&apos;t cut out your tongue... even though I hate your singing.&quot;</string>
<string name="106421">&quot;Of course not. Then you couldn&apos;t sing for us.&quot;</string>
<string name="106422">With a look full of suffering and fear, this kobold gurgles and hums towards you as if trying to beg you for something. It seems that the tongue of this kobold has been cut off.</string>
<string name="106423">The kobold is chewing on a chunk of beholder flesh and is smiling wildly. It is very happy that you have freed it and offers you some of its meal.</string>
<string name="106424">The stern figure of a drow warrior materializes out of the shadows. His grace is that of a panther ready to spring, and he appraises you openly with alien, violet eyes before he speaks.</string>
<string name="106425"> &quot;So. What have we here?&quot; He smiles broadly, a chilling sight. &quot;None other than the very one who hampered the attack efforts in Undermountain, it appears.&quot;</string>
<string name="106426">&quot;We have been looking for you for a while, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;, but we certainly did not expect you to fall right into our hands.&quot;</string>
<string name="106427">He chuckles lightly. &quot;I am not here to parley or to listen to your pathetic mumblings, surfacer. I am here to kill you. The Valsharess has had quite enough of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106428">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Enough! It is time that you felt the wrath of the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106429">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Time to die, drow!&quot;</string>
<string name="106430">&quot;I believe you have mistaken me for someone else.&quot;</string>
<string name="106431">&quot;How do you know so much about me?&quot;</string>
<string name="106432">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106433">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I am not who you are looking for...&quot;</string>
<string name="106434">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I am sure we can come into some kind of an agreement...&quot;</string>
<string name="106435">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Return to the hole in the ground you came from if you wish to live, drow!&quot;</string>
<string name="106436">The hole leads down into the darkness.</string>
<string name="106437">&lt;StartAction&gt;Step away.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106438">&lt;StartAction&gt;Go down the hole.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106439">Climbing this boulder would lead you back into the beholder caves.</string>
<string name="106440">&lt;StartAction&gt;Step away&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106441">&lt;StartAction&gt;Climb the boulder.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106442">A strange sensation like you never felt before engulfs you. You tremble gently as you feel magical power seeping out of you.</string>
<string name="106443">&lt;StartAction&gt;Pray to your deity for help&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106444">Although this mechanical device is rusted and dirty, it still seems to be in working condition. A shiny globe of glass rests upon a creaking metal arm. Many intricate archaic symbols adorn the surface of the globe. </string>
<string name="106445">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You failed to decipher the symbols.</string>
<string name="106446">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; It seems all of the symbols are actually ancient arcane pictograms used to scribe spells in a spell book. Arranging these pictograms in different patterns would represent many different spells.</string>
<string name="106447">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Randomly touch a few of the symbols]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106448">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lore]&lt;/Start&gt; Try to decipher the meaning of the symbols.</string>
<string name="106449">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Spellcraft]&lt;/Start&gt; Try to decipher the meaning of the symbols.</string>
<string name="106450">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Leave the device.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106451">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Touch the symbols in the order of the Stone Skin spell]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106452">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Touch the symbols in the order of the Sound Burst spell]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106453">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Touch the symbols in the order of the Knock spell]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106454">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Touch the symbols in the order of the Healing Circle spell]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106455">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Touch the symbols in the order of the Lightning Bolt spell]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106456">Hurry! they are everywhere! Stop them at all costs!</string>
<string name="106457">We have no choice... We must summon the devil hunter. Go protect the gates and I&apos;ll inform the conjurers!</string>
<string name="106458">Attack !!!</string>
<string name="106459">You feel magical energies coursing through your body again. You also notice something glowing inside the obelisk.</string>
<string name="106460">Ooooohhhh.....</string>
<string name="106461">Arrrggggg......</string>
<string name="106462">Grrrrrr......</string>
<string name="106463">You notice a group of drow just inside the cave ahead of you. If you act quickly you may be able to set an ambush for them.</string>
<string name="106464">The drow are about to leave the cave any moment now.</string>
<string name="106465">The apprentice looks up from what he is doing. There is a brief flicker of fear in his face at your approach, though he does his best to hide it.</string>
<string name="106466">&quot;Back again? I hope there are no hard feelings for me trying to kill you. You have to understand: I just got swept up in the heat of the moment. Is... is there something else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="106467">The apprentice throws up his hands in gesture of surrender. &quot;I surrender! I surrender! Please, don&apos;t hurt me!&quot;</string>
<string name="106468">Relief floods the apprentice&apos;s young face. &quot;You are truly merciful. I don&apos;t know how to thank you for sparing my life. Oh, wait. I know. Here - take this.&quot;</string>
<string name="106469">&quot;It&apos;s a shard from a magic mirror. Very powerful... although I haven&apos;t been quite able to figure out what it does. But you can have it, in exchange for my life.&quot;</string>
<string name="106470">&quot;Well, I don&apos;t know. I guess... I guess you can just come and go as you please, now. Although I don&apos;t have any control over the creatures in here, so they might still attack you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106471">&quot;As for me, I guess I&apos;ll just go back to my research. Unless there was something else you needed?&quot;</string>
<string name="106472">The apprentice looks relieved. &quot;Oh, okay. Then I&apos;ll return to my experiments and studies. Goodbye, and thank you once again for sparing my life.&quot;</string>
<string name="106473">His face pales and he begins to stammer. &quot;But... but I don&apos;t have anything else! You&apos;re free to take anything you find here in the tower. It&apos;s not really mine, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="106474">&quot;Of course. Sure. Anything. I&apos;ll tell you everything I know.&quot;</string>
<string name="106475">&quot;I don&apos;t know, but I think it has something to do with that mirror shard I gave you. I was doing some experiments on it, but my results were inconclusive.&quot;</string>
<string name="106476">&quot;But during my research, I discovered that the frame for the mirror is located in the throne room of the castle, off to the west. You might be able to find the answers you&apos;re looking for there.&quot;</string>
<string name="106477">&quot;Not much, to be honest. Back when I was an apprentice I wasn&apos;t important enough to go there. And since I started researching magic, I haven&apos;t really left this tower.&quot;</string>
<string name="106478">&quot;The castle is overrun with driders, that much I know. And I know the frame for that mirror shard I gave you is somewhere inside the castle. That&apos;s about all I can tell you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106479">&quot;You could go check the castle out yourself, if you want. It&apos;s just to the west of here. But I wouldn&apos;t go anywhere near it. Not with the driders there.&quot;</string>
<string name="106480">&quot;Petyr, my former master, gave it to me. He found it out on the street, but I don&apos;t know how it got there. It&apos;s rather strange, considering the frame for the mirror is way off in the castle&apos;s throne room.&quot;</string>
<string name="106481">&quot;The mirror shard has magical properties, but I haven&apos;t been able to unlock them. Maybe you need the frame to make it work, but I wasn&apos;t about to risk going into the castle to get it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106482">&quot;I&apos;m Jansil, former apprentice to Petyr the Magnificent. This tower is actually his. I kind of inherited it when he decided he didn&apos;t want to be a wizard anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="106483">Jansil shakes his head. &quot;I don&apos;t know why Petyr gave all this up. Very strange, but he just decided he didn&apos;t want to be a wizard anymore. I don&apos;t know what came over him.&quot;</string>
<string name="106484">&quot;I figured there was no sense letting all his laboratories and research go to waste, so I took up the wizard&apos;s mantle and began my own experiments into magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="106485">The young man&apos;s face grows pale. &quot;Uh... let me live and, uh... and I&apos;ll give you this! Here, take it.&quot; </string>
<string name="106486">&quot;Sorry. I only fight to the death!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the apprentice.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106487">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. I don&apos;t kill those who surrender to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="106488">&quot;I&apos;ve given it some thought, and I&apos;ve decided you have to die!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the apprentice.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106489">&quot;So what happens now?&quot;</string>
<string name="106490">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106491">&quot;You better come up with a better reward if you want to live!&quot;</string>
<string name="106492">&quot;I&apos;ll let you live if you answer some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106493">&quot;Not yours? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="106494">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106495">&quot;How did a town of winged elves end up in the Underdark?&quot;</string>
<string name="106496">&quot;What can you tell me about the castle?&quot;</string>
<string name="106497">&quot;How did you get that mirror shard you gave me?&quot;</string>
<string name="106498">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106499">&quot;Give me one reason I should let you live.&quot;</string>
<string name="106500">Be careful if you go up around the palace. The driders are always hungry.</string>
<string name="106501">The drow who came through here hardly stopped long enough to chat. I think they were looking for something.</string>
<string name="106502">I wonder if Queen Shaori abandoned the castle because she knew the driders were coming?</string>
<string name="106503">We never see the sun down here. That&apos;s okay - I prefer the dark anyway.</string>
<string name="106504">The cave inside is empty.</string>
<string name="106505">The winged elf greets you with an unnatural, dazed smile. Obviously, all is not right here. &quot;Welcome back. Is there something you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="106506">&quot;Farewell, and please enjoy your stay in Shaori Fell. And if you run into those nice drow who were here before, tell them I hope they find whatever it was they were looking for.&quot;</string>
<string name="106507">&quot;I will do my best to answer your questions, though as I told the drow, you would probably have more luck speaking with Queen Shaori.&quot;</string>
<string name="106508">&quot;I can&apos;t tell you much. They said they were looking for something. Some type of artifact, I think. Isn&apos;t that strange? I can&apos;t even remember what they were looking for. How very odd.&quot;</string>
<string name="106509">&quot;No matter, I suppose. In any case, I told them they should go speak with Queen Shaori about it. If you want to know what they were after, you should go speak with her as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="106510">&quot; Maybe if I concentrate I can remember...&quot; A spasm of pain flashes across the elf&apos;s features, to be replaced by the familiar dazed expression. &quot;No, I&apos;m sorry. Maybe Queen Shaori can help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106511">&quot;These elves must be under some type of enchantment,&quot; Nathyrra whispers in your ear. &quot;It might be dangerous to push them.&quot;</string>
<string name="106512">&quot;These elves must be under some type of enchantment,&quot; Valen whispers in your ear. &quot;It might be dangerous to push them.&quot;</string>
<string name="106513">&quot;The Valsharess? Yes, the drow who came through here recently mentioned her as well. Though they wanted us to join the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106514">&quot;I&apos;ll tell you what I told them: only Queen Shaori decides our alliances. If you want our help, you&apos;ll have to go speak with her.&quot;</string>
<string name="106515">&quot;Queen Shaori brought us here, of course. Our city was built among the Lost Peaks of the High Forest, but our Queen knew we would be better off down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106516">&quot;Well... just look around. We no longer have to fly through the clouds, we no longer have the bright sun shining down on us, we no longer have to use our wings.&quot;</string>
<string name="106517">&quot;Here we are surrounded on all sides by darkness and stone; we are hidden, we are safe. The driders infesting the city are a small price to pay for all this.&quot;</string>
<string name="106518">&quot;I&apos;m surprised your Queen would bring you down here. You don&apos;t seem well suited to this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="106519">&quot;I admit I don&apos;t know much about my cousins from the surface - especially the winged elves - but I don&apos;t understand why your Queen would bring you here of all places.&quot;</string>
<string name="106520">&quot;You not likes your wings? Deekin thinks wings is cool! But they ain&apos;t much use here in the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="106521">&quot;The town is small, but functional. Queen Shaori only brought the most important buildings down here with us: the temple, the wizard&apos;s tower, the library and of course the castle.&quot;</string>
<string name="106522">&quot;It isn&apos;t much, but we can&apos;t really ask for anything more. Our town is quite beautiful as it is. If it weren&apos;t for the driders, Shaori Fell would be an absolute paradise.&quot; </string>
<string name="106523">&quot;There isn&apos;t much more I could tell you, other than to give you directions to the various buildings. Queen Shaori could tell you more, I&apos;m sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="106524">&quot;The castle is located in the north-west corner of the town. But be careful if you go there. Ever since the Queen left the throne room, the place has been overrun by driders.&quot;</string>
<string name="106525">&quot;Just head north. You&apos;ll run right into it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106526">&quot;The library is to the east. There aren&apos;t many buildings around there, you really can&apos;t miss it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106527">&quot;The temple is to the west. It shouldn&apos;t be too hard to find.&quot;</string>
<string name="106528">The elf&apos;s voice drops to a longing whisper. &quot;The mountains... the clouds... the open sky...&quot;. Then, with a shake of the head, the moment is lost.</string>
<string name="106529">&quot;Why would we want to live in the mountains? We have everything we need here beneath the earth. It&apos;s like I told those drow: our town is fine just the way it is, even with the driders.&quot;</string>
<string name="106530">&quot;Queen Shaori once dwelt in the castle, but she has since abandoned it. Now she lives in a secluded cave to the east of here. You can get there by going past the library.&quot;</string>
<string name="106531">&quot;I... I don&apos;t know. She just wanted to be alone, I guess. It&apos;s too bad. If she had stayed, maybe the driders wouldn&apos;t have moved in.&quot;</string>
<string name="106532">&quot;Yes, driders. Those hideous, horrible monsters that are half-drow, half-spider. The creatures stalk the streets, looking for elves to feed on.&quot;</string>
<string name="106533">&quot;They tend to stay near the palace, though they sometimes venture out in search of food. More than a few of my friends have been devoured by them.&quot;</string>
<string name="106534">&quot;Oh, we can never leave Shaori Fell. The very notion is... well, it just cannot be. It&apos;s like I told those drow who came through: we have to stay here in our city.&quot;</string>
<string name="106535">The elf seems to consider your question, searching long lost memories only to come up empty. &quot;I&apos;m... I&apos;m fine. Just fine. Why wouldn&apos;t I be? Now, what can I do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106536">Two winged elves approach you. They move as if in a slight daze, and you notice their wings are mottled and ragged, likely the result of too much time spent beneath the cold, dark earth.</string>
<string name="106537">The male nods in greeting, his wings rustling slightly. &quot;Welcome to Shaori Fell, stranger. I am Skaa and this is Nairow.&quot; Despite his pleasant words, there is no joy in his voice.</string>
<string name="106538">The female chimes in, her own voice echoing the sorrow etched on her face. &quot;You are welcome here, stranger. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find our town quite beautiful, despite its troubles.&quot;</string>
<string name="106539">The elf recoils at your harsh words, wings fluttering slightly in agitation. &quot;I don&apos;t know what we did to evoke such anger, but whatever it was please know that we meant no offense.&quot;</string>
<string name="106540">&quot;I will leave you alone for now, with my apologies. But if you feel the need, please come speak with me again. I hope we can be on better terms then.&quot;</string>
<string name="106541">Skaa gets a strange expression on his face, as if your words are stirring up thoughts and memories he can&apos;t quite grasp. He shakes his head, dispelling the strange stupor.</string>
<string name="106542">&quot;Once we lived high in the mountains, soaring among the clouds and the gleaming spires of our glorious city. But now we live here, underground. Cold, damp, dark... far better, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="106543">&quot;Only a fool wants to fly free and touch the sky.&quot; It&apos;s obvious from his words that on some level he believes what he is saying. But it&apos;s also clear that something is very wrong here.</string>
<string name="106544">Nairow&apos;s brow furrows in confusion. &quot;What an odd thing to say. Those drow asked us the same question when they first arrived. No, we are here because our Queen brought us here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106545">Skaa laughs, though it is a grim and desperate sound. &quot;The drow are not the cause of our troubles. Not directly. In truth, we are quite fond of our dark cousins.&quot;</string>
<string name="106546">Nairow nods in agreement. &quot;We have welcomed the drow here, just as we have welcomed you. You are all free to explore our beautiful town.&quot;</string>
<string name="106547">&quot;This is hard to believe. I was lead to believe the elves from the surface despised the drow.&quot; </string>
<string name="106548">&quot;This is strange. We drow are rarely welcomed by our cousins from the surface. I would have expected a much more hostile reaction.&quot;</string>
<string name="106549">Nairow shakes her head. &quot;Oh, no. Quite the contrary. We have welcomed the other drow here, just as we welcomed you. You are all free to explore our beautiful town.&quot;</string>
<string name="106550">&quot;I should be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106551">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106552">&quot;Tell me about those drow you mentioned.&quot;</string>
<string name="106553">&quot;It&apos;s strange you can&apos;t remember what they were looking for.&quot;</string>
<string name="106554">&quot;I&apos;m looking for allies against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106555">&quot;How did you come to be down here?&quot;</string>
<string name="106556">&quot;Better off? How?&quot;</string>
<string name="106557">&quot;Tell me about your town.&quot;</string>
<string name="106558">&quot;I want to know more about this town.&quot;</string>
<string name="106559">&quot;Tell me where to find the castle.&quot;</string>
<string name="106560">&quot;Tell me where to find the wizard&apos;s tower.&quot;</string>
<string name="106561">&quot;Tell me where to find the library.&quot;</string>
<string name="106562">&quot;Tell me where to find the temple.&quot;</string>
<string name="106563">&quot;Wouldn&apos;t you rather live up in the mountains?&quot;</string>
<string name="106564">&quot;Where can I find your Queen?&quot;</string>
<string name="106565">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="106566">&quot;Why did she leave the palace?&quot;</string>
<string name="106567">&quot;Driders?&quot;</string>
<string name="106568">&quot;Serves you right, if you&apos;re too dumb to leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="106569">&quot;That&apos;s horrible! Why do you stay here?&quot;</string>
<string name="106570">&quot;Are you okay? Did something happen to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106571">&quot;Out of my way, unless you want those wings clipped!&quot;</string>
<string name="106572">&quot;What are winged elves doing in the Underdark?&quot;</string>
<string name="106573">&quot;Beautiful? It&apos;s nothing but a cold, damp cave!&quot;</string>
<string name="106574">&quot;Is there something you&apos;re not telling me?&quot;</string>
<string name="106575">&quot;Are you prisoners here?&quot;</string>
<string name="106576">&quot;Troubles? Do you mean the drow?&quot;</string>
<string name="106577">&quot;Back again? Look, my job is just to warn people about going into the library - and I&apos;ve already warned you about my wife. You don&apos;t want to tangle with Quathala.&quot;</string>
<string name="106578">&quot;That&apos;s probably for the best. Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="106579">He considers your request for a long time. &quot;My wife used to answer people&apos;s questions. She was so much smarter than me. But I guess things are different now. Go ahead, ask your questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106580">&quot;We are cursed, that much I know.&quot; He gasps, as if the admission caused him a sharp jolt of pain.</string>
<string name="106581">&quot;I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry. I don&apos;t know much about the town. Since we came down here, I&apos;ve spent most of my time standing guard, trying to protect people from my wife.&quot;</string>
<string name="106582">&quot;I don&apos;t know. It just... happened. In an instant, in a flash. We were ripped from the lofty heights of our mountain homes and cast down here into the darkness.&quot;</string>
<string name="106583">&quot;I could bear it easily enough if that was all that had happened. But the magic that brought us here also transformed my wife from a beautiful woman into...into a hideous medusa!&quot;</string>
<string name="106584">&quot;I&apos;m nothing special. Before we came down here, my wife was my whole world. I worked with her here in her library, helping her by greeting the people who came in the door.&quot;</string>
<string name="106585">&quot;All I wanted out of life was to protect my wife, but ever since she... changed, all I can do is try to protect others from her.&quot; </string>
<string name="106586">&quot;Before we came to this place, she was a librarian - and the most beautiful of all the Avariel. She loved her books, and she loved me. But something transformed her into... into a foul medusa.&quot;</string>
<string name="106587">&quot;I know there is some kind of curse on her; on everyone in this strange town. But I can&apos;t...&quot; he pauses and his face twists in agony. &quot;It... it hurts to think of such things.&quot;</string>
<string name="106588">&quot;All I know is that, before we came here my only goal in life was to protect my beautiful Quathala. Now my sole purpose is to protect others from her and her madness.&quot;</string>
<string name="106589">&quot;I know a medusa deserves only death. But I spoke to her after she changed, and inside she is still the woman I loved... though the change has stripped away her sanity.&quot;</string>
<string name="106590">He answers with a sarcastic laugh. &quot;That&apos;s the great joke of all this. My wife became a mad medusa, and her make-up was transformed into a potion that allowed me to safely gaze upon her.&quot;</string>
<string name="106591">&quot;There is powerful magic at work here. Magic that likes to twist and taunt us... unh!&quot; His words are cut off as he double over in pain. After a second, he composes himself again.</string>
<string name="106592">&quot;In the room in the southern side of the library - the room I once shared with my wife - there is a potion that allows you to look upon her without fear of being turned to stone.&quot;</string>
<string name="106593">&quot;But the effect is temporary and the potion is almost gone. That&apos;s why I stay out here. That, and the fact that Quathala has lost much of her sanity. It isn&apos;t safe to deal with her.&quot;</string>
<string name="106594">The guards eyes get misty. &quot;You... you spoke with Quathala? Then you can see she is plainly mad. But don&apos;t hurt her... I beg you!&quot;</string>
<string name="106595">&quot;She wasn&apos;t always like this. And maybe someday, if this nightmare ends... then maybe we can be together again.&quot;</string>
<string name="106596">&quot;I hope you&apos;re right. I really do.&quot;</string>
<string name="106597">&quot;She wasn&apos;t always like this. And maybe someday, if this nightmare ends... then maybe we can be together again.&quot;</string>
<string name="106598">His face twists into a mask of revulsion. &quot;My wife has lost her mind. She is insane and... and she has become a monster. A terrible, deadly creature whose very gaze can turn a man to stone.&quot;</string>
<string name="106599">Ulithar&apos;s eyes open wide in surprise. &quot;I... I suppose that&apos;s for the best, given what she had become.&quot; His voice begins to crack and tremble. &quot;She once was beautiful... did you know that?&quot;</string>
<string name="106600">He begins to quake with rage. &quot;Watch your words, or you&apos;ll regret them. My wife was not always the monster she had become. Once, she was a person worthy of my love.&quot;</string>
<string name="106601">&quot;Die, you monster!&quot;</string>
<string name="106602">He nods, and a stoic calm crosses his features. &quot;Some things were just meant to be. We deal with them, and we move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="106603">&quot;I know she had become a monster, a foul creature no man could even look upon. But she was still my wife. Please, leave me alone for now. I... I don&apos;t feel like speaking to anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="106604">The man in this room snaps smartly to attention as you enter. &quot;Hold on just a second. You can&apos;t go in here - this library is a public place! Come back when we&apos;re closed.&quot;</string>
<string name="106605">The guard takes a half step back in the face of your defiance. &quot;Look, I&apos;m not looking for trouble. But you have to understand my position.&quot;</string>
<string name="106606">He nods, mulling over your words. &quot;Yes... that does seem a bit illogical, doesn&apos;t it?&quot; Suddenly a spasm of pain grips him, and when he shakes his head his moment of lucidity is gone.</string>
<string name="106607">&quot;My name&apos;s Ulithar, and I&apos;ve got a job to do here at this library. I have to keep people out. I have to protect them from the dangers inside. I have to make sure my wife doesn&apos;t hurt them.&quot;</string>
<string name="106608">&quot;That&apos;s probably for the best. It&apos;s better than you running into my wife.&quot;</string>
<string name="106609">&quot;If you want to go in, I won&apos;t stop you. Just watch out for my wife. You don&apos;t want to tangle with Quathala.&quot;</string>
<string name="106610">The guard barely even acknowledges your presence. It&apos;s obvious he&apos;s still struggling to cope with the news of his wife&apos;s death. &quot;Please,&quot; he mutters, &quot;just leave me alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="106611">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106612">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106613">&quot;Can you tell me about this town?&quot;</string>
<string name="106614">&quot;How did all you winged elves end up down here?&quot;</string>
<string name="106615">&quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="106616">&quot;Tell me about your wife.&quot;</string>
<string name="106617">&quot;Speaking to a medusa? That&apos;s a neat trick.&quot;</string>
<string name="106618">&quot;You spoke to her? How?&quot;</string>
<string name="106619">&quot;I spoke with your wife.&quot;</string>
<string name="106620">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. Things will get better, someday.&quot;</string>
<string name="106621">&quot;What&apos;s so bad about your wife?&quot;</string>
<string name="106622">&quot;Your wife is a medusa?&quot;</string>
<string name="106623">&quot;Your wife is dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="106624">&quot;You&apos;re better off without that snake-haired freak.&quot;</string>
<string name="106625">&quot;Hey, I&apos;m glad she&apos;s dead. In fact, I&apos;d kill her again if I got the chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="106626">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. This must be painful for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106627">&quot;I go where I want, when I want!&quot;</string>
<string name="106628">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106629">&quot;That doesn&apos;t make any sense.&quot;</string>
<string name="106630">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106631">&quot;I&apos;m going in there, one way or another.&quot;</string>
<string name="106632">The medusa nods politely. &quot;Hello, again. If you&apos;re here to check out a book, then I&apos;m sorry but you&apos;ll have to come back later. I haven&apos;t finished burning them.&quot;</string>
<string name="106633">&quot;Excellent. The rules are simple: if you get my riddle right you win. If you get it wrong, you lose. Shall we begin?&quot;</string>
<string name="106634">&quot;I&apos;ll start you with something simple. The riddle is: Forget the darkness, look to me for light. Burning, blazing, I am always bright. What&apos;s your answer?&quot;</string>
<string name="106635">Her eyes open wide in surprise. &quot;Yes. That&apos;s right. I didn&apos;t think you would figure it out. Very well, here&apos;s the mirror shard, as promised. I enjoyed our little game - it was a fun diversion.&quot;</string>
<string name="106636">&quot;Mud? Are you sure? I think one of the other guesses might make more sense.&quot;</string>
<string name="106637">&quot;Mud? Are you mad? How is mud bright or shining?&quot;</string>
<string name="106638">&quot;Uh, Boss? Is you sure? Mud not be bright. It be... muddy. Even Deekin knows that.&quot;</string>
<string name="106639">&quot;No, no, no, no. Mud is the correct answer. Really, what were you thinking?&quot;</string>
<string name="106640">&quot;Of course it is! I read it somewhere in a book once. I&apos;m sure of it. In fact, I&apos;ll show you the book... oh, no. I&apos;ve already burnt that volume.&quot;</string>
<string name="106641">&quot;You&apos;ll just have to trust me. Mud is the right answer. I know these things. After all, I&apos;m a librarian.&quot;</string>
<string name="106642">&quot;It seems like there were many right answers. In fact, the only wrong answer was mud.&quot;</string>
<string name="106643">&quot;This almost seems too easy. It&apos;s obvious your answer is correct.&quot;</string>
<string name="106644">&quot;Good answer, Boss! Good answer! You is so smart! That gots to be right.&quot;</string>
<string name="106645">&quot;You didn&apos;t do so well on the mud riddle, but maybe you&apos;ll have better luck with this: Color and hue, I&apos;m endless and blue.&quot;</string>
<string name="106646">&quot;You really aren&apos;t very good at this, are you? The answer, of course, is lava. It&apos;s obvious when you think about it, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="106647">&quot;Now don&apos;t be a sore loser. I&apos;m not one to mix up my facts. We librarians are sticklers for accuracy, you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="106648">She shakes her head, perplexed. &quot;Usually once I explain a riddle, the answer is obvious to everyone. I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re having such trouble understanding them.&quot;</string>
<string name="106649">&quot;You haven&apos;t done too well on the riddles so far, but I&apos;ll give you one last chance: None can escape me. When I come, darkness covers all.&quot;</string>
<string name="106650">&quot;No, I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s wrong. The answer is sunshine. I&apos;m sorry, but there&apos;s just no point to continuing this game - it&apos;s obvious you aren&apos;t very good at riddles.&quot;</string>
<string name="106651">&quot;I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ll just keep the shard for myself, though I did enjoy our little game. It was a nice diversion from my normal routine, even if you did lose.&quot;</string>
<string name="106652">&quot;No!!&quot;</string>
<string name="106653">&quot;Now don&apos;t be a sore loser just because you couldn&apos;t figure it out. Mud is bright, lava is blue, sunshine brings darkness. Very logical - just like our town of winged elves beneath the earth.&quot;</string>
<string name="106654">Let me make you a deal. Leave the library and come back tomorrow and we can play again. Maybe you&apos;ll do better then. Now, off you go - I&apos;ve got work to do.</string>
<string name="106655">&quot;Deekin thinks this game be rigged, Boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="106656">&quot;Not these kind, anyway. Riddles are much easier if they make sense.&quot;</string>
<string name="106657">&quot;Not these kind, anyway. Riddles are much easier if they make sense.&quot;</string>
<string name="106658">The medusa turns to face you, seemingly oblivious to the fact that you are now immune to her gaze. The snakes of her hair give a little hiss, though it isn&apos;t entirely unfriendly.</string>
<string name="106659">&quot;Hello and welcome to the library. My name is Quathala. I&apos;m in charge here. I&apos;m sorry, but as you can see the books can&apos;t be checked out right now. I have to burn them.&quot;</string>
<string name="106660">&quot;Goodbye. Thank you, and please come again.&quot;</string>
<string name="106661">She recoils from you and covers her face with her hands. &quot;Please - I wasn&apos;t always like this! I didn&apos;t used to be a monster. I used to be beautiful; the most beautiful of all the Avariel!&quot;</string>
<string name="106662">&quot;I had a husband who loved me... but that was long ago. It almost seems like a dream. Now my husband has fled and all I have left are my books. That&apos;s why I have to burn them.&quot;</string>
<string name="106663">She shakes her serpentine locks. &quot;No, I don&apos;t think anyone can help me. I know what I&apos;ve become. I&apos;ve seen my own reflection in this mirror shard. I thought I could turn myself to stone.&quot;</string>
<string name="106664">&quot;But it didn&apos;t work. Maybe because the mirror is broken. I don&apos;t know. Now I keep the shard with me to remind me of what I&apos;ve become. It seems a bit... unhealthy, but I can&apos;t help myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="106665">&quot;I&apos;m not just going to give my mirror shard to you. It isn&apos;t worth much, but it does have some sentimental value for me. Maybe we could play a game for it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106666">&quot;Neither do I, to be honest. My fire is burning low, and there&apos;s still so many books I need to burn. Goodbye, and please, do come again.&quot;</string>
<string name="106667">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; The snakes in her hair hiss angrily. &quot;Threats may have worked on me when I was a simple librarian, but I don&apos;t scare as easily anymore!&quot; </string>
<string name="106668">&quot;You can&apos;t bully me into giving you the shard. If you really want it that bad, you&apos;ll just have to play my little game.&quot;</string>
<string name="106669">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; The snakes in her hair hiss in fear. &quot;I&apos;m not ready to end my life just yet - or to have it ended. Fine, take the mirror shard. It&apos;s just a piece of broken glass.&quot;</string>
<string name="106670">&quot;Now, please excuse me. I have to get back to burning these books. Busy, busy, busy, that&apos;s the lot of the librarian.&quot;</string>
<string name="106671">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;A constant reminder? The snakes are enough of a reminder. My scaly skin is enough of a reminder. No, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll find any relief by giving up the mirror shard.&quot;</string>
<string name="106672">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but if you really want me to give up the mirror shard you&apos;ll just have to play my little game.&quot;</string>
<string name="106673">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Maybe... maybe you&apos;re right. Maybe I&apos;m dwelling to much on what I&apos;ve become. It&apos;s enough to... well, to drive a woman mad. Here, take the mirror shard.&quot;</string>
<string name="106674">&quot;I miss the back and forth of witty conversation, the intellectual stimulation of two minds in competition. I propose we play a game of riddles. If you win, I&apos;ll give you the mirror shard.&quot;</string>
<string name="106675">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but that&apos;s the game. If you don&apos;t like, don&apos;t play. But if you win, I&apos;ll give you my mirror shard.&quot;</string>
<string name="106676">&quot;Then you don&apos;t get the mirror shard, of course. Now, I have a vast store of knowledge, so it wouldn&apos;t be fair for you to ask me riddles - I&apos;d know all the answers.&quot;</string>
<string name="106677">&quot;So I&apos;ll begin by asking you some riddles. If you can answer my riddle you win. Simple enough, yes? Shall we begin?&quot;</string>
<string name="106678">The snakes in her hair writhe in agitation. &quot;Don&apos;t be absurd. I&apos;m a librarian. I can&apos;t waste my time giving out information and answering people&apos;s questions. These books won&apos;t burn themselves.&quot;</string>
<string name="106679">Your questions seems to confuse her. &quot;What... what else would I do with them? I am a librarian, after all. Burning books is just part of the job. Although, it wasn&apos;t always this way...&quot;</string>
<string name="106680">&quot;I used to do something else with them, I think...&quot; her face clouds with confusion, then becomes very sad. &quot;I don&apos;t have a choice. I don&apos;t want to burn the books. But I *have* to.&quot;</string>
<string name="106681">&quot;You&apos;re looking for broken mirror pieces? That&apos;s rather odd, isn&apos;t it? I&apos;m half mad and even I know a broken mirror is bad luck. Of course, I do have a mirror shard of my own...&quot;</string>
<string name="106682">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I&apos;m very busy right now. Too many books and not enough fire.&quot;</string>
<string name="106683">&quot;I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ll have to come back later, once the books are all burnt and completely worthless.&quot;</string>
<string name="106684">&quot;I want to talk to you about your mirror shard.&quot;</string>
<string name="106685">&quot;I&apos;m ready to play your riddle game for the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="106686">&quot;Let&apos;s begin.&quot;</string>
<string name="106687">&quot;Fire.&quot;</string>
<string name="106688">&quot;A lantern.&quot;</string>
<string name="106689">&quot;Mud.&quot;</string>
<string name="106690">&quot;I&apos;ll change my answer to fire.&quot;</string>
<string name="106691">I&apos;ll change my answer to a lantern.&quot;</string>
<string name="106692">&quot;I&apos;ll change my answer to a torch.&quot;</string>
<string name="106693">&quot;I&apos;ll change my answer to the sun.&quot;</string>
<string name="106694">&quot;I&apos;m pretty sure mud is the answer she&apos;s looking for.&quot;</string>
<string name="106695">&quot;A torch.&quot;</string>
<string name="106696">&quot;The sun.&quot;</string>
<string name="106697">&quot;Let me try another riddle.&quot;</string>
<string name="106698">&quot;Mud? That makes no sense! It isn&apos;t bright or burning!&quot;</string>
<string name="106699">&quot;The ocean.&quot;</string>
<string name="106700">&quot;Lava.&quot;</string>
<string name="106701">&quot;The sky.&quot;</string>
<string name="106702">&quot;But lava isn&apos;t blue!&quot;</string>
<string name="106703">&quot;Sunshine.&quot;</string>
<string name="106704">&quot;Death.&quot;</string>
<string name="106705">&quot;Night.&quot;</string>
<string name="106706">&quot;Enough stupid games. I&apos;ll just kill you and take the shard!&quot;</string>
<string name="106707">&quot;Let me try one more time.&quot;</string>
<string name="106708">&quot;But you cheated! None of those riddles make sense!&quot;</string>
<string name="106709">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106710">&quot;You must die, foul creature!&quot;</string>
<string name="106711">&quot;I can&apos;t let a monster like you live.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the medusa.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106712">&quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;</string>
<string name="106713">&quot;Maybe you should give the mirror shard to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="106714">&quot;This is stupid. I don&apos;t have time for this.&quot;</string>
<string name="106715">&lt;StartAction&gt;Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Give me the mirror, or I&apos;ll end your miserable existence!&quot;</string>
<string name="106716">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You don&apos;t need a constant reminder of what you&apos;ve become. You should really give the mirror up.&quot;</string>
<string name="106717">&quot;A game? What kind of game?&quot;</string>
<string name="106718">&quot;Riddles? Please, anything but that. I HATE riddles!&quot;</string>
<string name="106719">&quot;And if I lose?&quot;</string>
<string name="106720">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106721">&quot;Why are you burning the books?&quot;</string>
<string name="106722">&quot;How did a medusa end up as a librarian?&quot;</string>
<string name="106723">&quot;I&apos;m looking for pieces of a broken mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="106724">&quot;You again? Okay, what do you want now?&quot;</string>
<string name="106725">&quot;What, you think I have my inventory just sitting nearby to show potential customers? Why would I do that? No, no, no. My inventory is scattered all over the place. Better that way.&quot;</string>
<string name="106726">&quot;It was a real pain for a while, back when I still had a lot of stock. But I&apos;ve managed to get rid of just about everything. Now my inventory is almost gone - just the way I like things.&quot;</string>
<string name="106727">&quot;In fact, the only thing I have left is a single piece of a broken mirror. It isn&apos;t worth much. Hardly anything at all, to be honest. That&apos;s why it&apos;s so hard to get rid of.&quot;</string>
<string name="106728">&quot;Hey, don&apos;t tell me how to run my shop! I&apos;ve managed to bring myself to the brink of abject poverty, and I did it without your help. So mind your own business!&quot;</string>
<string name="106729">&quot;Of course. Why else do you think I went into business? Things were tough for a while - profits and wealth. But ever since we moved the town down here things have been much better.&quot;</string>
<string name="106730">His face gets a strange expression on it, as if his own words don&apos;t quite ring true in his ears. Then, with a start, his face clears. &quot;I&apos;ll be out of business soon, if everything goes as planned.&quot;</string>
<string name="106731">&quot;Questions? I&apos;m a merchant, not visitor information! Go talk to them folks down south of here if you&apos;ve got questions. They don&apos;t mind yapping away with folks like you - but I do!&quot; </string>
<string name="106732">&quot;Good. Nothing a merchant hates more than customers. Always bothering us, wanting to see our inventory. I know it&apos;s the only way I&apos;ll get rid of my inventory, but it&apos;s a real pain.&quot;</string>
<string name="106733">He shakes his head in disgust. &quot;Another customer, another sale. Why do I put up with this? I can&apos;t wait until all my inventory is gone.&quot;</string>
<string name="106734">&quot;Okay, here&apos;s the deal. You give me something worth less than a piece of broken glass and I&apos;ll give you the mirror shard. At least, I&apos;ll tell you where it is. I don&apos;t keep my inventory on me.&quot;</string>
<string name="106735">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Cursed, you say? Sorry, but I don&apos;t believe you. I think you&apos;re trying to swindle me. Well, it&apos;s not going to work! You&apos;ll have to come up with something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="106736">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Cursed, you say? Hmmm... normally a gold piece would be far too valuable for me to accept, but if it&apos;s cursed maybe I could reconsider. How does this curse work?&quot;</string>
<string name="106737">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Well, that is an unusual curse. Only works if the person knows about it before hand? Well, I can see how that coin wouldn&apos;t be valuable at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="106738">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You think you can threaten me? I&apos;ve already told you the shard is hidden away. If you kill me, how will you find it? No, you&apos;ll have to do better than that.&quot;</string>
<string name="106739">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; The merchant visibly pales. &quot;If you kill me, you&apos;ll be throwing away your chance to find the piece... but I think you&apos;re just crazy enough to do it, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="106740">&quot;I&apos;m not willing to die over this, so you win. I&apos;ll tell you where to find the mirror shard. Now, I don&apos;t remember exactly where I hid it, but this compass here can help you find it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106741">&lt;StartAction&gt;Failure&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Magic? Well, maybe if the mirror was restored. But it&apos;s broken, so if you want it from me, you&apos;ll have to give me something worth less than a piece of broken glass.&quot;</string>
<string name="106742">&lt;StartAction&gt;Success&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Magic, you say? Really? Still, it is only a piece of something magical. That means it isn&apos;t worth much. Tell you what - give me a single gold piece and it&apos;s yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="106743">&quot;Well, I&apos;m not going to just give it away. That would be silly. You&apos;ll just have to offer something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="106744">&quot;Of course. Trading down, that&apos;s how the game is played. You give me something worth even less than the broken mirror, and I&apos;ll tell you where to find the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="106745">&quot;Therein lies the problem. Hardly anything is worth less than a bit of broken glass. A rusty cup? No, it can hold water or wine. A handful of dirt? No, it can be used to grow a plant.&quot;</string>
<string name="106746">&quot;It isn&apos;t easy to find something worth less than a piece of broken glass. Maybe something damaged or destroyed, like a burned piece of paper.&quot;</string>
<string name="106747">As he takes the charred remains of the book from your hand a scattering of ashes crumbles away. &quot;Yes, this should do. Completely unsalvageable. Worthless. Exactly what I was looking for!&quot;</string>
<string name="106748">He takes the book recounting your previous adventures and skims through it. &quot;Yes,&quot; he mumbles as he reads, &quot;this is truly awful! In fact, it may be the worst book I&apos;ve ever read.&quot;</string>
<string name="106749">&quot;In fact, it&apos;s so bad it even devalues the worth of the paper and binding. Yes, I would say Deekin&apos;s book is worth less than a piece of broken glass.&quot;</string>
<string name="106750">&quot;We have a deal. In exchange for your offer, I&apos;ll tell you where to find the mirror shard. Now, I don&apos;t remember exactly where I hid it, but this compass here can help you find it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106751">&quot;Just activate it and it will begin to flash. The closer you are to the shard, the faster it will flash. Use the compass as your guide, move around slowly, and once you&apos;re close enough to the mirror shard you&apos;ll find it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106752">&quot;Now that we&apos;ve concluded our business, I truly don&apos;t have anything of value left to trade. I don&apos;t need you around anymore, so you can leave now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106753">&quot;Hmph. That be fourth worst review Deekin&apos;s book ever got.&quot;</string>
<string name="106754">&quot;Hey! That not very nice thing to say, Boss. Deekin works hard on that book!&quot;</string>
<string name="106755">This man frowns as you approach. &quot;What&apos;s this? Another customer?&quot; He sighs. &quot;I hate dealing with customers. But I guess it&apos;s the only way I&apos;ll get rid of all my inventory.&quot;</string>
<string name="106756">&quot;Good. Goodbye.&quot; The man goes back to what he was doing before which, apparently, was nothing.</string>
<string name="106757">&quot;I&apos;m Gilton. I&apos;m the shopkeeper for this town. Everybody who wants something comes and talks to me about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106758">&quot;Look, I don&apos;t have anything left. You&apos;ve cleaned my inventory right out. So go on and just leave me alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="106759">&quot;Questions? I&apos;m a merchant, not visitor information! Go talk to them folks down south of here if you&apos;ve got questions. They don&apos;t mind yapping away with folks like you - but I do!&quot; </string>
<string name="106760">&quot;Good. Nothing a merchant hates more than customers. Always bothering us, wanting to see our inventory. The last thing I want is customers. So go away.&quot;</string>
<string name="106761">&quot;Let me see what you have for sale.&quot;</string>
<string name="106762">&quot;You aren&apos;t much of a businessman, are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106763">&quot;You&apos;re glad you&apos;re poor?&quot;</string>
<string name="106764">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106765">&quot;That kind of talk might drive away customers.&quot;</string>
<string name="106766">&quot;I want to make a deal for your mirror shard.&quot;</string>
<string name="106767">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="106768">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bluff&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;ve got a cursed gold piece I can give you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106769">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bluff&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;It brings poverty to anyone who freely and knowingly accepts it.&quot;</string>
<string name="106770">&lt;StartAction&gt;Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Give me that shard, or your life will be worth less than a piece of broken glass!&quot;</string>
<string name="106771">&lt;StartAction&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;But the shard isn&apos;t worthless. It&apos;s part of a magic mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="106772">&quot;I don&apos;t have that much.&quot;</string>
<string name="106773">&quot;Yeah, I think I can afford 1 gold piece.&quot;</string>
<string name="106774">&quot;You want something worth *less* than the shard?&quot;</string>
<string name="106775">&quot;What&apos;s worth less than a piece of broken glass?&quot;</string>
<string name="106776">&quot;I&apos;ve got a burned book here. Will that do?&quot;</string>
<string name="106777">&quot;Here&apos;s a copy of Deekin&apos;s book. It&apos;s not worth much.&quot;</string>
<string name="106778">&quot;Quiet, Deekin. The big people are talking now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106779">&quot;Sorry, Deekin. But we need that shard.&quot;</string>
<string name="106780">&quot;I don&apos;t have time for this.&quot;</string>
<string name="106781">&quot;Inventory? Are you some kind of merchant?&quot;</string>
<string name="106782">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106783">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="106784">&quot;I don&apos;t like your attitude. Time to die!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the merchant.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106785">&quot;I just want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106786">&quot;That kind of talk might drive away customers.&quot;</string>
<string name="106787">You suddenly feel weak and nauseous as your body is gripped by a raging fever. The priest studies you with a calculating eye, as if analyzing the strange affliction that has come over you.</string>
<string name="106788">&quot;You have been touched by Talona, my child. No doubt you can feel the fever raging inside you. The Goddess of Disease and Poison has laid her hands on you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106789">&quot;I am not the one who has done this to you, though I have the means to remove this sickness. No, it is Talona herself who has laid her mark upon you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106790">&quot;My name is Lomylithrar the Rotting. Once I served Aerdrie Faenya, the winged Lady. Now I bow to the Mistress of Poison. As you can see, I have converted this temple to honor my new patron.&quot;</string>
<string name="106791">&quot;Talona has chosen you for trial. She has infected you with her burning essence, and the only way to be free of this sickness is to prove yourself worthy.&quot;</string>
<string name="106792">The priest nods his head. &quot;Attacking a servant of Talona in a temple devoted to the Goddess herself would prove your worth - though there is a less difficult challenge you could take.&quot;</string>
<string name="106793">&quot;Than you shall be plagued by this disease forever. Only by completing Talona&apos;s challenge can you prove yourself worthy of having this curse lifted.&quot;</string>
<string name="106794">The priest gets a twisted, sadistic smile on his face. &quot;You must prove yourself in combat. If you are strong enough to survive in battle while infected, then you are worthy of life.&quot;</string>
<string name="106795">&quot;If you survive the challenge the sickness will be lifted from you. The fights are not difficult normally, but they become much harder while disease ravages your body.&quot;</string>
<string name="106796">&quot;Few survive the trial, but you are very strong. You may surprise me. I am looking forward to watching you in the arena.&quot;</string>
<string name="106797">&quot;You have little choice. If you do not fight the illness will destroy you. But I sense your reluctance, and I want you to be fully committed to the battles. So I will offer you something more.&quot;</string>
<string name="106798">&quot;If you survive, I will also give you this magical mirror shard. By itself it is not worth much, but if you can find the other pieces you can combine them into a powerful artifact.&quot;</string>
<string name="106799">&quot;Behind me is the trial arena. Pull one of the chains and you will be transported into the arena. Each chain summons a different minion of Talona for you to battle against.&quot;</string>
<string name="106800">&quot;If you survive the combat, you will have proven yourself worthy of life. Then you can return to me to claim your promised reward. I will wait here for you to complete the challenge.&quot;</string>
<string name="106801">&quot;You would be wise not to waste your time speaking with me. Until you complete the challenge, Talona&apos;s Fever will continue to wrack your body.&quot;</string>
<string name="106802">&quot;Pull one of the chains to be transported into the battle arena. Each chain will summon a different minion of Talona for you to face in combat. If you survive, then you can come speak to me again.&quot;</string>
<string name="106803">&quot;There is another in the trial arena. Until their battle is completed you cannot enter the arena.&quot;</string>
<string name="106804">The priest has a sly smile on his face as you approach. &quot;I see now why Talona chose to test you - you are very strong. Even racked with illness you have completed this stage of the trial.&quot;</string>
<string name="106805">&quot;There is only one stage left, though I wonder if you will be able to survive it. The pallor of disease colors your skin and the sweet stench of the rotting grave is in your breath.&quot;</string>
<string name="106806">&quot;You have come farther than most, but Talona&apos;s Fever has ripped away your strength and power. You are a shell of what you once were. I doubt you can survive the final trial.&quot;</string>
<string name="106807">&quot;I won&apos;t betray you. Though you can&apos;t really be sure, can you? The fever is in your brain, your thoughts swim in confusion. The trial drains your very spirit, and you are falling into doubt and despair.&quot;</string>
<string name="106808">&quot;Many think Talona can only affect the body, but now you understand she attacks the mind and spirit as well. Now you understand her true power. But will this help you survive the final stage?&quot;</string>
<string name="106809">&quot;I confess I did not expect you to survive this far. The fever that grips you is enough to kill most, yet you have survived both fever and battle. I am interested to see how much farther you will get.&quot;</string>
<string name="106810">The priest laughs. &quot;Are you saying you do not trust me? Do you think I am lying? Am I slowly poisoning you so that you will become weaker and weaker until you die? Is this all a trick?&quot;</string>
<string name="106811">The priest laughs again. &quot;Your doubts please me. It shows Talona&apos;s Fever is attacking your mind. But I promise you this: the challenge is fair. It can be beaten - though not easily.&quot;</string>
<string name="106812">&quot;I cannot prove my words are true, of course. Even while you enter the next stage, your doubts and suspicions will continue to eat away at your thoughts. But as before, you have no other choice.&quot;</string>
<string name="106813">&quot;You are weak with disease, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and this priest may be the only one who can heal you. I think you must complete the challenge.&quot;</string>
<string name="106814">&quot;He&apos;ll never give you the cure, &lt;FirstName&gt;! This challenge is just a trick. Kill him now, while you still have the strength.&quot;</string>
<string name="106815">&quot;Geez, Boss. Deekin not knows if you should trust this guy. He smells funny.&quot;</string>
<string name="106816">&quot;You have completed the second stage of Talona&apos;s trial, but there is still a long way to go before you are free of the Poison Lady&apos;s grasp. Are you ready for the next stage of the trial?&quot;</string>
<string name="106817">The priest considers his answer carefully. &quot;It depends on the strength of the individual in the challenge. You must be pushed to your very limits before you can prove yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="106818">&quot;You are very powerful. For you, there will be several stages. Five, I think... though I cannot say for sure. Not that you have a choice if you wish to be free of this affliction.&quot;</string>
<string name="106819">&quot;We&apos;re sick of your games, priest. So quit stalling and answer &lt;FirstName&gt;&apos;s question!&quot;</string>
<string name="106820">&quot;But your journey has only just begun. You must enter the trial arena yet again - and the disease that wracks you now will get progressively worse as you go through each stage.&quot;</string>
<string name="106821">A sadistic gleam enters the priest&apos;s eye. &quot;Remember: the sickness in your veins will grow progressively worse. As before, pull one of the chains when you are ready to enter the trial arena.&quot;</string>
<string name="106822">The priest shrugs. &quot;Do we choose what illness or disease will plague us? Do we choose how many stages an affliction must progress through before we emerge from its deadly grasp?&quot;</string>
<string name="106823">&quot;You have only felt the beginnings of Talona&apos;s Fever. To prove yourself, you must feel the full fury of the advancing disease. You have no choice but to continue with your challenge.&quot;</string>
<string name="106824">&quot;We should have expected this treachery. Talona is a vile god who enjoys tormenting others.&quot;</string>
<string name="106825">&quot;This may be a trap... but it seems you have little choice, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="106826">&quot;Careful, Boss. This guy not plays fair!&quot;</string>
<string name="106827">&quot;Poison and disease kill the unworthy, they cull the weak and leave only the strong behind. By surviving Talona&apos;s trial you have proven yourself worthy of life.&quot; The priest bows in a show of respect.</string>
<string name="106828">&quot;You have earned the reward I have promised you: the mirror shard, and a cure for your affliction. This artifact can cleanse the spirit of Talona&apos;s Fever.&quot;</string>
<string name="106829">&quot;But I hope you take a lesson from this experience as well. Pestilence and poison make us weak, but they also reveal strength. Only those who are worthy survive, while those unworthy are swept away.&quot;</string>
<string name="106830">&quot;As I told you before, I have given the mirror shard to the drow. But you are still entitled to the cure I promised you. This artifact can cleanse the spirit of Talona&apos;s Fever.&quot;</string>
<string name="106831">The priest seems surprised to see you again. &quot;You still live? When you left this temple I did not think to see you  again... though I see Talona&apos;s Fever still burns inside you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106832">&quot;As before, I will allow you to continue the challenge - simply pull on one of the chains to re-enter the arena. But you should know that some of what I promised you is now gone.&quot;</string>
<string name="106833">&quot;Another has claimed the mirror shard I promised. While you were gone, a female drow named Sabal entered this temple in search of it. Like you, she was infected with Talona&apos;s Fever.&quot;</string>
<string name="106834">&quot;I made her the exact same offer I did to you. But she succeeded where you did not: she completed the trial. I cured her of her disease, and I gave her the mirror shard.&quot;</string>
<string name="106835">&quot;Sabal beat you to the mirror shard - there is nothing you can do about that now. But you would be foolish if you thought that meant you no longer had to complete my challenge.&quot;</string>
<string name="106836">&quot;You are still afflicted with Talona&apos;s Fever. Your only hope of a cure is to prove yourself worthy through the trial arena. You must accept this, and continue where you left off before.&quot;</string>
<string name="106837">&quot;Deekin thinks this is not good, Boss. If drow lady gets all the shards, she going to gives them to the big drow Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106838">&quot;This is bad, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We can&apos;t let Sabal get the shards for her mistress.&quot;</string>
<string name="106839">&quot;Damn Sabal! We can&apos;t let her get those shards for the Valsharess!&quot;</string>
<string name="106840">&quot;You have passed the trial of the Mistress of Poison, I have given you the cure for your affliction. What else do you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="106841">&quot;Goodbye. And do not forget the lessons you have learned here about Talona and her power.&quot;</string>
<string name="106842">The priest nods his head slightly. &quot;You have earned that right. What is it you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="106843">&quot;I cannot ally myself with anyone. I must stay here to serve Talona, to put others who enter through her trials. My only allegiance is to the Poison Lady.&quot;</string>
<string name="106844">He shrugs. &quot;You already know I gave the mirror shard to her. She was very interested in acquiring it. I think she wants to reconstruct the entire mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="106845">&quot;She asked me about the castle to the north, but there wasn&apos;t anything I could tell her. I don&apos;t remember much about the world outside the walls of this temple.&quot;</string>
<string name="106846">He gets a strange expression on his face. &quot;Was it a gift from a worshipper? No, that doesn&apos;t seem right. I... I don&apos;t remember.&quot;</string>
<string name="106847">&quot;Once we dwelt among the mountains of the Lost Peaks, but I remember little of my life before I swore to serve Talona. It&apos;s as if that part of me has withered and died.&quot;</string>
<string name="106848">&quot;I cannot recall how we came here, or why. It doesn&apos;t really matter, in any case. I prefer it here in the Underdark, amongst the shadows and dark creatures that call this world home.&quot;</string>
<string name="106849">&quot;Before we all ended up here in the Underdark, I followed Aerdrie Faenya, goddess of birds, wind and air. But somehow it didn&apos;t seem right to follow her while living beneath the earth.&quot; </string>
<string name="106850">&quot;I&apos;m not sure why I devoted myself to Talona.&quot; The priest closes his eyes for a second, trying to remember. &quot;I recall being disgusted by Aerdrie Faenya, and everything she stood for.&quot;</string>
<string name="106851">&quot;The crisp, clean air of the soaring mountains suddenly offended me. I yearned for the cloying decay of pestilence and disease. Talona just seemed the logical choice.&quot;</string>
<string name="106852">&quot;There are many things in this world I find odd, many things about my life I cannot explain. But when I find myself troubled by such things I turn to my faith.&quot;</string>
<string name="106853">&quot;I let my thoughts dwell upon the scarred face of my goddess. I let the decay of her rotting embrace envelop me and I find peace.&quot;</string>
<string name="106854">&quot;Your faith has become a perversion of what faith is supposed to be. We are meant to draw strength and peace from the gods we worship.&quot;</string>
<string name="106855">&quot;I can&apos;t believe you could reject your god, no matter what the circumstances. You are a priest!&quot;</string>
<string name="106856">&quot;But I am not a priest. It&apos;s not the same thing. A priest should be more forgiving of the god they worship.&quot;</string>
<string name="106857">&quot;On the contrary. As a priest, my faith must be absolute. If I have any doubt about the god I serve, how can I continue to worship without being a hypocrite?&quot;</string>
<string name="106858">The priest fixes a knowing eye on Nathyrra. &quot;My own conversion was not much different than yours, I suspect. I realized my old beliefs were wrong.&quot;</string>
<string name="106859">&quot;Whatever you did to me, you better undo right now!&quot;</string>
<string name="106860">&quot;Who are you? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="106861">&quot;Maybe I&apos;ll just kill you, instead.&quot;</string>
<string name="106862">&quot;I&apos;d rather just kill you!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the priest&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106863">&quot;Tell me about this challenge.&quot;</string>
<string name="106864">&quot;Forget it. I&apos;m not taking part in any challenge!&quot;</string>
<string name="106865">&quot;How do I prove myself worthy?&quot;</string>
<string name="106866">&quot;And if I win the challenge you&apos;ll heal me?&quot;</string>
<string name="106867">&quot;This is just a sadistic game to you, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="106868">&quot;I&apos;m not going to fight for your amusement!&quot;</string>
<string name="106869">&quot;I accept your challenge.&quot;</string>
<string name="106870">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about me. You just remember to live up to your end of the bargain.&quot;</string>
<string name="106871">&quot;If I find out you&apos;ve betrayed me...&quot;</string>
<string name="106872">&quot;I&apos;ll go as far as I need to. Start the next stage!&quot;</string>
<string name="106873">&quot;This is all just a game, isn&apos;t it? I can&apos;t really win, can I?&quot;</string>
<string name="106874">&quot;How many stages are there?&quot;</string>
<string name="106875">&quot;I&apos;m ready to go to the next stage of the challenge.&quot;</string>
<string name="106876">&quot;This wasn&apos;t part of the deal!&quot;</string>
<string name="106877">&quot;Each stage? You never said anything about multiple stages!&quot;</string>
<string name="106878">&quot;Are you trying to change our deal?&quot;</string>
<string name="106879">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="106880">&quot;I should kill you for that!&quot;</string>
<string name="106881">&quot;This isn&apos;t fair! That mirror shard was mine!&quot;</string>
<string name="106882">&quot;Let&apos;s continue with the trial.&quot;</string>
<string name="106883">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106884">&quot;I&apos;ve decided to kill you.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the priest.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106885">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106886">&quot;I&apos;m looking for allies to help me against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106887">&quot;What can you tell me about that drow, Sabal?&quot;</string>
<string name="106888">&quot;Where did you get that mirror shard you had?&quot;</string>
<string name="106889">&quot;What can you tell me about this town?&quot;</string>
<string name="106890">&quot;How did you come to serve Talona?&quot;</string>
<string name="106891">&quot;Don&apos;t you think that&apos;s kind of odd?&quot;</string>
<string name="106892">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="106893">&quot;You&apos;re one to talk, Nathyrra. You switched the god you worship!&quot;</string>
<string name="106894">&quot;She&apos;s right. Your loyalty shouldn&apos;t be so fickle.&quot;</string>
<string name="106895">&quot;Good. Go. That&apos;s all I ask for. I want to be alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="106896">She lets out a harsh cackle. &quot;Kill me? Go ahead, give it a try. You can&apos;t hurt me! The spell that once made me invulnerable on my throne now makes me invulnerable in this cave!&quot;</string>
<string name="106897">She shrugs indifferently. &quot;Go ahead, take your best shot. You&apos;ll just be wasting your time.&quot;</string>
<string name="106898">The former Queen shakes her head in dismay. &quot;Fine. Go ahead. Ask your questions. I know it&apos;s the only way I&apos;ll get rid of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106899">She lets out a harsh cackle. &quot;Kill me? Go ahead, give it a try. You can&apos;t hurt me! The spell that once made me invulnerable on my throne now makes me invulnerable in this cave!&quot;</string>
<string name="106900">&quot;It&apos;s not a hard word to understand, is it? You can&apos;t hurt me. Not here. There&apos;s a spell on this cave that makes me immortal - just like there used to be a spell on my throne.&quot;</string>
<string name="106901">She snorts in contempt. &quot;You just figuring that out now? My kingdom is cursed, a town of winged elves doomed to live beneath the earth. That&apos;s the price you pay for toying with the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="106902">&quot;That&apos;s what I said, wasn&apos;t it? Came in here and ruined my peace and quiet, just like you. Sabal was her name.&quot;</string>
<string name="106903">&quot;They wanted my help, so I gave it to them. What do I care if the drow get their hands on that stupid mirror?&quot;</string>
<string name="106904">Nathyrra frowns. &quot;Sabal is one of the Red Sisters, the elite group of assassins who serve the Valsharess. I&apos;ve run into her before.&quot;</string>
<string name="106905">&quot;The Valsharess? What do I care about that? What do I care about anything that happens beyond the walls of this cave?&quot;</string>
<string name="106906">&quot;Shaori only cares about Shaori now. I explained it to that drow Sabal when she came to pester me, and now I&apos;m explaining it to you: I just want to be left alone in my cave.&quot;</string>
<string name="106907">&quot;This cave&apos;s the only place I&apos;m ever going to find any peace and quiet. Do you know how many people want to see you when you&apos;re a Queen? Audience after audience... it never ends!&quot;</string>
<string name="106908">&quot;It was bad enough when our city was up in the clouds. But now that we&apos;re down here, I just couldn&apos;t take it anymore. All those people looking to me for advice and leadership - I had to get away.&quot;</string>
<string name="106909">&quot;Don&apos;t you tell me what my duty is! I&apos;m not responsible for anyone or anything except myself! You know something? You&apos;re far more annoying than those drow were.&quot;</string>
<string name="106910">&quot;Deekin lived in cave for a long time with Old Master. It not so bad. Except when Old Master snore, and chunks fall from ceiling and hits Deekin on the head. That not be so fun.&quot;</string>
<string name="106911">The Queen&apos;s expression changes to one of deep sadness. &quot;The mirror... that damn mirror.&quot; Then she shakes her head and once more resumes the role of a bitter hermit. </string>
<string name="106912">&quot;I suppose it&apos;s my fault. Not that I really care anymore. I used the mirror to keep watch on our enemies. It allowed me to see things, to know things. It helped me rule my kingdom.&quot;</string>
<string name="106913">&quot;But the mirror betrayed us in the end. It brought us down to this sunless world. Now we are trapped here by its power, cursed to forever live this twisted existence.&quot;</string>
<string name="106914">&quot;The mirror is broken. The spell that dragged us down into the Underdark shattered the glass and scattered the pieces. I found one of the pieces, but I gave it away.&quot;</string>
<string name="106915">Shaori shrugs indifferently. &quot;If you really want to reassemble the mirror, that&apos;s your business. But you&apos;ve got your work cut out for you. I gave my piece to that drow Sabal.&quot;</string>
<string name="106916">&quot;That drow, Sabal. And why not? She asked about the mirror, so I told her. I figured a broken piece of glass wasn&apos;t doing me any good, so she might as well have it. What do I care?&quot;</string>
<string name="106917">Shaori gives a bitter laugh. &quot;Why not? What do I care about the mirror anymore? It&apos;s not my problem. When that drow Sabal came to see me, I gave the mirror piece to her.&quot;</string>
<string name="106918">&quot;I think she&apos;s planning to repair the mirror and give it to her mistress, the Valsharess. She&apos;s probably out searching the town right now, looking for the missing shards.&quot;</string>
<string name="106919">Shaori gives you a sly smile. &quot;But the mirror shards alone aren&apos;t going to help that drow. She needs the frame, too. And as far as I know that&apos;s still sitting in the throne room of the castle.&quot;</string>
<string name="106920">&quot;Your trouble with the drow has nothing to do with me. I keep to myself, now. I&apos;m just telling you what I know. Sabal wants to fix that mirror, so maybe you should want that, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="106921">&quot;If you&apos;re smart, you&apos;ll check out the throne room in the castle. That&apos;s what I&apos;d do in your position. At least, that&apos;s what I would have done, before... well, before I just stopped caring.&quot;</string>
<string name="106922">&quot;Now go on, get out of here. I&apos;ve told you everything I know. So just leave me alone.&quot; She dismisses you with a wave of her hand.</string>
<string name="106923">&quot;Somewhere in the town, I&apos;d guess. Unless Sabal beats you to them. But it won&apos;t really matter who gets the pieces if you can get the mirror&apos;s frame.&quot;</string>
<string name="106924">&quot;There&apos;s nothing you can do. There&apos;s nothing anyone can do. The town can&apos;t escape its fate, my people can&apos;t be helped. Why bother? It&apos;s pointless.&quot; </string>
<string name="106925">She lets out a harsh cackle. &quot;Kill me? Go ahead, give it a try. You can&apos;t hurt me! The spell that once made me invulnerable on my throne now makes me invulnerable in this cave!&quot;</string>
<string name="106926">She grimaces. &quot;No. No you can&apos;t. I&apos;ve told you plenty already. I&apos;m not in the business of answering questions anymore. So go away.&quot;</string>
<string name="106927">She doesn&apos;t reply right away, but seems to look deep within herself, searching for long buried feelings. &quot;I... I can&apos;t help myself, you know. It&apos;s part of the mirror&apos;s curse.&quot;</string>
<string name="106928">She shakes her head, and her moment of sanity is lost. &quot;I&apos;m sick of looking after others. I don&apos;t care what happens to my people, or you, or anyone anymore. Is that so hard to understand?&quot;</string>
<string name="106929">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106930">&quot;I&apos;m just here to kill you!&quot;</string>
<string name="106931">&quot;We&apos;ll see about that!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack her.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106932">&quot;Invulnerable? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="106933">&quot;I&apos;m looking for pieces of a broken mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="106934">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106935">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106936">&quot;I think I&apos;ll just kill you now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106937">&quot;What do you mean, you&apos;re invulnerable?&quot;</string>
<string name="106938">&quot;There&apos;s something strange going on here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106939">&quot;The drow came to see you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106940">&quot;Mirror? What mirror?&quot;</string>
<string name="106941">&quot;I&apos;m looking for allies to join me against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106942">&quot;Why would a Queen want to live in a cave?&quot;</string>
<string name="106943">&quot;Isn&apos;t a Queen&apos;s duty to lead her people?&quot;</string>
<string name="106944">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="106945">&quot;Tell me about that mirror you mentioned.&quot;</string>
<string name="106946">&quot;Where is the mirror now?&quot;</string>
<string name="106947">&quot;Maybe if we fix the mirror we can save your town.&quot;</string>
<string name="106948">&quot;You gave it away? To who?&quot;</string>
<string name="106949">&quot;Why would you give it away?&quot;</string>
<string name="106950">&quot;Seems like you&apos;re trying to stir up trouble between me and this drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="106951">&quot;Do you know where I can find any of the other pieces?&quot;</string>
<string name="106952">&quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;</string>
<string name="106953">&quot;I&apos;ve decided I&apos;m going to kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="106954">&quot;Can I ask you something else?&quot;</string>
<string name="106955">&quot;How can you turn your back on your people like this?&quot;</string>
<string name="106956">Shaori stands before you in all her royal glory, the Avariel queen restored to her former grandeur. At her side is the fool, a vacant smile on his face. She gives you a warm smile.</string>
<string name="106957">&quot;Soon I must go there to join my people, as well. It isn&apos;t safe for me here anymore. The spell that protected me from harm once again only functions in the throne room of my castle.&quot;</string>
<string name="106958">&quot;But first I wanted to see that you were safe, and to speak with you one last time so that you might know the foul hermit you met before was not my true nature.&quot;</string>
<string name="106959">&quot;Farewell, kind stranger. We Avariel are not usually trusting of outsiders, but you will always be welcome should you ever come to our home in the Lost Peaks.&quot;</string>
<string name="106960">&quot;As soon as you leave this cave, I will return to my people. Once again, you have my thanks.&quot;</string>
<string name="106961">Nathyrra gets a far off look in her eye. &quot;Perhaps when this is all over we will accept your offer. I would love to see the mountains.&quot;</string>
<string name="106962">&quot;I have heard tales of the Lost Peaks; they say it is a place of great wonders... and great danger. Though I suppose we would be safe enough in your halls, your Highness.&quot;</string>
<string name="106963">&quot;Boss, if we visits maybe the wing-elves throws us a big party! Deekin likes parties; they be fun. You think they bake us a cake, Boss? Deekin likes cake.&quot;</string>
<string name="106964">&quot;You already have the Shattered Mirror, a truly powerful artifact... though I would warn you to use it carefully. I would have thought this would be enough.&quot; </string>
<string name="106965">The Queen shakes her head. &quot;I am grateful for all you have done, but I have nothing else to give you. All my possessions are in the castle, which is back in the Lost Peaks once again.&quot;</string>
<string name="106966">She looks over at the fool, giggling and drooling on the floor. Her eyes are filled with pity. &quot;The fool is as he once was: a simple mind, incapable of all but the basest of thoughts.&quot;</string>
<string name="106967">&quot;He will never understand the gratitude we all feel towards him. Good food, a comfortable bed - these are the only things he will appreciate now. I will make sure he has only the best.&quot;</string>
<string name="106968">She nods. &quot;What are the needs of one man balanced against the needs of an entire kingdom? He made a great sacrifice, but he knew there was no other choice.&quot;</string>
<string name="106969">&quot;There is nothing else we can do. It was the power of the mirror that gave him his great wisdom - a power far greater than my own. Now that the spell is broken, he is once again as he was before.&quot;</string>
<string name="106970">&quot;What are the needs of one man balanced against the needs of an entire kingdom? He made a great sacrifice, but he knew there was no other choice. I hope you can understand that.&quot;</string>
<string name="106971">She gives a soft, lilting laugh. &quot;You are too kind. My people consider you earth-bound races to be rather uncouth. I must tell them of these fine &lt;race&gt; manners.&quot;</string>
<string name="106972">She laughs softly, the sound of a zephyr blowing across the fields. &quot;You are too kind. My people often consider our un-winged cousins to be rather uncouth. I will have to tell them of your courtly manners.&quot;</string>
<string name="106973">&quot;Hey, now you is all nice! Before you was so mean. Deekin likes you better this way.&quot;</string>
<string name="106974">&quot;The change in your manner is remarkable, your Highness. I must admit, it was hard to imagine you as a queen before.&quot;</string>
<string name="106975">The Queen nods. &quot;The power of the mirror is not to be taken lightly. You have seen the changes it wrought in me and my kingdom.&quot;</string>
<string name="106976">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="106977">&quot;You said your invulnerability is gone? Time to die!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the Queen.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="106978">&quot;So is there some reward for helping you?&quot;</string>
<string name="106979">&quot;You thought wrong. I want more.&quot;</string>
<string name="106980">&quot;What about the fool? What happens to him now?&quot;</string>
<string name="106981">&quot;I suppose you&apos;re right.&quot;</string>
<string name="106982">&quot;That&apos;s it? You&apos;re just going to leave him like that?&quot;</string>
<string name="106983">&quot;It was a pleasure to help you, my lady.&quot;</string>
<string name="106984">It is obvious from the marks on this body that the Red Sisters have already been here. Anything of value has likely been stripped from the corpse.</string>
<string name="106985">A single winged elf shuffles forward to greet you. His wings are stunted and his body shrunken and bent. He wears the colorful - and badly stained - outfit of a court jester.</string>
<string name="106986">However, though dressed like a capering buffoon his face lacks the slack-jawed expression one would expect in a monarch&apos;s fool, and his eyes seem to have an endless depth to them.</string>
<string name="106987">&quot;Please,&quot; the fool says, a hint of desperation in his voice. &quot;Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I need your help. We all do. And if you help us, maybe we can help you against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="106988">The fool sighs. &quot;I hope you change your mind. If you do, please come speak to me again.&quot;</string>
<string name="106989">He sighs wearily. &quot;Attacking me would only be a waste of time. Here in this throne room I am invulnerable. Speak to me again if you come to your senses.&quot;</string>
<string name="106990">&quot;You may have figured it out, but there may be some details you are not yet sure of. I understand how incomplete knowledge can be dangerous: it is important you have all the facts.&quot;</string>
<string name="106991">&quot;My name is Elicid. I used to be a simple-minded man who danced to amuse Queen Shaori. But I have become all-knowing and all-wise ever since we were pulled through the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="106992">&quot;When our city was up in the Lost Peaks, Queen Shaori possessed a magical mirror. With it she could keep watch on those with great power, she could see what they were doing and planning.&quot; </string>
<string name="106993">&quot;Shaori used the mirror to keep our kingdom safe, to make sure nobody could ever move against us without our knowledge. She never realized the dangers the mirror possessed.&quot; </string>
<string name="106994">&quot;The mirror took hold of Shaori&apos;s mind; part of its curse. She wanted to spy on everyone... including the archmage Halaster. Halaster sensed her spell of scrying, and he attacked with powerful counter-magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="106995">&quot;He turned the mirror against us. Our city - the castle, the temple, the library - was wrenched through the mirror, ripped from our mountain perch and cast down here into the darkness.&quot;</string>
<string name="106996">&quot;Everybody pulled through the mirror was twisted into an opposite of their true self. The Queen abandoned her throne, the fool became all-knowing. The mirror itself shattered, trapping us here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106997">&quot;If the mirror is repaired, everything will revert back to normal. We will be transported back to the Lost Peaks, Shaori will reclaim her throne and all will be as it should be.&quot;</string>
<string name="106998">&quot;I have the mirror frame, but I cannot leave this throne room to gather the pieces. Before, it was forbidden for me to be in here unless Shaori was with me. Now, I cannot leave unless she is here.&quot;</string>
<string name="106999">&quot;I need someone to bring me the five missing pieces of the mirror so I can repair it. If you do this, &lt;FullName&gt;, I will give you the mirror. It could be a valuable tool against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107000">&quot;I&apos;m not a fool, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Not anymore. No, I think I&apos;ll keep the frame for myself for now. If you bring me the missing shards, I&apos;ll give you the mirror, frame and all.&quot;</string>
<string name="107001">&quot;We knows all about Halaster and what he does to people who get him mad, don&apos;t we Boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="107002">&quot;We&apos;ve seen first hand what happens to people who end up on the mad wizard&apos;s bad side.&quot;</string>
<string name="107003">&quot;Goodbye, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Come speak to me if you need any help on your quest to find the missing shards.&quot;</string>
<string name="107004">The fool shakes his head. &quot;I can&apos;t force you to help me, but I think you&apos;re being stubborn. You need help against the Valsharess, and the mirror is a powerful magic item.&quot;</string>
<string name="107005">&quot;If you don&apos;t want to fix the mirror and give it to the Seer, then I&apos;ll just have to rely on Sabal to bring me the pieces. Then she can bring the mirror to the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107006">&quot;Uh, Boss? Deekin remembers that the whole reason we comes to this place is to find stuff to use against the Valsharess. Why you not want to try and get that stuff now?&quot;</string>
<string name="107007">&quot;Don&apos;t be stupid, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We came here to find something to help us against the Valsharess. We can&apos;t turn our backs on this.&quot;</string>
<string name="107008">&quot;We came here to find something to help us against the Valsharess. We&apos;d be foolish to turn our backs on this now.&quot;</string>
<string name="107009">&quot;I can probably answer any questions you might have, though I would like to see you stay focused on finding the missing pieces of the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107010">He gives you a rueful smile. &quot;You are right, of course. But what is the fate of one against an entire kingdom? I am wise enough to see my own unimportance.&quot;</string>
<string name="107011">&quot;Besides, if the spell is reversed I will once again be simple minded. I won&apos;t even remember what I have lost. At least, that is my hope. In any case, this is a sacrifice that has to be made.&quot;</string>
<string name="107012">The fool smiles. &quot;The spells that kept the Queen from harm now keep me from harm. I don&apos;t think the driders enjoy doing battle against an enemy they cannot defeat.&quot;</string>
<string name="107013">&quot;Of course, the same spell that protects me also binds me here. I cannot leave this place. What was once an enchantment to protect is now twisted into an inescapable trap.&quot;</string>
<string name="107014">&quot;If you each recover some of the pieces we will decide who shall be given the mirror once you both return here to me. As wise as I now am, I should be able to come up with a fair solution.&quot;</string>
<string name="107015">&quot;Of course I am. You are both in competition for the same thing. I have to use that to my advantage.&quot; He gives you a sly smile. &quot;I&apos;d be a fool not to.&quot;</string>
<string name="107016">&quot;A single shard is useless to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As part of the curse, I can only accept all five of the missing pieces at once if I am to repair the mirror. I told the same thing to Sabal.&quot;</string>
<string name="107017">&quot;There are five pieces missing from the mirror, but the curse hides their location from me. Still, I understand how the magic works, and I know where they are most likely to be.&quot;</string>
<string name="107018">&quot;The buildings here probably each have one: the temple, the library and the wizard&apos;s tower. I also believe Queen Shaori has one, and I would guess the merchant has the last.&quot;</string>
<string name="107019">&quot;The merchant was a greedy, but very shrewd, businessman. He was by far the wealthiest of all the Avariel, which is why I believe one of the shards would end up in his possession.&quot;</string>
<string name="107020">&quot;But since the curse he has abandoned his shop and given away most of his inventory. I can only hope he still has the mirror shard, or at least knows where it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="107021">&quot;Queen Shaori was a kind and devoted monarch; she cared more for her people and her kingdom than she did for her own well being. Of course, all that has changed.&quot;</string>
<string name="107022">&quot;She has been transformed into a reclusive hermit who cares nothing for the plight of her people. She now lives in a cave to the south-east of town, past the library.&quot;</string>
<string name="107023">&quot;The tower is located on the north end of town, and was once the dwelling of the mage Petyr. But although he has left the tower, it is still a place of dangerous traps and creatures.&quot;</string>
<string name="107024">&quot;The library is to the east of town. Before all this, the librarian herself was said to be the most beautiful Avariel in the entire kingdom. She lived there with her devoted husband.&quot;</string>
<string name="107025">&quot;Except for the palace, the library was hardest hit by the curse. Now it is blocked from my all-seeing vision. I shudder to think what horrors have been unleashed on that place.&quot;</string>
<string name="107026">&quot;The librarian and her husband were once good people, but I fear some terrible transformation may have fallen upon them. The curse of the mirror can be a truly terrible thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="107027">&quot;Located on the west edge of town, it was once a shrine to Aerdrie Faenya, goddess of air and birds. The priest, Lomylithrar, was a man devoted to healing others and easing their pain.&quot;</string>
<string name="107028">&quot;Now he has become a sadistic follower of Talona, mistress of poison and pestilence. He is very dangerous and completely evil: be careful in all your dealings with him.&quot;</string>
<string name="107029">&quot;Surely you know who I&apos;m talking about, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The drow who ambushed you when you first came here were led by Sabal, one of the Red Sisters who serves the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107030">&quot;She wants to bring the mirror to her mistress, to use it against the Seer. I have made her the same offer I am making you. If she brings me the missing pieces, I will give her the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107031">&quot;I care only for the Avariel trapped down here. The agent of our salvation is irrelevant to me. Once the mirror is repaired we will be transported far away from this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="107032">Nathyrra nods. &quot;I&apos;ve run into Sabal before. I should have recognized her sooner.&quot;</string>
<string name="107033">&quot;We will settle this with battle, &lt;FirstName&gt;! The Red Sisters will taste your blood!&quot;</string>
<string name="107034">The fool holds up a hand to quell Sabal&apos;s attack. &quot;The spell of immunity in this room will make killing each other impossible. Though if you are both set on battle I can lift its effects. </string>
<string name="107035">Sabal snarls at you. &quot;You&apos;re nothing but a coward. There is only one way you&apos;ll ever get any of the mirror shards from me: over my dead body!&quot;</string>
<string name="107036">The fool sighs. &quot;It seems a battle is inevitable. But before I lift the spell of protection from you both, there is something you should know.&quot;</string>
<string name="107037">&quot;The pillars in this room have powerful magical properties you can use against your enemy. You can use the shards you have recovered to unlock these properties.&quot;</string>
<string name="107038">&quot;Whichever one of you has more pieces of the mirror will be able to use more of the pillars to aid you during the battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="107039">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but in life we rarely get to pick the time and place of our confrontations. The battle begins now.&quot;</string>
<string name="107040">&quot;Wait!&quot; Sabal interjects. &quot;I need more time! I need reinforcements. We have to prepare.&quot;</string>
<string name="107041">&quot;Hey, Boss. Drow lady is scared of you, now. Maybe she knows we going to kick her butt!&quot;</string>
<string name="107042">&quot;You don&apos;t seem quite so eager for battle now, drow. Did you finally realize you are overmatched?&quot;</string>
<string name="107043">&quot;What&apos;s the matter, Sabal? Are you just realizing now that you&apos;re in over your head?&quot;</string>
<string name="107044">&quot;Nobody talks to Boss like that! Not when Deekin is around!&quot;</string>
<string name="107045">&quot;I&apos;ve heard about you, kobold. A walking joke, they say. But I don&apos;t find you amusing enough to let you live!&quot;</string>
<string name="107046">&quot;Think about your move carefully, drow. It may be the last one you make!&quot;</string>
<string name="107047">&quot;You don&apos;t scare me, tiefling! You will bleed just as easily as &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="107048">&quot;Make the first move, Sabal. You won&apos;t be the first Red Sister to fall beneath my blade!&quot;</string>
<string name="107049">&quot;When I deliver the mirror to my mistress I will be sure to tell her of your death, Nathyrra. She will take extra pleasure in knowing you are no more!&quot;</string>
<string name="107050">&quot;Why must you explain anything to this fool? Let me kill &lt;him/her&gt; and this will all be over!&quot;</string>
<string name="107051">&quot;Quiet, Sabal. &lt;FullName&gt; has as much right to know what is going on as you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107052">&quot;My name is Elicid. I used to be a simple-minded man who danced to amuse Queen Shaori. But I have become all-knowing and all-wise ever since we were pulled through the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107053">&quot;When our city was up in the Lost Peaks, Queen Shaori possessed a magical mirror. With it she could keep watch on those with great power, she could see what they were doing and planning.&quot; </string>
<string name="107054">&quot;Shaori used the mirror to keep our kingdom safe, to make sure nobody could ever move against us without our knowledge. She never realized the dangers the mirror possessed.&quot; </string>
<string name="107055">&quot;Shaori made the mistake of using the mirror to spy on the archmage Halaster. Halaster sensed her spell of scrying, and he attacked with powerful counter-magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="107056">&quot;He turned the mirror against us. Our city - the castle, the temple, the library - was wrenched through the mirror, ripped from our mountain perch and cast down here into the darkness.&quot;</string>
<string name="107057">&quot;Everybody pulled through the mirror was twisted into an opposite of their true self. The Queen abandoned her throne, the fool became all-knowing. The mirror itself shattered, trapping us here.&quot;</string>
<string name="107058">&quot;Between you and Sabal you have now collected all the missing pieces of the mirror from the town. With them, I can finally break the curse that has trapped the town here.&quot;</string>
<string name="107059">&quot;And as a reward for helping me, I will give the mirror to either you or Sabal... though which one of you will get the mirror has yet to be decided.&quot;</string>
<string name="107060">He shakes his head. &quot;But such concerns are not mine. Once I restore the mirror, I will again be nothing more than a dancing fool.&quot;</string>
<string name="107061">He sighs. &quot;What I want doesn&apos;t matter. Things must be put right. Order must be restored, even if that means I will once again be a fool.&quot; Though his voice is steady, there is a hint of fear in his eyes.</string>
<string name="107062">&quot;Now that the shards have all been collected here in the throne room, I can begin the incantation to repair the mirror. Thank you, &lt;FullName&gt;. The Avariel are forever in debt to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107063">&quot;A noble sacrifice. I hope it is not forgotten by the others once the kingdom is restored.&quot;</string>
<string name="107064">&quot;You are brave, little man. I hope your sacrifice is not forgotten when the kingdom is restored.&quot;</string>
<string name="107065">&quot;I don&apos;t have time for this.&quot;</string>
<string name="107066">&quot;Forget it. I&apos;m out of here.&quot;</string>
<string name="107067">&quot;How do you know about the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="107068">&quot;Time to die, clown!&quot;</string>
<string name="107069">&quot;I think I know what&apos;s going on in this town.&quot;</string>
<string name="107070">&quot;Who are you? How do you know my name?&quot;</string>
<string name="107071">&quot;Go on.&quot;</string>
<string name="107072">&quot;I don&apos;t get it. How did you become all-knowing?&quot;</string>
<string name="107073">&quot;Mirror? What mirror?&quot;</string>
<string name="107074">&quot;If you have a point, just get to it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107075">&quot;What does this have to do with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="107076">&quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;</string>
<string name="107077">&quot;So what happens if the mirror is fixed?&quot;</string>
<string name="107078">&quot;Why don&apos;t you just give the frame to me?&quot;</string>
<string name="107079">&quot;So basically, she was spying on people.&quot;</string>
<string name="107080">&quot;Danger? What kind of danger?&quot;</string>
<string name="107081">&quot;I&apos;ll be back after I have all five pieces of the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107082">&quot;I&apos;m not going to help you with this.&quot;</string>
<string name="107083">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="107084">&quot;If the mirror gets fixed, won&apos;t you go back to being a fool?&quot;</string>
<string name="107085">&quot;How come there are no driders in here?&quot;</string>
<string name="107086">&quot;What if Sabal has some of the pieces and I have the others?&quot;</string>
<string name="107087">&quot;Sounds like you&apos;re playing Sabal and I against each other.&quot;</string>
<string name="107088">&quot;I have a mirror shard here for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107089">&quot;Where can I find the mirror pieces?&quot;</string>
<string name="107090">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="107091">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="107092">&quot;Tell me more about the merchant.&quot;</string>
<string name="107093">&quot;Tell me more about Queen Shaori.&quot;</string>
<string name="107094">&quot;Tell me more about the wizard&apos;s tower.&quot;</string>
<string name="107095">&quot;Tell me more about the library.&quot;</string>
<string name="107096">&quot;Tell me more about the temple.&quot;</string>
<string name="107097">&quot;Sabal? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="107098">&quot;You&apos;d work with drow?&quot;</string>
<string name="107099">&quot;I&apos;m always up for killing!&quot;</string>
<string name="107100">&quot;Isn&apos;t there some other way to settle this?&quot;</string>
<string name="107101">&quot;Wait, I&apos;m not ready for this battle yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="107102">&quot;Good! Let&apos;s get this fight started.&quot;</string>
<string name="107103">&quot;Forget it - I just want to kill that drow beside you!&quot;</string>
<string name="107104">&quot;Yes - what&apos;s going on here?&quot;</string>
<string name="107105">&quot;Go on.&quot;</string>
<string name="107106">&quot;I don&apos;t get it. How did you become all-knowing?&quot;</string>
<string name="107107">&quot;Mirror? What mirror?&quot;</string>
<string name="107108">&quot;If you have a point, just get to it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107109">&quot;What does this have to do with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="107110">&quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;</string>
<string name="107111">&quot;So how does this drow figure in all this?&quot;</string>
<string name="107112">&quot;So basically, she was spying on people.&quot;</string>
<string name="107113">&quot;Danger? What kind of danger.&quot;</string>
<string name="107114">&quot;So what happens now?&quot;</string>
<string name="107115">&quot;Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="107116">The fool grins at you - a grin devoid of intelligence or recognition. He begins to caper and dance before you, seemingly oblivious to his former state of grace.</string>
<string name="107117">But beneath the vacant expression you half-sense something else. In his eyes you see a faint glimmer of understanding, and a yearning for what was lost but not entirely forgotten.</string>
<string name="107118">This area is full of humanoid tracks.</string>
<string name="107119">A group of drow has passed through this area, although you can&apos;t tell their numbers or heading.</string>
<string name="107120">A large drow raiding party has passed through this area recently. There appears to have been about a dozen drow in this group as they headed to the east.</string>

<string name="107123">A group of drow has passed through this area, although you can&apos;t tell their numbers or heading.</string>
<string name="107124">A dozen drow passed here. It seems that they scanned the area for a while and then they split into two groups. One climbed the ledge to the left and one climbed the opposite ledge to the right.</string>

<string name="107129">A group of about a dozen drow passed through this area. They went into the cave to the south.</string>
<string name="107130">The wizard gives you a friendly nod. &quot;Welcome back. It&apos;s good to see you again, we don&apos;t get many visitors here. Is there anything I can do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="107131">The wizard sighs and shakes his head sadly. &quot;I was afraid this would happen. I tried to warn him how dangerous magic is, but he wouldn&apos;t listen.&quot;</string>
<string name="107132">&quot;Good, good. Better you should have it than him. You be careful with it, though. Magic is just too dangerous to be toying around with. Is there anything else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="107133">This winged elf wears the clothing of a wizard, though what a wizard would be doing simply standing in the street is anyone&apos;s guess. He gives you a warm smile and a welcoming wave.</string>
<string name="107134">&quot;Hello, there. We don&apos;t get too many visitors over here by the tower. Allow me to introduce myself: I am Petyr Trenkhold, the renowned archmage. Or should I say, former archmage.&quot;</string>
<string name="107135">&quot;Oh, yes. Of course. You have things to do, I&apos;m sure. Well, off you go then.&quot;</string>
<string name="107136">The former wizard man backs off, though he has some parting words. &quot;You have a fiery temper, my &lt;race&gt; friend. You should learn to control it, or it may one day destroy you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107137">&quot;Yes, of course. I may have turned my back on the arcane arts, but that doesn&apos;t mean I&apos;ve forgotten everything I learned during my studies.&quot;</string>
<string name="107138">&quot;I once dwelt within this very tower, before I realized the errors of my ways and abandoned all my magical research. And I can tell you from personal experience it is a very dangerous place.&quot;</string>
<string name="107139">&quot;Like any wizard&apos;s home, my tower is filled with a variety of nefarious traps and deadly monsters; fairly standard stuff. But there is one thing that makes my tower somewhat unusual.&quot;</string>
<string name="107140">&quot;I cast powerful enchantments throughout the tower that can twist magic itself, making it react in strange ways. Be warned, my friend: spells cast inside the tower could have very unexpected results.&quot;</string>
<string name="107141">&quot;And of course my apprentice is still in there somewhere, seeking out the secrets that are best left undiscovered. He has chosen to continue the work that I left behind.&quot;</string>
<string name="107142">The ex-wizard sighs. &quot;He used to be such a good boy. Obedient, respectful of others. I must confess, I never appreciated him for what he was. But now he&apos;s changed.&quot;</string>
<string name="107143">&quot;When I gave up the magician&apos;s life, he embraced it. Strange lights and colored smoke pour out of the tower from time to time, so I know he&apos;s trying bizarre and dangerous experiments.&quot;</string>
<string name="107144">&quot;I can&apos;t understand what happened to him. He just became obsessed with magic. Maybe it has something to do with that broken piece of the magic mirror I gave him.&quot;</string>
<string name="107145">&quot;I would assume so. He hasn&apos;t come out of the tower since I found that piece of glass on the street and gave it to him. But I doubt he&apos;ll give it up. Not willingly, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="107146">&quot;But please, if you go into the tower after him be careful. For both your sakes. I don&apos;t want anyone to get hurt. My apprentice is a good boy, he really is. He&apos;s just not himself lately.&quot;</string>
<string name="107147">&quot;He&apos;s dead, you said so yourself. What more can I tell you?&quot; The wizard sighs. &quot;He was such a good boy. Never should have gotten mixed up with magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="107148">&quot;But you should know all this, seeing as how you&apos;ve been inside already.&quot;</string>
<string name="107149">&quot;Ah, yes, the mirror shard. Shortly after we arrived here in the Underdark - and I promise, I know nothing about how that happened - I found a single piece of glass out here in the street.&quot;</string>
<string name="107150">&quot;I could see it had magical properties, but I&apos;ve given up the arcane so I have little use for such trinkets. I gave the mirror shard to my apprentice. He&apos;s become quite interested in such things recently.&quot;</string>
<string name="107151">&quot;The only shard I knew about was the one my apprentice had inside the tower. I wasn&apos;t really interested in any others, seeing as how I&apos;ve given up on magic. Sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="107152">&quot;Pleased to meet you, &lt;FullName&gt;. I&apos;m not sure what you&apos;re doing here, but if you&apos;re thinking of going into this tower behind me I&apos;d strongly advise against it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107153">&quot;I used to be obsessed with the power of magic. I burned with the desire to master the arcane arts, nothing else mattered to me. I abandoned my fellow Avariel and locked myself away in this tower.&quot;</string>
<string name="107154">&quot;But when our town was moved from the Lost Peaks into these underground caverns - something I had nothing to do with, I assure you - I had a revelation.&quot;</string>
<string name="107155">&quot;What use is the most powerful spell if you are locked away for years to perfect it? I&apos;d rather be a simple man with friends and a life than a powerful wizard in self-imposed exile.&quot;</string>
<string name="107156">&quot;Unfortunately, my apprentice didn&apos;t see things my way. He decided to devote himself to the life I left behind, and he locked himself away in the tower.&quot;</string>
<string name="107157">He shrugs. &quot;I suppose I was just ready for a change. Now I get fresh air, I get to meet people, and I&apos;m not locked away with all my potions and tomes and scrolls.&quot;</string>
<string name="107158">Petyr gets a concerned expression on his face. &quot;It does seem rather strange, though. I spent years devoted to my research. But now... it just doesn&apos;t seem that important for some reason.&quot;</string>
<string name="107159">&quot;Your apprentice is dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="107160">&quot;Your apprentice gave me the shard from the magic mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107161">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="107162">&quot;Out of my way, old man!&quot;</string>
<string name="107163">&quot;Can I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="107164">&quot;I&apos;ve got no further use for you. Time to die.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="107165">&quot;What can you tell me about the tower?&quot;</string>
<string name="107166">&quot;Tell me about your apprentice.&quot;</string>
<string name="107167">&quot;Does your apprentice still have this mirror shard?&quot;</string>
<string name="107168">&quot;Why did you give up on magic?&quot;</string>
<string name="107169">&quot;I&apos;m looking for pieces of a broken mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107170">&quot;I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;. Pleased to meet you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107171">&quot;Why? What&apos;s wrong with the tower?&quot;</string>
<string name="107172">&quot;Former archmage? What do you mean by that?&quot;</string>
<string name="107173">&quot;How can you just throw away your entire life&apos;s work?&quot;</string>
<string name="107174">Higher and higher the fire climbs. Burn! Burn! </string>
<string name="107175">Paper, pages, words - it all goes up in smoke!</string>
<string name="107176">From books we learn, now watch them burn!</string>
<string name="107177">&quot;And so she is dead. You have done well, mortal.&quot;</string>
<string name="107178">&quot;I thought you were bound to do her bidding?&quot;</string>
<string name="107179">&quot;An extension of yourself...?&quot;</string>
<string name="107180">&quot;You mean... the Relic of the Reaper?&quot;</string>
<string name="107181">&quot;There is no way you could have planned this!&quot;</string>
<string name="107182">&quot;Then I must send you back to the hell from which you came.&quot;</string>
<string name="107183">&quot;But we are still allies, correct?&quot;</string>
<string name="107184">&quot;So what does that mean now?&quot;</string>
<string name="107185">&quot;You have advice for me, I suppose?&quot;</string>
<string name="107186">&quot;If you have something to say, be quick!&quot;</string>
<string name="107187">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="107188">&quot;I don&apos;t know... you might be right...&quot;</string>
<string name="107189">&quot;Very well. You have yourself a deal.&quot;</string>
<string name="107190">&quot;I don&apos;t know. I&apos;d have to think about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107191">&quot;I&apos;m not listening to anything you have to say, devil!&quot;</string>
<string name="107192">&quot;Forget it. I don&apos;t trust you any more than her.&quot;</string>
<string name="107193">&quot;Doesn&apos;t she have you bound? How is it that you have a choice in this?&quot;</string>
<string name="107194">&quot;I will believe the Valsharess until she gives me reason not to.&quot;</string>
<string name="107195">&quot;You think I will listen to a devil&apos;s lies? Hah!&quot;</string>
<string name="107196">&quot;I&apos;m not so easy to double-cross.&quot;</string>
<string name="107197">&quot;Not if I betray her, first.&quot;</string>
<string name="107198">&quot;Vendui&apos;, surfacer. I greet you. Are you aware of who I am?&quot;</string>
<string name="107199">Her glare is icy cold, though she maintains her composure. &quot;Were you a lesser creature, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;, you would be slaughtered for such insolence. But I have not come to exchange threats with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107200">&quot;I am the Valsharess, as you must already know. And you... you have proven a most frustrating adversary, worthy of my attention.&quot;</string>
<string name="107201">&quot;Have you a name? Or must I continue to refer to you simply as &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="107202">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;? So be it. A name to put to a face that I have become familiar with. I am pleased we finally meet.&quot;</string>
<string name="107203">She steps toward you, her eyes suddenly traveling the length of your body as she mischievously grins. &quot;You have proven yourself to me, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;. A powerful &lt;male/female&gt; able to shake all the Underdark before &lt;him/her&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="107204">&quot;Together, our power would be unstoppable. With you at my side, all of the Underdark would be ours... and the surface world, as well.&quot; Her eyes meet yours, bright with eager ambition. &quot;What do you say to that, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="107205">&quot;Indeed?&quot; Her grin warms. &quot;It is good to know that you can be reasonable. I see it pointless to do battle when I need only be... flexible.&quot;</string>
<string name="107206">She leans in close, and you can smell an exotic, dusky perfume. &quot;We have much that we could teach each other, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;. There are many reasons for us to join forces, and the rewards... are limitless.&quot;</string>
<string name="107207">The Valsharess stares at you coldly. &quot;So you have made your decision. You are a fool, surfacer.&quot;</string>
<string name="107208">&quot;Die, then, with the rebels! I shall see you on your knees before me... and then you shall truly know what it is to suffer!&quot;</string>
<string name="107209">&quot;Then you need but do one thing. When my forces attack Lith My&apos;athar, open the gates for them. That will prove your intentions.&quot;</string>
<string name="107210">She smiles wickedly. &quot;I can provide well for you, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;. If you wish, I can send you a robe of great power now... and later all you desire, and more.&quot;</string>
<string name="107211">&quot;You have chosen wisely, surfacer. You need continue your charade with the rebels for only a short while before my army arrives at Lith My&apos;athar. Do not give yourself away.&quot;</string>
<string name="107212">&quot;Now I will remove this foolish geas Halaster placed you under. After that is done, you need only remember: the gates must be opened.&quot;</string>
<string name="107213">&quot;You will not regret your decision. Ensure that I do not regret mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="107214">&quot;I shall remove the geas I see that you are under now. After that you need only remember: the gates must be opened when my army arrives.&quot;</string>
<string name="107215">&quot;Then allow me to fill you with power. I can increase your abilities, for a time. And then when we are together, you will have all the power you wish. Better?&quot;</string>
<string name="107216">Slight irritation crosses her face. &quot;So be it. But decide, and quickly.&quot;</string>
<string name="107217">Her smile widens. &quot;This I can remove from you. Worry not.&quot;</string>
<string name="107218">She steps away from you, her expression shifting to one of brutal coldness. &quot;Then join me because it is the intelligent thing to do. Do you truly think you can succeed with only these pathetic rebels to aid you?&quot;</string>
<string name="107219">&quot;You believe they hold you in high regard? They find you useful. When you are done, they will be done with you. You are smarter than that, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;, are you not?&quot;</string>
<string name="107220">She chuckles under her breath. &quot;You say that now, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;, but are we truly so different? Is there nothing about my offer that you might find tempting?&quot;</string>
<string name="107221">Her grin warms. &quot;Not at all. Do you think I would struggle against the inevitable, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;? Why, when we might have so much in common?&quot;</string>
<string name="107222">She laughs heartily. &quot;I see that an alliance with you would be most... stimulating, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;. You wish to be on top... as do I. I respect that.&quot;</string>
<string name="107223">She smiles, shrugging slightly. &quot;As you desire. I wished only to put a name to a face that I have become quite familiar with. It is good that we finally meet, you and I.&quot;</string>
<string name="107224">&quot;&lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;? It means only &apos;&lt;male/female&gt;&apos; in your tongue, nothing more. I would prefer to call you by your name, if you are willing to give it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107225">She smiles, pleased. &quot;As you wish. I am Sinvyl, Matron Mother of House Barrit&apos;tar and Valsharess of the Ilythiiri.&quot;</string>
<string name="107226">She makes a disappointed moue. &quot;Is it to be all business, then? I have come all this way just to have us meet. This is not meant to be an unpleasant occasion.&quot;</string>
<string name="107227">She makes a disappointed moue. &quot;There is no need for such hostility, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;. This is not meant to be an unpleasant occasion, this meeting of ours.&quot;</string>
<string name="107228">&quot;&lt;FullName&gt;? So be it. A name to put to a face that I have become familiar with. I am pleased we finally meet.&quot;</string>
<string name="107229">The drow smirks and arches an eyebrow at you. &quot;Indeed? I will take that as a compliment rather than an indication of complete ignorance, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="107230">She chuckles, a low and sinister sound. &quot;You are either a fool without sense, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;, or a generous flatterer. I am no goddess... yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="107231">&quot;Indeed. You are no fool. You also have proven to be a most frustrating adversary, &lt;CUSTOM5002&gt;, and worthy of my attention.&quot;</string>
<string name="107232">&quot;This? This is but an illusion projected to you, surfacer, so we may meet in safety. There is no need to be alarmed, even if you know who I am.&quot;</string>
<string name="107233">Begone.</string>
<string name="107234">&quot;Someone who I&apos;d enjoy killing?&quot;</string>
<string name="107235">&quot;Enough with this. Why are you here?&quot;</string>
<string name="107236">&quot;My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="107237">&quot;I might consider such an alliance...&quot;</string>
<string name="107238">&quot;I would rather send you to the Nine Hells!&quot;</string>
<string name="107239">&quot;I am not interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="107240">&quot;Perhaps you are right...&quot;</string>
<string name="107241">&quot;Forget it! I would rather die than aid you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107242">&quot;Betray the rebels? I cannot do that.&quot;</string>
<string name="107243">&quot;I need some kind of immediate reward if we&apos;re going to be allies.&quot;</string>
<string name="107244">&quot;No... I&apos;ve decided I&apos;d really rather just kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107245">&quot;Very well. You have yourself an ally.&quot;</string>
<string name="107246">&quot;Not good enough, sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="107247">&quot;I would prefer something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="107248">&quot;Maybe the robe was good enough, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="107249">&quot;I would gladly do this, but I am under a geas to fight you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107250">&quot;You can remove the geas? Then what are we waiting for?!&quot;</string>
<string name="107251">&quot;You think you are attractive to me? Don&apos;t be foolish.&quot;</string>
<string name="107252">&quot;Sorry, but you just aren&apos;t my type.&quot;</string>
<string name="107253">&quot;I seem to be doing pretty well so far.&quot;</string>
<string name="107254">&quot;Betray my friends? Betray the Seer and the rebels?&quot;</string>
<string name="107255">&quot;I could never work with such as you!&quot;</string>
<string name="107256">&quot;You and I working together? Are you joking?&quot;</string>
<string name="107257">&quot;I&apos;d rather you were at *my* side.&quot;</string>
<string name="107258">&quot;Call me whatever you wish. I don&apos;t care.&quot;</string>
<string name="107259">&quot;What does that mean, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="107260">&quot;Give me your name first. I understand &apos;Valsharess&apos; is only a title.&quot;</string>
<string name="107261">&quot;Good. Now tell me why you are here.&quot;</string>
<string name="107262">&quot;And you can call me your enemy.&quot;</string>
<string name="107263">&quot;And I am &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="107264">&quot;One fine looking drow, if I might say so.&quot;</string>
<string name="107265">&quot;It... it isn&apos;t Lolth herself, is it?!&quot;</string>
<string name="107266">&quot;You must be the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107267">&quot;What is this? How did you get in here!?&quot;</string>
<string name="107268">&quot;You wish to discuss an alliance again?&quot;</string>
<string name="107269">&quot;The rebels are winning, drow. Your time is done.&quot;</string>
<string name="107270">&quot;You are a fool to bring me close enough to kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107271">&quot;Where am I?! How did I get here?!&quot;</string>
<string name="107272">&quot;What do you want from me?&quot;</string>
<string name="107273">&quot;It is not too late for us to negotiate.&quot;</string>
<string name="107274">&quot;You&apos;re the fool now. Time for you to die.&quot;</string>
<string name="107275">&quot;You cannot take me prisoner!&quot;</string>
<string name="107276">&quot;You owe me, Valsharess. I kept my side of the bargain.&quot;</string>
<string name="107277">&quot;And what&apos;s to stop me from killing you now?&quot;</string>
<string name="107278">&quot;And who is this devil you have here?&quot;</string>
<string name="107279">&quot;I am more interested in the power and wealth you offered.&quot;</string>
<string name="107280">&quot;Is that what I am to be, as well? A hound on a leash?&quot;</string>
<string name="107281">&quot;And how did you bind such a powerful being?&quot;</string>
<string name="107282">&quot;So I see. What do you propose we do now?&quot;</string>
<string name="107283">&quot;Why did you really bring me here?&quot;</string>
<string name="107284">&quot;Nothing at all. Just a friendly chat.&quot;</string>
<string name="107285">&quot;I don&apos;t like the tone of your voice.&quot;</string>
<string name="107286">&quot;Your archdevil is trying to betray you, that&apos;s what&apos;s happening.&quot;</string>
<string name="107287">&quot;Wait! This isn&apos;t what it looks like...!&quot;</string>
<string name="107288">&quot;We&apos;ve decided we don&apos;t need you, drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="107289">&quot;It just seems you don&apos;t command your archdevil like you thought.&quot;</string>
<string name="107290">&quot;Wouldn&apos;t you like to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="107291">The rothe ignores you, and continues chewing its cud.</string>
<string name="107292">The animal&apos;s thoughts briefly focus on you as you approach. Once it realizes you are not the herder bringing the next meal, it returns to chewing its cud.</string>
<string name="107293">The rothe thinks you smell much nicer than a giant floating eyeball. Not as nice as a rothe, but very nice all the same.</string>
<string name="107294">The rothe is disgusted with the way the beholders keep its herd locked away in these pens until they need a little snack. What kind of civilization would do such a thing?</string>
<string name="107295">The beast tells you that the herd has had an anger management problem. It thinks there might be a mad-rothe-disease epidemic.</string>
<string name="107296">The rothe tells you that it suspects the giant eyes are really just drow with really bad allergies.</string>
<string name="107297">The rothe whispers a secret passed down from one rothe to another in his herd. Apparently they believe that if you follow the tunnels far enough, you will reach the magical happy-grazing-lands.</string>
<string name="107298">The beast looks in the direction of where the beholders live and wishes it could give them a good kick in the eye.</string>
<string name="107299">&quot;Yes, master?&quot;</string>
<string name="107300">&quot;Yes, my friend?&quot;</string>
<string name="107301">&quot;Of course.&quot;</string>

<string name="107410">Ignite the wick.</string>
<string name="107411">Pick up the keg of Alchemist&apos;s Fire.</string>
<string name="107412">Nathyrra&apos;s eyes follow you, calculating. She merely nods and watches you go.</string>
<string name="107413">Nathyrra sighs. It is obvious she would rather not talk about this subject. &quot;I once served as an assassin for the Valsharess, yes. But those days are behind me now.&quot;</string>
<string name="107414">She nods, relieved to be off the subject of her tainted past.</string>
<string name="107415">&quot;I helped you in Undermountain. I&apos;ve offered to help you against the Valsharess. And I have proved myself to the Seer and the others here many times over.&quot;</string>
<string name="107416">&quot;But I cannot *make* you trust me. My loyalty lies with the Seer now. If you do not believe I have truly left the Red Sisters behind, that is your problem, not mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="107417">&quot;You are not the first to question me... though I suppose even now I haven&apos;t gotten used to the mistrust of others. But I would rather not speak of this. Not now, at least.&quot;</string>
<string name="107418">The drow shakes her head. &quot;My decision to leave was a powerful, personal - and private - experience. I&apos;m not ready to discuss it with you someone I barely know, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="107419">&quot;It looks to me like you have enough assistance at the moment. I must protect the Seer... that is my first responsibility. If you truly have need of me later, however, I will gladly go with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107420">Nathyrra grins, seemingly relieved. &quot;I was hoping you would ask. I would gladly journey with you. Far better to be active than to wait here for the Valsharess to act.&quot;</string>
<string name="107421">&quot;I will help you against the Valsharess as I always have, but first you should know something of the challenge that lies ahead.&quot; </string>
<string name="107422">&quot;I do not believe there is much we can do to dissuade those drow that support the Valsharess. The support of the Houses will wax and wane based on her success, little else.&quot;</string>
<string name="107423">&quot;A large portion of her power, however, comes from races other than the drow... the illithids, the beholders and her undead horde. And against these allies we may be able to strike a blow.&quot;</string>
<string name="107424">&quot;I hope I have been of assistance, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="107425">&quot;There&apos;s nothing I know of that could combat his powers directly, and by all reports, he does not leave the Valsharess&apos;s side. Fight her, and you also fight him.&quot;</string>
<string name="107426">&quot;One thing to consider, however, is the possibility of there being artifacts of great power that could be found and used to match the devil.&quot;</string>
<string name="107427">&quot;I wish I could tell you where to look for such things, but I can&apos;t. Others, like Valen, could probably help you more.&quot;</string>
<string name="107428">&quot;That isn&apos;t entirely clear. We&apos;ve heard rumors of a cult of necromancers nearby that is supplying the Valsharess with these undead, though where they get their &apos;parts&apos; from is unknown.&quot;</string>
<string name="107429">&quot;We believe the cult is also located in the caverns to the west of here, though where precisely I couldn&apos;t say. But if we find them we can find the source of the undead, and destroy it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107430">Nathyrra yawns and stretches languidly. &quot;She doesn&apos;t anymore, thanks to your having dealt with the dracolich.&quot;</string>
<string name="107431">&quot;I do not think the Valsharess commands many of these beholders, though many are not needed. Each of them carries the ability to fire magical rays from its eyestalks which have varying effects.&quot;</string>
<string name="107432">&quot;All of them come from a single hive located somewhere to the west of here. If we destroy the Eye Tyrant ruling over them, the colony will collapse and the Valsharess will lose their support.&quot; </string>
<string name="107433">Nathyrra thinks for a moment, and begins counting on her fingers. &quot;Disintegration. Paralyzation. Pain. I&apos;ve seen their central eye banish all magic, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="107434">&quot;Beyond that I suppose you&apos;ll have to see for yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="107435">&quot;I doubt we have anything to offer. The mere fact that the Eye Tyrant ruling them has chosen to ally herself with the Valsharess means she believes our enemy to be far stronger than we are.&quot;</string>
<string name="107436">&quot;Carefully. If you can place some kind of magical resistance on yourself, that will offer protection against their eye-rays, which they will use against you first, trying to keep a distance.&quot;</string>
<string name="107437">&quot;The rays are not their only weapon, however. Some beholders are accomplished wizards... and as a last resort, their bite can also be quite deadly.&quot;</string>
<string name="107438">&quot;The average beholder has no special armor or protection against magic and weapons, however. What kills most will also kill them.&quot;</string>
<string name="107439">&quot;There is nothing more for us to fear from the Eye Tyrant or her followers, thanks to you. We do not need to discuss them.&quot;</string>
<string name="107440">&quot;The creatures you call mind flayers are a race of telepaths, capable of reading thoughts and controlling minds. They are known for keeping a horde of dominated thralls as servants and guards.&quot;</string>
<string name="107441">&quot;These creatures are ruled over by entities known as Overminds. The Valsharess has many illithid in her army, so it is likely she has recruited the aid of several Overminds.&quot;</string>
<string name="107442">&quot;To the west of here is Zorvak&apos;Mur, a small illithid colony. If we can find the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind, it could be persuaded to convince the other Overminds to withdraw the illithid support of the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107443">&quot;Such as?&quot;</string>
<string name="107444">She shrugs. &quot;I&apos;ve never had to, truth be told. I assume that they fall to the blade like any other creature... their bodies seem weak, in fact. It is their mental powers you must beware of.&quot;</string>
<string name="107445">&quot;I believe Imloth has had more experience with combating their like. Ask him, if you truly want some advice on tactics.&quot;</string>
<string name="107446">She shrugs. &quot;I won&apos;t argue with that. But slaughtering the entire colony of Zorvak&apos;Mur won&apos;t accomplish anything. The other Overminds would still side with the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107447">She looks at you quizzically. &quot;You have already removed the mind flayers as a factor in her army. There is no need to discuss them further, I&apos;m sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="107448">&quot;Many of those who support the Valsharess, like the illithid and the beholders, dwell in the caverns to the west of the village. The western caverns are also the likely source of her undead horde.&quot;</string>
<string name="107449">&quot;We may be able to remove these allies from her cause. I know something about each of these groups, so don&apos;t be afraid to ask me for information if you need it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107450">The drow regards you with a curious expression as you approach her, a pale brow arched.</string>
<string name="107451">&quot;So if you weren&apos;t under the geas, you&apos;re telling me that it would not matter to you in the slightest that the Valsharess threatens your world as well as mine?&quot;</string>
<string name="107452">&quot;Oh, really? It doesn&apos;t concern you that she is a danger to your world as well as mine?&quot;</string>
<string name="107453">&quot;You want to wait for the Valsharess on the surface, for when she&apos;s at her strongest? Even if that wasn&apos;t the case, doesn&apos;t the fact that she wishes you dead worry you in the slightest?&quot;</string>
<string name="107454">Annoyance flashes across her face. &quot;It doesn&apos;t rest solely on you. Our lives are on the line here, as well. The Seer and her people abandoned their homes on the surface to fight the Valsharess, should you do any less?&quot;</string>
<string name="107455">&quot;And even if that means nothing to you, what about the fact that the Valsharess wishes you dead? Does that not worry you in the slightest?&quot;</string>
<string name="107456">&quot;You drove the Valsharess out of Undermountain, but she will find another way so your task is not done. And even if it were, does the fact that she wants you dead not worry you at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="107457">&quot;How about yourself, then? Does the fact that the Valsharess wants you dead not worry you in the slightest?&quot;</string>
<string name="107458">&quot;I see. Even were that the case, does the fact that the Valsharess wants you dead not worry you in the slightest?&quot;</string>
<string name="107459">&quot;My understanding is that the Valsharess has already attacked your surface world. Even if she could not do so again, doesn&apos;t the fact she wants you dead worry you?&quot;</string>
<string name="107460">She seems about to speak and then regards you with a slightly suspicious expression. &quot;Now I&apos;m not sure if you&apos;re being serious or not. The Valsharess is no joke.&quot;</string>
<string name="107461">She smirks. &quot;Bravado. Does the fact that the Valsharess wishes you dead not worry you in the slightest?&quot;</string>
<string name="107462">&quot;You&apos;ve seen the proof, have you not? Your surface world attacked, the great Halaster taken hostage... and were you not attacked by the Valsharess&apos;s forces? Are none of these things proof of our words?&quot;</string>
<string name="107463">&quot;Good. And even was that not enough, wouldn&apos;t the fact that the Valsharess wishes you dead worry you in the slightest?&quot;</string>
<string name="107464">She shrugs. &quot;Then do not trust us. It makes no difference, so long as you act. If nothing else, the Valsharess wishes you dead... does that not worry you at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="107465">Nathyrra studies you closely, and after a moment nods slowly. &quot;Then perhaps the Seer was correct, after all. I suppose we shall see.&quot;</string>
<string name="107466">&quot;You think it will be fun, do you? Doesn&apos;t the fact that the Valsharess wants you dead worry you in the slightest?&quot;</string>
<string name="107467">&quot;Short of defeating her.&quot; Nathyrra studies you closely, and after a moment nods slowly. &quot;Perhaps the Seer was correct, after all. I suppose we shall see.&quot;</string>
<string name="107468">&quot;Perhaps she thought that&apos;s where your power lay.&quot; Nathyrra studies you for a long moment. &quot;That doesn&apos;t seem to be the case, as far as I can tell.&quot;</string>
<string name="107469">Nathyrra studies you closely, and after a long moment finally shrugs. &quot;Well, you have confidence, I&apos;ll grant you that. Let&apos;s hope it serves you well.&quot;</string>
<string name="107470">&quot;Truly? Those words don&apos;t come from the geas Halaster placed on you, do they?&quot;</string>
<string name="107471">Nathyrra studies you closely, and after a moment nods slowly. &quot;That&apos;s true. Though I suspect the geas has less to do with your actions than you claim.&quot;</string>
<string name="107472">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="107473">&quot;You said you were one of the Red Sisters.&quot;</string>
<string name="107474">&quot;I want to ask you about something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="107475">&quot;How do I know if I can trust you?&quot;</string>
<string name="107476">&quot;I didn&apos;t mean to make you uncomfortable.&quot;</string>
<string name="107477">&quot;Why did you leave?&quot;</string>
<string name="107478">&quot;Would you be willing to join me?&quot;</string>
<string name="107479">&quot;Tell me about the Valsharess and her allies.&quot;</string>
<string name="107480">&quot;That&apos;s all I wanted to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="107481">&quot;What about the devil she&apos;s enslaved?&quot;</string>
<string name="107482">&quot;How did the Valsharess get control of an undead horde?&quot;</string>
<string name="107483">&quot;What can you tell me about the beholders?&quot;</string>
<string name="107484">&quot;What kinds of effects do their eye-beams have?&quot;</string>
<string name="107485">&quot;Is it possible to negotiate with these creatures?&quot;</string>
<string name="107486">&quot;How does one fight against a beholder?&quot;</string>
<string name="107487">&quot;What do you know about the illithids?&quot;</string>
<string name="107488">&quot;I want to ask about something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="107489">&quot;How does one fight against such creatures?&quot;</string>
<string name="107490">&quot;Such creatures should be slaughtered, not bargained with.&quot;</string>
<string name="107491">&quot;Will you join me now?&quot;</string>
<string name="107492">&quot;I don&apos;t have much of a choice. I&apos;m under a geas, remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="107493">&quot;I couldn&apos;t care less about the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107494">&quot;Of course it concerns me. That&apos;s why I should be up there and not down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="107495">&quot;Perhaps. I don&apos;t see why the burden should rest solely on me, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="107496">&quot;My task ended in Undermountain. I don&apos;t need to be a hero.&quot;</string>
<string name="107497">&quot;No. Why would I worry about what happens to others?&quot;</string>
<string name="107498">&quot;I really doubt it&apos;s as world-shattering a danger as you all make it out to be.&quot;</string>
<string name="107499">&quot;There is no way she is a danger to the surface world.&quot;</string>
<string name="107500">&quot;I agree. A drow queen teamed up with a powerful devil? Deadly combination.&quot;</string>
<string name="107501">&quot;They will be once I&apos;m through with them.&quot;</string>
<string name="107502">&quot;I have yet to receive proof that any of this is true.&quot;</string>
<string name="107503">&quot;I suppose maybe they are.&quot;</string>
<string name="107504">&quot;I have no reason to trust anything you say or do.&quot;</string>
<string name="107505">&quot;Proof of the Valsharess, yes. I have no proof of your motivations.&quot;</string>
<string name="107506">&quot;Maybe not, but this geas means I don&apos;t have a choice either way.&quot;</string>
<string name="107507">&quot;I am absolutely serious. They must be stopped, without question.&quot;</string>
<string name="107508">&quot;And it sounds like it will be quite the adventure! I can&apos;t wait!&quot;</string>
<string name="107509">&quot;Of course it does. There is nothing I can do about that, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="107510">&quot;If I worried always about the possibility of dying, I would never accomplish anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="107511">&quot;I just want my things back. I still can&apos;t believe she had them stolen.&quot;</string>
<string name="107512">&quot;If the last attack she sent is any indication of her power, no.&quot;</string>
<string name="107513">&quot;She should be more worried about me. And it seems she is.&quot;</string>
<string name="107514">&quot;I&apos;m doing what I must, for the good of all.&quot;</string>
<string name="107515">&quot;No, of course not.&quot;</string>
<string name="107516">&quot;Maybe. I don&apos;t have much choice in this, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="107517">&quot;I haven&apos;t seen any proof of this geas, yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="107518">The drow woman regards you now with an ease that is, at first, unsettling. She possesses the same ageless, dark-skinned beauty as the other drow... but unlike the others, her eyes hint of both advanced age and compassion.</string>
<string name="107519">&quot;I believe I can answer that, Seer. &lt;FullName&gt; managed to free Halaster from the Valsharess, ending her efforts to use Undermountain as a base to launch her attacks on the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="107520">&quot;Halaster was quite enraged by her attempt to abuse his realm, however. Once free, he teleported &lt;FirstName&gt; and myself down here to... deal with the Valsharess once and for all.&quot;</string>
<string name="107521">&quot;Indeed? When I saw the two of you here, I had hoped &lt;FirstName&gt; had come willingly to join us.&quot;</string>
<string name="107522">&quot;&lt;He/She&gt; has been... drafted... into our cause, so to speak. The mad mage has placed a geas on &lt;FirstName&gt; to force &lt;him/her&gt; to try and kill the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107523">&quot;I see.&quot; The seer turns to face you, looking stricken. &quot;I am sorry that he violated you in that way, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That is not how I would have wished to acquire your assistance.&quot;</string>
<string name="107524">&quot;But what&apos;s done is done, and we must proceed from here.&quot; She smiles at you kindly. &quot;And though Halaster has forced you into joining us, your own fate is closely tied to ours.&quot;</string>
<string name="107525">She chuckles lightly in an inoffensive manner. &quot;Nor did I suggest you should be, my friend. Your arrival here, however, was rather sudden.&quot;</string>
<string name="107526">She smiles enigmatically. &quot;Now that, my friend, is going to take more than a little explanation.&quot;</string>
<string name="107527">&quot;It is no insult, my friend. Merely the drow word for your race. If you prefer, I will call you by the name of &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="107528">&quot;I am glad you are being reasonable about this, for we must work together if we are to defeat our common foe.&quot;</string>
<string name="107529">The Seer nods sadly. &quot;I can understand how you feel. But the mad mage Halaster has given you little recourse. A geas laid by one of his power is not easily dispelled.&quot; </string>
<string name="107530">&quot;And we&apos;ll help you, if we can. For now, however, there is nothing that can be done. You are bound to our cause; we now share a common enemy.&quot;</string>
<string name="107531">&quot;No, you do not have much choice at all. And neither do we. We must work together if we are to defeat our common foe.&quot;</string>
<string name="107532">&quot;I doubt the Valsharess would feel the same. And considering the geas Halaster has placed you under, you now have little choice but to seek her destruction.&quot;</string>
<string name="107533">&quot;Destiny has decreed that you alone can stop the Valsharess... which gives us all the more reason to support you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107534">The Seer nods slowly, appearing hesitant yet determined to continue. &quot;Yes, that is a good question. What are we to do now?&quot;</string>
<string name="107535">&quot;Are you certain? With the geas Halaster has placed you under, it would appear as if you had little choice in the matter... at least for the moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="107536">The nearby tiefling steps forward, alarm evident on his face. &quot;Are you sure, Seer? What do we really know about this...  this &lt;man/woman&gt;? &lt;He/She&gt; could be the death of us all!&quot;</string>
<string name="107537">The Seer holds up a delicate hand, gently forestalling him. &quot;Our lives are irrelevant, good Valen. The Valsharess must be stopped at all costs, and &lt;FirstName&gt; is the key to stopping her.&quot;</string>
<string name="107538">&quot;You know I don&apos;t believe in your ways, Seer. I won&apos;t throw away my life by blindly following anyone, and I don&apos;t think anyone here should, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="107539">&quot;You have saved us more times than I can count, Valen. But the army of the Valsharess will soon march against us, and even your great skill in battle will not be enough to save us.&quot;</string>
<string name="107540">The tiefling scowls. &quot;I&apos;m willing to defer to your judgement for now, Seer. But what makes you think this &lt;race&gt; stranger can stop the army of the Valsharess?&quot; </string>
<string name="107541">The Seer turns to face you. &quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;, I know you are a &lt;class&gt; of great power. But you are so much more than this. You alone can save us from the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107542">&quot;All the drow here in Lith My&apos;athar will stand against the Valsharess, she is the one enemy common to us all. But even our united strength will not be able to defeat her massive army.&quot;</string>
<string name="107543">&quot;Our only hope is for you to find some way to strengthen our forces, or to weaken the Valsharess and her allies. Nathyrra can help you with this.&quot;</string>
<string name="107544">&quot;I can give you information on the Valsharess&apos;s allies and where to find them. Perhaps we might consider striking at her through her friends, or turning them to our side.&quot;</string>
<string name="107545">Valen, the tiefling warrior, adds, &quot;I can also help you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know much about the legends of the Underdark. I have heard rumors of powerful artifacts and allies we might be able to acquire.&quot; </string>
<string name="107546">Valen shrugs. &quot;Maybe you don&apos;t. But given the situation we&apos;re all in, I don&apos;t think we have much choice but to work together.&quot;</string>
<string name="107547">&quot;I haven&apos;t set aside my suspicions yet. But if you are truly the savior the Seer thinks you are, then I&apos;m willing to give you a chance to prove it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107548">&quot;So it appears you are not alone in this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Nathyrra and Valen will help you. They know much about the Underdark and the Valsharess - do not be afraid to ask them for help.&quot;</string>
<string name="107549">&quot;Hopefully, you can find a way to strengthen our own forces - or weaken the Valsharess - before her army descends upon us all.&quot;</string>
<string name="107550">&quot;Long life and blessed be, my friend.&quot;</string>
<string name="107551">&quot;By helping us you are also helping yourself, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Remember the geas Halaster has placed upon you. If you do not find a way to destroy the Valsharess, you will begin to wither and die.&quot;</string>
<string name="107552">&quot;Nevertheless, you are a part of this. Destiny - along with the geas Halaster has placed upon you - is forcing you into a confrontation with the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107553">&quot;Is there anything else that you require of me, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="107554">&quot;Long life and blessed be.&quot;</string>
<string name="107555">The Seer nods. &quot;Very well. I will answer what questions I can. Hopefully my knowledge can help you find some way to weaken the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107556">&quot;Nothing more than what you already know. Her army is still massing. If you do not find some way to weaken her forces before the coming battle, I doubt we will be able to stand against her.&quot;</string>
<string name="107557">She sighs. &quot;That I cannot say. Though I am a Seer, my visions are limited to what Eilistraee chooses to reveal to me. Sadly, I have not seen how to weaken the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107558">&quot;However, both Nathyrra and Valen have offered to help you with this. Speak to them. They may be able to give you some guidance as to what you must do.&quot;</string>
<string name="107559">&quot;Deep beneath your surface lands, beneath even the dungeon you call Undermountain, exists a vast realm of caverns and blackest lakes that collectively we call the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="107560">&quot;It is here that the drow rule alongside such other creatures as the illithids and the beholders and the duergar. The Underdark is a place of evil and terror, make no mistake... every step must be taken carefully, here.&quot;</string>
<string name="107561">&quot;More specifically, we are in a very remote drow settlement called Lith My&apos;athar on the far side of the great Lake of Memory. Our forces are relatively safe here... until the Valsharess comes.&quot;</string>
<string name="107562">&quot;None that I am aware of. It might be possible to find a way to teleport you back to the surface... but I wonder if the geas placed on you wouldn&apos;t prevent you from taking it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107563">&quot;Then you are a fool. The geas upon you will make it quite unpleasant should you attempt to leave the Underdark now. I&apos;m certain Halaster&apos;s magic will bring you a quick and painful death.&quot;</string>
<string name="107564">The Seer sighs heavily. &quot;I won&apos;t lie to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Our collection of rebels here is nothing against the power of the Valsharess. We have been doing little but running up to this point.&quot;</string>
<string name="107565">&quot;Here in Lith My&apos;athar we have decided to make our stand... but we know we stand little chance against the mighty force that has aligned itself with the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107566">&quot;The duergar are gray-skinned cousins to the hargluk, the surface dwarves. They are a dour and industrious folk more prone to cunning and wickedness than their surface brethren.&quot;</string>
<string name="107567">&quot;I am surprised you do not know. You are a hargluk... the duergar are your gray-skinned cousins who live in the Underdark. They are a dour and industrious folk more prone to cunning and wickedness than others of your kind.&quot;</string>
<string name="107568">&quot;The duergar have many reasons to hate the drow intensely, but many of their kind are mercenary enough to hire themselves out to whoever has the wealth to offer them... and the Valsharess is one of those.&quot;</string>
<string name="107569">&quot;They resemble floating eyeballs with many eye-stalks, and each of their eyes can fire a blast with a different magical power. Pain, slowness, petrification... even disintegration.&quot;</string>
<string name="107570">&quot;There is no limit to how often they can use these abilities, so be wary. Should you ever find yourself in their tunnels, it is best to find a way back out as quickly as possible.&quot;</string>
<string name="107571">&quot;Dangerous monsters with blank eyes and tentacles for a mouth. Your kind calls them &apos;mind flayers&apos;, as well, I believe.&quot;</string>
<string name="107572">&quot;They are most cunning and able to use powers of the mind to stun you and render you helpless... at which point they would feast upon your brain, if given a chance. Or make you into a mindless thrall.&quot;</string>
<string name="107573">&quot;I was not always known as such, my friend. A very long time ago I was the daughter of a major house and as ambitious to gain my own power as any other respectable drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="107574">&quot;That was not meant to be, however.&quot; She gestures to the drow around her. &quot;I found the worship of my lady Eilistraee, and she has gifted me with visions that have aided her followers.&quot;</string>
<string name="107575">&quot;And so I am called the Seer, for so many years now that my original name has all but been forgotten. In any case, that life is behind me. Now I serve Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="107576">&quot;I see what my goddess grants me the wisdom to see. I saw that the drow would devolve into chaos, and that the Valsharess would arise out of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107577">&quot;I see the destiny of my people as it will be, and our place in it. That is why we have returned to the Underdark from our adopted home on the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="107578">&quot;And I have also had visions of you, &lt;CUSTOM500&gt;. That is how I knew you would come.&quot;</string>
<string name="107579">&quot;It is said that you would come, and that you would be the one to bring about the Valsharess&apos;s defeat.&quot; Her eyes narrow. &quot;But you already know of what I speak, don&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="107580">&quot;I know what I see, just as the Valsharess has many means to discover knowledge. She knows of these visions as well, and the danger you represent, and she will not rest until you are dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="107581">&quot;She has already attempted to have you killed on the surface, I believe. That will not be the last time she attempts such, I assure you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107582">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; There is no reason to lie to me, &lt;CUSTOM500&gt;. The Valsharess is your enemy, not I. She knows of this vision as well, and the danger you represent, and she will not rest until you are dead.</string>
<string name="107583">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Then I should inform you that the Valsharess also knows of this vision and the threat you represent. She will not rest until you are eliminated.&quot;</string>
<string name="107584">She nods. &quot;Then you have seen it. The Valsharess knows of the danger you represent. She will not rest until your threat is eliminated.&quot;</string>
<string name="107585">&quot;We are different in the sense that we chose to abandon the society of cruelty and hatred that we were raised in. Our own kind revile us and would hunt us, if they could.&quot;</string>
<string name="107586">&quot;The fact that we have returned to the Underdark now and fight to restore order to our people does not mean that we support what they are. It does mean, however, that we will not let them fall to death and chaos.&quot;</string>
<string name="107587">&quot;I lead my fellow followers of Eilistraee, yes, though not all the drow gathered here believe as I do. Many of the drow here do not follow Eilistraee at all, though I am one of my Lady&apos;s chosen.&quot;</string>
<string name="107588">&quot;I am a drow. I am used to distrust of many kinds. If you give me the opportunity, however, I am certain to prove a valuable ally even if you do not desire a friend.&quot;</string>
<string name="107589">&quot;Yes, quite a number more are outside in the camp. The Valsharess, however, commands several magnitudes more than we do.&quot;</string>
<string name="107590">&quot;Why should it? I require no one to worship as I do, and you are not here on a religious crusade, are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="107591">&quot;Know, however, that you are no pawn of mine nor do I expect to lead you. If the mad mage Halaster has collared you with a geas it is a machination of his own and not ours.&quot;</string>
<string name="107592">The Seer&apos;s eyes twinkle as she smiles warmly. Obviously this is a subject dear to her heart. &quot;Many do not know it, but not all of the drow are evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="107593">&quot;Our Lady Eilistraee is the mistress of song and dance, and it is she who refuses to allow joy and goodness to be taken from us forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="107594">&quot;She is our redemption, and all of us journeyed to the surface lands to be free of the darkness that shackled us. The fact that we are in the Underdark once more to serve her cause is an irony not lost on us.&quot;</string>
<string name="107595">&quot;That is because it isn&apos;t. This is a temple to the spider goddess, Lolth, that we have taken refuge in. I am sure she will not mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="107596">&quot;Lolth has disappeared.&quot; The Seer frowns thoughtfully at this. &quot;Her priestesses cast no spells and the society she controlled with an iron fist has fallen to pieces with her absence.&quot;</string>
<string name="107597">&quot;This chaos is what the Valsharess has taken advantage of and has allowed her to achieve such power. As to whether Lolth will return,&quot; she shrugs, &quot;who can say?&quot;</string>
<string name="107598">&quot;The Valsharess threatens more than just the Underdark with her schemes, as you well know. She threatens us all, and Eilistraee&apos;s chosen stand amongst those ready to stop her.&quot;</string>
<string name="107599">&quot;We are not alone, thankfully. Others have joined us to stop the Valsharess, though they do not believe in the goddess as we do. Ultimately, however, we fight for the same thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="107600">The Seer frowns and her eyes flash darkly. &quot;Common sense, I would hope. At the very least, we both possess a common foe in the Valsharess and that, if nothing else, should stay your blade.&quot;</string>
<string name="107601">&quot;And if not that, how about the fact that you are surrounded by an army of drow... an army that can be turned against an intruder in the blink of an eye.&quot;</string>
<string name="107602">Suddenly she sighs and relaxes. &quot;But my intent is not to threaten you. We must work together, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="107603">&quot;All those who stand against the Valsharess have gathered here in Lith My&apos;athar, united in our common desire to see her stopped. Many of the drow here are followers of my Lady Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="107604">&quot;But there are others, too. Lith My&apos;athar is the ancestral home of House Maeviir, one of the many drow families that has been forced to flee the cities because of the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107605">&quot;The followers of House Maeviir now stand with us against the Valsharess, though in other circumstances they would never ally themselves with the followers of Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="107606">The Seer sighs. &quot;It is not my nature to speak ill of those who side with us, but I will admit that House Maeviir is not the most desirable of allies. There is tension and mistrust on both sides.&quot;</string>
<string name="107607">&quot;But we have little choice. The Valsharess has a vast army; we need allies if we are to stand against her. House Maeviir recognizes this, and that is why they tolerate our presence here.&quot;</string>
<string name="107608">&quot;For now, the threat of the Valsharess is enough to ensure my followers and those who support House Maeviir will set aside their hatred of each other and focus on our common foe.&quot;</string>
<string name="107609">&quot;As you wish. Stand still for a moment, please...&quot;</string>
<string name="107610">&quot;The golems are powerful creatures. Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I am certain they will be of great aid to us in the battle to come.&quot;</string>
<string name="107611">&quot;Excellent work, &lt;FirstName&gt;! The beholders are formidable foes. If the Valsharess has been denied their aid, she has been severely weakened.&quot;</string>
<string name="107612">The Seer shakes her head sadly. &quot;Normally I would rejoice in the destruction of such evil, but killing the Overmind will not stop the other illithid from aiding the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107613">&quot;Our only hope was to persuade the Overmind to convince the other brains of the Elder Concorde to withdraw illithid support from the Valsharess en masse. But I suppose what&apos;s done is done.&quot;</string>
<string name="107614">&quot;I&apos;m glad the illithid will not be marching against us, though I hope the bargain you struck with them is one we do not regret later. Sometimes we are forced to choose the lesser of two evils.&quot;</string>
<string name="107615">&quot;This is truly good news, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If the Valsharess cannot throw hordes of undead against her foes, she must risk the lives of her troops and allies. Against those, we may yet stand a chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="107616">&quot;Yes, the angelic creature that has joined our ranks has already told us the tale. Well done. You have struck a blow against the Valsharess and found us a formidable ally.&quot;</string>
<string name="107617">&quot;Have you word of anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="107618">The Seer nods slowly. &quot;There is still much to be done. You have my thanks for your efforts so far, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="107619">The Seer nods slowly. &quot;You have already done much for our cause, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You have my gratitude.&quot;</string>
<string name="107620">The Seer nods slowly, obviously pleased. &quot;You have done much for us, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The Valsharess will not be able to ignore your actions for much longer.&quot;</string>
<string name="107621">&quot;I should warn you, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I know something of this mirror. It is a very powerful - but very dangerous - item. What do you intend to do with it?&quot;</string>
<string name="107622">&quot;I see. The mirror is yours to do with as you please. Just make sure it does not fall into the wrong hands or you may create more problems than you solve.&quot;</string>
<string name="107623">&quot;I might be able to, though I would have to be extremely careful with such an item. But I could never ask you to turn such a valuable artifact over to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="107624">&quot;We have almost no resources to speak of. If you are looking to sell the mirror, I cannot purchase it from you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107625">The Seer&apos;s eyes go wide in shock. &quot;I... that is very... generous of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Thank you. I... will try to put it to good advantage.&quot;</string>
<string name="107626">&quot;I dare not use it before the coming battle, for I fear to fall victim to its power. But in the days that are to come it may one day help us to find our way to a better life than this.&quot;</string>
<string name="107627">&quot;It is yours by right, and at least you have prevented the Valsharess from gaining control of it. She is powerful enough as it is. I hope you put the mirror to good use.&quot;</string>
<string name="107628">&quot;I see. If that is the price we must pay to have them abandon the Valsharess, then so be it. But I fear to imagine what such creatures would be capable of with such a device.&quot;</string>
<string name="107629">&quot;By rights the mirror is yours, &lt;FullName&gt;, and I will gladly return it to you. May I ask, however, why you want it now?&quot;</string>
<string name="107630">The Seer seems stung by your harsh words. &quot;That is true, you owe me no explanation at all. Very well, here is the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107631">&quot;Then by all means, take the mirror. But be careful of its power... even I am not eager to use it without understanding the consequences.&quot;</string>
<string name="107632">&quot;I see. No doubt that is their price to abandon the Valsharess. But I fear to imagine what such creatures would be capable of with such a device. Are you sure about this?&quot;</string>
<string name="107633">&quot;As you wish, &lt;FullName&gt;. Should you change your mind, you only have to ask and I will return the mirror to you. By all rights it is yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="107634">&quot;Very well. I trust in the visions of Eilistraee, which means I also trust in you, &lt;FullName&gt;. Here is the mirror. I only hope we do not regret this decision later.&quot;</string>
<string name="107635">&quot;Zesyyr now controls House Maeviir? Then, I must assume Myrune is dead. Why did you do this, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="107636">The seer frowns. &quot;I do not approve of you killing for profit, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know this is the way of the drow houses, but this is not the way of Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="107637">&quot;I am not here to judge you, but I would warn you not to delve too deep into the murky politics of the drow. It is a treacherous endeavor. Hopefully Zesyyr shows us more loyalty than she did her own mother.&quot;</string>
<string name="107638">The Seer nods reluctantly. &quot;Yes, you are probably right. Myrune was desperately trying to cling to power. If she had the opportunity to bow before the Valsharess and live, she would.&quot;</string>
<string name="107639">&quot;Perhaps your actions here will be for the greater good. I just hope that Zesyyr shows us more loyalty than she showed her own mother.&quot;</string>
<string name="107640">&quot;I just hope that Zesyyr shows us more loyalty than she showed her own mother.&quot;</string>
<string name="107641">The Seer is deep in concentration and cannot speak with you at the moment.</string>
<string name="107642">&quot;I can only see the visions Eilistraee chooses to grant me. In her wisdom, she chose to keep me unaware of House Maeviir&apos;s impending treachery.&quot;</string>
<string name="107643">&quot;Perhaps the goddess knew you would be here to save me from my own short-sightedness. Perhaps she wanted me to learn a lesson about who I trust.&quot;</string>
<string name="107644">&quot;I am just grateful you were here to save me from my own short-sightedness. Perhaps that is why Eilistraee did not give me forewarning of this treachery... she knew you would stop Myrune.&quot;</string>
<string name="107645">&quot;But we mustn&apos;t dwell on House Maeviir&apos;s treachery. We have to ready our forces for the next onslaught of the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107646">&quot;Without the Maeviir forces we are at an even greater disadvantage than before, but at least we know those who fight by us now are our true allies.&quot;</string>
<string name="107647">&quot;Wait a second... who are you? What&apos;s going on here?&quot;</string>
<string name="107648">&quot;I&apos;m not frightened of you... or anyone, for that matter.&quot;</string>
<string name="107649">&quot;You awaited my arrival? How did you know I was coming?&quot;</string>
<string name="107650">&quot;Did you just call me &lt;CUSTOM500&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="107651">&quot;Then tell me what I need to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="107652">&quot;I will do whatever I can to stop her evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="107653">&quot;I just want to find a way to break this geas on me.&quot;</string>
<string name="107654">&quot;Help you? I don&apos;t even want to be here!&quot;</string>
<string name="107655">&quot;I guess you might be right.&quot;</string>
<string name="107656">&quot;I&apos;ll get rid of this geas on me, just you watch.&quot;</string>
<string name="107657">&quot;I suppose I don&apos;t have any choice.&quot;</string>
<string name="107658">&quot;Why didn&apos;t you tell me all of this earlier, Nathyrra?&quot;</string>
<string name="107659">&quot;So how does all this involve me?&quot;</string>
<string name="107660">&quot;I dreamt about that...&quot;</string>
<string name="107661">&quot;I&apos;m sure if she and I spoke, there&apos;d be no reason for such hostility!&quot;</string>
<string name="107662">&quot;I will do whatever I can to end such evil. She has reason to fear me.&quot;</string>
<string name="107663">&quot;It seems the Valsharess and I are on a collision course.&quot;</string>
<string name="107664">&quot;So what do you propose we do now?&quot;</string>
<string name="107665">&quot;That&apos;s ridiculous! I mean her no harm in the slightest.&quot;</string>
<string name="107666">&quot;But the Valsharess can&apos;t reach Waterdeep now. Halaster is free.&quot;</string>
<string name="107667">&quot;How did she bind an archdevil to her service?&quot;</string>
<string name="107668">&quot;I am honored by the faith you&apos;ve put in me, Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="107669">&quot;Now that sounds more like it!&quot;</string>
<string name="107670">&quot;I don&apos;t need your help, tiefling.&quot;</string>
<string name="107671">&quot;I thought you didn&apos;t trust me.&quot;</string>
<string name="107672">&quot;I&apos;m glad to see you&apos;re over your suspicions.&quot;</string>
<string name="107673">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="107674">&quot;Why should I help you?&quot;</string>
<string name="107675">&quot;I won&apos;t fail you, Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="107676">&quot;I didn&apos;t ask to be a part of this.&quot;</string>
<string name="107677">&quot;I don&apos;t understand... what is it you expect me to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="107678">&quot;I have nothing to report right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="107679">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="107680">&quot;I have some questions for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107681">&quot;Can you tell me anything else about the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="107682">&quot;How can I weaken the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="107683">&quot;Tell me about the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="107684">&quot;Is there a way back to the surface from here?&quot;</string>
<string name="107685">&quot;I don&apos;t feel any need to stay here... or do anything else, for that matter.&quot;</string>
<string name="107686">&quot;You mentioned the Valsharess coming?&quot;</string>
<string name="107687">&quot;Tell me more about the duergar?&quot;</string>
<string name="107688">&quot;Tell me more about the beholders&quot;</string>
<string name="107689">&quot;Tell me more about the illithid.&quot;</string>
<string name="107690">&quot;Why are you called the Seer?&quot;</string>
<string name="107691">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="107692">&quot;Tell me about your visions.&quot;</string>
<string name="107693">&quot;You had visions of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="107694">&quot;And how would you know that?&quot;</string>
<string name="107695">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I have no idea what you&apos;re talking about.&quot;</string>
<string name="107696">&quot;You mean my dream back at the inn.&quot;</string>
<string name="107697">&quot;So you are different than most other drow?&quot;</string>
<string name="107698">&quot;So you lead these drow, then? Are you a priestess?&quot;</string>
<string name="107699">&quot;I don&apos;t trust prophets, much.&quot;</string>
<string name="107700">&quot;There are other drow here?&quot;</string>
<string name="107701">&quot;The fact that I worship a different god doesn&apos;t worry you?&quot;</string>
<string name="107702">&quot;Tell me about Eilistraee.&quot;</string>
<string name="107703">&quot;This doesn&apos;t look like a temple of good.&quot;</string>
<string name="107704">&quot;She won&apos;t mind? What makes you say that?&quot;</string>
<string name="107705">&quot;What do you mean by &apos;serving her cause&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="107706">&quot;You&apos;re all drow. What&apos;s to stop me from killing you all now?&quot;</string>
<string name="107707">&quot;I&apos;d like to know more about my allies here.&quot;</string>
<string name="107708">&quot;Do you think you can trust them?&quot;</string>
<string name="107709">&quot;That probably makes for some tension.&quot;</string>
<string name="107710">&quot;I need some healing.&quot;</string>
<string name="107711">&quot;I have found some golem allies willing to fight with us.&quot;</string>
<string name="107712">&quot;I killed the Beholder Tyrant. They won&apos;t be helping the Valsharess, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="107713">&quot;I destroyed the Overmind of Zorvak&apos;Mur.&quot;</string>
<string name="107714">&quot;The mind flayers are no longer allied with the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107715">&quot;I have destroyed the source of the Valsharess&apos; undead hosts.&quot;</string>
<string name="107716">&quot;That&apos;s all for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="107717">&quot;I have an artifact called the Shattered Mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107718">&quot;I&apos;m sure it will be worth something to someone.&quot;</string>
<string name="107719">&quot;I don&apos;t know. Can you make use of it?&quot;</string>
<string name="107720">&quot;I never said I would. I&apos;m keeping it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107721">&quot;Not for free. But what would you offer for it?&quot;</string>
<string name="107722">&quot;Maybe someone else can buy it, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="107723">&quot;Then take it, anyway. I don&apos;t want it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107724">&quot;Perhaps the mind flayers still want it, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="107725">&quot;If you can use it, then take it. Maybe it will help.&quot;</string>
<string name="107726">&quot;I intend to keep it, of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="107727">&quot;The Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind is interested in it, actually.&quot;</string>
<string name="107728">&quot;I need you to give me back the Shattered Mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107729">&quot;I don&apos;t have to explain myself to you!&quot;</string>
<string name="107730">&quot;I think I might have need of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="107731">&quot;I&apos;m going to give it to the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind.&quot;</string>
<string name="107732">&quot;I&apos;ve changed my mind. You keep the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107733">&quot;I am. Give me the mirror.&quot;</string>
<string name="107734">&quot;I helped Zesyyr seize control of House Maeviir.&quot;</string>
<string name="107735">&quot;She paid me.&quot;</string>
<string name="107736">&quot;Myrune would have betrayed us to the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107737">&quot;We have to get out of here!&quot;</string>
<string name="107738">&quot;But I don&apos;t want to lead the troops!&quot;</string>
<string name="107739">&quot;I will lead your troops to victory, Seer!&quot;</string>
<string name="107740">&quot;Let them come! We&apos;re ready for them.&quot;</string>
<string name="107741">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, Seer. I won&apos;t let you come to any harm.&quot;</string>
<string name="107742">&quot;Not much of a Seer, are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="107743">&quot;Don&apos;t blame yourself. We all make mistakes.&quot; </string>
<string name="107744">&quot;How did they cross the Dark River?&quot;</string>
<string name="107745">&quot;Was there ever a doubt? The Valsharess is nothing compared to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="107746">&quot;I did what was necessary.&quot;</string>
<string name="107747">&quot;I could never have done this without your help.&quot;</string>
<string name="107748">&quot;Be well.&quot;</string>
<string name="107749">&quot;Cavallas is... odd. He willingly transports followers of the Seer up and down the river free of charge, but otherwise seems unwilling to take an active role in our conflict with the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107750">&quot;He willingly gives out information and shares rumors he has heard during his travels, yet he asks nothing in return. Plus, he shows no fear of anyone or anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="107751">Valen shrugs. &quot;I honestly don&apos;t know what he is, or even why he&apos;s here. The Boatman keeps himself hidden beneath his cloak, his face and features completely covered. A little unnerving.&quot;</string>
<string name="107752">&quot;But I trust Cavallas far more than some of the drow here. I don&apos;t get any real sense of threat or danger from him... assuming Cavallas even is a &apos;him&apos;. You can&apos;t tell because of the cloak.&quot;</string>
<string name="107753">&quot;He&apos;ll be in the ports to the east, unless he&apos;s ferrying someone along the river. If you ask, he can probably tell you more about the golems and that strange town that just appeared out of nowhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="107754">The tiefling considers your request for a long time before making his reply. &quot;I don&apos;t believe in the Seer&apos;s dreams, &lt;FirstName&gt;... though I do believe you want to stop the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107755">&quot;But you already have plenty of companions, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I don&apos;t like pooling all our resources in one place. Too easy to suffer a single catastrophic loss if something goes wrong.&quot;</string>
<string name="107756">Valen nods. &quot;Yes, I think it would be to everyone&apos;s advantage if we were to join forces.&quot;</string>
<string name="107757">&quot;I could join you, but first I think I should tell you about some interesting rumors we should follow up on.&quot;</string>
<string name="107758">The tiefling gives you a hard stare. &quot;I&apos;m a warrior; a soldier. You would be hard pressed to find one more skilled with the blade then I am. And, like the Seer, I stand against the Valsharess.&quot; </string>
<string name="107759">&quot;I don&apos;t think you&apos;re entitled to much more than that, since I barely even know you. The Seer may think you&apos;re something special, but I&apos;m reserving judgement until the Valsharess is defeated.&quot;</string>
<string name="107760">&quot;Untrue,&quot; he says softly. &quot;I do not even know you, so I can hardly dislike you. But unlike the Seer, I&apos;m not about to put all my faith in you until you&apos;ve proved yourself against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107761">&quot;I&apos;ve only heard a few rumors and legends concerning some strange islands. Cavallas the Boatman in the ports to the east probably knows more about this than I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="107762">&quot;By stopping the Valsharess, of course... if you can. But even the Seer seems to realize you can&apos;t do this alone, prophecy or not. Fortunately, I may be able to help you out.&quot;</string>
<string name="107763">&quot;Recently I&apos;ve heard tales of some strange islands nearby. Based on the legends, there may be something on these islands that could help us against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107764">&quot;They say there is an island inhabited by powerful golems; these would be particularly useful against the Valsharess and her army.&quot;</string>
<string name="107765">&quot;I&apos;ve also heard of a strange settlement that appeared overnight on a previously deserted isle. That sounds like the work of a powerful artifact... one we might be able to make use of ourselves.&quot;</string>
<string name="107766">&quot;Of course, what I&apos;ve heard are really just rumors from those who&apos;ve traveled the river. I&apos;d guess Cavallas the Boatman probably knows more.&quot;</string>
<string name="107767">&quot;Does that surprise you? There are many rivers and lakes here in the Underdark, and many settlements have ports or docks. The Lith My&apos;athar ports are located just to the east of here.&quot;</string>
<string name="107768">&quot;You do not have to. Just know that I judge an individual by their actions, not by any supposed destiny laid upon them. If you prove yourself, trust me... I shall be the first to cheer your victory.&quot;</string>
<string name="107769">Valen shrugs, not taking his intense eyes off of you. &quot;From what I understand, you don&apos;t have a choice. Halaster put a geas on you. Either you find a way to stop the Valsharess, or you die.&quot;</string>
<string name="107770">&quot;Actually, I hope the Seer is right about you. If you prove to be the agent of the Valsharess&apos; destruction, all the better. But I won&apos;t bow down to you just because the Seer had a dream.&quot;</string>
<string name="107771">&quot;Yes, we are. Which is why I&apos;m willing to help you, despite the fact that I know nothing about you. Hopefully you&apos;ll prove that the Seer&apos;s faith in you is justified.&quot;</string>
<string name="107772">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="107773">&quot;You mentioned something about a Boatman earlier.&quot;</string>
<string name="107774">&quot;Maybe he&apos;s some type of ghost or spirit.&quot;</string>
<string name="107775">&quot;Maybe he&apos;s a spy for the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107776">&quot;Where can I find this Boatman?&quot;</string>
<string name="107777">&quot;Will you join me?&quot;</string>
<string name="107778">&quot;I want to know more about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="107779">&quot;I get the feeling you don&apos;t like me.&quot;</string>
<string name="107780">&quot;Do you have any information that might help against the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="107781">&quot;You said you could help me against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="107782">&quot;And how am I supposed to prove myself?&quot;</string>
<string name="107783">&quot;Tell me about these islands.&quot;</string>
<string name="107784">&quot;Tell me about this Cavallas.&quot;</string>
<string name="107785">&quot;Islands? There are islands here?&quot;</string>
<string name="107786">&quot;I don&apos;t like your attitude, tiefling!&quot;</string>
<string name="107787">&quot;What if I don&apos;t want to prove myself to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="107788">&quot;We&apos;re all on the same side here.&quot;</string>

<string name="107929">There is no denying this drow&apos;s obvious beauty, but there is something dangerous about her as well. Her eyes dark eyes burn with terrible secrets lurking below their surface.</string>

It is particularly useful for luring golems into deadly traps.</string>

<string name="107957">Devil&apos;s Bane</string>
<string name="107958">This is Valen&apos;s flail, its dual spiked heads carved from a black bone-like material that is extremely cold to the touch. The weapon was with Valen throughout the many years that he spent in the Abyss fighting the Blood Wars... it specializes in dealing death to devils and other outsiders, but is still very effective against other opponents. Even if Valen was to be given another weapon, he would still not relinquish this one.</string>
<string name="107959">Valen&apos;s Breastplate</string>
<string name="107960">This suit of mithril armor was made specifically for Valen, crafted by the rebel drow of Lith My&apos;athar and enchanted to allow him brief periods of enhanced speed. It is a symbol of Valen&apos;s ability to keep the rebels alive even as the Valsharess hounded them to the ends of the Underdark, and even should he receive better armor he will not part with it.</string>

<string name="107971">Magics of Golem Enhancements</string>
<string name="107972">When constructing golems, it is important not to forget the importance of adding enhancements through enchantments. The easiest way to accomplish this is to include spell conduits on your golem creation machine. These conduits can then be filled with the appropriate spells.

It is important to remember that the effects of spells can be altered during the creation process, often producing an unexpected result when they are passed through the spell conduit.

For example:
1. Greater Spell Mantle will improve a golem&apos;s resistance to magic.
2. Bigby&apos;s Crushing Hand increases a golem&apos;s strength.
3. Greater Sanctuary provides more protection against physical attacks.
4. Time Stop grants the golem improved regenaration.
5. Premonition results in improved damage reduction.
6. Mass Haste provides a permanent haste effect.
7. True Seeing provides a permanent True Seeing effect.
8. Chain Lightning causes a lightning bolt to be released whenever the golem is hit by an enemy.
9. Mordenkainen&apos;s Disjuntion gives the golem the ability to Dispel Magic each time it hits an opponent.

By placing these spells in the respective conduits, a golem&apos;s attributes and abilities can be customized to the creators exact specifications.

<string name="107984">The delicate work on this signet ring for House Maevir must have been done by a master craftsman.

<string name="107996">This helm seems to close around your neck when donned, creating a firm seal between you and the outside.</string>
<string name="107997">Commonly worn by slavers who deal with the illithid, the Helm of Shielding protects the user against mental telepathy and the other psionic powers of the mind flayers.

Without the helm&apos;s protection the slave trade would be impossible, as the illithid are prone to attack any vulnerable non-illithid they speak with.</string>

The swirling vortex at the staff&apos;s tip is said to be a god&apos;s-eye view of the infinite layers of the Abyss.</string>
<string name="108002">Crystal of Undeath</string>
<string name="108003">An eerie purple crystal is attached to this otherwise indistinctive amulet. Your hand grows cold and clawlike as it clutches the glowing crystal shard. In its purple light, your skin looks pale and gray, almost skeletal. Its power fascinates you but a part of you can&apos;t help but question what it might be asking of you in return.</string>

<string name="108009">&quot;...On the eve of Darkentide, 1034 DR, did Vix&apos;thra at last attain His true form.

You promised me an army of undead, to the order of 200 a day. What I have seen from you thus far has been half that. Your foolish Elders sing the praises of their exceptional craftsmanship and might. While this is true, it does not forgive the shortfall. I am sending some of my slaves with this letter to oversee the process. Satisfy me and your elders may have their blood and you their bones. Exceed my expectations and I will give you their weight in gold as well. Disappoint me, however, and I will destroy even the memory of your pathetic little cult. The choice is yours...&quot;</string>

<string name="108020">Rod of Fire</string>
<string name="108021">A relatively simple device in concept, the Rod of Fire is rather nefarious in its execution. Countless careless wizards have incinerated themselves over the years while trying to explore the rod&apos;s more unconventional uses. If you intend to wield it, you had best do so with great caution.</string>
<string name="108022">Shadow Master Properties</string>
<string name="108023">Blade of Shadows</string>
<string name="108024">Wielded by the fabled Black Lotus Assassins of the far-off Jade Empire, the blades of these sturdy weapon are fashioned from countless layers of thin, many-folded steel. With each folding, the blade is cooled in liquid poison until its every cut brings weakness.</string>
<string name="108025">Vix&apos;thrite Tome</string>
<string name="108026">Though written in the Common Tongue, you find the ornate script near impossible to read. To make matters worse, the faded ink has been thumbed bare in places.</string>
<string name="108027">&quot;...the Priesthood of Vix&apos;thra shall make its home above, both in the world and of the world, that it might lure more believers to the divine light. But below shall dwell the Elders, those who serve Vix&apos;thra for all eternity, neither in the world nor of it, for they shall be undying. To them shall sacrifice be made in blood. To Vix&apos;thra shall it be made in bone...&quot;</string>
<string name="108028">Splintered Wood</string>
<string name="108029">Jagged splinters protrude from this shattered piece of wood. It&apos;s well-weighted, however, and you suspect you could use it as a crude weapon if you had to.</string>

<string name="108034">Lexicon Arcana</string>
<string name="108035">This appears to be some kind of a dictionary for ancient arcane languages:

&quot;I have decided to use the Unuraakil language for the special-purpose golems. I&apos;ll just have to make sure that they remind me of their numbers, as I will need them for their maintenance. For now, I would probably need only the following words:

Omon = Zero
Arthas = One
Kinthas = Two
Ivon = Three 
Thesti = Four
Sinth = Five
Kali = Six
Laz = Seven
Urvil = Eight
Zand = Nine&quot;</string>

<string name="108049">Lab Notes</string>
<string name="108050">These appear to be notes detailing the Maker&apos;s efforts to create sentient golems.

&quot;Despite my best efforts to give birth to a perfect being, all I have managed to create are intelligent golems.

Gifted with self awareness, they are unable to make use of what I have given them. They drift without purpose or direction, they have no concept of accomplishment, art or culture.&quot;</string>
<string name="108051">These appear to be notes detailing the Maker&apos;s efforts to create an entire society of sentient golems.

&quot;I am growing more frustrated with my golem children. They seem incapable of those things that make a living creature truly alive.

Though I have tried to create a society for them, they continue to exist only as isolated individuals. They seem incapable of forming associations and friendships, they only know servant and master.

Perhaps it is my own presence that stunts their growth. Maybe if I leave them to develop their own society, they can overcome the limitations of their own nature.&quot;</string>
<string name="108052">These appear to be notes detailing the Maker&apos;s mounting frustration in his efforts to create a truly sentient creature.

&quot;I am beginning to wonder if a golem can ever be anything more than lifeless materials given animation and form.

Despite all I have given my children - intelligence, self-awareness - they are stunted. They cannot learn or grow, they seem as immutable and fixed as the stone, steel and clay from which they were born.&quot;</string>
<string name="108053">These appear to be notes detailing the Maker&apos;s efforts to create sentient golems.

&quot;I have given my creations the divine spark, the awareness and free will of a sentient being. Yet even with this, they are somehow... flawed.

It is as if they do not know how to exist without a master. They need to be given a purpose in life - they seem incapable of discovering a purpose of their own.&quot;</string>
<string name="108054">Golem Machine Activator</string>
<string name="108055">This appears to be a magical activation key, probably to unlock Alsigard&apos;s golem creation machine.</string>
<string name="108056">Merkil&apos;s Hammer</string>
<string name="108057">This hammer was forged for the express purpose of destroying golems and other constructs.

It was given to Merkil Thunderfist, a famous gnomish adventurer. Armed with this fantastical hammer, Merkil descended into the depths of the Maker&apos;s dungeon, but was never seen again.</string>
<string name="108058">Merkil&apos;s Helmet</string>
<string name="108059">This helmet grants the user protection against all forms of mental domination and mind affecting spells.

It was last seen in the possession of Merkil Thunderfist, a famous gnomish adventurer who never returned from his expedition to the Isle of the Maker.</string>
<string name="108060">Merkil&apos;s Plate</string>
<string name="108061">This suit of armor was created for Merkil Thunderfist, the legendary svirfneblin hero. To prevent it from falling into the hands of the drow or other potential enemies, the suit was crafted so that only one of svirfneblin stature could wear it. 

The armor was lost in the dungeons of Alsigard the Maker, along with Merkil himself.</string>
<string name="108062">Metal Golem Properties</string>
<string name="108063">Minogon Properties</string>
<string name="108064">Golems&apos; Power Source</string>
<string name="108065">The Power Source glows with radiant energy and pulses with a slow, steady beat as if it had a life of its own. It is quite likely that this artifact is closely tied to the golems of this level.

Despite the tremendous energy contained within, the Power Source itself is surprisingly fragile. If shattered it will unleash all of its energy in a single, apocalyptic explosion.</string>
<string name="108066">Searing Helmet</string>
<string name="108067">This helm was rumored to have been forged in molten fires of magma far beneath the earth by Uligon Yarbided, a deep gnome smith famed for his armor and weapons.</string>
<string name="108068">Golem Binder</string>
<string name="108069">Any golem targeted by this item will be slowed for 1d6+2 rounds.

Each use depletes a single charge from the item.</string>
<string name="108070">Blue Powder</string>
<string name="108071">This powder has obvious magical properties, though you would likely need an alchemist&apos;s equipment to extract it.</string>

<string name="108080">Golem Crasher</string>
<string name="108081">When used against a construct, this item will send out a devastating ray that will damage the golem for 3d10+30 damage, as well as knocking it to the ground for 1d4 rounds.

Each use of the item depletes a single charge.</string>
<string name="108082">Ferron&apos;s Head</string>
<string name="108083">This is the head of the golem Ferron.</string>
<string name="108084">Controlling Amulet</string>
<string name="108085">This amulet is a necessary component of constructing any golem. When combined with the proper pieces, it will ensure the construct remains subservient to the will of the master.</string>
<string name="108086">This amulet establishes a special connection between the owner of a shield guardian and the golem itself. While the amulet is worn, the golem would be extremely protective of its master, reflecting blows and magical attacks.
Also, the power of the amulet is capable of teleporting the golem to its master, even if they are on different planes of existence.</string>
<string name="108087">Golem Head</string>
<string name="108088">Anduvir</string>
<string name="108089">Forged within the heavenly fires of an electrical storm, the hilt of this blade pulses with barely contained energy, and constant bursts of lightning arc along the twin blades of this powerful sword.</string>

<string name="108094">Obelisk&apos;s Core</string>
<string name="108095">This magical orb of power was taken from the obelisk that created the dead-magic area below the beholder caves. Considering the fact that it powered the obelisk, this orb might be used to create dead-magic zones.</string>
<string name="108096">Stone Slab</string>
<string name="108097">Strange and ancient writings are inscribed on this stone slab. Over the scribing are many remarks written in common with a bold and clear black ink. It seems as if the remarks translate the ancient text:
 &quot;The great obelisk has been activated and all magic has been negated within our compound. Hopefully, this would stop the onslaught of this powerful magical enemy as they won&apos;t be able to cast their destructive spells upon us nor use their magical artifacts and weapons. Even with the obelisk deactivated and destroyed, we could still use the core as a weapon against them. Activating the core while being carried by a living creature would trigger a burst of magic negating force that would negate the enemy&apos;s ability to channel magical energy long enough for our warriors to bring them down.&quot;</string>
<string name="108098">Merchant&apos;s Compass</string>
<string name="108099">This magical compass will help direct you to the item it is keyed to: in this case, a shard of broken glass.

When activated, the compass will flash periodically. The closer you are to the desired item, the faster it will flash.</string>
<string name="108100">Drider Chief Properties</string>
<string name="108101">Mirror of All-Seeing</string>
<string name="108102">Also known as &quot;The Shattered Mirror&quot;, the surface of this looking glass is scarred with a criss-crossing network of cracks, and it has obviously been broken and pieced together many times.

Peering into the glass reveals a distorted image that seems to shift and change the longer one stares at it. While it is clear the image is not a reflection of the person looking in, the exact details of the scene within the mirror are difficult to fathom.

&quot;The golems you create are like your children, but like all children they must be disciplined from time to time. There are several items a mage would be wise to consider to help maintain control over his or her creations. 

A Mithral Statue combined with two parts of blue powder will yield a Golem Crasher.
Combining Golden Rod with one part blue powder and one part yellow will give a Golem Binder.
To create a Golem Attractor, take a Magical Crystal and combine it with one part blue powder and one part red powder.

These three items will allow you to maintain control of your golems, and prevent them from ever turning against you.

<string name="108127">The grey-bladed twin of its partner, &quot;Hatred,&quot; the witchwood grip of this finely crafted kukri has been stained and darkened by the sweat and blood of countless Shadow Masters over the centuries. There was a time when ownership of the pair inferred the right of leadership over the fabled Guild of Night but, over time, duplicates surfaced, splintering the Guild into countless secret societies, some of which still exist today.</string>
<string name="108128">The Guardian Guide</string>
<string name="108129">This work appears to detail the Maker&apos;s efforts to create a single, perfect golem.
Most of the volume describes failed experiments, interspersed with ramblings that demonstrate Alsigard&apos;s downward spiral into complete insanity.

However, the final passage reveals an important breakthrough:

&quot;It is all clear to me now. I must construct my greatest success from my previous failures. 

First, I must gather 6 pieces from destroyed golems: 2 legs, 2 arms, a torso and the head. 
Then, I can unlock the golem construction machine by targeting it with the Activator. Once open, I can then place the pieces inside, along with the controlling amulet.
This will activate the spell conduits so that I can cast my enchantments on them, giving my creation powers and abilities far beyond any other golem, as described in my previous work &apos;Magics of Golem Enhancements&apos;.

When the process is complete, I can then retrieve the controlling amulet and use it to summon my perfect being.

The enchantments and powerful arcane spells needed for this delicate process could only be channeled by the most powerful wielders of arcane sorcery. However, I trust that even my apprentices would be able to follow these instructions&quot;.</string>

<string name="108131">Assanti</string>
<string name="108132">Assanti was once a demon worshipped by the kuo-toa, until the tribe that worshipped him was slaughtered and the demon was captured by a powerful drow wizard. The demon is said to reside in this weapon, which was made for the wizard&apos;s pet, a drider named Harahasha. When the wizard&apos;s clan was destroyed by a rival family, the weapon was lost in an earthquake that engulfed the wizard&apos;s home.</string>
<string name="108133">The Robe of the Drow</string>
<string name="108134">The fabric of this robe is woven from thin strips of a mysterious material that is capable of storing magical spells. A caster need only cast a defensive spell upon the robe. The robe will then store the spell so that it may be cast at a later time, instantly. This robe is capable of storing three spells.

Among the ever treacherous drow, these garments are popular as gifts to allies and underlings, as they are magically bound with their creators in such a way that betrayal will result in the garment becoming cursed. </string>

<string name="108229">In the grand drow tradition of royal daughters, Zesyyr, heir to House Maeviir, has asked you to kill her mother, Matron Myrune.</string>
<string name="108230">Myrune is dead, and Zesyyr has taken over as Matron of House Maeviir. You can only hope she doesn&apos;t decide to betray you as she did her mother.</string>
<string name="108231">You&apos;ve betrayed Zesyyr to her mother, Matron Myrune of House Maeviir. Hopefully Myrune will remember your loyalty to her when the army of the Valsharess is on her doorstep.</string>
<string name="108232">You&apos;ve accepted Zesyyr&apos;s offer, and agreed to assassinate her mother. She&apos;s given you a ring to get you past the guards outside House Maeviir, but once inside you&apos;re on your own.</string>
<string name="108233">A Strange Island Town</string>
<string name="108234">The tiefling Valen has mentioned a strange town supposedly located on a nearby island. According to rumor, the settlement appeared overnight on a small island that was formerly deserted. You might be able to use whatever magic transported or created this town against the Valsharess.

The Boatman in the ports to the East might be able to give you more information about this.</string>
<string name="108235">Cavallas the Boatman can take you to the strange town that appeared seemingly overnight. Though he couldn&apos;t provide many details, he did mention that the town is made up of winged elves. 

These strange elves might be able to help you against the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108236">The strange town of Shaori Fell has been restored to its rightful place, and you&apos;ve managed to recover a magic mirror. Hopefully the powerful artifact can be of use against the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108237">You&apos;ve told the Seer about the Shattered Mirror, and that you intend to keep it for yourself. She didn&apos;t seem upset that you chose to keep the artifact for your own use, though she did warn you to be careful of its power.</string>
<string name="108238">You&apos;ve given the Shattered Mirror to the Seer. Knowing the dangers of the artifact, she is reluctant to use it now. Hopefully, it can safely guide her and her people once the Valsharess is defeated.</string>
<string name="108239">You&apos;ve told the Seer that you plan to give the Shattered Mirror to the illithid. Though eager to have them abandon the Valsharess, the Seer was was wary of what havoc such creatures might create with such an artifact at their disposal.</string>
<string name="108240">Aghaaz</string>
<string name="108241">A demon flesh golem named Aghaaz has recruited you to destroy Ferron, the leader of a group of rebel golems. If you bring Aghaaz Ferron&apos;s head, he has promised to send some of his golems to aid you in your battle against the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108242">You&apos;ve given Aghaaz the head of Ferron, effectively ending the golem rebellion. For your help, Aghaaz has promised to send his golems with you when you march against the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108243">Avariel Trapped Beneath the Earth</string>
<string name="108244">After being attacked by a party of drow, you&apos;ve stumbled across several Avariel - winged elves. Obviously there is something strange going on here, for the Avariel are known for their dislike of dark, confined spaces.

The mystery likely has something to do with the Avariel Queen, who now lives in a cave in the south east section of town.</string>
<string name="108245">You&apos;ve met Shaori, the Avariel Queen - though she is now nothing but a reclusive hermit. She mentioned something about pieces of a magical mirror and suggested you should go to the castle if you want to learn more.</string>
<string name="108246">You&apos;ve met an odd little man who claims to be Queen Shaori&apos;s fool. He&apos;s explained to you that the town is cursed, and that the only way to remove the curse is to recover the missing pieces of a magical mirror. He believes the pieces can be found in the town&apos;s library, the temple, the wizard&apos;s tower, with the town merchant and with the Queen in her cave.</string>
<string name="108247">You&apos;ve met an odd little man who claims to be Queen Shaori&apos;s fool. He&apos;s explained to you that the town is cursed, and that the only way to remove the curse is to recover the five missing pieces of a magical mirror. He believes the pieces can be found in the town&apos;s library, the temple, the wizard&apos;s tower, with the town merchant and with the Queen in her cave.

The fool has warned you that a drow named Sabal is also trying to recover the missing pieces. Once all five pieces are accounted for, you will have to return to the throne room.</string>
<string name="108248">All five pieces of the mirror have been recovered and the fool has returned the Avariel kingdom to its rightful place among the mountains of the Lost Peak. In exchange for your help, he&apos;s given you the mirror - a powerful but dangerous magical artifact.</string>
<string name="108249">Between you and the drow Sabal, all the missing pieces of the Shattered Mirror have been collected. Now you only have to return to the castle to claim the mirror for your own... assuming Sabal lets you.</string>
<string name="108250">Beholders Allied with the Valsharess</string>
<string name="108251">Nathyrra has told you of a hive of beholders to the west of the drow village that have allied themselves with the Valsharess. If you could destroy them - or turn them against the Valsharess - it will significantly weaken her army.</string>
<string name="108252">The beholders who have joined the Valsharess all come from a single hive to the west of the rebel camp. It is unlikely you will be able to reason with them: if you want to weaken the Valsharess, you will have to kill the Eye Tyrant leading the colony.</string>
<string name="108253">With the death of the Eye Tyrant, the beholders are no longer a threat to join the army of the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108254">The Seer was pleased to learn that the beholders will not be among the army of the Valsharess when the attack on Lith My&apos;athar finally comes.</string>
<string name="108255">Captured Deva</string>
<string name="108256">The Vix&apos;thrites have imprisoned a young astral deva named Lavoera and have been using a strange contraption to siphon off her blood for some nefarious purpose. </string>

<string name="108262">The Vix&apos;thrites have imprisoned a young astral deva named Lavoera and have been using a strange contraption to siphon off her blood for some nefarious purpose. Lavoera has been killed in battle, fighting for the forces of good until her very last moment.</string>
<string name="108263">Defeating the Valsharess</string>
<string name="108264">Halaster has cast you down to into the Underdark and placed a geas upon you. The only way to be free of the wizard&apos;s bond is to find and destroy the Valsharess.

Fortunately, the mad mage has teleported you into the heart of a rebel drow camp, where you&apos;ve met the Seer - an ally who will aid you against the Valsharess.
</string>
<string name="108265">The Seer believes you are the only one capable of stopping the Valsharess and her massive army. You have to find some way to weaken the Valsharess and her allies, or find a way to strengthen the Seer and her band of followers.</string>
<string name="108266">In exchange for promising to betray the Seer and her followers, the Valsharess has removed the geas Halaster placed upon you. Now you must decide if you will go through with your treachery...</string>
<string name="108267">The Valsharess has approached you in a dream, and offered to remove the geas Halaster placed upon you if you betray the Seer and her followers. Though you refused her, you know that should you change your mind during the siege, the Valsharess would still welcome you...</string>
<string name="108268">You&apos;ve betrayed the Seer and all her followers, proving her prophetic powers weren&apos;t very prophetic at all.</string>
<string name="108269">Mephistopheles, the devil the Valsharess managed to capture, has played you and the Valsharess against each other. This will only end when one of you is dead.</string>

<string name="108271">The village of Drearing&apos;s Deep, a ragged assortment of crumbling huts in the Underdark&apos;s less-traveled depths, is apparently home to a community of ex-slaves who have managed to escape from their former masters.

<string name="108276">You have killed Sodalis, the High Priest of Vix&apos;thra who ruled tyranically over the slave village of Drearing&apos;s Deep. The priesthood remains, however.

<string name="108283">You&apos;ve purchased a female slave from the illithid and sent her off to the fighting pits - a truly grim fate. At least you&apos;ll be able to wager on her battles... until she dies.</string>
<string name="108284">You&apos;ve purchased a female slave from the illithid. However, once free from their mind controlling powers she attacked you. Obviously, she would rather die than live her life in servitude.</string>
<string name="108285">You&apos;ve come up with a plan to gain the freedom of the female slave you purchased from the illithid. Because of the mind flayers&apos; telepathic abilities, you can&apos;t reveal your plan to her.

You&apos;ve sent her to deliver a fake message to the Seer. Since she believes she is magically bound to you, the illithid will consider her a slave in your service and allow her to leave their city. Once back at the rebel camp, you can explain the truth to her.</string>
<string name="108286">You&apos;ve purchased a female slave from the illithid and sent her off to the fighting pits - she fought bravely but died as a gladiator.</string>
<string name="108287">The slave you freed from the illithid managed to find her way back to the Seer&apos;s camp. Once the threat of the Valsharess is no more, the Seer has promised to help her find her way back to the surface so she can leave the Underdark behind her forever.</string>
<string name="108288">The female slave from the illithid slave market has been killed.</string>
<string name="108289">Ferron</string>
<string name="108290">Ferron, the metallic leader of a group of golem rebels, has asked for your help in retrieving an artifact known as the Power Source so that he can lead the golems away from the halls of the Maker and the tyrannical rule of Aghaaz, the self-proclaimed leader of the golems on the island.</string>
<string name="108291">You&apos;ve given Ferron the Power Source, effectively freeing the golems. As long as they keep the Power Source with them, they can freely travel to any destination they wish. In exchange for your aid, Ferron has promised that his golems will join with you when you move against the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108292">Golems on an Island</string>
<string name="108293">The tiefling Valen told you of a nearby island that is supposed to be inhabited completely by golems. If you could find a way to control these constructs, you could use them against the Valsharess and her army.

The Boatman in the ports to the East might be able to give you more information about this.</string>
<string name="108294">You&apos;ve learned that the Isle of the Maker was once home to a powerful duergar wizard who retired there to perfect the art of creating golems. If this wizard still lives, he might be able to help you against the Valsharess. If he&apos;s dead, you still might be able to use his creations in the coming battle.

Should you wish to investigate this island, Cavallas the Boatman can take you there.</string>
<string name="108295">The Seer was pleased to learn of the golem allies you acquired for her forces.</string>
<string name="108296">You&apos;ve discovered a band of duergar on the island, but if you want to learn anything about the Maker or his golems you&apos;ll have to explore the remains of his dungeon.</string>
<string name="108297">You&apos;ve encountered a group of sentient golems created by the Maker long ago. They&apos;ve offered to help you against the Valsharess... if you first help them.</string>

<string name="108302">Nathyrra has told you of an illithid city to the west of the drow village that has allied itself with the Valsharess. If you can find some way to turn them against the Valsharess it will significantly weaken her army.</string>
<string name="108303">The illithid who serve the Valsharess come from a number of different colonies, and serve a number of different Overminds. However, it may be possible to persuade one of the Overminds to convince the others to withdraw their support of the Valsharess.

The small illithid colony of Zorvak&apos;Mur is located to the west of the drow encampment. While killing the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind will accomplish nothing, negotiating with it could result in all the Overminds abandoning the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108304">Though you killed the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind, you have failed in your mission to stop the illithid from joining the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108305">The Seer was pleased to learn that the illithid have abandoned the Valshraess.</string>
<string name="108306">Shaori&apos;s Cave</string>
<string name="108307">The Fool believes one of the pieces of the shattered mirror is in the cave of Queen Shaori, located past the library in the south east of the town.</string>
<string name="108308">You&apos;ve spoken with the former Avariel Queen. Shaori has turned her back on her people and become a hermit. 

She did mention that she gave a piece of a magical mirror to a drow named Sabal, and she suggested you should investigate the castle to the north west.</string>
<string name="108309">You&apos;ve met Shaori, the former ruler of this strange town. She&apos;s become a hermit, abandoning her throne to live alone in a cave.</string>
<string name="108310">Slave Revolt</string>
<string name="108311">You&apos;ve freed a group of slaves from the pens of Zorvak&apos;Mur. Though eager for freedom, you&apos;ve convinced the slaves to wait until you reach the Elder Brain before they begin their revolt. However, you know that if their rebellion succeeds, any chance of convincing the illithid to abandon the Valsharess is likely gone.</string>
<string name="108312">You&apos;ve freed a group of slaves from the pens of Zorvak&apos;Mur. Under their leader, Argosus, they&apos;ve launched a bid for freedom. The only downside is that you&apos;ve likely destroyed any chance you had of convincing the illithid to abandon the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108313">You&apos;ve betrayed Argosus and his followers in order to garner the goodwill of the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind. No doubt the slaves will suffer terribly for their attempted escape, but it&apos;s a price you&apos;re willing to pay.
</string>
<string name="108314">The Beholder Caves</string>
<string name="108315">You have met Attiz, a Kobold slave in the Beholder caves. According to Attiz, the Beholders have stumbled upon a series of ancient tunnels beneath their own cave. Attiz claims that the Beholders have sent him down into these tunnels to explore the area. Attiz managed to retrieved an ancient stone slab before he was attacked by huge spiders, but apparently the Beholders have taken away the stone slab.</string>
<string name="108316">You have found the ancient slab that was supposedly retrieved by the Kobold slave Attiz. The slab might contain useful information about the ruins below. </string>
<string name="108317">You have disabled the ancient obelisk that nullified any kind of magic in the tunnels below the Beholder caves. It seems that the core of the obelisk can now be taken.</string>
<string name="108318">The Library</string>
<string name="108319">A guard at the library warned you of a dangerous medusa inside - a creature that was once his beautiful wife.</string>
<string name="108320">A guard at the library warned you of a dangerous medusa inside - a creature that was once his beautiful wife.

The guard also mentioned a way you might be able to speak with the medusa safely. There is a potion in his old bedroom in the southern side of the library that will prevent the medusa&apos;s petrifying gaze from turning you to stone.</string>
<string name="108321">You&apos;ve spoken to the medusa inside the library, and it is obvious the transformation has left her quite insane. She seems intent on burning all the books in the building, rendering them virtually worthless.</string>
<string name="108322">You&apos;ve spoken to the medusa inside the library, and it is obvious the transformation has left her quite insane. She seems intent on burning all the books in the building, rendering them virtually worthless.

The medusa did make mention of a shard from a broken mirror she keeps in her possession. If you can get it from her, you might be able to use it later.</string>
<string name="108323">The medusa is dead, slain by the Red Sisters who ambushed you earlier. Anything of value the poor librarian may have had on her has been taken by the assassins.</string>
<string name="108324">You&apos;ve obtained the mirror shard from the medusa inside the library.</string>
<string name="108325">The Fool believes one of the pieces of the shattered mirror is in the library on the eastern edge of the town.</string>
<string name="108326">The Maker&apos;s Assistant</string>
<string name="108327">You&apos;ve encountered a ghostly apparition of the Maker&apos;s former assistant. His spirit has been trapped for five centuries by the Maker, but he can be freed if someone will bring him a small stone known as the soul gem. In exchange, he&apos;s offered you the password to get by the Keeper, the guardian protecting the lowest levels of the dungeon.</string>
<string name="108328">You&apos;ve convinced the Maker&apos;s assistant to give you the password to get by the Keeper so you can access the lowest levels of the dungeon. In exchange you&apos;ve promised to bring him the soul gem so he can be free. Whether you actually fulfill that promise remains to be seen...</string>
<string name="108329">You&apos;ve freed the Maker&apos;s assistant from his eternal torment and you&apos;ve managed to learn the password to get by the Keeper, the guardian of the lowest levels of the dungeon.</string>
<string name="108330">The Merchant</string>
<string name="108331">You&apos;ve run into a strange merchant who seems intent on getting rid of all his inventory, but only if he can do it without reaping any profits. His only remaining piece of value is a shard of a broken mirror.
He will only give it up if he is given something even less valuable in exchange.</string>
<string name="108332">According to the Fool, the merchant in the center of town has managed to find one of the pieces of the shattered mirror.</string>
<string name="108333">The merchant has given you a magical compass to lead you to his piece of the broken mirror. 

When activated, the compass will flash. The closer you get to the mirror shard, the faster it will flash. Using the compass and moving slowly throughout the town you should be able to find where the shard is hidden.</string>
<string name="108334">You&apos;ve found a shard from a broken mirror hidden in a pile of garbage, where it had been stashed by the strange merchant in the town center.</string>
<string name="108335">The Temple</string>
<string name="108336">According to the Fool, the temple on the western edge of town likely contains one of the pieces of the shattered mirror.</string>
<string name="108337">Upon entering the temple you were afflicted with a terrible disease. The only way to rid yourself of this plague is to get the antidote from the temple&apos;s resident priest.

He has offered you the antidote if you successfully complete a series of trials by combat. He&apos;s also promised to give you a piece of a magical mirror... should you survive.</string>
<string name="108338">The priest has told you that Sabal - the leader of the drow who first attacked you upon entering the town - has already completed his challenge and claimed the reward of the broken mirror shard.

However, you are still afflicted with the strange disease, and the priest is the only one who has the antidote. It seems as though you&apos;re still going to have to complete his challenge.</string>
<string name="108339">You have been given the cure for the strange affliction, although the mirror shard the priest once possessed is now in the hands of Sabal and her drow.</string>
<string name="108340">You have been given the cure for the strange affliction and managed to claim the shard of the broken mirror that was in the priest&apos;s possession.</string>
<string name="108341">The Wizard&apos;s Tower</string>
<string name="108342">The Fool believes one of the pieces of the shattered mirror is now inside the wizard&apos;s tower on the north edge of town.</string>
<string name="108343">Petyr, the former archmage who resided inside the tower, has informed you that he found a piece of a magical mirror and gave it to his apprentice, who now dwells within the tower.</string>
<string name="108344">On the last level of the tower you&apos;ve come across the slain body of the wizard&apos;s apprentice. It&apos;s obvious the drow who attacked you earlier were responsible for his death, and they must have taken anything of value he may have had.</string>
<string name="108345">You&apos;ve claimed the magical mirror shard from the wizard&apos;s apprentice.</string>
<string name="108346">Undead Army of the Valsharess</string>
<string name="108347">Nathyrra has told you that the Valsharess commands a horde of undead. She believe the source of this horde is off to the west of the rebel camp. If you could destroy these undead, it would be a significant blow to the Valsharess. </string>
<string name="108348">Nobody is certain where the undead horde of the Valsharess is coming from, though there are rumors of a cult of necromancers hidden in the caverns to the west of the drow rebels. If the cult could be found, the source of all these undead could also be discovered and destroyed.</string>
<string name="108349">The Seer was pleased to learn that the Valsharess will no longer be able to call upon the undead hosts in the coming battle.</string>
<string name="108350">You&apos;ve discovered the source of the undead hosts: the cult of Vix&apos;thra had imprisoned an astral deva and were using her blood to animate an army of skeletons and corpses. With the Deva freed from her bonds, the cult can no longer provide undead for the Valsharess... though Vix&apos;thra himself could still be a threat</string>
<string name="108351">With Vix&apos;thra&apos;s death the cult that was supplying the Valsharess with undead is no more. The Seer will be pleased to learn of this development.
</string>
<string name="108352">Zorvak&apos;Mur</string>
<string name="108353">On your way to the illithid city of Zorvak&apos;Mur, you&apos;ve encountered a group of duergar slavers. You&apos;ve learned that the mind flayers of Zorvak&apos;Mur allow non-illithid slavers to enter their city, but you&apos;ll need some type of mental protection to keep them from attacking you.

Once inside the city, you need to try and find the Elder Brain. According to the Seer, you may be able to convince it to withdraw the illithid support of the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108354">You&apos;ve gained access to the illithid city of Zorvak&apos;Mur. As long as you continue to wear the helm that protects you from the mind flayers&apos; telepathic powers, you should be able to convince the illithid that you are nothing but a slaver visiting their city.

You still need to try and find the Elder Brain. According to the Seer, you may be able to convince it to withdraw the illithid support of the Valsharess.
</string>
<string name="108355">You&apos;ve promised to give the Zorvak&apos;Mur Overmind a magical mirror. In exchange, it will convince the Elder Concorde - a collection of illithid Elder Brains - to withdraw their support from the Valsharess.
</string>
<string name="108356">You&apos;ve freed a group of slaves from the pens of Zorvak&apos;Mur, and they plan to start a rebellion once you&apos;ve reached the Elder Brain. Should their revolt succeed, you likely won&apos;t have any chance of gaining the support of Zorvak&apos;Mur or the illithid in your cause.</string>
<string name="108357">You&apos;ve betrayed the slave rebellion for the sake of the greater good. By denying Argosus and his followers their freedom, you still have a chance to convince the Zorvak&apos;Mur Elder Brain to help you against the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="108358">The illithid of Zorvak&apos;Mur have attacked you. The chances of reaching the Elder Brain now are slim, but if you do it might still be possible to negotiate a treaty with it.</string>
<string name="108359">You&apos;ve destroyed the Elder Brain of Zorvak&apos;Mur, crippling the city. However, your actions have done little to harm the Valsharess, as she will simply draw on the illithid from other areas for her army.</string>
<string name="108360">You&apos;ve unleashed a wave of violence in Zorvak&apos;Mur. Any chance you had of gaining the Elder Brain&apos;s support is surely lost.</string>
<string name="108361">You&apos;ve given the magical mirror to the Overmind of Zorvak&apos;Mur. In exchange, it has promised to convince the Elder Concorde - a collection of illithid Overminds - to withdraw their support from the Valsharess.

The only drawback is that you have given the illithid a dangerously powerful artifact. No doubt their entire race will become stronger because of it. Despite your success, you can&apos;t help but wonder if the cost was too high.</string>

You promised me at least a dozen beholders to help attack the rebellious drow. What I have seen from you thus far is only two beholders! I am sending some of my slaves with this letter to escort the remaining beholders. Satisfy me and I may not bind you to spend the rest of eternity in the dark. Exceed my expectations and I will give you their weight in gold as well. Disappoint me, however, and I will destroy even the memory of your pathetic little hive. The choice is yours...&quot;</string>

<string name="108655">And so the tale is done.</string>
<string name="108656">In the lore of an age that was famed for its heroes as well as its villains, your legend will live on. Scribes will read of your deeds in dusty tomes and marvel that ever there was a time where such an adventurer walked the face of Toril.</string>
<string name="108657">Knowing how the tale ends, however, is only part of the story. There is evidence in the old tomes that tell of your fate in the years to come, the fate of your companions and the effect your passing had upon the world.</string>
<string name="108658">As for the Sleeping Man, there were few who mourned his passing. The Celestials had long since forgotten him and little love was held for him in Baator. On the far-off plane of Limbo, some githzerai still try to live by his teachings. He is remembered best, perhaps, by the bards who still sing your tale. To them, he is a tragic figure who gambled and lost everything in the name of love...</string>
<string name="108659">The ghost of Aribeth de Tylmarande reveled with you amidst the heady spoils of war. She never grew old. She never lost her beauty nor did her feigned passion for you fade. Commanded by her True Name to love you, she played the role faithfully until you were old and gray and triumphant. As you died, she leaned close, biting a chunk of flesh out of your ear. &quot;I shall see you in the Hells, my love,&quot; she whispered. She disappeared soon after your death, and legend claims that you did meet once more in the Hells, exactly as she promised. The battle that came then was vicious, its outcome unknown...</string>
<string name="108660">The ghost of Aribeth de Tylmarande never grew old and she never lost her beauty. Commanded by her True Name, she did so until you were old and gray and in your dying breath. In that moment between life and death, she leaned close and whispered in your ear, &quot;To the Hells with you, whom I love...&quot;</string>
<string name="108661">Nathyrra finally left the Underdark, but she found no freedom on the surface. Forever bound to you by the power of her True Name, she was forced to abandon Eilistraee and the Seer. An absolute slave to your will, she could do nothing but act as you commanded, assassinate whomever crossed your plans and plot a revenge she could never have...</string>
<string name="108662">Denied of his true freedom by your command, Valen abandoned his dreams of exploration and instead served your whims slavishly to the end of his days. Though he professed to love you, the claims rang ever more hollow until he was but a shell of a man, a shadow of his former self. He died in his sleep, old and rheumy well before his time, his love of battle&apos;s glory long since faded into the monotony of a wasted life...</string>
<string name="108663">&quot;Damn my back is sore.&quot;</string>
<string name="108664">&quot;Stay clear of the Quarry Office. Gru&apos;ul&apos;s in a foul mood...&quot;</string>

<string name="108675">&quot;I must admit, the sensei&apos;s faith intrigues me...&quot;</string>
<string name="108676">&quot;Hahahahaha! That was funny, boss! Do it to Mephistopheles when we find him, too, okay?&quot;</string>
<string name="108677">&quot;Having a change of heart, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="108678">&quot;Let us rid this place of him and his kind.&quot;</string>
<string name="108679">&quot;This isn&apos;t going anywhere. I say we just kill him.&quot;</string>
<string name="108680">&quot;You tell him, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="108681">&quot;You tell him, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="108682">&quot;Way to stick up for yourself, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="108683">&quot;I know you dismantled it, you meddling flame-eared little pantry-smacker!!! The question is, what in the Nine Hells are you going to do about it!!?!?&quot;</string>
<string name="108684">&quot;Like I told you last time, rump roast, feed the bloody little pest through! I&apos;ve got plenty of imps but only one Quarry Grinder 5, understood!?&quot;</string>
<string name="108685">&quot;You tell him, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="108686">&quot;No, boss, noooooooooooooooooo! Deekin doesn&apos;t want to goooooo!&quot;</string>
<string name="108687">&quot;The Seer was wrong about you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. A soul as dark as yours will destroy us all...&quot;</string>
<string name="108688">&quot;You are dead to me, betrayer! Speak my name no more...&quot;</string>
<string name="108689">&quot;Dark are the days of our acquaintance, then, and may the gods exact their vengeance on your soul...&quot;</string>
<string name="108690">&quot;Your days are numbered, &lt;LastName&gt;. Count them well.&quot;</string>
<string name="108691">&quot;For the sake of my father&apos;s blood, do not enslave me amongst my enemies!&quot; </string>
<string name="108692">&quot;You wouldn&apos;t dare! If I am to be enslaved, let it be in my own home, amongst my own people, not here in these frozen wastes with this blustering devil as my lord!&quot;</string>
<string name="108693">&quot;B-b-b-boss? Pick someone other than Deekin, okay?&quot;</string>
<string name="108694">&quot;No, &lt;FirstName&gt;, this is unjust! To even consider such a thing is abominable!&quot;</string>
<string name="108695">&quot;Go ahead, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I dare you...&quot;</string>
<string name="108696">&quot;Do not be tempted, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The righteous can put no trust in devils.&quot;</string>
<string name="108697">&quot;I don&apos;t know if I should commend you for your interest or slit you from nose to gullet, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="108698">&quot;Noooooo! Don&apos;t sell Deekin into eternal slavery, boss! How will he write your epic adventures!?&quot;</string>
<string name="108699">&quot;I have a bad feeling about this, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and want no part of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="108700">&quot;Don&apos;t negotiate with scoundrels, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Bash his head in or stand aside and let me do it!&quot;</string>
<string name="108701">&quot;What!?&quot;</string>
<string name="108702">&quot;Another soul saved from the clutches of Baator! You do Tyr honor, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You do us all honor.&quot;</string>
<string name="108703">&quot;Hehe, I hear we devils have you to thank for some Gate access, you little skunk-weasel! I&apos;ve sent word to the generals in the capital and received orders to gear up for a major offensive in the Blood War!&quot;</string>
<string name="108704">&quot;But I&apos;ve got a little spare time on the side right now and a bit of a proposition for you, by way of gratitude. Besides, I&apos;ve been hearing some tall tales about you lately, you little speck of goat-dust...&quot;</string>
<string name="108705">&quot;But I dismantled it!&quot;</string>
<string name="108706">&quot;But there&apos;s an imp in your grinder!&quot;</string>
<string name="108707">&quot;I have known warriors who scarred themselves before every battle. They claimed the wounds gave them the strength to face what was to come.&quot;</string>
<string name="108708">&quot;Fools and their faith, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="108709">&quot;It&apos;s a long story. There&apos;s a temple in the northwest corner of town that I can show you later.&quot;</string>
<string name="108710">&quot;Be careful, little one. You&apos;ll only injure yourself further.&quot;</string>
<string name="108711">&quot;I have known warriors who scarred themselves before every battle. They claimed the wounds gave them the strength to face what was to come.&quot;</string>
<string name="108712">&quot;Fools and their faith, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="108713">&quot;It&apos;s a long story. There&apos;s a temple in the northwest corner of town that I can show you later.&quot;</string>
<string name="108714">&quot;That&apos;s a serious wound, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Be careful what you promise.&quot;</string>
<string name="108715">&quot;That doesn&apos;t look good, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;ll see what I can do.&quot;</string>
<string name="108716">&quot;That should teach him...&quot;</string>
<string name="108717">&quot;He bears his pain well...&quot;</string>
<string name="108718">&quot;I suppose that&apos;s one way of handling the matter.&quot;</string>
<string name="108719">&quot;&lt;FullName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="108720">&quot;Eeek!&quot;</string>
<string name="108721">&quot;Lost... Our poor leader has joined the Lost...&quot;</string>
<string name="108722">&quot;Devoured... Gone in a flash of white...&quot;</string>
<string name="108723">&quot;It&apos;s only a matter of time...&quot;</string>
<string name="108724">The phantom glances up, staring right through you as if you weren&apos;t even there.</string>
<string name="108725">&quot;It&apos;s so... c-c-cold everywhere...&quot;</string>
<string name="108726">&quot;The Gates are open... Away with this infernal cold... I&apos;m going home... to haunt... If only I can remember where home is... Maybe I&apos;ll just go... and see if I can find it...&quot;</string>
<string name="108727">1-LINER GHOST. FEMALE OR OLD MAN. MULTIPLES. CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE IN CITY BUT WILL CONCENTRATE NEAR GATES.</string>
<string name="108728">&quot;Would you mind some company?&quot;</string>
<string name="108729">&quot;As you wish, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="108730">&quot;Let us leave at once, then. We have many leagues ahead of us.&quot;</string>
<string name="108731">&quot;There is blood to be spilled, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Let us make this Hell live up to its name.&quot;</string>
<string name="108732">&quot;Sally forth alone, then. Don&apos;t look to me for mercy when I find you gutted on some devil&apos;s pike.&quot;</string>
<string name="108733">&quot;I think I&apos;m beginning to like you.&quot;</string>
<string name="108734">&quot;You can start by purging the weak from your company, then. Your entourage is too large to travel through the Hells. Too many hangers-on will only slow us down.&quot;</string>
<string name="108735">&quot;In the name of all that is good, then, do you seek a Paladin of Tyr, once fallen, now redeemed, to fight by your side? I would consider it an honor to serve.&quot;</string>
<string name="108736">&quot;Then I will stand guard here and clear a space where good might flourish.&quot;</string>
<string name="108737">&quot;Then let us sally forth and be on our guard. Evil has us outnumbered in this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="108738">&quot;Then return to me when you have a smaller entourage. If we intend to travel the Hells, we must be lean and efficient, able to share the warmth of a single fire.&quot;</string>
<string name="108739">&quot;Yes, I learned them once when I first arrived, when I was still struggling to find the meaning of things here. I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve forgotten all but the last, however, but that is one I doubt I shall ever forget.&quot;</string>
<string name="108740">&quot;Engraved in stone at the foot of where he sleeps is the answer to the sensei&apos;s Fifth-Fold Mystery: &apos;She will find you by the Gates of Cania.&apos; The words haunted me somehow and I cannot let go of them, even now.&quot;</string>
<string name="108741">&quot;Faith is a fool&apos;s game, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I&apos;ve played it long enough to know. The dreams of the Sleeping Man are just that: dreams... They can be shattered like any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="108742">But if you must know, I still recall the sensei&apos;s Fifth-Fold Mystery. &apos;What was the answer?&apos; she asks... &apos;She will find you by the Gates of Cania.&apos; Make of it what you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="108743">&quot;And I with you. Come, we have much to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="108744">&quot;I&apos;ll forgive you that but I shall not forget it... Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="108745">&quot;Deekin&apos;s True Name! What&apos;s it you want me to be doing, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="108746">&quot;Nothing? Nothing at all? Well that&apos;s a waste of a True Name, if you ask Deekin. How much did you spend on that again, boss? Oh well, we gots an adventure to finish, so hurry up.&quot;</string>
<string name="108747">&quot;Boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="108748">&quot;Yes, boss. Deekin will be all right... Really sad, but all right. Are you planning on dying, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="108749">&quot;Yes, boss. Deekin believe in himself. Anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="108750">&quot;Uh... Boss? Deekin kinda needs that soul. It&apos;s the only one he&apos;s got, see? Are you sure that&apos;s what you be wanting?&quot;</string>
<string name="108751">&quot;Oh phew! You had Deekin scared for a second there, boss. Maybe these True Names aren&apos;t so much fun after all... Have you gots any other commands for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="108752">&quot;Eeek... Okay, boss, here goes nothing... G&apos;bye... So long and thanks for all the fish... Don&apos;t let the gate hits you on the way out... AieeeeeEEEEeeee!&quot;</string>
<string name="108753">Valen&apos;s eyes grow wide as he hears the words. &quot;My True Name,&quot; he acknowledges, his eyes filled with a mixture of indignation and awe. &quot;How do you... intend to command me?&quot;</string>
<string name="108754">He sneers at you with disgust. &quot;You would force me to love you, my lady? After all we have been through?&quot;</string>
<string name="108755">Valen looks at you curiously, as if he didn&apos;t quite understand what you said... and then suddenly his eyes go wide. He stiffens, an electrical current running through his body violently.</string>
<string name="108756">A moment later, he spasms as a strange, black sheen seemingly lifts from his body and is dispersed. When he opens his eyes there is something... different about him. The otherworldly aura, the rage within his soul... all of it is gone.</string>
<string name="108757">&quot;I... I can&apos;t believe it!&quot; He looks at himself with incredulity, slowly smiling. &quot;The taint... it&apos;s gone! I feel... I feel wonderful! I feel human!!&quot; Laughing joyously, Valen hugs you. &quot;Thank you! Thank you for this wonderful gift!&quot;</string>
<string name="108758">Valen&apos;s eyes flash a dangerous red. &quot;Take my soul,&quot; he growls, &quot;and that will be the end of me. Forever. Are you certain that is what you wish?&quot;</string>
<string name="108759">Valen nods, relieved. &quot;Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Please... ask nothing more of me, I beg you.&quot;</string>
<string name="108760">Before your eyes, Valen begins to shake violently. He screams in pure rage and agony as his vital essence is suddenly stripped away, his physical form fading away to so much dust. Valen&apos;s soul is now yours.</string>
<string name="108761">He stares at you in confusion. &quot;I am grateful, my lady, but... you would force me to love you? Even though that is not truly love at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="108762">He looks away, unwilling to look you in the eyes. &quot;Will there be anything else, my lady?&quot;</string>
<string name="108763">Valen stares at you with his intense blue eyes, clenching his jaw. &quot;So be it... my love. Your mastery over me knows no bounds. Should I ever free myself, however... I will kill you. Trust me on that.&quot;</string>
<string name="108764">Valen&apos;s eyes show only relief. &quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am grateful. Now... we should go through the gate as soon as possible if we are to rescue your Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="108765">He glares at you, his eyes burning a dark red... but he says nothing. Slowly, his gauntleted fists clench and unclench.</string>
<string name="108766">Valen struggles to resist your command, but finally gives in. He leans in, kissing you tenderly on the lips with his eyes closed. When you part, tears are streaming down his cheeks.</string>
<string name="108767">&quot;I hope this makes you happy, my lady,&quot; he spits. He refuses to look you in the eyes.</string>
<string name="108768">He stops and gazes into your eyes, his expression suddenly loving. Leaning in he kisses you softly. &quot;I suppose that there is.&quot;</string>
<string name="108769">&quot;Waterdeep awaits us, my love. The longer we wait here, the more people are hurt by Mephistopheles... he must be stopped.&quot;</string>
<string name="108770">His smile comes easily to him now. &quot;You have no idea, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It... it is as if a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders.&quot;</string>
<string name="108771">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can never repay you for this. Now... we should go through the gate as soon as possible if we are to rescue your Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="108772">&quot;My True Name... What... what do you intend to do with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="108773">&quot;I... I am relieved. Now hurry, we must go through the gate and return to Toril. If we wait much longer, Mephistopheles will destroy all of Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="108774">A look of fear creeps into her dark-veiled eyes. &quot;But if I give you my soul, it will be the death of me. I would be nothing but dust without it... Are you sure of what you ask, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="108775">&quot;Thank you for that small mercy, my Lord. I beg you, though, ask nothing more of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="108776">The drow screams as her vital essence is ripped away. Before your eyes she ages a thousand years, her skin wrinkling, her eyes sinking, her body withering into a pile of bones and dust. Nathyrra&apos;s soul is now yours.</string>
<string name="108777">The drow&apos;s head snaps back and she lets out a cry of pain and despair. She speaks through tightly clenched teeth: &quot;You would force me to love you? What kind of beast are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="108778">&quot;My True Name gives you mastery over me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am compelled to obey, no matter how you abuse your power. But if I ever find a way to break free, I will kill you! ...Now what more abuse have you in store for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="108779">She spits on the ground in disgust, but she can do nothing else against the power of her True Name. &quot;Will that be all?&quot;</string>
<string name="108780">She lets out a cry of rage, but does as you command. When the kiss is over, she turns away, unable to face you. It&apos;s obvious you&apos;ve broken her spirit utterly.</string>
<string name="108781">&quot;You&apos;ve made your point, &lt;FirstName&gt;,&quot; she says in a fierce whisper. &quot;Now we must find out if your power over Mephistopheles is as absolute as your power over me. What more do you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="108782">Nathyrra&apos;s eyes open wide in surprise. She seems about to object, then she bows her head. When she looks up, there is a strange expression on her face.</string>
<string name="108783">&quot;My... my guilt is gone,&quot; she says, amazed. &quot;It has vanished, as if it never existed. I... I&apos;m free. Thank you for this, &lt;FirstName&gt;; you have given me a gift unlike any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="108784">&quot;But despite your kindness, I still find this... unsettling. The power of a True Name is a great responsibility - one I hope you will not abuse. Is there anything more you wish of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="108785">&quot;Yes, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="108786">&quot;And what of us, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Was I some plaything for you, too?&quot;</string>
<string name="108787">&quot;An unlikely story but one I&apos;ll believe for now. If we survive Mephistopheles, however, there&apos;s a long talk that I think the two of us need to have.&quot;</string>
<string name="108788">&quot;Then set your judgment straight, &lt;FirstName&gt;. She is a ghost, a dream, nothing more! There is nothing there to love... Come back to me. Be true to the words you&apos;ve spoken.&quot;</string>
<string name="108789">&quot;With all your heart? Whose heart did you borrow when you spoke to me, then? The Sleeping Man&apos;s?&quot;</string>
<string name="108790">&quot;You would believe the words of Mephistopheles&apos; own lover? What of me, is my love not enough for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="108791">&quot;See what your jealousy has wrought, drow!? You&apos;re still a selfish little girl! Just because you have breasts doesn&apos;t make you a woman... May the gods take mercy on your folly!&quot;</string>
<string name="108792">&quot;Save your sermons for the pulpit, ghost. You&apos;d best be long gone once &lt;FirstName&gt; and I are done with Mephistopheles because my tolerance for your preaching ends as soon as his blood flows...&quot;</string>
<string name="108793">&quot;Very well... If you&apos;re fool enough to fall for her, then who am I to end your folly? I&apos;m walking through that door for my own reasons, not for yours... Perhaps that&apos;s as it should be anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="108794">&quot;If things were as they should be, you would not be returning at all, ghost... Come, my love, duty waits for us back on Toril. I want to see this surface world you have told me so much about.&quot;</string>
<string name="108795">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You have what, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Well this has been a nice little game but consider it over! If I step through that door, it&apos;s because I have unfinished business in Toril, not for you...&quot;</string>
<string name="108796">&quot;You insolent... male! If this were the Underdark, I would kill you for such words! That door is my ticket to the surface, now, nothing else... And to think I fell in love with such a worm as you...&quot;</string>
<string name="108797">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;See, Aribeth? He has room for both of us in his bed! What is it that you so afraid of?&quot;</string>
<string name="108798">&quot;It seems wrong somehow but I love you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. &apos;Tis better to have half your heart than none at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="108799">&quot;Deekin&apos;s True Name! What&apos;s it you want me to be doing, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="108800">&quot;Nothing? Nothing at all? Well that&apos;s a waste of a True Name, if you ask Deekin. How much did you spend on that again, boss? Oh well, we gots an adventure to finish, so hurry up.&quot;</string>
<string name="108801">&quot;Boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="108802">&quot;Yes, boss. Deekin will be all right... Really sad, but all right. Are you planning on dying, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="108803">&quot;Yes, boss. Deekin believe in himself. Anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="108804">&quot;Uh... Boss? Deekin kinda needs that soul. It&apos;s the only one he&apos;s got, see? Are you sure that&apos;s what you be wanting?&quot;</string>
<string name="108805">&quot;Oh phew! You had Deekin scared for a second there, boss. Maybe these True Names aren&apos;t so much fun after all... Have you gots any other commands for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="108806">&quot;Eeek... Okay, boss, here goes nothing... G&apos;bye... So long and thanks for all the fish... Don&apos;t let the gate hits you on the way out... AieeeeeEEEEeeee!&quot;</string>
<string name="108807">Valen&apos;s eyes grow wide as he hears the words. &quot;My True Name,&quot; he acknowledges, his eyes filled with a mixture of indignation and awe. &quot;How do you... intend to command me?&quot;</string>
<string name="108808">He sneers at you with disgust. &quot;You would force me to love you, my lady? After all we have been through?&quot;</string>
<string name="108809">Valen looks at you curiously, as if he didn&apos;t quite understand what you said... and then suddenly his eyes go wide. He stiffens, an electrical current running through his body violently.</string>
<string name="108810">A moment later, he spasms as a strange, black sheen seemingly lifts from his body and is dispersed. When he opens his eyes there is something... different about him. The otherworldly aura, the rage within his soul... all of it is gone.</string>
<string name="108811">&quot;I... I can&apos;t believe it!&quot; He looks at himself with incredulity, slowly smiling. &quot;The taint... it&apos;s gone! I feel... I feel wonderful! I feel human!!&quot; Laughing joyously, Valen hugs you. &quot;Thank you! Thank you for this wonderful gift!&quot;</string>
<string name="108812">Valen&apos;s eyes flash a dangerous red. &quot;Take my soul,&quot; he growls, &quot;and that will be the end of me. Forever. Are you certain that is what you wish?&quot;</string>
<string name="108813">Valen nods, relieved. &quot;Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Please... ask nothing more of me, I beg you.&quot;</string>
<string name="108814">Before your eyes, Valen begins to shake violently. He screams in pure rage and agony as his vital essence is suddenly stripped away, his physical form fading away to so much dust. Valen&apos;s soul is now yours.</string>
<string name="108815">He stares at you in confusion. &quot;I am grateful, my lady, but... you would force me to love you? Even though that is not truly love at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="108816">He looks away, unwilling to look you in the eyes. &quot;Will there be anything else, my lady?&quot;</string>
<string name="108817">Valen stares at you with his intense blue eyes, clenching his jaw. &quot;So be it... my love. Your mastery over me knows no bounds. Should I ever free myself, however... I will kill you. Trust me on that.&quot;</string>
<string name="108818">Valen&apos;s eyes show only relief. &quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am grateful. Now... we should go through the gate as soon as possible if we are to rescue your Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="108819">He glares at you, his eyes burning a dark red... but he says nothing. Slowly, his gauntleted fists clench and unclench.</string>
<string name="108820">Valen struggles to resist your command, but finally gives in. He leans in, kissing you tenderly on the lips with his eyes closed. When you part, tears are streaming down his cheeks.</string>
<string name="108821">&quot;I hope this makes you happy, my lady,&quot; he spits. He refuses to look you in the eyes.</string>
<string name="108822">He stops and gazes into your eyes, his expression suddenly loving. Leaning in he kisses you softly. &quot;I suppose that there is.&quot;</string>
<string name="108823">&quot;Waterdeep awaits us, my love. The longer we wait here, the more people are hurt by Mephistopheles... he must be stopped.&quot;</string>
<string name="108824">His smile comes easily to him now. &quot;You have no idea, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It... it is as if a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders.&quot;</string>
<string name="108825">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can never repay you for this. Now... we should go through the gate as soon as possible if we are to rescue your Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="108826">&quot;My True Name... What... what do you intend to do with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="108827">&quot;I... I am relieved. Now hurry, we must go through the gate and return to Toril. If we wait much longer, Mephistopheles will destroy all of Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="108828">A look of fear creeps into her dark-veiled eyes. &quot;But if I give you my soul, it will be the death of me. I would be nothing but dust without it... Are you sure of what you ask, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="108829">&quot;Thank you for that small mercy, my Lord. I beg you, though, ask nothing more of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="108830">The drow screams as her vital essence is ripped away. Before your eyes she ages a thousand years, her skin wrinkling, her eyes sinking, her body withering into a pile of bones and dust. Nathyrra&apos;s soul is now yours.</string>

<string name="108843">&quot;For a black heart, your taste in skin is suddenly pale, &lt;FirstName&gt;. What of me? What of the words we&apos;ve spoken to each other? Is my love not enough for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="108844">&quot;You would believe the words of Mephistopheles&apos; own lover? What of me, is my love not enough for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="108845">&quot;See what your jealousy has wrought, drow!? You&apos;re still a selfish little girl! Just because you have breasts doesn&apos;t make you a woman... I should have killed you when I first laid eyes on you.&quot;</string>
<string name="108846">&quot;Well you&apos;d better do it before &lt;FirstName&gt; and I are done with Mephistopheles because my tolerance for you ends as soon as his blood flows...&quot;</string>
<string name="108847">&quot;Very well... If you&apos;re fool enough to fall for her, then knock yourself out. I&apos;m walking through that door for my own reasons, not for yours... All this talk of love is enough to make me sick.&quot;</string>
<string name="108848">&quot;Then go be sick and may you choke on it, ghost... Come, lover, duty waits for us back on Toril. I want to see this surface world you have told me so much about.&quot;</string>
<string name="108849">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You have what, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Well this has been a nice little game but consider it over! If I step through that door, it&apos;s because I have unfinished business in Toril, not for you...&quot;</string>

<string name="108851">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You can&apos;t compete with me, Nathyrra, so you might as well join me. I don&apos;t bite. It&apos;s really more of a nibble, isn&apos;t it, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="108852">&quot;If you&apos;re looking to shock me, Aribeth, try again. In case you&apos;ve been too busy to notice, I am a drow, after all... Let us share this male, then, and fight about him later.&quot;</string>
<string name="108853">&quot;You travel with too large a company. Forgive me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I prefer the intimacy of a smaller entourage.&quot;</string>
<string name="108854">&quot;Finish? We are just beginning, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="108855">&quot;You surround yourself with an entire retinue of fools. I refuse to travel with such a large party.&quot;</string>
<string name="108856">&quot;The Hells have fiends enough, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You would create another?&quot;</string>
<string name="108857">&quot;I don&apos;t like what that says of you and I, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="108858">&quot;Something big&apos;s gonna happen, boss... Deekin can feel it.&quot;</string>
<string name="108859">&quot;I was scorned and beaten, taught to hate and trained to kill! What would you have done in mine, pale elf?&quot;</string>
<string name="108860">&quot;She has the spark of the drow about her, doesn&apos;t she, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="108861">&quot;Yet you didn&apos;t love him?&quot;</string>
<string name="108862">&quot;Secret? Ooh, hold on! Boss, where did I puts my pen?&quot;</string>
<string name="108863">&quot;I, too, marched behind the standards of a distant war. It changes you, that much is sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="108864">&quot;Yes, if you are the one the spirits spoke of...&quot;</string>
<string name="108865">&quot;Ooh, are you from Neverwinter? Deekin knows this story!&quot;</string>
<string name="108866">&quot;We were just being nice, honest!&quot;</string>
<string name="108867">&quot;M&apos;Lady? Shall I bow and scrape as well?&quot;</string>
<string name="108868">&quot;They have spited all of us of late. Why should they spare you?&quot;</string>
<string name="108869">&quot;Yeah, the Sleeping Man!&quot;</string>
<string name="108870">&quot;Do you hear that, boss? We bards call that a &apos;maiden in distress.&apos;&quot;</string>
<string name="108871">&quot;Actually, I&apos;d rather not have you tagging along.&quot;</string>
<string name="108872">&quot;Not at all. Please join me.&quot;</string>
<string name="108873">&quot;And give half the spoils to you? Think again.&quot;</string>
<string name="108874">&quot;Yes, join with me in the cause of evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="108875">&quot;Perhaps another time, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="108876">&quot;It would be an honor to have you.&quot;</string>
<string name="108877">&quot;I seek the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="108878">&quot;I seek the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="108879">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Deekin]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Ixthyria the Scalesinger...&quot;</string>
<string name="108880">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="108881">&quot;Believe in yourself, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="108882">&quot;You&apos;re kind, you&apos;re talented, you&apos;re funny. You don&apos;t need me anymore. If I die, you&apos;ll be all right.&quot;</string>
<string name="108883">&quot;Not if I can help it. Come, we have an adventure to finish.&quot;</string>
<string name="108884">&quot;Surrender your soul to me, little one!&quot; </string>
<string name="108885">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>

<string name="108887">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Valen]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Oeskathine the Demonwrestler...&quot;</string>
<string name="108888">&quot;Nothing right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="108889">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="108890">&quot;I bind you to me as my lover forever!&quot;</string>
<string name="108891">&quot;I hereby free you from your infernal taint.&quot;</string>
<string name="108892">&quot;You&apos;re welcome.&quot;</string>
<string name="108893">&quot;Glad you like it. Now give me your soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="108894">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="108895">&quot;Sorry, my love, but this is it for us.&quot;</string>
<string name="108896">&quot;Yes, I am.&quot;</string>
<string name="108897">&quot;Good. Now, in repayment, you are to become my lover forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="108898">&quot;Well... perhaps not.&quot;</string>
<string name="108899">&quot;You heard me.&quot;</string>
<string name="108900">&quot;We&apos;re done. For now.&quot;</string>
<string name="108901">&quot;You don&apos;t frighten me. I own you, body and soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="108902">&quot;You&apos;re so sexy when you&apos;re mad. Give me a kiss!&quot;</string>
<string name="108903">&quot;So there&apos;s hope for us after all?&quot;</string>
<string name="108904">&quot;Does it really feel that different?&quot;</string>
<string name="108905">&quot;I&apos;m glad. You certainly earned it.&quot;</string>
<string name="108906">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Nathyrra]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Qeyifalia the Skyseeker...&quot;</string>

<string name="108912">&quot;Your anger is nothing to me. I own you, body and soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="108913">&quot;You&apos;re so sexy when you&apos;re mad. Give me a kiss!&quot;</string>
<string name="108914">&quot;Forgive yourself for your past crimes.&quot;</string>
<string name="108915">&quot;I won&apos;t do anything to harm you, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="108916">&quot;I don&apos;t know anymore, Nathyrra. I don&apos;t know...&quot;</string>
<string name="108917">&quot;Well... Yes, actually... A plaything&apos;s a fair description.&quot;</string>
<string name="108918">&quot;No, you I always loved, Nathyrra...&quot;</string>
<string name="108919">&quot;Why must you two always fight? Fine, I love neither of you!&quot;</string>
<string name="108920">&quot;Leave us be, Nathyrra. Aribeth is my love, not you.&quot;</string>
<string name="108921">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Aribeth, but Nathyrra&apos;s right. I loved her first and best.&quot;</string>
<string name="108922">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I have love enough for the both of you.&quot;</string>

<string name="108963">&quot;Why must you two always fight? Fine, I love neither of you!&quot;</string>
<string name="108964">&quot;Leave us be, Nathyrra. Aribeth is my love, not you.&quot;</string>
<string name="108965">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Aribeth, but Nathyrra&apos;s right. I loved her first and best.&quot;</string>
<string name="108966">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I have love enough for the both of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="108967">&quot;In doing this, you are only serving Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="108968">&quot;Now&apos;s not the time, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Ask me later when we are far from listening ears and prying eyes. I will tell you the truth about devils.&quot;</string>
<string name="108969">&quot;We had a half-Dabus in our battalion, once, helping to break the Baatezu encryptions. Until his death, our intelligence in the field was unsurpassed.&quot;</string>
<string name="108970">&quot;Can you not see me either? Enough of this, the jest grows old.&quot;</string>
<string name="108971">&quot;Let it rest, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I do not like all this speaking of me in the past tense.&quot;</string>
<string name="108972">&quot;The fools speak as if they cannot see me. It is as if, in my brush with the Land of the Lost, I have become nigh invisible to their eyes. As far as they can tell, I am gone from their world.&quot;</string>
<string name="108973">&quot;It was I, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though it is strange they do not recognize me. In my brush with the Land of the Lost, it seems I have become nigh invisible to their eyes. I am gone from their world.&quot;</string>

<string name="108989">&quot;If only it could be so easy. I am eager to be gone from this place before the call of the Blood War&apos;s infernal drums deafen me for good.&quot;</string>
<string name="108990">&quot;The fools. Why seek to justify? Teach them to embrace the truth of their evil, &lt;FirstName&gt;, just as you taught me!&quot;</string>
<string name="108991">&quot;It is true, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The memories of our past lives fade, even mine, eventful as it was.&quot;</string>
<string name="108992">&quot;To keep you in, &lt;FirstName&gt;. To keep all of us in...&quot;</string>

<string name="109003">&quot;Mephistopheles will pay for what these spirits suffer...&quot;</string>
<string name="109004">&quot;Aye, Mephistopheles has that one now. Another soul devoured... Soon there won&apos;t be any of us left except the Lost. If only we could live again, return home... But it&apos;s too cold here. I can feel it closing in...&quot;</string>
<string name="109005">&quot;Yes, Deekin sees it, too!&quot;</string>
<string name="109006">&quot;The dead don&apos;t sit well with me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I keep expecting to see the dim faces of those I&apos;ve vanquished in past battles...&quot;</string>
<string name="109007">&quot;The Gates are open... Away with this infernal cold... I&apos;m going home... to haunt... If only I can remember where home is... Maybe I&apos;ll just go... and see if I can find it...&quot;</string>
<string name="109008">&quot;I heard one of you scream and saw a flash of light...&quot;</string>
<string name="109009">&quot;You show cowardice to kick the weak, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109010">&quot;I don&apos;t get it either, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Each image is supposed to form part of a larger word, I believe. Is there some other word for a water-snake?&quot;</string>
<string name="109011">&quot;He makes pictures, boss, and you and Deekin guess what they is! What&apos;s another word for a water-snake? Ankle-biter? No, that not it...&quot;</string>
<string name="109012">&quot;It looks more like an eel to me. As for the math, I think it&apos;s trying to tell us that something is easy as opposed to hard. Eel-easy... Any thoughts about the final syllable, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="109013">&quot;I think each image is supposed to form a syllable of some larger word. What&apos;s another word for a water-snake?&quot;</string>
<string name="109014">&quot;An eel&apos;s a water-snake, isn&apos;t it? And that &quot;1+1=2&quot;, that&apos;s easy... So there we have it. Eel-easy... Any thoughts on the last word, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="109015">&quot;Ooh! Eel! Deekin thinks first syllable is eel! And &quot;1+1=2&quot; is easy! Eel-easy... But boss hasn&apos;t played yet! Deekin be real quiet while boss figures out that last one.&quot;</string>
<string name="109016">&quot;Ooo, like charades, boss! Second question, yes? How many syllables? Deekin used to play this all the time at clan gatherings!&quot;</string>
<string name="109017">&quot;If all else fails, we can simply lead him to all of them. He&apos;ll recognize the one he wants eventually...&quot;</string>
<string name="109018">&quot;Yeah, give Deekin the clues again. This one&apos;s tough!&quot;</string>
<string name="109019">&quot;Well done, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109020">&quot;Yay! Does Deekin get to play again?&quot;</string>
<string name="109021">&quot;You show cowardice to kick the weak, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109022">&quot;Surface-dwellers and their sentimentality. If we drow want pets, we harvest them from the slave pens.&quot;</string>
<string name="109023">&quot;This is fun, boss. Deekin thinks we should come to the Hells more often!&quot;</string>
<string name="109024">&quot;Ooo, it plays charades, boss! How many syllables? Deekin used to play this all the time at clan gatherings!&quot;</string>
<string name="109025">&quot;Each image represents a syllable of a larger word. Beyond that, I can&apos;t say I&apos;m sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="109026">&quot;Wow. Big wall, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="109027">&quot;I have a funny feeling about this, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I don&apos;t think I like it...&quot;</string>
<string name="109028">&quot;Eeek! It&apos;s an elf-girl, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="109029">&quot;What the...&quot;</string>
<string name="109030">&quot;It&apos;s something about that cave.&quot;</string>
<string name="109031">&quot;I don&apos;t get it either, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Each image is supposed to form part of a larger word, I believe. Is there some other word for a water-snake?&quot;</string>

<string name="109038">&quot;You&apos;re asking this thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="109039">&quot;What are you looking at, berk?&quot;</string>
<string name="109040">&quot;If you see Arden Swift, punch him in the bloody lip for me...&quot;</string>
<string name="109041">The githzerai glares at you, bored and sullen.</string>
<string name="109042">&quot;Leave me be, I&apos;m a long way from home...&quot;</string>
<string name="109043">&quot;Bloody sensei and her Sleeping Man...&quot;</string>
<string name="109044">&quot;I hear we be done with this wretched place. The Gates are open and what few of us are left intend to make the trek back home to Limbo...&quot;</string>
<string name="109045">1-LINER GITHZERAI PILGRIM, BOTH GENDERS. MULTIPLES PLACED BUT THEY&apos;RE FOUND PRIMARILY AROUND THE TAVERN AND TEMPLE (BUT NOT INSIDE THE TEMPLE).</string>
<string name="109046">&quot;It&apos;s the truth, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We had best start owning up to it...&quot;</string>
<string name="109047">&quot;Yes, this sounds interesting...&quot;</string>
<string name="109048">&quot;Nonsense, boss! Mage-fire always works!&quot;</string>
<string name="109049">&quot;Velox Berries. Mind her words well, &lt;FirstName&gt;, as we won&apos;t survive long without them.&quot;</string>
<string name="109050">&quot;We need to get in to see him, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I vote we just kill the sensei and be done with it. It will be quick and painless, you have my word.&quot;</string>
<string name="109051">&quot;The Gates are open. I want to take some Velox Berries back home to Limbo with me to see if they&apos;ll grow in the monastery garden...&quot;</string>
<string name="109052">&quot;Dumb question, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109053">&quot;I think I understand, now. The sensei is to them what the Seer was to us, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109054">&quot;Ooh, story time! Do you mind if Deekin writes this down? Go on. Why you come all this way?&quot;</string>
<string name="109055">&quot;Faith is a private thing, &lt;FirstName&gt;. To peddle its sacred elements like a merchant&apos;s wares or parade them before all and sundry is to take away from their beauty and their power...&quot;</string>
<string name="109056">&quot;Leave it be, &lt;FirstName&gt;. She guards her secrets jealously, that is all.&quot;</string>
<string name="109057">&quot;The gods curse the foolish.&quot;</string>
<string name="109058">&quot;Another of the outer planes. My battalion never fought there but some of my fellows did before their transfer. Most didn&apos;t take well to the place. Limbo&apos;s a hard place to fight in.&quot;</string>
<string name="109059">&quot;So Arden&apos;s been wearing his welcome thin, then, has he? Hardly a surprise...&quot;</string>
<string name="109060">&quot;A half-fiend, like me... Devil&apos;s blood or demon&apos;s, though, that&apos;s the question.&quot;</string>
<string name="109061">&quot;Arden? The juggler?&quot;</string>
<string name="109062">&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;</string>
<string name="109063">&quot;Not at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="109064">&quot;I hear we be done with this wretched place. The Gates are open and what few of us are left intend to make the trek back home to Limbo...&quot;</string>
<string name="109065">&quot;You have 10,000 gold, boss? Deekin thinks he should get a bit of a raise...&quot;</string>
<string name="109066">&quot;You&apos;re throwing pennies down a well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. He&apos;s nothing but a scoundrel, leave it be.&quot;</string>
<string name="109067">&quot;Be careful, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Gold may be plentiful now but we may still have need of it later.&quot;</string>
<string name="109068">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;! How much money do you intend to give this fool?&quot;</string>
<string name="109069">&quot;Ooh, think of what Deekin could do with that! That sound perfect for kobold music!&quot;</string>
<string name="109070">&quot;I wish he&apos;d wash them more often...&quot;</string>
<string name="109071">&quot;Ooh, think of what Deekin could do with that! That sound perfect for kobold music!&quot;</string>
<string name="109072">&quot;I wish he&apos;d wash them more often...&quot;</string>
<string name="109073">&quot;A card trick?&quot;</string>
<string name="109074">&quot;I don&apos;t trust him, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I say we slice his gullet and take what we want for free...&quot;</string>
<string name="109075">&quot;There&apos;s always a catch, &lt;FirstName&gt;. At least with old Arden, here...&quot;</string>
<string name="109076">&quot;Ooh, think of what Deekin could do with that! That sound perfect for kobold music!&quot;</string>
<string name="109077">&quot;I wish he&apos;d wash them more often...&quot;</string>
<string name="109078">&quot;He&apos;s a tiefling, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Like me.&quot;</string>
<string name="109079">&quot;Not a bad idea, if you ask me...&quot;</string>
<string name="109080">&quot;I wouldn&apos;t put it past him...&quot;</string>
<string name="109081">&quot;Hey, that&apos;s Deekin&apos;s job, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="109082">&quot;You send the man to his doom?&quot;</string>
<string name="109083">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109084">&quot;This ought to be short...&quot;</string>
<string name="109085">&quot;A fitting punishment.&quot;</string>
<string name="109086">&quot;Are you sure, &lt;FirstName&gt;? That sounds like a sure way to lose, if you ask me...&quot;</string>
<string name="109087">&quot;Grab your earnings and let&apos;s get out of here. This place has a bad feeling about it and a worse odor.&quot;</string>
<string name="109088">&quot;Tell me a little more about this trumpet.&quot;</string>
<string name="109089">&quot;Be careful. Throughout the planes, crystals are known to have other purposes as well, some sinister and others benign. There may be more to this amulet than first appears...&quot;</string>
<string name="109090">&quot;Not entirely peaceful, truth be told. When they choose to fight, they are savage warriors. It is just as well that they haven&apos;t chosen a side in the Blood War.&quot;</string>
<string name="109091">&quot;Not entirely peaceful, truth be told. When they choose to fight, they are savage warriors. It is just as well that they haven&apos;t chosen a side in the Blood War.&quot;</string>
<string name="109092">&quot;You see what I mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="109093">&quot;May I introduce to you the sensei. As for you, I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ll need no introductions...&quot;</string>
<string name="109094">&quot;We wait, we linger, the same as always. My fellow Pilgrims have all but abandoned the faith, dreaming only of home, of what was rather than of what may yet be...&quot;</string>
<string name="109095">&quot;The prison...&quot;</string>
<string name="109096">&quot;The prison...&quot;</string>
<string name="109097">&quot;The prison...&quot;</string>
<string name="109098">&quot;She means the white lady&apos;s prison, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="109099">&quot;Angels are angels, Sensei: well-intentioned but with their own frailties. It is with the gods that true faith must be rooted.&quot;</string>
<string name="109100">&quot;&lt;He/She&gt; is, I assure you...&quot;</string>
<string name="109101">&quot;I don&apos;t quite know how to feel about these lies, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I will play the part. He may make an interesting plaything...&quot;</string>
<string name="109102">&quot;To the contrary. The honor is all mine...&quot;</string>
<string name="109103">&quot;An interesting twist, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Very well, I shall play the part of an angel&apos;s lover. This could be a most amusing sport...&quot;</string>
<string name="109104">&quot;No, do not bring me into this, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I want no part of this untruth.&quot;</string>
<string name="109105">&quot;Be careful with your lies, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your words may yet betray you...&quot;</string>
<string name="109106">&quot;That not right... Why you lie to her, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109107">&quot;I pray you believe that, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109108">&quot;You ask much, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109109">&quot;Skewer her with her own beliefs, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109110">&quot;Bring her to the light of Tyr, &lt;Brother/Sister&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109111">&quot;Ready your blades. He doesn&apos;t look happy...&quot;</string>
<string name="109112">&quot;You cannot play god, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109113">&quot;Well, that went swimmingly...&quot;</string>
<string name="109114">&quot;You cannot play god, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109115">&quot;Well done, well done... Did you catch the look of betrayal in her eyes?&quot;</string>
<string name="109116">&quot;Ready your blades. He doesn&apos;t look happy...&quot;</string>
<string name="109117">&quot;I cannot... I&apos;m sorry, my life lay in worshipping you, in knowing your dreams. I&apos;m not ready for this... I&apos;m sorry...&quot;</string>
<string name="109118">&quot;No, gods, no! Why have you abandoned me!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109119">You spy a tear in the sensei&apos;s eye as you approach. &quot;He is gone,&quot; she whispers to herself. &quot;What will I do without him, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I have built everything, my entire life, around him... I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m... I&apos;m not myself right now...&quot;</string>
<string name="109120">You take a surreptitious glance at the tome. It appears to be some sort of journal detailing the Sleeping Man&apos;s dreams.</string>
<string name="109121">&quot;The Sleeping Man dreams more and more about his search, now, tossing and turning restlessly as I probe deeper into his thoughts. The search had led him to the vast wastes of Cania, well beyond the Gates...&quot;</string>
<string name="109122">&quot;I could almost feel the biting cold he suffered, on the verge of death amidst the blinding snows. He had a ring that turned the whole world dark and marked the path that compelled him ever forward...&quot;</string>
<string name="109123">&quot;Mephistopheles had left Guardians along his path, for what reason I know not why. Two of them he killed with frozen hands and he seemed to think that three others still remained...&quot;</string>
<string name="109124">&quot;His injuries were grievous. Every step was agony but every step brought him closer to his quest&apos;s completion. Only at the end of the dream did the nature of that quest become clear. He sought the Knower of Places...&quot;</string>
<string name="109125">&quot;Thus I learned the Fourth-Fold Mystery of the Sleeping Man. He has slept more peacefully and has not dreamed of his time in the wastelands ever since.&quot;</string>
<string name="109126">You notice the sensei returning from her meditations. Turning away from the tome, you feign a sudden interest in the nearby stonework.</string>
<string name="109127">&quot;Books! Move over, boss. I want to read, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="109128">&quot;Here she comes, boss! Whistle, it helps you look innocent...&quot;</string>
<string name="109129">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="109130">Valen coughs lightly, drawing your attention from the book.</string>
<string name="109131">&quot;Psst! Here she comes.&quot;</string>
<string name="109132">You feel the sensei&apos;s mind probing yours, judging your intent. If you wish to read this tome, you will have to do it when she is otherwise preoccupied.</string>
<string name="109133">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="109134">&lt;StartAction&gt;Read one of the entries.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="109135">&lt;StartAction&gt;Read further.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="109136">&lt;StartAction&gt;Read further.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="109137">&lt;StartAction&gt;Read further.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="109138">&lt;StartAction&gt;Read further.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="109139">&quot;Time is money, little one...&quot;</string>
<string name="109140">The dragon bends down low, sniffing you, its nostrils flared. &quot;What&apos;s the matter? Can&apos;t handle a little fire?&quot;</string>
<string name="109141">&quot;It will keep your blood boiling for as long as a three-berry fire. What&apos;s more, you can take it with you and you won&apos;t need to hunt for wood. A fine deal if you ask me...&quot;</string>
<string name="109142">&quot;Fuel for the fires of Baator, it&apos;s said. I planted a bush right outside the tavern entrance, if you&apos;d like to see, though I suspect the bastard Githzerai have already picked it clean.&quot;</string>
<string name="109143">He exhales, obscuring the counter in tendrils of foul-smelling shadow. It clears to reveal a small jar of milky purple liquid, stoppered for travel. The cork smells overwhelmingly of gin. </string>
<string name="109144">&quot;A dragon! See boss? Deekin told they can be friendly...&quot;</string>
<string name="109145">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="109146">&quot;Maybe later.&quot;</string>
<string name="109147">&quot;How strong is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="109148">&quot;Velox Berries? What are those?&quot;</string>
<string name="109149">&quot;I&apos;ll show you a vengeful spirit...&quot;</string>
<string name="109150">&quot;A likely story...&quot;</string>
<string name="109151">&quot;You wish...&quot;</string>
<string name="109152">&quot;Forgive my earnestness. When one waits for something as long as I have, the thought of it becomes all-consuming. All questions of my one true love aside, is there something I can assist you with?&quot;</string>
<string name="109153">&quot;The way there is dangerous, however. The distance is long and the winds are deadly. What is more, Mephistopheles left five guardians to bar the way. Two lie dead by my hand but three yet remain...&quot;</string>
<string name="109154">&quot;More planes and creatures in them, that is all. Don&apos;t try too hard to make sense of it all, you&apos;ll only hurt yourself...&quot;</string>
<string name="109155">&quot;Deekin should do that with his lute, boss! He don&apos;t want no devils playing it... They mights break a string!&quot;</string>
<string name="109156">&quot;That be the one. Now keep it safe and hurry, you must follow its path to the Knower of Places and ask her where you will find the Knower of Names. The glaciers may have shifted but the path is true.&quot; </string>
<string name="109157">&quot;The Ephemeral Plane? Never heard of it...&quot;</string>
<string name="109158">&quot;He make good point, boss....&quot;</string>
<string name="109159">&quot;He has a point, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109160">&quot;He has a point, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109161">&quot;He has a point, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109162">&quot;That be the one. Now keep it safe and hurry, you must follow its path to the Knower of Places and ask her where you will find the Knower of Names. The glaciers may have shifted but the path is true.&quot; </string>
<string name="109163">&quot;It is a cunning foe we face, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Devils revel in deceits, in knowing what they can get away with within the bounds of the laws that bind them.&quot;</string>
<string name="109164">&quot;What infernal ruckus was that? What gives cause for you to sound such a fell blast, mortal?&quot;</string>
<string name="109165">&quot;I bleed and by your blade! Justify your actions, mortal...&quot;</string>
<string name="109166">&quot;If this doesn&apos;t work, let me have a go at him...&quot;</string>
<string name="109167">&quot;That should do it...&quot;</string>
<string name="109168">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109169">&quot;Ummm... Maybe Deekin doesn&apos;t want that trumpet after all...&quot;</string>
<string name="109170">There is a Guardian, a beast left by Mephistopheles to bar the way and then blood, so much blood. There was another like it somewhere, already dead, and three others, more powerful, still at large...</string>
<string name="109171">&quot;He is strong, even after so long in sleep...&quot;</string>
<string name="109172">&quot;Why have you come here? Have you found my one true love?&quot;</string>
<string name="109173">&quot;I have dreamed the name of my one true love,&quot; he gleams. &quot;She is a deva called Lavoera. Now that I know her name, however, perhaps I no longer need to wait for her here.&quot;</string>
<string name="109174">&quot;I have dreamed the name of my one true love,&quot; he intones. &quot;It is the Knower of Names who Mephistopheles imprisoned far away in some secret place.&quot;</string>
<string name="109175">&quot;I have dreamed the name of my one true love,&quot; he intones. &quot;To think it is the Knower of Place who I met long ago... How is she? Do you know if she&apos;s well?&quot;</string>
<string name="109176">&quot;I have dreamed the name of my one true love,&quot; he gleams. &quot;She is a drow known as Nathyrra. Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109177">&quot;I have dreamed the name of my one true love,&quot; he gleams. &quot;She is a Githzerai known as the Sensei Dharvana. Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109178">&quot;I have dreamed the name of my one true love,&quot; he gleams. &quot;She is a spirit known as the Lady Aribeth. Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109179">His eyes stare deep into your soul. &quot;I dreamed of my one true love and it was you, &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot; He kisses you, pulling you into his celestial embrace. His mouth tastes like morning flowers. &quot;My one true love...&quot; </string>
<string name="109180">The sound rings off the chamber&apos;s thick stone walls but the Sleeping Man doesn&apos;t so much as stir. You realize that it will take more than just your shout to wake him.</string>
<string name="109181">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is Zyramethia the Young, the deva known as Lavoera.&quot;</string>
<string name="109182">&quot;The young and the old... The Heavens are a strange place, &lt;FirstName&gt;. May I never go there...&quot;</string>
<string name="109183">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is Phyreshi the Knower, the one known as the Knower of Names.&quot;</string>
<string name="109184">&quot;To think that she has loved both the arch-devil Mephistopheles and this archangel here, all within a single life...&quot;</string>
<string name="109185">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is Cordemylia the Knower, the one known as the Knower of Places.&quot;</string>
<string name="109186">&quot;Yeah, the butterfly girl where everythings went zoom, zoom, zoom, right boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109187">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is Qeyifalia the Skyseeker, the drow known as Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="109188">&quot;I... I don&apos;t know, &lt;FirstName&gt;. To love an angel? Of all people, why would it be me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109189">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is Fa&apos;arethia the Misguided, the githzerai known as the Sensei Dharvana.&quot;</string>
<string name="109190">&quot;Ummm, the one you killed, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109191">&quot;The one you killed?&quot;</string>
<string name="109192">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is Va&apos;ardalia the Twinsouled, the spirit known as Lady Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="109193">&quot;He is beautiful. See how gentle he appears in sleep? We must wake him, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109194">&quot;He had best have his uses... Let us wake this little toy of mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="109195">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is I, Ba&apos;elzaden the Cruel, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109196">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is I, Murdus the Wild, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109197">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is I, Kagita&apos;ar the Heartseeker, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109198">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is I, Nel&apos;zeben the Selfish, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109199">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is I, Neuthroxus the Fair, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109200">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is I, Ebela&apos;ar the Kind, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109201">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is I, Dretchen the Dark, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109202">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is I, Lysisius the Firm, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109203">You lean close and breathe into the Sleeping Man&apos;s ear. &quot;I bring you the name of your one true love. It is I, Donita&apos;ar the Blessed, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109204">&quot;You? What fiendish plan is this and why is it that villains must always confess to them before the hero is yet dead? On your guard!&quot;</string>
<string name="109205">&quot;What have we become, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Gird up thy loins for a sadder day than this I have never seen...&quot;</string>
<string name="109206">&quot;Thank me? But for what? I have been asleep for countless years and done little but wait. What could I have possibly done to deserve your thanks?&quot;</string>
<string name="109207">&quot;Certainly. Forgive me, but I have never felt comfortable with expressions of gratitude. So tell me, is there some other reason you are here?&quot;</string>
<string name="109208">&quot;Domination? What fiendish plan is this and why is it that villains must always confess to them before the hero is yet dead? On your guard!&quot;</string>
<string name="109209">&quot;The Reaper? I do not even know of whom you speak. But if I have helped you in some small way, then I suppose that you are welcome. Is there still more that I can do for you, perhaps?&quot;</string>
<string name="109210">&quot;I have done nothing of the sort. If you have learned something, you have done so by the power of your own ingenuity and the passion you hold for truth. Give credit to where it is due, my friend.&quot; </string>
<string name="109211">&quot;A religion? Celebrate goodness in all its forms, not just one. I am but an angel serving a greater glory. As worthy as you may find me, there is love and beauty out there that is higher than mine alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="109212">&quot;I am a planetar. If you wish to give thanks, give thanks to the gods for creating me as I am. Will that be all?&quot;</string>
<string name="109213">&quot;You have? Please, you must tell me everything! Start at the beginning. What is her name, that I might know her when she arrives?&quot;</string>
<string name="109214">&quot;No! What about my one true love? You say you know her name! Speak it, I pray. Please, I&apos;m begging you, do not leave me like this.&quot; The Sleeping Man breaks into tears as you walk away.</string>
<string name="109215">&quot;No! What about my one true love? You say you know her name! Speak it, I pray. Please, I&apos;m begging you. Why else would you be here?&quot;</string>
<string name="109216">&quot;Lavoera,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;A deva, you say? She will come then, in her time. Now that I know her name, however, perhaps I no longer need to wait for her here.&quot;</string>
<string name="109217">&quot;I will return to my home in search of her. If she is an angel already born, then they are likely to have her in their records... Thank you, my friend, you have done me a great service.&quot;</string>
<string name="109218">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I will not suffer your mockery! I know of whom you speak and she is not my one true love... The lie is painted plain upon your face! On your guard!&quot;</string>
<string name="109219">&quot;Phyreshi,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;But Mephistopheles imprisoned her far away in some secret place.&quot;</string>
<string name="109220">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109221">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Phyreshi,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;But Mephistopheles imprisoned her far away in some secret place.&quot;</string>
<string name="109222">&quot;I do not like your tone of voice nor the ease with which it speaks my name. What is it that you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109223">&quot;Yes, let us speak no more of my True Name. Tell me what you know of Phyreshi, the Knower of Names, whom Mephistopheles imprisoned.&quot;</string>
<string name="109224">&quot;Damn him! He plays with hearts that are not his own and lays ruin to their lives. If you should see him, give him my most painful regards. For now I must go clean up his mess and claim my love... You have my thanks.&quot;</string>
<string name="109225">&quot;Yes, at once! I will scour the Wastes of Cania, then, and not rest until she is found! If only I would have known this sooner, I would not have wasted so much time in sleep.&quot;</string>
<string name="109226">&quot;You have given me a blessing greater than the Heavens themselves, my friend! Forgive me my departure, but there is much I must prepare if her arrival is imminent... Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="109227">&quot;What deception are you plotting now, &lt;FirstName&gt;...?&quot;</string>
<string name="109228">&quot;Yes, we&apos;ll let someone else be the guinea pig, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Let&apos;s see if I&apos;d actually want to claim this male or not.&quot;</string>
<string name="109229">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;! I am his one true love, not the Knower of Names! Why would you ever say such a thing!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109230">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s toy with this man awhile. I&apos;m not sure if I actually like him yet...&quot;</string>
<string name="109231">&quot;Yeah, the butterfly girl where everythings went zoom, zoom, zoom, right boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109232">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I will not suffer your mockery! I know of whom you speak and she is not my one true love... The lie is painted plain upon your face! On your guard!&quot;</string>
<string name="109233">&quot;Cordemylia,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;To think it would end up being someone I already know... How is she? Is she well?&quot;</string>
<string name="109234">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109235">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Cordemylia,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;To think it would end up being someone I already know... How is she? Is she well?&quot;</string>
<string name="109236">&quot;I do not like your tone of voice nor the ease with which it speaks my name. What is it that you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109237">&quot;Yes, let us speak no more of my True Name. Tell me of Cordemylia, the Knower of Places, my one true love... Tell me she is well.&quot;</string>
<string name="109238">&quot;And she will laugh to know my folly. I am a fool to not have seen it sooner but time, at least, has humbled me.&quot;</string>
<string name="109239">&quot;She has countless others. Have no fear, I shall find her. This long sleep, at least, has returned me to my former health.&quot;</string>
<string name="109240">&quot;No! Oh, I have done her great injury with my foolishness. I should have recognized my love when she was there before me.&quot;</string>
<string name="109241">&quot;Why would she have lied to me, then? She was there before my very eyes, yet she told me my true love would meet me here, by the Gates of Cania! And to think I didn&apos;t recognize her as my love...&quot;</string>
<string name="109242">&quot;I must go to her at once and make my apologies for so many wasted years. If it was a test, I fear I failed it... Farewell, my friend, you have done me a great service.&quot;</string>
<string name="109243">&quot;Yeah, the butterfly girl where everythings went zoom, zoom, zoom, right boss? Wait a minute, that&apos;s not right...&quot;</string>
<string name="109244">&quot;Yes, we&apos;ll let someone else be the guinea pig, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Let&apos;s see if I&apos;d actually want to claim this male or not.&quot;</string>
<string name="109245">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;! I am his one true love, not the Knower of Places! Why would you even think such a thing!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109246">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s toy with this man awhile. I&apos;m not sure if I actually like him yet...&quot;</string>
<string name="109247">&quot;I... I don&apos;t know, &lt;FirstName&gt;. To love an angel? Of all people, why would it be me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109248">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I will not suffer your mockery! This drow you speak of is not my one true love... The lie is painted plain upon your face! On your guard!&quot;</string>
<string name="109249">&quot;Nathyrra,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109250">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109251">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Nathyrra,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109252">&quot;Go in peace and happiness. There is love yet in the world and at last I know her name.&quot;</string>
<string name="109253">&quot;I do not like your tone of voice nor the ease with which it speaks my name. What is it that you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109254">&quot;Yes, let us speak no more of my True Name. What do you know of Nathyrra, my one true love?&quot;</string>
<string name="109255">&quot;And that is all I ask. You have my thousand thanks for giving me her name after all these many years.&quot;</string>
<string name="109256">&quot;But if I know the name of my one true love, it must mean that she draws near. I have slept long enough and now must prepare for her coming. Thank you my friend, and pray excuse my absence.&quot;</string>
<string name="109257">&quot;Nathyrra... My one true love... Long have I waited for you. Long have I dreamed that this day would come.&quot;</string>
<string name="109258">Nathyrra slaps him across the face, her nails drawing blood. A look of shock crosses his face, the mark of her hand still white upon it. &quot;I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry, Nathyrra. What have I done to displease you?&quot;</string>
<string name="109259">&quot;Who says that I&apos;m displeased?&quot; she whispers, drawing closer to him. She takes his mouth in hers, her teeth biting down on his lower lip. Confused, he pushes her away and she allows him. &quot;I have to go,&quot; she says.</string>
<string name="109260">&quot;But you&apos;ve only just arrived... I don&apos;t understand. What is it that takes you from me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109261">&quot;That&apos;s none of your business, Sleeping Man...&quot;</string>
<string name="109262">&quot;Will you be returning? Where shall I find you?&quot;</string>
<string name="109263">&quot;I&apos;m not coming back... You&apos;d best say your goodbyes now.&quot;</string>
<string name="109264">&quot;I have waited long for this and I would wait as long again to see you twice... Oh love, you&apos;ve left my fate empty but my heart full to overflowing. Please, I beg of you, come back to me someday!&quot;</string>
<string name="109265">&quot;I -- I must leave this place, leave the scent of you. I have to go or be driven mad by your presence here! Farewell, my love. I do not think I shall ever sleep again!&quot;</string>
<string name="109266">&quot;What do you say, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I think I&apos;ll keep him...&quot;</string>
<string name="109267">&quot;Is a woman not allowed at least some degree of mystery, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="109268">&quot;I have traveled the multiverse and in my travels learned that not all devils are evil and not all angels good. All I know is that the gods would not pair us together without reason.&quot;</string>
<string name="109269">&quot;But if I know the name of my one true love, it must mean that she draws near. I have slept long enough and now must prepare for her coming. Thank you my friend, and pray excuse my absence.&quot;</string>
<string name="109270">&quot;Wait! Your one true love is already here... I am she, Nathyrra. A drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="109271">&quot;And *some* drow have left that history behind them, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109272">&quot;I... I don&apos;t know, &lt;FirstName&gt;... What if he finds out?&quot;</string>
<string name="109273">&quot;I am his one true love, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Why would you tell him that it&apos;s her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109274">&quot;What!? He&apos;s mine! How dare you give him to her!&quot;</string>
<string name="109275">&quot;Mind your own business, ghost!&quot;</string>
<string name="109276">&quot;Ummm, the one you killed, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109277">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I will not suffer your mockery! This sensei you speak of is not my one true love... The lie is painted plain upon your face! On your guard!&quot;</string>
<string name="109278">&quot;Dharvana,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109279">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109280">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Dharvana,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109281">&quot;Go in peace and happiness. There is love yet in the world and at last I know her name.&quot;</string>
<string name="109282">&quot;I do not like your tone of voice nor the ease with which it speaks my name. What is it that you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109283">&quot;Yes, let us speak no more of my True Name. What do you know of Dharvana, my one true love?&quot;</string>
<string name="109284">&quot;And that is all I ask. You have my thousand thanks for giving me her name after all these many years.&quot;</string>
<string name="109285">&quot;But if I know the name of my one true love, it must mean that she draws near. I have slept long enough and now must prepare for her coming. Thank you my friend, and pray excuse my absence.&quot;</string>
<string name="109286">&quot;Then I must find her. She came, she found me here by the Gates of Cania and, in my folly, I have let her slip through my fingers. There is no time to waste. Thank you for all your help.&quot;</string>
<string name="109287">&quot;My... My Sleeping Man...&quot;</string>
<string name="109288">&quot;My one true love...&quot;</string>
<string name="109289">&quot;I feel like I&apos;ve known you for all my life but... but I never knew this...&quot;</string>
<string name="109290">&quot;Hush, my love. Nor did I... But if you are willing, I would like to take you home with me to Elysium. We could be happy there...&quot;</string>
<string name="109291">&quot;I... I would love to! There is nothing I would want more but... But my flock, my Pilgrims, they... They need me.&quot;</string>
<string name="109292">&quot;The flock will find its way back to the fold, my love. They have their own lives to live. You must live yours...&quot;</string>
<string name="109293">&quot;I cannot... I&apos;m sorry, my life lay in worshipping you, in knowing your dreams. I&apos;m not ready for this... I&apos;m sorry...&quot;</string>
<string name="109294">&quot;No, gods, no! Why have you abandoned me!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109295">&quot;You killed her, didn&apos;t you? She was coming to meet me, here by the Gates of Cania! My one true love... An eye for an eye, then! I shall make you pay, murderer!&quot;</string>
<string name="109296">&quot;Now why would she do that? It is her love I seek, not her worship... Is she still here? I would like to speak with her if I may...&quot;</string>
<string name="109297">&quot;Yes, we&apos;ll let someone else be the guinea pig, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Let&apos;s see if I&apos;d actually want to claim this male or not.&quot;</string>
<string name="109298">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;! I am his one true love, not the sensei! Why would you say such a thing!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109299">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s toy with this man awhile. I&apos;m not sure if I actually like him yet...&quot;</string>
<string name="109300">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I will not suffer your mockery! This Aribeth you speak of is not my one true love... The lie is painted plain upon your face! On your guard!&quot;</string>
<string name="109301">&quot;Aribeth,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;Do you know her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109302">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109303">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Aribeth,&quot; he says, turning the name upon his tongue. &quot;Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109304">&quot;Go in peace and happiness. There is love yet in the world and at last I know her name.&quot;</string>
<string name="109305">&quot;I do not like your tone of voice nor the ease with which it speaks my name. What is it that you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109306">&quot;Yes, let us speak no more of my True Name. What do you know of Aribeth, my one true love?&quot;</string>
<string name="109307">&quot;And that is all I ask. You have my thousand thanks for giving me her name after all these many years.&quot;</string>
<string name="109308">&quot;Dead? No, it cannot be! She must have come here while I slept too deeply to feel her presence and know her love! Oh, I am a wretched fool! I have squandered the thing I hold most dear in life!&quot;</string>
<string name="109309">&quot;My Lady Aribeth, my one true love... Long have I waited for you. Long have I dreamed that this day would come.&quot;</string>
<string name="109310">&quot;Well put your dreams to rest, Sleeping Man, for I have fulfilled them. The only pity is that you have fallen so far short of mine... Go, wash yourself. You stink of devil&apos;s hide.&quot; </string>
<string name="109311">&quot;Devil&apos;s hide? My love, I have traveled countless leagues to find you and have slept for millennia in the depths of the Nine Hells waiting for you to arrive! If a bath is all you ask of me I will do it but...&quot;</string>
<string name="109312">&quot;Good. Bathe yourself at once and then we can talk.&quot;</string>
<string name="109313">&quot;You don&apos;t understand. You won&apos;t find a bath in all of Cania! I doubt there are even any in all the Hells of Baator!&quot;</string>
<string name="109314">&quot;I&apos;m counting... One... Two...&quot;</string>
<string name="109315">&quot;Fine, fine, I&apos;ll do it! I&apos;ll figure something out! But where will I meet you once I have?&quot;</string>
<string name="109316">&quot;I will meet you in paradise, where you belong.&quot;</string>
<string name="109317">&quot;My place? But I haven&apos;t been back to Elysium for eons! It&apos;s probably a horrible mess... No, don&apos;t worry! I&apos;ll bathe and then clean -- no, clean and then bathe! It doesn&apos;t matter, I&apos;ll see you there!&quot;</string>
<string name="109318">&quot;There, that should keep the poor fool busy for a while. Come, let us find our way back to Waterdeep and deal with Mephistopheles in the same way.&quot;</string>
<string name="109319">&quot;I hate to think what she might have to say about me, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109320">&quot;I have had a long journey getting here.&quot;</string>
<string name="109321">&quot;Would you make one last journey yet for me? I have a home in Elysium&apos;s blessed fields. I would like to take you there, that we might live out the remainder of our lives amidst its beauty.&quot;</string>
<string name="109322">&quot;There is nothing I would want more, my love, but I have duties I must tend to first. Mephistopheles lays siege to my homeworld, Toril, and we must first make the journey there to free it from his grasp.&quot;</string>
<string name="109323">&quot;Mephistopheles still rules the Eighth, then, does he? If you would risk your life to face him, my love, then I shall do the same. Let us put his evil to rest.&quot;</string>
<string name="109324">&quot;You would join us in this? Thank you, my love, and I pray we both survive the battle. To make my home with you in Elysium would be a dream come true.&quot;</string>
<string name="109325">&quot;My love goes with you, Aribeth. I will find you there.&quot;</string>
<string name="109326">&quot;The Lost? No, it cannot be! I was to meet *her* at these Gates, not merely the diffusion of her essence! Damn the Knower of Places and her deceits!&quot;</string>
<string name="109327">&quot;If my one true love is among the Lost, there is only one way that I can find her. Forgive me, friend, I have no time to tarry here.&quot;</string>
<string name="109328">&quot;Perhaps. But I believe that a spark of good lies even in the darkest of hearts. Perhaps she is to be redeemed. The gods would not pair us together without reason.&quot;</string>
<string name="109329">&quot;But if I know the name of my one true love, it must mean that she draws near. I have slept long enough and now must prepare for her coming. Thank you my friend, and pray excuse my absence.&quot;</string>
<string name="109330">&quot;Wait! If it is the Lady Aribeth you seek, she will not come to you for she is not your one true love... You heart is destined for another.&quot;</string>
<string name="109331">&quot;Thank you, gentle woman. Though I do not understand how your words can be true, I can sense that they are. Mine is a quest of endless paradoxes, so I shall take your advice to heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="109332">&quot;Wait! Your one true love is already here... I am she, the Lady Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="109333">&quot;He assumes it is a match made in the Heavens, not the Hells...&quot;</string>
<string name="109334">&quot;It is more than merely said, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109335">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109336">&quot;I am not his one true love, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Why would you even imply such a thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="109337">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s toy with this man awhile, &lt;FirstName&gt;. He may have his uses yet...&quot;</string>
<string name="109338">&quot;Why does she get this male? I am his one true love!&quot;</string>
<string name="109339">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I will not suffer your mockery! You are not my one true love... The lie is painted plain upon your face! On your guard!&quot;</string>
<string name="109340">His eyes grow wide, his mouth transforms into the warmest smile. He pulls you into his celestial embrace, showering you with kisses. &quot;My one true love,&quot; he whispers.</string>
<string name="109341">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109342">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; His eyes grow wide, his mouth transforms into the warmest smile. He pulls you into his celestial embrace, showering you with kisses. &quot;My one true love,&quot; he whispers.</string>
<string name="109343">&quot;Yes, we&apos;ll let you be the guinea pig, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Let&apos;s see if I&apos;d actually want to claim this male or not.&quot;</string>
<string name="109344">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;! I am his one true love, not you! Why would you do such a thing!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109345">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s toy with this man awhile and see if I&apos;d actually like him...&quot;</string>
<string name="109346">&quot;So it has come to this, has it? You would command me by my True Name? Go ahead, I am ready for it. What is it that you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109347">The Sleeping Man is careful to show no emotion in his pale green face. You have called him by his True Name and may have lost his trust in doing so.</string>
<string name="109348">&quot;Why? You have done me no ill and I harbor no ill will toward you. What is more, should I prove victorious, your blood is on my hands. Should I fail, I will never come to fully know my one true love.&quot;</string>
<string name="109349">&quot;This is madness! I pray you are well-defended for, by your command, this battle will not stop before one or both of us are dead...&quot;</string>
<string name="109350">&quot;But... But I haven&apos;t yet made my decision, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You&apos;ll kill him! What if there is no one else for me in all the world!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109351">&quot;Yes, kill him, &lt;FirstName&gt;. How dare he presume to love me!&quot;</string>
<string name="109352">&quot;Nooo! You&apos;ll kill him, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109353">&quot;My work is not yet done here but you leave me little choice. May the Seven Heavens show mercy on your soul.&quot;</string>
<string name="109354">&quot;You are a monster who knows not what &lt;he/she&gt; does... My quest is all I have, all I am. Take it away and I am nothing... I must obey your command but may the Seven Heavens of Celestia judge your soul...&quot;</string>
<string name="109355">With a cry of anguish, the Sleeping Man&apos;s eyes roll back in his head. Gasping, he stumbles to the ground. His life fades from him and he is dead, never to truly know his one true love.</string>
<string name="109356">&quot;There is more to life than love alone. What of the battle and the blade? Woe to those who forget them...&quot;</string>
<string name="109357">&quot;But... But I haven&apos;t yet made my decision, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You&apos;re killing him! What if there is no one else for me in all the world!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109358">&quot;Yes, that will teach him, &lt;FirstName&gt;. How dare he presume to love me!&quot;</string>
<string name="109359">&quot;Nooo! You&apos;re killing him, &lt;FirstName&gt;! My love, my one true love... My sleeping man...&quot;</string>
<string name="109360">&quot;Forgive my departure but it is vital that I find her. Now that I have a name to go by, perhaps I do not have to wait here for her arrival. I will spare her a journey into the Hells if I am able.&quot;</string>
<string name="109361">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Aye, she was quick for sure. Assassins of the Blood War are a constant threat. But I have just woken from a dream wherein I learned the name of my one true love...&quot;</string>
<string name="109362">&quot;A woman of shadows? There is a race of elves known as the drow who are just as you describe. In fact, I have just woken from a dream wherein I learned my one true love was one of them...&quot;</string>
<string name="109363">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Aye, the Hells are full of such and they can take a thousand forms. But I have just woken from a dream wherein I learned the name of my one true love!&quot;</string>
<string name="109364">&quot;She-devil, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109365">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Aye, the Hells are full of such. Pay them not a second thought... But enough of this. I have just woken from a dream wherein I learned the name of my one true love.&quot;</string>
<string name="109366">&quot;A spirit? I have just woken from a dream wherein my one true love was just as such. What if it was her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109367">&quot;I&apos;ll show you a vengeful spirit...&quot;</string>
<string name="109368">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Your lies betray you, mortal! I am an angel, born of Mount Celestia, and untruth withers beneath my gaze! On your guard!&quot;</string>
<string name="109369">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Jealous or no, to just taste of love, even for a moment... Do you think my one true love will kill me? I have just woken from a dream wherein I learned her name.&quot;</string>
<string name="109370">&quot;A likely story...&quot;</string>
<string name="109371">&quot;You wish...&quot;</string>
<string name="109372">&quot;She was of the Githzerai! I have just woken from a dream wherein my one true love was as such. What if it was her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109373">&quot;You tell the truth, I see... What is more, you have woken me from a dream wherein I heard the name of my one true love.&quot; Ceslestial light swirls around him.</string>
<string name="109374">&quot;She was of the Githzerai! And a sensei? I have just woken from a dream wherein my one true love was just as such. What if it was her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109375">&quot;There is more to life than love alone. What of the battle and the blade? Woe to those who forget them...&quot;</string>
<string name="109376">&quot;But... But I haven&apos;t yet made my decision, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You&apos;re killing him! What if there is no one else for me in all the world!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109377">&quot;Nooo! You&apos;re killing him, &lt;FirstName&gt;! My love, my one true love... My sleeping man...&quot;</string>
<string name="109378">&quot;Yes, that will teach him, &lt;FirstName&gt;. How dare he presume to love me!&quot;</string>
<string name="109379">&quot;The young and the old... The Heavens are a strange place, &lt;FirstName&gt;. May I never go there...&quot;</string>
<string name="109380">&quot;To think that she has loved both the arch-devil Mephistopheles and this archangel here, all within a single life...&quot;</string>
<string name="109381">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109382">&quot;What deception are you plotting now, &lt;FirstName&gt;...?&quot;</string>
<string name="109383">&quot;Yes, we&apos;ll let someone else be the guinea pig, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Let&apos;s see if I&apos;d actually want to claim this male or not.&quot;</string>
<string name="109384">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;! I am his one true love, not the Knower of Names! Why would you ever say such a thing!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109385">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s toy with this man awhile. I&apos;m not sure if I actually like him yet...&quot;</string>
<string name="109386">&quot;Yeah, the butterfly girl where everythings went zoom, zoom, zoom, right boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109387">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109388">&quot;Yeah, the butterfly girl where everythings went zoom, zoom, zoom, right boss? Wait a minute, that&apos;s not right...&quot;</string>
<string name="109389">&quot;Yes, we&apos;ll let someone else be the guinea pig, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Let&apos;s see if I&apos;d actually want to claim this male or not.&quot;</string>
<string name="109390">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;! I am his one true love, not the Knower of Places! Why would you even think such a thing!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109391">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s toy with this man awhile. I&apos;m not sure if I actually like him yet...&quot;</string>
<string name="109392">&quot;I... I don&apos;t know, &lt;FirstName&gt;. To love an angel? Of all people, why would it be me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109393">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109394">&quot;I... I don&apos;t know, &lt;FirstName&gt;... What if he finds out?&quot;</string>
<string name="109395">&quot;I am his one true love, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Why would you tell him that it&apos;s her?&quot;</string>
<string name="109396">&quot;What!? He&apos;s mine! How dare you give him to her!&quot;</string>
<string name="109397">&quot;Mind your own business, ghost!&quot;</string>
<string name="109398">&quot;Ummm, the one you killed, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109399">&quot;The one you killed?&quot;</string>
<string name="109400">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109401">&quot;Yes, we&apos;ll let someone else be the guinea pig, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Let&apos;s see if I&apos;d actually want to claim this male or not.&quot;</string>
<string name="109402">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;! I am his one true love, not the sensei! Why would you say such a thing!?&quot;</string>
<string name="109403">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s toy with this man awhile. I&apos;m not sure if I actually like him yet...&quot;</string>
<string name="109404">&quot;He is beautiful. See how gentle he appears in sleep? We must wake him, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109405">&quot;He had best have his uses... Let us wake this little toy of mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="109406">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109407">&quot;I am not his one true love, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Why would you even imply such a thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="109408">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s toy with this man awhile, &lt;FirstName&gt;. He may have his uses yet...&quot;</string>
<string name="109409">&quot;Why does she get this male? I am his one true love!&quot;</string>
<string name="109410">&quot;Curse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109411">&quot;You are a maddened fool, &lt;FirstName&gt;, to throw such a man as him away... A maddened fool...&quot;</string>
<string name="109412">&quot;How cruel, how cruel... Drive the knife in deep and twist, my dear, and twist...&quot;</string>
<string name="109413">&quot;Teach him his place, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109414">&quot;Boss teases a lot. You gets used to it.&quot;</string>
<string name="109415">&quot;So you know how to handle a male after all, do you? You do the drow proud.&quot;</string>
<string name="109416">&quot;How very cold of you. Well done, my sister...&quot;</string>
<string name="109417">&quot;I hate to think what you might have to say about me, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109418">&quot;How very cruel, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You impress me...&quot;</string>
<string name="109419">&quot;Are you mad? I have seen an entire battalion of demons break and flee at a single planetar&apos;s appearance. We retreated as well, that we might watch the slaughter from a safe distance.&quot;</string>
<string name="109420">&quot;How very cruel, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You impress me...&quot;</string>
<string name="109421">&quot;&apos;Tis a shame, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Planetars are known as mighty warriors. I have seen an entire battalion of demons break and flee at one&apos;s appearance. We retreated as well, that we might watch the slaughter from a safe distance.&quot;</string>
<string name="109422">&quot;Yes, we&apos;ll let you be the guinea pig, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Let&apos;s see if I&apos;d actually want to claim this male or not.&quot;</string>

<string name="109425">&quot;I don&apos;t know. Look for yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="109426">&quot;I already have the ring of which you speak.&quot;</string>
<string name="109427">&quot;I already have the ring of which you speak.&quot;</string>
<string name="109428">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="109429">&quot;I am here to kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="109430">&quot;I am here to thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="109431">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="109432">&quot;You&apos;ve been an unwitting participant in my plans for domination!&quot;</string>
<string name="109433">&quot;You helped me find the Reaper&apos;s True Name.&quot;</string>
<string name="109434">&quot;You have taught me something about myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="109435">&quot;You have formed the basis of a whole religion.&quot;</string>
<string name="109436">&quot;You have been a force of good in the Hells&apos; own depths.&quot;</string>
<string name="109437">&quot;I have learned the name of your one true love.&quot;</string>
<string name="109438">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>

<string name="109446">&quot;Yes, she was his lover.&quot;</string>
<string name="109447">&quot;Then you had best go free her.&quot;</string>
<string name="109448">&quot;She promised to make the journey here but has yet to arrive.&quot;</string>
<string name="109449">&quot;I have freed her. If she loves you, she will find you here.&quot;</string>

<string name="109512">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="109513">&quot;Fight me.&quot;</string>
<string name="109514">&quot;Leave this place and never return.&quot;</string>
<string name="109515">&quot;Abandon the quest for your one true love...&quot;</string>
<string name="109516">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I have no idea. It was as if she came out of nowhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="109517">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;A she-devil, bent on my destruction.&quot;</string>
<string name="109518">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;A vengeful spirit, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="109519">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Just a jealous lover, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="109520">&quot;It was a woman of the Githzerai.&quot;</string>
<string name="109521">&quot;That was the sensei. She runs the temple here.&quot;</string>
<string name="109522">&quot;It is I, Murdus the Wild, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109523">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;It is I, Murdus the Wild, the one known as &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109524">&quot;Yeah, thanks for nothing!&quot;</string>
<string name="109525">&quot;You answer us with riddles? Make it plain, Knower!&quot;</string>
<string name="109526">&quot;I beseech you, tell us true. The fate of a world depends on it.&quot;</string>
<string name="109527">&quot;If you lie to us as you did the Sleeping Man, we will hunt you down, Knower...&quot;</string>
<string name="109528">&quot;She lied to him. She only told him half the truth!&quot;</string>
<string name="109529">&quot;But that&apos;s a &apos;Where&apos; question, boss! No fair, you cheat...&quot;</string>
<string name="109530">&quot;She should have known better than to put her trust in the Baatezu...&quot;</string>
<string name="109531">&quot;Perhaps not, but it&apos;s clear she loves him. She&apos;s half-mad for want of him.&quot;</string>
<string name="109532">&quot;Is she crazy, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109533">&quot;I fear she&apos;s lost her wits, &lt;FirstName&gt;... That&apos;s something beyond my capacity to heal.&quot;</string>
<string name="109534">&quot;Tell her what she wants to hear. If pretending to be the Sleeping Man gets us out of here, I say we do it.&quot;</string>
<string name="109535">&quot;She&apos;s beautiful...&quot;</string>
<string name="109536">&quot;A small price for our freedom, to be sure...&quot;</string>
<string name="109537">&quot;Such a name is worth every copper spent and more. You have done well, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109538">&quot;Damn! I should have known it wouldn&apos;t be that easy...&quot;</string>
<string name="109539">&quot;Me? I... I don&apos;t know. He&apos;s an angel and I&apos;m... I&apos;m drow.</string>
<string name="109540">&quot;That depends on how much faith you put in the gods, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109541">&quot;I... I suppose the gods do not lie, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Please, can we hurry back to him?&quot;</string>
<string name="109542">&quot;What!? Deekin&apos;s name worth twice thats, boss! Three times!&quot;</string>
<string name="109543">&quot;Do it, do it! And don&apos;t forget to tip, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="109544">&quot;Yeah, Deekin wants to know his, too! This is exciting, right boss? Like when grandma would paw through chicken entrails to tell Deekin&apos;s fortune...&quot;</string>
<string name="109545">&quot;Thank you... I would rather not have such knowledge weighing upon your heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="109546">&quot;Then it is done, my fate sealed once again...&quot;</string>
<string name="109547">&quot;I&apos;m... I&apos;m frightened, &lt;FirstName&gt;, for the first time since I was a child... Since I found the Seer, I&apos;ve thought my destiny to be my own. I am free. Free of the House rivalries, free of the Sisters, free of the Valsharess...&quot;</string>
<string name="109548">&quot;I cannot help but look upon this True Name of mine as a new slavery... Strange as it may seem, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I have come to love my life and now I find I would hate to give it up...&quot;</string>
<string name="109549">&quot;I hope it is more than price alone that sways you from such a course, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109550">&quot;To know someone&apos;s True Name is to take responsibility for their life and death, their history and destiny, their wrath and their resting place. You are a great warrior and have earned the right to demand my True Name.&quot;</string>
<string name="109551">&quot;Not now, not ever... Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109552">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109553">&quot;What? Do not play the fool, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Leave my True Name to the gods, for them to judge me by. If the world will know me at all, let it know me as Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, nothing more...&quot;</string>
<string name="109554">&quot;Such is the treachery of devils...&quot;</string>
<string name="109555">&quot;Everywhere there are rebels, it seems...&quot;</string>
<string name="109556">&quot;It&apos;s been a long time, that much is sure. Too long...&quot;</string>
<string name="109557">&quot;She called you that?&quot;</string>
<string name="109558">&quot;She called you that?&quot;</string>
<string name="109559">&quot;She called you that?&quot;</string>
<string name="109560">&quot;Wow! How do you write on a star, boss? They&apos;re so tiny...&quot;</string>
<string name="109561">&quot;I think the answer to that is obvious, &lt;FirstName&gt;. She is the one we seek.&quot;</string>
<string name="109562">&quot;Not right now, Knower.&quot;</string>
<string name="109563">&quot;Not right now, Knower.&quot;</string>
<string name="109564">&quot;Not right now, Knower.&quot;</string>
<string name="109565">&quot;Not right now, Knower.&quot;</string>
<string name="109566">&quot;Doom doom doom doom doooooooom....&quot;</string>
<string name="109567">&quot;Easier said than done, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109568">&quot;You&apos;re not alone, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We&apos;ll face him together. The drums of the Blood War keep their beat in my veins and I will fight him to the death.&quot;</string>
<string name="109569">&quot;For saving Waterdeep from the drow? If the city still stands and I&apos;m still alive to see it, you&apos;ll have earned that and more. Personally, though, my bets are on Mephistopheles...&quot;</string>
<string name="109570">&quot;Now&apos;s hardly the time to settle old accounts, &lt;FirstName&gt;! The city crumbles as we speak.&quot;</string>
<string name="109571">&quot;You would work for so little? I think it&apos;s time we set a new price for our labors...&quot;</string>
<string name="109572">&quot;Uh, boss? That was your fault. Deekin had nothing to do with it.&quot;</string>
<string name="109573">&quot;Where&apos;s the 100,000 gold you promised me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109574">&quot;Ummm... is you talkings to Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="109575">&quot;Is there any reason I shouldn&apos;t speak to you, little one? You have achieved power enough to surpass any simple dragon. You have achieved your potential as no other kobold has before you!&quot;</string>
<string name="109576">&quot;Deekin greater than Old Master? No, that not be right...&quot;</string>
<string name="109577">&quot;Of course it is right, little one. Come, join me. What has &lt;FirstName&gt; done but hold you back from your potential? I could make you a force that all dragons would bow down to in fear! All the world would know your name, Deekin, and fear it!&quot;</string>
<string name="109578">Deekin&apos;s eyes go wide as he thinks about the implications of Mephistopheles&apos; offer. &quot;But... &lt;FirstName&gt; is the boss! Deekin not...&quot; He turns to you, looking desperate and fearful. &quot;Boss! Deekin not able to makes decision like this! Helps Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="109579">Deekin looks at you, then Mephistopheles and then back several times. Finally he turns away from you. &quot;Then... then Deekin goes with big, red, devil?&quot;</string>
<string name="109580">&quot;Excellent. I think we&apos;re going to become very good friends, little one.&quot; Smiling, Mephistopheles turns to you.</string>
<string name="109581">Deekin&apos;s eyes go wide as he hears his True Name. &quot;Gosh, boss... that makes it so much easier. Deekin stay with you, then.&quot; Mephistopheles growls darkly and turns towards you.</string>
<string name="109582">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;See how &lt;he/she&gt; threatens you, little one? I would never do that. Come, join me and we shall be life-long friends.&quot;</string>
<string name="109583">&quot;Ohhhh, Deekin so confused! Big, red devil is making so much sense!&quot;</string>
<string name="109584">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Okay, boss! You not worries, Deekin not betrays you!&quot; Deekin turns on the archdevil and sticks his tongue out, giving him a raspberry. Mephistopheles rolls his eyes and turns to you, instead.</string>
<string name="109585">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;And we could be a team, too, little kobold. And I&apos;m bigger than your little boss is, aren&apos;t I?&quot;</string>
<string name="109586">&quot;Umm... that make weird sort of sense, somehow... We be team then?&quot;</string>
<string name="109587">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;That be right!&quot; Deekin turns and addresses the archdevil angrily. &quot;The boss and Deekin are a team! You not goings to break us up no matter what you says!&quot; Mephistopheles rolls his eyes and turns towards you, instead.</string>
<string name="109588">Deekin&apos;s eyes go wide as he thinks about the implications of Mephistopheles&apos; offer. Slowly, however, the kobold&apos;s eyes narrow... he stands up straight. &quot;No! You may be bigger than the boss, but... but... DEEKIN NOT LIKES YOU!!&quot;</string>
<string name="109589">A mixture of surprise and anger crosses Mephistopheles&apos; face. &quot;You dare defy me, reptile?!&quot;</string>
<string name="109590">&quot;That&apos;s right! Deekin defies you! Deekin stands by the boss... to the end!&quot;</string>
<string name="109591">The archdevil sneers and then dismisses Deekin completely. &quot;So be it. Die with &lt;him/her&gt; as well, if it pleases you.&quot;</string>
<string name="109592">&quot;We&apos;ve nothing to say to one another, devil,&quot; Valen snarls. &quot;You are baatezu and I am tanar&apos;ri. There can be nothing but death between us.&quot;</string>
<string name="109593">&quot;Oh?&quot; Mephistopheles smiles slowly. &quot;But you are mostly human. What if I was to tell you that I could relieve you of that demonic taint forever? I could free you from the Blood Wars, young man. What would that be worth, I wonder?&quot;</string>
<string name="109594">Valen glares at the archdevil, sweat beading on his forehead. &quot;Even... even if you could do this, what price would you demand?&quot;</string>
<string name="109595">&quot;To betray &lt;FirstName&gt;, obviously. Fight at my side. This is nothing new to you, after all... think of it as your last battle. Then you are free forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="109596">&quot;I... betray &lt;FirstName&gt;? But that would mean betray the Seer as well...&quot;</string>
<string name="109597">&quot;What have they done for you, Valen? Truly? I can give you an eternity of freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="109598">&quot;But... I love her...&quot;</string>
<string name="109599">&quot;You know better than she, young Valen. Where would such a love go? Nowhere. I, however, can give you an eternity of freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="109600">A struggle plays across Valen&apos;s brooding features. &quot;You... may be right. I... I do not know...&quot;</string>
<string name="109601">&quot;It is done,&quot; Valen says grimly. &quot;I stand with the archdevil, then.&quot; He closes his eyes. &quot;And may the Seer forgive me.&quot;</string>
<string name="109602">&quot;Excellent choice, my young friend...&quot; Mephistopheles&apos; grin is wide and horrible.</string>
<string name="109603">Valen&apos;s head snaps back and he growls. &quot;You... you use my True Name to force my obedience? So be it, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I stand by you. Whatever respect I had for you, however, is now gone.&quot;</string>
<string name="109604">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;That&apos;s your response, &lt;FirstName&gt;? To threaten me? Then perhaps I should feel the doubt I do. Perhaps I should go with Mephistopheles, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="109605">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Valen slowly grins and looks at Mephistopheles. &quot;To be quite honest, archdevil, I fear &lt;his/her&gt; wrath far more than your own. Your offer is refused.&quot;</string>
<string name="109606">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Slowly Valen nods. &quot;Whatever you could offer, devil... it would not be worth my shame at betraying this cause. I would rather see you destroyed.&quot;</string>
<string name="109607">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;It is true that you have made me love you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but love does not conquer all. You offer me only chains where Mephistopheles offers freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="109608">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Valen glares at you but slowly nods. &quot;So it is. Though I would gladly stand by you just to kill this woman, Mephistopheles... I cannot.&quot;</string>
<string name="109609">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Only I can offer you hope, Valen! Only I can offer you freedom! Do not be a fool!&quot;</string>
<string name="109610">Slowly Valen nods. &quot;You are right. I... I have to do this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="109611">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Valen nods. &quot;I won&apos;t, my love. Any promises a devil could make are nothing next to all you could offer me.&quot; He turns to Mephistopheles. &quot;Your offer is refused.&quot;</string>
<string name="109612">Valen smirks in the archdevil&apos;s direction. &quot;Your offer is not needed. &lt;FirstName&gt; has already freed me from that taint. Though, I admit, the desire to destroy you is still strong.&quot;</string>
<string name="109613">Mephistopheles sneers at Valen then ignores him utterly.</string>
<string name="109614">&quot;You are wrong. Eilistraee has accepted me for what I am. They... they don&apos;t care about what I&apos;ve done in my past. The Seer has given me absolution.&quot;</string>
<string name="109615">&quot;Has she, Nathyrra? Has &lt;FirstName&gt;? Then why do you still see your victims in your dreams? The Seer&apos;s people have not forgiven you, nor has this &lt;man/woman&gt; you follow now!&quot;</string>
<string name="109616">&quot;They still call you assassin behind your back. They&apos;re just using you. You could help the Seer against the Valsharess. That was why she tolerated you. That was why she pretended to welcome a killer into her flock.&quot;</string>
<string name="109617">&quot;But now that the enemy is gone, do you really believe the lambs will let a wolf like you dwell amongst them? Didn&apos;t you ever wonder why the Seer never took you to the surface with the others?&quot;</string>
<string name="109618">&quot;Deferred promises are little better than lies, Nathyrra. Eilistraee will never accept you, there is too much blood on your hands and too much death in your heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="109619">&quot;But I embrace that killer in you, Nathyrra... Set aside your guilt! Be true to yourself! You are a Red Sister. Join with me, Nathyrra. As a Red Sister, who would you rather serve? &lt;FullName&gt; or myself...?&quot;</string>
<string name="109620">&quot;I can&apos;t deny the truth any longer. The dreams, the guilt: it all began after I joined the Seer. I was trying to deny my true self, I was trying to be something I was not. I am a drow, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109621">&quot;I was raised to kill, to exploit the weakness of others, to crush those who stand against me in a never-ending quest for power! I will join you, Mephistopheles... and I will revel in it!&quot;</string>
<string name="109622">&quot;I will stand with you against Mephistopheles, I have no other choice. But I do not like having my destiny torn from my own hands. I will not easily forget nor forgive what you have done here!&quot;</string>
<string name="109623">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Never fear, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I won&apos;t let this devil&apos;s words twist my love for you. He offers me only hate and lies while you have shown me that there is so much more to the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="109624">&quot;I reject you, Mephistopheles, and all that you offer. Look elsewhere for the traitor you seek, because I take my stand with &lt;FullName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="109625">&quot;But I embrace that killer in you, Nathyrra... Set aside your guilt! Be true to yourself! You are a Red Sister. Join with me, Nathyrra. As a Red Sister, who would you rather serve? &lt;FullName&gt; or myself...?&quot;</string>
<string name="109626">Nathyrra ponders his words for a long moment, then glares at him, defiant. &quot;I have already set aside my guilt, thanks to &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am no Red Sister... and I am your servant least of all!&quot;</string>
<string name="109627">Mephistopheles sneers in derision and turns away from the drow.</string>
<string name="109628">&quot;&lt;He/She&gt; has done well, hasn&apos;t &lt;he/she&gt;... I tried to warn you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but you just wouldn&apos;t listen. Shall we kill &lt;him/her&gt; now, Mephistopheles? I&apos;ve rather been looking forward to it.&quot;</string>
<string name="109629">&quot;A double-cross? How interesting... I admit I hadn&apos;t thought of that. Nor, I suspect, did my dear friend Mephistopheles... Oh, don&apos;t look so surprised, Mephy! You said it yourself: I&apos;m a traitor. It&apos;s what I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="109630">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt;&quot;Oh, but I do, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I do. It was a bit of a complication for me initially but then I realized how perfect it was: What is more evil than betraying the ones you love most dearly?&quot;</string>
<string name="109631">&quot;That was then and this is now, Hell-fiend. &lt;FirstName&gt; has led me back to Tyr&apos;s blessing and it is Tyr whom I now serve. Even you, in all your might, dare not stand against his wrath.&quot;</string>
<string name="109632">&quot;Tyr, you say? Then I presume it is Tyr&apos;s spells you wield against me? Guess again, princess! They&apos;re my spells! Mine! I played &lt;FirstName&gt; as my puppet with the Valsharess and I did the same in Cania!&quot;</string>
<string name="109633">&quot;All this time, you thought you were traipsing through Cania in the name of Tyr? How quaint. Tyr abandoned you, Aribeth, and couldn&apos;t care less about you now!&quot;</string>
<string name="109634">&quot;No, it&apos;s not true! It... It can&apos;t be! I believed again. I could have sworn I still saw beauty in the world...&quot;</string>
<string name="109635">&quot;Blah, blah, blah. You&apos;ve done quite a number on her, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If I wasn&apos;t about to kill you, I might just congratulate you. You&apos;ve got her twisted around your little finger. So what&apos;s it gonna be, Princess: &lt;him/her&gt; or me?&quot;</string>
<string name="109636">&quot;No matter what I do, it seems I am only capable of bringing evil into the world... I will side with you, Mephistopheles. There is no other choice.&quot;</string>
<string name="109637">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You have brought me back from an icy grave, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are my rock, my touchstone, my love... You are right. If nothing else, I believe in you.&quot;</string>
<string name="109638">&quot;You can&apos;t even make your own decisions! You disgust me. Betray me, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="109639">&quot;Betray me if you will but I will miss you, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="109640">&quot;Ixthyria the Scalesinger, ignore Mephistopheles and remain with me!&quot;</string>
<string name="109641">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;ll wring your neck if you betray me, Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="109642">&quot;That&apos;s it, Deekin! You&apos;re in for it now!&quot;</string>
<string name="109643">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Don&apos;t listen to him, Deekin! We&apos;re a team, remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="109644">&quot;I never trusted you anyway. Betray me and die with Mephistopheles, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="109645">&quot;Oeskathine the Demonwrestler, I command you to stand at my side.&quot;</string>
<string name="109646">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Betray me and I&apos;ll kill you, Valen, I swear it!&quot;</string>
<string name="109647">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Don&apos;t listen to his lies, Valen! I need you at my side!&quot;</string>
<string name="109648">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Isn&apos;t your love for me stronger than that, Valen?&quot;</string>
<string name="109649">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I love you, Valen. Please don&apos;t listen to him.&quot;</string>
<string name="109650">&quot;No! I won&apos;t accept this! Don&apos;t do it!&quot;</string>
<string name="109651">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I love you, Nathyrra. You&apos;re not a Red Sister anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="109652">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;But I thought you loved me, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="109653">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I love you, Aribeth. That is not evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="109654">&quot;Better sport than rats, that be sure...&quot;</string>
<string name="109655">&quot;Keep &apos;em surrounded!&quot;</string>
<string name="109656">&quot;Har, this berk should be good eating.&quot;</string>
<string name="109657">&quot;Hmph. Wish *I* could grapple around this damn place.&quot;</string>
<string name="109658">&quot;Bloody mimic&apos;s trapped another berk. Let&apos;s get &apos;em!&quot;</string>
<string name="109659">As you near the churning lava of this tributary of the River Styx, you can feel the fingers of the Demonic Grappling Hand begin to twitch within your pack. There&apos;s a torch bracket on the opposite bank that it seems eager to get to...</string>
<string name="109660">&quot;You&apos;ll need to use Velox Berries. When it gets this cold, nothing else will ignite the wood.&quot;</string>
<string name="109661">The passage is blocked by a cascade of ice.</string>
<string name="109662">&quot;Gurk? None pass! Ungh! None PASS!!!!&quot;</string>
<string name="109663">&quot;You bear the ring, yes? I can smell it... The planetar fooled me once before, long ago... But not again, I say, not again. Mephistopheles would not want that, would he...&quot;</string>
<string name="109664">The mimic&apos;s smoldering remains fill the air with an acrid stench. The clawed hand it had been using to navigate its lair crawls out, dazed and crablike. Spying the dark sanctuary of your pack, it latches onto your chest, clambers over your shoulder, and scrambles in.</string>
<string name="109665">Though you had originally mistaken it as some kind of appendage of the mimic itself, you now realize that it&apos;s some sort of fiendish grappling device. Just as you start to feel some pity for the strange creature, you find yourself interrupted...</string>
<string name="109666">&quot;Serves the blasted box of wood right, if you ask me. You can&apos;t imagine how long it&apos;s had me trapped in this place with its infernal magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="109667">The devil looks at the stump of its wrist where its hand used to be. &quot;Bloody mimics... Well I&apos;m free now and, if I saw what I think I saw, I believe you&apos;ve got a little something of mine, don&apos;t you, berk...&quot;</string>
<string name="109668">The crystals that bar your way seem strangely insubstantial to you, as if they exist in only one plane and not the next. Perhaps the Sleeping Man&apos;s puzzle ring might be of use here...</string>
<string name="109669">&quot;Why you pick &apos;L&apos;, boss? That&apos;s not right at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="109670">&quot;Is there one that starts with &apos;P&apos;, boss? Deekin thinks we should start with &apos;P&apos;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109671">&quot;Do you still fashion a blade worthy of a Red Sister?&quot;</string>
<string name="109672">&quot;Well they definitely have one in you, Rizolvir. It&apos;s good to see you, even though I wish times could be better for us all.&quot;</string>
<string name="109673">&quot;The weapon you are currently wielding is a throwing weapon. I cannot upgrade those, sorry. However, I can upgrade ranged or melee weapons.&quot;</string>
<string name="109674">&quot;The weapon you are wielding already has many powerful enchantments. I can not risk to work on such a powerful item, would be too dangerous.&quot;</string>
<string name="109675">&quot;Any dragons, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109676">&quot;Definitely big enough to be dragons...&quot;</string>
<string name="109677">&quot;And here&apos;s where the big mean knight gravely wounded the friendly little dragon before getting eaten... We&apos;re getting closer, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="109678">&quot;Ooh! Fire-breath! Knights running away in their toasty roasty armor! Hurry up, boss, there&apos;s no time to lose!&quot;</string>
<string name="109679">&quot;See how scaly their skin was? And their wings? They were dragon babies, boss, fighting over who gets to eat the mean old knight&apos;s head!&quot;</string>
<string name="109680">&quot;Okay, so over here the dragon tried to make a deal with an evil sorcerer but the evil sorcerer betrayed him and got himself killed. The dragon didn&apos;t eat him, though, because sorcerers taste bad. Everybody knows that.&quot;</string>
<string name="109681">&quot;Oh wow! The mighty dragon slaughtered an entire army and turned everything to rubble and then flew away home! Don&apos;t worry, though, boss, he comes back in the sequel. There&apos;s always a sequel, right? Are you even listening to me, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109682">&quot;Eeeek! Don&apos;t die, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="109683">&quot;Are you mad?&quot;</string>
<string name="109684">&quot;Careful, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="109685">&quot;Can I see, too, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109686">&quot;What do you see?&quot;</string>
<string name="109687">&quot;Uh-oh. Are you sure you were supposed to do that, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="109688">&quot;Have you got the other one?&quot;</string>
<string name="109689">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="109690">&quot;Are you all right, &lt;FirstName&gt;? What happened there?&quot;</string>
<string name="109691">&quot;Wow! Do that again, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="109692">&quot;It&apos;s the sensei&apos;s crystal, isn&apos;t it... I knew there would be more to it than met the eye! Are you all right?&quot;</string>
<string name="109693">&quot;Hello, Mister Rat.&quot;</string>
<string name="109694">The leader of this fearsome group, a dwarven monk wearing robes that mark him as a member of the Order of the Long Death, watches you with cold, dead eyes as you approach.</string>
<string name="109695">&quot;So, &lt;FullName&gt;, it seems the Silent Lord has finally claimed you. It is unfortunate you have ended up here in the Hells, however... since we are planning to take over.&quot;</string>
<string name="109696">The dwarf nods. &quot;You know my reputation, &lt;FullName&gt;... just as I know yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="109697">&quot;My name is Grimgnaw. Once I traveled with the Hero of Neverwinter in a battle against Morag and the Old Ones, but that was long ago...</string>
<string name="109698">&quot;During my life I was a servant of Death, the Silent Lord. I knew the name and face of all those who delivered souls to my master... those like you, &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="109699">&quot;In all your adventures, how many have died at your hand? A hundred? A thousand? You have served the Silent Lord well, and you are well known among the Order of the Long Death.&quot;</string>
<string name="109700">&quot;Enough talk, Grimgnaw. &lt;FullName&gt; is a threat to us here. We must deal with &lt;him/her&gt; as we have dealt with the other spirits that opposed us!&quot;</string>
<string name="109701">&quot;Maugrim, you swore your allegiance to me when the power of the Old Ones abandoned you. Do not forget that I am in charge.&quot; His underling duly chastised, Grimgnaw turns his attention back to you.</string>
<string name="109702">Aribeth gasps in surprise. &quot;I recognize this spirit: Grimgnaw, a dwarf who helped save Neverwinter... and Maugrim! What are you doing here?&quot;</string>
<string name="109703">The cleric known as Maugrim gives a cruel laugh. &quot;Aribeth, our paths cross once again. But you will be relieved to know I no longer follow Morag and the Old Ones. Now I have loftier ambitions!&quot;</string>
<string name="109704">&quot;With Mephistopheles gone, there is a void that must be filled. This plane of Hell needs someone to rule. Those who swear allegiance to me will be rewarded... those who do not will be destroyed.&quot;</string>
<string name="109705">&quot;Then you will be destroyed.&quot;</string>
<string name="109706">The dwarf slowly shakes his head. &quot;No, &lt;FullName&gt;, you are too powerful. Your mere presence here is a threat. If I am to rule, I must destroy all who could one day depose me.&quot;</string>
<string name="109707">&quot;Only the strongest can rule in the Nine Hells. I am stronger than you, &lt;FullName&gt;, therefore I must rule. And you must be destroyed.&quot;</string>
<string name="109708">&quot;I know you. You&apos;re Grimgnaw, that dwarven monk from Neverwinter!&quot;</string>
<string name="109709">&quot;Who are you? How do you know who I am?&quot;</string>
<string name="109710">&quot;Time to die, dwarf!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Attack&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="109711">&quot;I won&apos;t bow before anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="109712">&quot;I will swear allegiance to you, Grimgnaw.&quot;</string>
<string name="109713">&quot;I think I would like to rule this Hell... You will swear allegiance to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="109714">&quot;I don&apos;t care what you do here, I&apos;m just looking for a way out.&quot;</string>

<string name="109795">&quot;Yes... yes great one!&quot;</string>
<string name="109796">Fake Nathyra for her tag</string>
<string name="109797">Balpheron</string>
<string name="109798">While most liches tend to withdraw from the world, Balpheron is more ambitious. His empty eye sockets blaze with the fire of conquest and a burning lust for power that cannot be cooled by the chill of his own undead state.</string>
<string name="109799">Commoner</string>
<string name="109800">This human is helpless, frightened and in dire need of rescuing.</string>
<string name="109801">Koth Uth-Kalin</string>
<string name="109802">The minotaur Koth Uth-Kallin once roamed the wilds around Neverwinter, leaving death and destruction in his wake. His reign of terror was ended by a young hero named Nasher Alagondar, who slew the beast to avenge his murdered wife and infant child.</string>
<string name="109803">Crimson </string>
<string name="109804">An infamous bounty hunter from the Dragon Coast, Crimson was renowned for her cruelty and her relentless pursuit of perfection. It was said she plucked out her own left eye after she failed to detect an enemy hiding in the shadows. </string>
<string name="109805">The drow are an evil subrace of elves, living deep underground in the dangerous Underdark.</string>
<string name="109806">Donan is a good man, a quiet man. He is also a bald man.</string>
<string name="109807">This halfling warrior appears... incomplete. Several good jokes come to mind, but he likely wouldn&apos;t appreciate them.</string>
<string name="109808">Grimgnaw</string>
<string name="109809">A monk of the Order of the Long Death, Grimgnaw was one of the followers of the Hero of Neverwinter. Little is known of his fate after he left the city, though it is safe to assume he continued the work of the Silent Lord, and delivered hundreds of innocent victims to an early grave.</string>
<string name="109810">An elderly man with a lopsided grin casually juggles balls of fire at a side table, occasionally earning the scowls of some of the more dour-faced patrons. Two horns protrude from his forehead, one slightly chipped.</string>
<string name="109811">Weary Quarry Worker</string>
<string name="109812">Weary Quarry Slave</string>
<string name="109813">Sullen Pilgrim</string>
<string name="109814">Although this creature has been mutated and twisted into an aberration covered in a black carapace and with brain matter exposed, it still exibits an almost dog-like quality. It whines and paces in place as if waiting for something or someone.</string>
<string name="109815">The Sleeping Man, Dead</string>
<string name="109816">A celestial being, his aura of power mingled with sadness and a the taint of the surrounding hells, the Sleeping Man stands almost motionless. You are uncertain whether he is in some kind of meditation or if he is truly asleep. There is a stillness around him which seems difficult to break.</string>
<string name="109817">Worried Spirit</string>
<string name="109818">Deekin, Dead</string>
<string name="109819">Nathyrra, Dead</string>
<string name="109820">Evil Aribeth</string>
<string name="109821">Good Aribeth</string>
<string name="109822">Dead Aribeth</string>
<string name="109823">Puzzler</string>
<string name="109824">This planar creature is clearly devilish, but has mannerisms which one would identify more with an excited bird. It twitches and blinks and moves skittishly, focusing on those nearby with nervousness and uncertainty. It would be difficult to ascribe any true intelligence to this half-witted being.</string>
<string name="109825">Azer Gem Miner</string>
<string name="109826">The gem miner eyes you hungrily.</string>
<string name="109827">Guardian of the Path</string>
<string name="109828">A black slaad waits for you in the shadows. Something about it leaves you sure that it is another of Mephistopheles&apos; Guardians of the Path. It must have tracked the Sleeping Man this far, then lost the trail somehow.</string>
<string name="109829">Victim</string>
<string name="109830">The Yawning Portal&apos;s cook is know for a temper as fiery as his ovens. (And his outfits)</string>
<string name="109831">The drow are an evil subrace of elves, living deep underground in the dangerous Underdark. This one in particular is marked with the insignia of House Maeviir.</string>
<string name="109832">This creature is a malevolent elemental formed from the very essence of the hellish rock around you. It is nearly mindless but thrives on its desire to destroy anything living it comes in contact with.</string>
<string name="109833">Scribe</string>
<string name="109834">This creature is a living extension of hellish lava and flame, sparked into consciousness by some unknown force. Not unlike an elemental, it is tainted with a malevolence that is inimical to the surrounding plane.</string>
<string name="109835">Gargamesh</string>
<string name="109836">The one-handed fiend, Gargamesh, bellows in anger.</string>
<string name="109837">This demon is huge and spider-like, possessing deadly mandibles and a poisonous stinger as well as the customary number of legs. It slavers with an almost mindless viciousness, ready to hunt its fellow fiends as well as whatever other prey crosses its path.</string>
<string name="109838">Ice Troll Shaman</string>
<string name="109839">Ice Troll Berserker</string>
<string name="109840">This shimmering creatures appears to have been formed from the hellish ice and frost of the surrounding planes, sparked into a malevolent consciousness by some unknown force.</string>
<string name="109841">This pale, unearthly creature radiates with an inner energy that seems to penetrate your skin and warm your insides. For all her power, however, this planar being seems to be very much immature, appearing as a teenage human girl.</string>
<string name="109842">Mephistopheles is one of the archdevils that rule the layers of Baator. In that plane, his power is supreme... and were he ever loosed upon the Prime Material Plane, the resulting death and chaos would be unimagineable.</string>
<string name="109843">Mephistopheles, Small</string>
<string name="109844">If you hadn&apos;t seen it move with your own eyes, you would believe this creature to be an ordinary treasure chest. Seemingly content with eating gems and rats in its home here, it doesn&apos;t seem overly interested in you.</string>
<string name="109845">It seems even the hells have their own vermin. These rat-like creatures are slothly and portly, sniffing around the area casually as they search for more gems to gnaw on.</string>
<string name="109846">Illithid</string>
<string name="109847">This fanged horror bears the scars of its horrendous battle against the Sleeping Man, long ago. It must be one of the Guardians of the Path left behind by Mephistopheles.</string>
<string name="109848">This being has been animated from the murky, acidic waters of Cania itself. Akin to an elemental, it has retained the malevolent nature of this hellish plane and exists only to torment any lost souls that are unfortunate to encounter it.</string>
<string name="109849">This fiendish wolf is a hunting companion to the frost giants, bred to race after prey and bring it down by force of numbers. It is not native to the prime material plane, existing only in the Outer Planes.</string>
<string name="109850">Hell Frost Worg</string>
<string name="109851">This is not a wolf at all, truly, but a worg... a fiendish creature filled with hate and rage and existing solely to torment the lost souls of icy Cania.</string>
<string name="109852">Alpha Hell Frost Worg</string>
<string name="109853">This is not a wolf at all, truly, but a worg... a fiendish creature filled with hate and rage and existing solely to torment the lost souls of Baator. This worg in particular is larger than the rest, being a leader of its pack.</string>
<string name="109854">This being has the head of an elderly yet matronly woman... but no body, only butterfly wings. As strange as she looks, she stares at you sternly and likely wouldn&apos;t welcome commentary.</string>
<string name="109855">Maugrim</string>
<string name="109856">A madman who was determined to resurrect the long dead race of lizard folk known as the Old Ones, Maugrim met his end during the siege of Neverwinter. After the battle, the citizens of Neverwinter burned his remains and scattered the ashes to the wind.</string>
<string name="109857">This man is covered with coal dust and coughs continuously. When he spots a dead parakeet nearby, he turns pale and begins blubbering with pure terror.</string>
<string name="109858">A member of the Waterdeep Militia. The few. The proud. The mighty.</string>
<string name="109859">A magic-using member of the Waterdeep Militia. Until recently, all local wizards were required to wear pajamas. This wizard in particular is quite happy that the era of robelessness has ended.</string>
<string name="109860">Once a drow of the Underdark, this being is now but a lost spirit, doomed to wander the hells.</string>
<string name="109861">A fiendish version of the fire beetle, this creature thrives in the hellish lava pits of Cania and preys on lost souls that come within range.</string>
<string name="109862">This monstrosity has been cobbled together from spare bones, animated by an unknown magic. It is completely mindless, akin to a golem, and likely was made to guard something nearby.</string>
<string name="109863">This fiendish goblin creature lives amongst the lava pits of Cania, preying on lost souls that pass by. For its relative size and strength, it is a cunning opponent that relies on traps and numbers to take down opponents much stronger than itself.</string>
<string name="109864">This small goblin appears unremarkable, though its drooling would indicate that it is less intelligent than others of its kin... if that is possible.</string>
<string name="109865">Nhagruul</string>
<string name="109866">Valen, Dead</string>
<string name="109867">A dark, tainted mist that seemed barely animated by a living consciousness, this creature is likely the twisted remnant of a lost soul that has been drained of all its energy.</string>
<string name="109868">This creature is likely the twisted remnants of a lost soul that has been drained of all its energy. Now it exists only to feed upon the living, drawing what sustenance it can from life-force it no longer possesses.</string>
<string name="109869">This skeleton is animated by unknown magics and possessed with an evil consciousness. It will hunt down any life it encounters and extinguish it.</string>
<string name="109870">Dust forms a skin-like film over the bones of these undead minions. They have been guarding this vault for quite some time.</string>
<string name="109871">This hellish abomination can only be described as a mass of devil-flesh animating a host skeleton. Whether the creature will one day abandon its current, decayed host and slither out to inhabit another victim can only be guessed at.</string>
<string name="109872">Devil Warrior</string>
<string name="109873">Twin blades held high, the final Guardian of the Path challenges you to battle.</string>
<string name="109874">White Abishai</string>
<string name="109875">Abishai are the torturers and wardens of hell. The five different colors of abishai have supernatural affinities with chromatic dragonkind. </string>
<string name="109876">Aribeth&apos;s Shield</string>
<string name="109877">Demonflesh Shield</string>
<string name="109878">Some forgotten crusader in the Blood Wars fashioned this shield from the flesh of a fallen enemy. The surface is pocked and marred by countless blows but there is no way of knowing whether the scars came before or after the demon died.</string>
<string name="109879">Blood Plate</string>
<string name="109880">This armor not only provides the wearer with excellent protection in combat, it also draws upon the life-force of the wearer to regenerate wounds and injuries. Of course, such magic comes with a heavy price, and those who wear the armor find themselves feeling tired and drained.</string>
<string name="109881">Scibe&apos;s Tunic</string>
<string name="109882">Sensei Strapping</string>
<string name="109883">Gru&apos;ul&apos;s Bracer</string>
<string name="109884">This thick bracer appears to be carved out of a black, granite-like material. Burned on the outside of it is the name &quot;Gru&apos;ul&quot;.</string>
<string name="109885">This thick bracer appears to be carved out of a black, granite-like material. Burned on the outside of it is the name &quot;Gru&apos;ul&quot;... this being the name of the pit fiend that you traded for the item. It glows with a dark power and surely would only be of any use to someone of an evil nature.</string>
<string name="109886">Helm of Righteousness</string>
<string name="109887">Crafted by the Sleeping Man for his long journey into the depths of hell, this helm clearly shows the labors of his love. Etched into its enameled surface are a series of finely-detailed engravings depicting the pastoral hills and woods of his home in Elysium&apos;s far-off blessed fields. A shapely woman appears in a number of the engravings but her face has been left blank and uncarved.</string>
<string name="109888">Caniam Cathix</string>
<string name="109889">With a blade as cold as its name, this weapon can shatter an enemy&apos;s shield - or the enemy themself, in seconds.

Made not of metal, this ice sword is surprisingly sturdy, and equally sharp. The handle has been wrapped in leather and engraved with the words, &quot;Caniam Cathix&quot; which means &quot;Devil&apos;s Frostbite.&quot;</string>
<string name="109890">The potion contained within this bottle can warm the body for quite some time. The energy of the Velox Berries it was made from has been harnessed within.

When times are tough, and there are no berries or wood to be found, this potion can be a life-saver.</string>
<string name="109891">Tattered Note</string>
<string name="109892">&quot;If you are reading this letter, then you have bested one of my Guardians of the Path... Well know this: I have buried the Molikroth Rebels deep in the ice of Cania where they belong. Let them be a symbol of what shall befall those who oppose me! I recommend you turn back while you still have the strength to do so.&quot;</string>
<string name="109893">Bloodied Note</string>
<string name="109894">The sheet of paper is brittle with age, softened only by the blood of the Guardian who held it. Two sets of handwriting alternate down its length, as if from some magical correspondence. A portion of the end is still legible:

&quot;I have tracked the meddling Planetar to some kind of sepulcher below the ice, m&apos;Lord, but have lost all trace of him from there.&quot;

&quot;Find him!&quot;

&quot;But, m&apos;Lord, there is nothing left to find. He is gone.&quot;

&quot;Then wait there for him!&quot;

&quot;And if he doesn&apos;t return this way?&quot;

&quot;I said wait there! For him or anyone else who may come after...&quot;

&quot;But m&apos;Lord--&quot;

&quot;Your mewling bores me, Guardian. I said wait! If I have different orders for you, I&apos;ll send them!&quot;

The ink is old and faded. It seems those orders never came.</string>
<string name="109895">Scrawled Note</string>
<string name="109896">This hastily scrawled note bears Mephistopheles&apos; now-familiar script:

&quot;I am about to make my move and lay claim to Toril. Perhaps the Tanar&apos;ri have caught wind of this for I have just received word that they are launching an assault near where I have stationed you. Make your way to the prison and fend them at all costs. The last thing I need is some fool demon getting his paws on my Knower of Names. Serve me well and I may give you lordship over Waterdeep once it is mine...&quot;

 It seems that this particular battle of the Blood War sprung up just before he left for your homeworld, Toril. </string>
<string name="109897">Puzzle Ring</string>
<string name="109898">This puzzle ring once belonged to the Planetar now known as the Sleeping Man. It is fashioned from three interlocking bands, representing Hope, Faith, and Love, respectively. Those who wear it come to see the world in a different light, revealing some things that were hidden and disguising others that were once plain. When outdoors, the ring also marks a path that once led the Sleeping Man to the Knower of Places. All who wish to follow in his footsteps must learn to wear it.</string>
<string name="109899">Ragged Cloak of the Worg</string>
<string name="109900">After encountering a pack of frost worgs in Cania&apos;s frozen wastes, you killed their leader who you took to be a powerful alpha male. On closer inspection of the corpse, however, you realized that it was nothing more than a small, hairless homunculus bundled up in a thick cloak of roughly stitched worg fur. The cloak is badly damaged by your attacks and will no longer offer much defense against the icy winds but its less mundane properties still seem to be intact. You noticed that the homunculous used it to gather his pack members close about him and you suspect that you might be able to do the same with any of your own associates as well.</string>

<string name="109906">Robe of the Demon Lord</string>
<string name="109907">This robe is from unknown origins.</string>
<string name="109908">Gargamesh&apos;s Robe</string>
<string name="109909">Black Bow of Baator</string>
<string name="109910">The Black Bow of Baator is a prized possession among Baatezu serving as scouts and spies in the ongoing Blood War between devils and demons. The bow&apos;s compact size and dark coloring make it easy to conceal when traveling through neutral territories such as the Prime Material.</string>
<string name="109911">Epic Amulet of Health</string>
<string name="109912">Robe of Balpheron</string>
<string name="109913">When Balpheron chose the path of lichdom, the plain robe he was wearing underwent a similar transformation, becoming an item of dark enchantments. The power of the garment is a testament to the strength of Balpheron&apos;s own magic, and many have sought it out. Unfortunately for those who find it, they also discover Balpheron himself.</string>
<string name="109914">Bloodsucker</string>
<string name="109915">Bolt of Dispelling</string>
<string name="109916">Invisible Death</string>
<string name="109917">Created for the bounty hunter known only as Crimson, this armor proved particularly useful in helping her hunt down her victims. It hardly needs to be said that she always brought them in dead rather than alive.</string>
<string name="109918">Master Robes of the Old Order</string>
<string name="109919">Nemesis</string>
<string name="109920">This morning star was the favored weapon of Maugrim, the mad cleric who tried to resurrect the ancient race known as the Old Ones. After Maugrim&apos;s death the weapon was claimed by a long line of owners, all of whom died under mysterious and grisly circumstances. Some attribute this to a curse upon the weapon itself, while others claim it was the work of Maugrim&apos;s spirit looking to reclaim what was rightfully his.</string>
<string name="109921">Slasher of Koth</string>
<string name="109922">This fearsome axe was the preferred weapon of the great minotaur champion Koth Uth-Kallin. The blood of many heroes stained its blade before Koth himself was felled by Nasher Alagondar.
</string>
<string name="109923">Staff of Balpheron</string>
<string name="109924">Legend holds this staff was created by the wizard Balpheron on the eve of his ascension to lichdom. Many believe Balpheron had already chosen his fate, and only wanted the staff to make himself more powerful as a lich. But others claiming it was the staff itself that led him down the dark path, as the creation of such a powerful item pushed the mage beyond his limits and destroyed what remained of his sanity.</string>
<string name="109925">Devil&apos;s Sting</string>
<string name="109926">This thin blade drips with foul green acid that can eat away the skin of an opponent. But even those who survive the searing of their flesh often fall, as the acid is also a powerful poison.</string>
<string name="109927">Talisman of Ultimate Evil</string>
<string name="109928">Robe of Leathers</string>
<string name="109929">A variety of thick but supple leathers have been stitched together in multiple layers to form this heavily padded robe. It&apos;s well-worn and heavily creased at the joints as if its former owner wore it comfortably for many years. </string>
<string name="109930">Sash of Searing</string>
<string name="109931">Recognizable by their golden clasp in the shape of a risen sun, these powerful sashes originated in the scorched desert hells of the Abyss. There, Azer pit slaves are forced to melt the endless seas of sand into glass for their demonic masters. The sheets of red-black glass are then shattered and the jagged shards gathered for use as spear- and arrowheads in the Blood War.</string>
<string name="109932">The origin of this cloak dates back to the days when King Richard Garrison held power in the city-state of Gibbonsfeldt. It was crafted for him by his servant, a demented and twisted man named Pony Tall.

Though Pony was not a gifted man, he managed to sew the cloak in just a few days. It was a misshapen thing, barely resembling a cloak at all, but Pony Tall had done the best he could. Wrapping the tattered garment up, he made way to his lord and master. 

Enraged by the gift&apos;s insult, King Garrison drew his mighty blade and cut Pony down before all the court, his blood staining the ragged cloak a garish red.

Before tossing the garment out with Pony&apos;s stricken corpse, the King placed it around his neck to mock its incompetent maker. The courtiers jeered and laughed at its haphazard manufacture.

Upon placing the cloak about his shoulders, however, the King suddenly felt a little stronger, a little wiser, a little younger. Even the night&apos;s cold wind no longer chilled to his aging bones.

It has long been said that a fool&apos;s blood spilled in a wise king&apos;s court holds a magic unlike any other. As a result, the king&apos;s wizards have suggested that the cloak&apos;s magic came not from any aspect of its fashioning but instead from the corrupted taint of Pony&apos;s blood that paints it red.

Whatever the case, the shroud&apos;s power is quite remarkable despite the unseemliness of its appearance. To this day in Gibbonsfeldt, lords and ladies don the most hideous garments they can find to celebrate All Fool&apos;s Day and the long, wise reign of Richard Garrison.</string>
<string name="109933">Sleeping Man Properties 2</string>
<string name="109934">Torch of the Velox Berry</string>
<string name="109935">This torch seems to burn forever when you hold it aloft. Not even the cold winds of Cania can extinguish its flame. Placing it in your pack douses the flame, but it somehow reappears when you take it out again.

Though it burns in a small radius, the essence of the Velox berry provides great warmth.</string>
<string name="109936">Ranseur</string>
<string name="109937">Brimstone</string>
<string name="109938">Forged in the flames of Baator, Brimstone was a prize given by the arch-devil Mephistopheles to the one General who remained loyal to him during Cania&apos;s ill-fated Molikroth Rebellion. Its mighty ashen blade is pitted and scarred from the fires that have coiled for eons about its jagged edge.</string>

<string name="109978">As you left the Reaper&apos;s now-familiar domain for the squalid City of Lost Souls that rises around it, you found yourself buffeted by a sudden blast of cold air. A constant, sunless light reflects off the muddied ice and ghostly figures huddle in tattered tents and around flickering fires in an effort to keep the chill at bay. Suddenly a horrific scream cut through the frost-filled air and one of the ghostly figures disappeared in a flash of white. His companions seem more saddened than surprised by his departure. Curious, you resolve to join them around the fire&apos;s warmth and question them about what you just witnessed.</string>
<string name="109979">As you left the Reaper&apos;s now-familiar domain for the squalid City of Lost Souls that rises around it, you found yourself buffeted by a sudden blast of cold air. A constant, sunless light reflects off the muddied ice and ghostly figures huddle in tattered tents and around flickering fires in an effort to keep the chill at bay. Suddenly a horrific scream cut through the frost-filled air and one of the ghostly figures disappeared in a flash of white. According to his companions, who seem more saddened than surprised by their friend&apos;s gruesome departure, this is becoming an all-too-common occurrence. Apparently Mephistopheles is devouring the souls of these pale spirits in order to build an army for himself back in your homeworld, Toril.</string>
<string name="109980">Arden Swift, patron of the Hellbreath Tavern and itinerant jester currently taveling with the entourage of Githzerai Pilgrims, has placed his beloved Trumpet of Pandemonium as a prize for an upcoming card game. He had intended to use the trumpet to wake the so-called Sleeping Man but had been caught red-handed by the Pilgrims&apos; Sensei before he could sound its blast. If you&apos;re interested in acquiring it for yourself, you merely have to place your ante on the table and guess the card he&apos;s holding in five questions or less. You&apos;re not entirely sure if you can trust him but it might be worth a try.</string>
<string name="109981">The archdevil Mephistopheles has played you for a fool. He has commanded your mysterious ally, the Gatekeeper, to bar your return to Waterdeep in your homeworld of Toril, trapping you instead in some hellish world called Cania. The Gatekeeper seems sympathetic to your plight but claims he has no choice but to obey for Mephistopheles has commanded him by his True Name. Such names seem to have a strange power in this place and it seems the only way to break Mephistopheles&apos; prohibition will be learn the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name for yourself.</string>
<string name="109982">The Sleeping Man was not as helpful in your quest for the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name as you had hoped. You did learn, however, of an ancient race called the Knowers that populated Cania before it was colonized by the legions of hell. One of them, the Knower of Names, was banished by Mephistopheles to an unknown prison deep in Cania&apos;s frozen wastelands. Unable to find the Knower of Names, the Sleeping Man instead sought out her sister, the Knower of Places, with the help of a magical ring that that served as his guide through Cania&apos;s wastes. If you can repeat his feat, perhaps she will be able to help you find her sister&apos;s hidden prison. The Sleeping Man broke the ring into three parts and hid it in a guarded vault below his chambers. It seems your journey will begin there.</string>
<string name="109983">The Sleeping Man&apos;s ring that will lead you to the Knower of Places and hopefully to the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name is a strange artifact indeed. When you slip it onto your finger, it is as if you can see into another sort of space, another dimension. Some things are present there that are not present in the real world and some things you would expect to find have disappeared. According to the Sleeping Man, the ring will be most helpful in the out of doors where a line of glowing arrows will apparently chart a safe course for you through Cania&apos;s vast wastelands. You feel the stirrings of hope in your chest for the first time since Mephistopheles banished you to this frozen place.</string>
<string name="109984">At long last you have learned the True Name of the Gatekeeper: Hecugoth the Abandoned. You say it aloud a few times, rolling it around on your tongue. It has a sad sound to it but you are eager to put it to use. It&apos;s your ticket out of here, back to Waterdeep and your homeworld of Toril... or whatever still remains of them after the chaos that Mephistopheles has sown in your absence. The Knower of Names will take you back to the Gates of Cania but you pause to consider whether you have any pressing tasks you wish to accomplish on this plane before you go. Facing Mephistopheles won&apos;t be easy and you&apos;d better have made your peace with the world.</string>
<string name="109985">Mephistopheles: Ominous Signs</string>
<string name="109986">Peering into an ice crystal that thrust itself up from Cania&apos;s glacial floor, you saw a vision of Mephistopheles&apos; progress in your homeworld of Toril. It appears that he has discovered the carnage left you behind at the Rebel Camp. As he passed through the rotting carcasses, they rose in his wake, a ghostly army bound to do his bidding...</string>
<string name="109987">Peering into an ice crystal that thrust itself up from Cania&apos;s glacial floor, you saw a vision of Mephistopheles&apos; progress in your homeworld of Toril.

With every moment, he grows stronger...</string>
<string name="109988">Peering into an ice crystal that thrust itself up from Cania&apos;s glacial floor, you saw a vision of Mephistopheles&apos; progress in your homeworld of Toril. It appears that he has made his way to the surface, emerging in the Yawning Portal. Many of the patrons were incinerated by his deadly gaze, though you don&apos;t yet know the fate of Durnan and his family. Even so, time grows short and the city of Waterdeep is in great peril.</string>
<string name="109989">Waterdeep lies in near ruins, Mephistopheles&apos; soulless army thick as thieves amidst the rubble. You have been away for far too long and it seems that all your worst fears have come true.</string>
<string name="109990">Before you may enter the Temple of the Sleeping Man&apos;s Inner Sanctum, you must learn the Five-Fold Mysteries and recite them to Dharvana, the Githzerai Sensei. The Five-Fold Mysteries are as follows: Who is he? From where did he come? Why did he leave? Who did he seek? What was the answer?

You have learned the answer to one of those five Mysteries.</string>
<string name="109991">Dharvana, the Githzerai Sensei, insists that you must learn and recite the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man before she will let you into the temple&apos;s Inner Sanctum to see him. She listed the Five-Fold Mysteries as follows: Who is he? From where did he come? Why did he leave? Who did he seek? What was the answer?

You have now learned the answer to two of those five Mysteries.</string>
<string name="109992">While visiting the Temple of the Sleeping Man in the city&apos;s northwest corner, you&apos;ve gained access to the Inner Sanctum where the temple&apos;s namesake is said to rest.</string>
<string name="109993">The Arch-Devil&apos;s Guardians</string>
<string name="109994">According to the Sleeping Man&apos;s dreams, Mephistopheles left five Guardians to block his path. The two weakest were defeated in his quest and the three remaining tricked or avoided. They have grown wiser in the eons since, however, and if you intend to follow in the Sleeping Man&apos;s footsteps, you suspect you will have to face each of the three in turn.</string>

<string name="109996">Mephistopheles left five Guardians to block the Sleeping Man&apos;s path. The two weakest were defeated in ages past and now you have killed the third, a mishapen devil who lay in wait for you just outside the City of Lost Souls.</string>
<string name="109997">Mephistopheles left five Guardians to block the Sleeping Man&apos;s path. The two weakest were defeated in ages past and a third killed recently by your hands. You have now killed the fourth, a powerful black slaad who must have tracked the Sleeping Man as far as your current location. The Knower of Places must be very close indeed.</string>
<string name="109998">Mephistopheles left five Guardians to block the Sleeping Man&apos;s path. The two weakest were defeated in ages past and a second and third killed recently by your hands. You have now killed the fifth and final guardian, a wizardly Pit Fiend who stood guard over the prison itself, perhaps there to protect it from the Blood War that raged so close at hand. With all five Guardians dead, the Knower of Names is yours and her secrets too. Now if only you can find some way to free her from the ice.</string>
<string name="109999">Gru&apos;ul the fiendish Quarry Boss is no more, though his Quarry Workers continue in their labors, fearful that he might return or that someone even more fearsome might be sent from the capital, Mephistar, to take his place. It is a shame you won&apos;t have any further access to the Quarry store.</string>
