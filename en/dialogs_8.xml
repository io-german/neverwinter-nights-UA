<resources><string name="80000">An ancient and bitter rat by the name of Dagget Filth suggests that the upper portion of the Arcanists&apos; Tower is being stolen, brick and mortar, by jealous planar creatures known as Shadovar. From his account, it appears they covet an artifact called the Dark Wind most of all.</string>
<string name="80001">Arcanists&apos; Tower - The Shadow Lich</string>
<string name="80002">After fighting through a sea of shadows, you arrive in the High Arcanist&apos;s Chambers only to see the lichly ruler of the Shadovar escape back to the safety his plane with the artifact known as the Dark Wind. With the shadow portal closed, you&apos;ll have to find some other way into his lair if you intend to steal his prize. </string>
<string name="80003">Ashtara</string>
<string name="80004">Ashtara, the Asabi merchant, concedes that you have performed your tasks admirably. Concerned for his own safety, however, he has refused to remove the slaver&apos;s collar from around your neck. That said, he has no further tasks for you and has granted you the freedom to explore the city as you wish. You can already feel the tremors growing in strength and you suspect it will not be long before Heurodis has freed the ancient city from its mooring.</string>
<string name="80005">Ashtara - Golem Destroyed</string>
<string name="80006">One of the ten guardian golems has been destroyed. With its fall, you feel one step closer to your freedom.</string>
<string name="80007">Two of the ten guardian golems have been destroyed. With its fall, you feel one step closer to your freedom.</string>
<string name="80008">Three of the ten guardian golems have been destroyed. With its fall, you feel one step closer to your freedom.</string>
<string name="80009">Four of the ten guardian golems have been destroyed. With its fall, you feel one step closer to your freedom.</string>
<string name="80010">Five of the ten guardian golems have been destroyed. With its fall, you feel one step closer to your freedom.</string>
<string name="80011">Six of the ten guardian golems have been destroyed. With its fall, you feel one step closer to your freedom.</string>
<string name="80012">Seven of the ten guardian golems have been destroyed. With its fall, you feel one step closer to your freedom.</string>
<string name="80013">Eight of the ten guardian golems have been destroyed. With its fall, you feel one step closer to your freedom.</string>
<string name="80014">Nine of the ten guardian golems have been destroyed. With its fall, you feel one step closer to your freedom.</string>
<string name="80015">All ten of the guardian golems have been destroyed. Though Ashtara&apos;s task was not an easy one, it is now complete. Your master will want to hear news of your accomplishment.</string>
<string name="80016">Ashtara - Golem Disabled</string>
<string name="80017">One of the ten guardian golems has been disabled through the use of the Golem-Maker&apos;s ring. Ashtara&apos;s task now seems far less daunting and you can almost taste your freedom from his accursed collar.</string>
<string name="80018">Two of the ten guardian golems have been disabled through the use of the Golem-Maker&apos;s ring. Ashtara&apos;s task now seems far less daunting and you can almost taste your freedom from his accursed collar.</string>
<string name="80019">Three of the ten guardian golems have been disabled through the use of the Golem-Maker&apos;s ring. Ashtara&apos;s task now seems far less daunting and you can almost taste your freedom from his accursed collar.</string>

<string name="80026">All ten of the guardian golems have been disabled through the use of the Golem-Maker&apos;s ring. Ashtara&apos;s task is now complete and you can almost taste your freedom from his accursed collar.</string>
<string name="80027">Ashtara - The Golem Emporium</string>
<string name="80028">The automatons that still stand guard over the ruined homes of Undrentide continue to advertise their maker&apos;s shop, no doubt long since destroyed. It was called the Golem Emporium and was apparently located in the northwest portion of the city though it is hard to say which way had pointed north when this city once flew.</string>
<string name="80029">Ashtara - The Golem-Maker&apos;s Ring</string>
<string name="80030">A ring has been found in the burial chamber of a long-dead Golem-Maker of Undrentide. Judging by the instructions around the outer band, he used it on his golems, deactivating them so he could tinker with their inner workings.</string>
<string name="80031">Ashtara - The Slaver&apos;s Task</string>
<string name="80032">Ashtara, the Asabi merchant who rescued you, also chose to make you his slave. Even though he is trapped within the ruined city and has lost some of his thralls in the collapsed tunnels, his greed continues unabated. He has informed you that ten guardians protect the ruined homes and has ordered you to destroy them so he and his thralls can continue their looting in safety.</string>
<string name="80033">Ashtara - The Stone Butler&apos;s Love</string>
<string name="80034">After so many years, a Stone Butler continues to pine for his long-dead master, the Golem-Maker of Undrentide. He lingers by the man&apos;s tomb even now and has confessed that his master wore a ring that kept him safe around his more violent creations.</string>
<string name="80035">Crypt Tower</string>
<string name="80036">Long protected by the dead of countless ages and the mysteries of the world beyond, the Dead Wind has at last been captured and encased in glass.</string>
<string name="80037">Crypt Tower - A Maze of Bones</string>
<string name="80038">Above the fiery chambers of the Burning Men lies a maze of bones. By some infernal magic, the walls of this place are there one moment and gone the next. All the while, the skeletons of the dead stalk those who wander their domain, mindlessly seeking to add more to their number.</string>
<string name="80039">Crypt Tower - Atop the Tower</string>
<string name="80040">The Dead Wind rests atop the shattered Crypt Tower, lost, defenseless, and alone. But nothing is defenseless so long as it has friends and, as for the Dead Wind, it knows how to make its own.</string>
<string name="80041">Crypt Tower - Discovery</string>
<string name="80042">A crumbling sign has been found along the northern edge of the city, identifying the ruins there as a Crypt Tower of some sort.</string>
<string name="80043">Crypt Tower - Disturbing the Dead</string>
<string name="80044">Dread sarcophagi glow in the dim light of the Crypt Tower&apos;s initial floor. From their stony depths climb an endless stream of the Disturbed, shuffling toward any who dare trespass here.</string>
<string name="80045">Crypt Tower - The Burning Men</string>
<string name="80046">The second floor of the Crypt Tower is like a furnace, fuelled by the self-flagellation of accursed souls known only as the Burning Men. Despite their name, their fiery torment does not consume them and it seems they shall walk this scorched domain for all eternity.</string>
<string name="80047">Heurodis</string>
<string name="80048">Heurodis is destroyed, the tatters of her lichly flesh slowly dissolving into dust and scattering with the ferocious wind. You lie there bleeding in the Chamber of the Shattered Mythallar and time itself seems to slow to nothing. The desert floor towards which you plummet seems so far away and desolate. But above you the sky seems so close and beautiful. Smiling, you close your eyes for the last time.</string>
<string name="80049">Heurodis - Farewell to the Mythal</string>
<string name="80050">The only way to destroy Heurodis has been to destroy the very mythal that protected her. That mythal is also what kept this floating city aloft. The wind screams all around you as, groaning, the city begins to fall. You know your death is imminent but what of Heurodis? She is a lich and no doubt her magic will allow her to survive the fall. You must destroy her here and now or all will be for naught.</string>
<string name="80051">Heurodis - The Chamber of the Mythallar</string>
<string name="80052">As suspected, Heurodis has been found in the Chamber of the Mythallar atop the Temple of the Winds. Protected by the mythal&apos;s power, she has finally raised the city from the sands and the sun of a desert dawn now bathes the ruined city in its glory. Heurodis&apos; madness knows no bounds and she must be stopped.</string>
<string name="80053">Heurodis - The Lost City of Undrentide</string>
<string name="80054">You have no idea how much time has passed since Heurodis turned you to stone but the lost city of Undrentide remains trapped below the sands, at least for the time being. Even so, the ground continues to shake with tremors and you know that you must hurry if you intend to put a stop to her madness.</string>
<string name="80055">Heurodis - The Mythallar</string>
<string name="80056">The flying cities of ancient Netheril drew their power from a magic known as the mythal. This magic was somehow associated with artifacts known as mythallar, a fragment of which you once wore on a chain around your neck until Heurodis stole it from you. Here in Undrentide, the mythallar were housed atop the Temple of the Winds and no doubt that is where Heurodis will be found.</string>
<string name="80057">Library</string>
<string name="80058">There was much to be learned from the magic tomes of fallen Undrentide and much to be gained from their reading. The Wise Wind, who hid within their enchanted pages, has finally been captured.</string>
<string name="80059">Library - A Romance Novel</string>
<string name="80060">A strange tome discovered in the Great Library of Undrentide appears to have the power to whisk its readers into the very world that it portrays. The tome claimed to be a romance novel of sorts and lo, a young man weeps out his heart into yonder canyon.</string>
<string name="80061">Library - A Romance Rewritten</string>
<string name="80062">The romance novel in the back room of Undrentide&apos;s Great Library has been rewritten.</string>
<string name="80063">Library - A Treatise on Forgiveness</string>
<string name="80064">The philosophical treatise on the nature of hell has been rewritten to allow for the concept of redemption.</string>
<string name="80065">Library - A Treatise on Hell</string>
<string name="80066">Tales within tales and tomes within tomes... Buried within the magical realm of the romance novel is another book, this one a philosophical treatise on the nature of hell. It, too, is enchanted to bring its reader into the world that it depicts, fearsome though it might be.</string>
<string name="80067">Library - Dark Rituals</string>
<string name="80068">Some dark ritual seems to have taken place within this temple. Incense burns with a fetid scent and the body of a fair young maid lies broken beneath it on a skull-shaped dais. Her blood seeps into the dark stone, mingled with the darker blood of summoned demons, now destroyed.</string>
<string name="80069">Library - Discovery</string>
<string name="80070">A crumbling sign has been found along the eastern edge of the city, identifying the ruins there as being that of the Great Library.</string>
<string name="80071">Library - Karsus&apos; Promise</string>
<string name="80072">An angel waited within the hellish domain of the revised philosophical treatise. Karsus, Archmage of Netheril, has been redeemed and left a grateful message promising that he would aid in the capture of the Wise Wind.</string>
<string name="80073">Library - Poor William</string>
<string name="80074">The central character of the romance novel found in the Great Library of Undrentide appears to be a young, lame beggar by the name of William. He fell in love with Jendra, a noble&apos;s daughter, and she loved him in return. On discovering their tryst, however, her parents sent her off to a nearby temple where William fears she is coming to great harm.</string>
<string name="80075">Library - Sins Against Netheril</string>
<string name="80076">In the depths of hell, Karsus, Archmage of Netheril, burns in eternal torment for his hubris. In his arrogance, he destroyed the Netherese empire and sent its floating cities, Undrentide included, plummeting to their doom. Hell made him a humbler man, however, and he wrote his confessions in another magic tome that rests in a back room.</string>
<string name="80077">Library - Sir William&apos;s Promise</string>
<string name="80078">Grateful for his less tragic end within the romance novel&apos;s magical realm, Sir William has promised to aid in the capture of the Wise Wind.</string>
<string name="80079">Library - The Catching of the Wind</string>
<string name="80080">At last the empty tome in Undrentide&apos;s Great Library lies empty no longer. A cunning tale has been crafted there and a trap set by which the capture of the Wise Wind might be possible.</string>
<string name="80081">Temple of the Winds</string>
<string name="80082">The mystery of the Ark of the Three Winds has been solved and the door to the temple now lies open. Even now you can feel the floor rumble and shift beneath you as Heurodis struggles to tap the mythal&apos;s power in the temple&apos;s upper chambers. It will not be long before she has the city aloft.</string>
<string name="80083">Temple of the Winds - An Empty Ark</string>
<string name="80084">Much of the wood that once sheathed the Ark of the Three Winds in the temple&apos;s outer sanctum has long since crumbled into dust. Its body and hinges were carved from stone, however, and the counter-weighted lid lifts as easily now as the day it was made. Inside, amidst rotten velvet lining, are three round depressions. They look as if they are meant to hold three spheres, each slightly larger than a grapefruit.</string>
<string name="80085">Temple of the Winds - Discovery</string>
<string name="80086">At the very heart of ruined Undrentide rests a tower unlike any other you have seen. Its glowing walls stretch into darkness of the cavern&apos;s upper reaches, seeming almost ethereal in substance yet at the same time invulnerable to even the mightiest of blows. The walls are smooth and seamless, with no apparent entry, though a strange ark rests nearby on the ruined floor, aligned to one of the facets.</string>
<string name="80087">Three Winds</string>
<string name="80088">All three Winds have been captured and placed within the sacred ark that rested at the base of the Temple of the Winds. Together, they unleashed a whirlwind that rent a hole within the temple&apos;s seamless walls and thereby granted entry.</string>
<string name="80089">Three Winds - An Ancient Ritual</string>
<string name="80090">An ancient ritual once protected the Temple of the Winds, keeping it sealed off from the city that surrounds it. Now that the magic of the mythal has been restored, that seal is once again intact. It cannot be broken without three artifacts known as the Dark Wind, the Dead Wind, and the Wise Wind. One is rumored to be hidden amongst the tomes of Undrentide&apos;s Great Library while another was given to the city&apos;s High Arcanist that he might protect it. The final Wind was buried in the Crypt Tower where few of the living were ever known to tread. The seal will only be broken when all three can be brought together within the Ark of the Three Winds that rests at the temple&apos;s base.</string>
<string name="80091">Three Winds - The Dark</string>
<string name="80092">The Dark Wind, stolen from its rightful place in the High Arcanists&apos; chambers, has been recovered from the Plane of Shadows.</string>
<string name="80093">Three Winds - The Dead</string>
<string name="80094">The Dead Wind has been recovered from the heights of Undrentide&apos;s dreaded Crypt Tower.</string>
<string name="80095">Three Winds - The Wise</string>
<string name="80096">The Wise Wind has been recovered from its hiding place amidst the enchanted tomes of the Great Library.</string>
<string name="80097">Reference Point</string>
<string name="80098">Arrow of the Vampire</string>
<string name="80099">No one knows when or where these arrows were made. It is rumored that each tip is made with a vampire tooth. That seems unlikely due to the number of quivers of these arrows that can be found.</string>
<string name="80100">Snores Men</string>

<string name="80358">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80359">Well, yes I told &lt;him/her&gt;. Didn&apos;t you hear me tell &lt;him/her&gt;?</string>
<string name="80360">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80361">Oh. He says you&apos;re not so bad... even if you&apos;re not a halfling. High praise from him.</string>

<string name="80366">Back again, are we? What can Daschnaya do for you now, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;?</string>
<string name="80367">Greetings, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. How has your voyage into the great Anauroch been so far?</string>
<string name="80368">Impatient, are you? You remind me of Katriana... no time for sentimentality, as she calls such things as legend and history.</string>
<string name="80369">Battle is no longer my place, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. I travel with Katriana to heal and to advise, and sometimes to remind my fellow halflings that there is more to existence than commerce. Nothing more.</string>
<string name="80370">How many times we have crossed this desolate wasteland and never stopped to consider what it once was, a place great for more than its size.</string>
<string name="80371">But, then, I am sure you have more on your mind than old tales that have mostly been forgotten. What can Daschnaya do for you?</string>
<string name="80372">Then I wish you well, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="80373">It will take me but a moment to find the proper scroll, my dear, and then I will gladly aid you.</string>
<string name="80374">I do not have much to show you, dear, but you&apos;re welcome to see it.</string>
<string name="80375">Your crystal... it radiates with great power. But it is a form of magic that I have never seen before, such raw energy!</string>
<string name="80376">I cannot, however, tell you more of its origin... not without guessing, and I do not wish to do that. I am sorry.</string>
<string name="80377">Is there something else I may do?</string>
<string name="80378">What it is today is plain to see, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. All I can tell you is what it once was. Do you know about the Netheril Empire, and how it fell?</string>
<string name="80379">As you wish. Is there something else you desire?</string>
<string name="80380">Very simple: this desert was not always here. The fall of the Netheril Empire created it. Hostile magic, cursed blight, the destruction of their cities... it turned a verdant land into a desolation.</string>
<string name="80381">Try to consider what kind of power could bring ruin to a land larger than the fabled Dales and you will realize why there are many who come to this desert seeking the answers to its mysteries.</string>
<string name="80382">Now that is the mystery, isn&apos;t it? Whatever happened to the Netherese it happened suddenly. There are many tales but no records of this calamity.</string>
<string name="80383">Perhaps their magic simply stopped working, perhaps they were attacked... perhaps the gods struck them down because their pride was so great.</string>
<string name="80384">However it happened, one day the flying cities of the Empire crashed to the ground and their power was no more. Lost to time and legend, as they say.</string>
<string name="80385">Traces, perhaps. Ruins, scattered artifacts, perhaps more buried beneath the sand under our feet. Little more.</string>
<string name="80386">Think on this: there is a legend of a single surviving set of scrolls from this Empire that is said to contain enough power to change Faerun forever.</string>
<string name="80387">Imagine for yourself what more might exist that has not yet been uncovered. All mysteries are solved in the end... don&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="80388">Mmmm. The Netherese Scrolls. Aye, what Xanos would not do to stumble across artifacts such as that.</string>
<string name="80389">They say that the Anauroch is nothing more than the corpse of the Empire buried under the sand of time. There have been great wonders unearthed here, &lt;FirstName&gt;, trust me.</string>
<string name="80390">There be flying city buried under Deekin&apos;s feet?</string>
<string name="80391">Very possibly, little one. If one of us knew the answer to that, who knows what power we might possess?</string>
<string name="80392">Ages ago this desert was not as you see it now. It was a lush land filled with the Netherese people... humans who commanded magic the power of which has not been seen since.</string>
<string name="80393">They ruled all that the Anauroch now encompasses, and likely further as well. They built great structures that awed all, and most fabled were their flying cities.</string>
<string name="80394">Imagine, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;, the power it would take to lift a mountain into the air and build a glorious city on it. And the Netheril Empire had many.</string>
<string name="80395">It is said that whatever caused the Empire to fall brought their great cities crashing to the ground. You do not see mountains flying in the air today, do you?</string>
<string name="80396">There are rumors, but no doubt they are only that. Can you imagine if a city such as that did exist today? An unassailable fortress filled with magic and power beyond measure.</string>
<string name="80397">Deekin sees Old Master fly, once. That come pretty close... Old Master was pretty fat.</string>
<string name="80398">Fabled, indeed. These are tales and nothing more.</string>
<string name="80399">Are you so certain, my friend? There is much evidence that would prove you wrong. Perhaps you will find some for yourself.</string>
<string name="80400">I&apos;ve read of those. It&apos;s said that the Netherese took the tops from whole mountains and made them fly, and it was on those that the cities were built.</string>
<string name="80401">As you wish. Since my cards were returned to me, I have in fact spent a great deal of time attempting to discern more of what is to come for you... in anticipation of your asking.</string>
<string name="80402">It is not an easy path you are on, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. The mission that you were sent here for involves much more than you believe it does.</string>
<string name="80403">Before it is over, you must confront one whose face is hidden from me. You will suffer great personal loss and all will seem lost... but do not despair!</string>
<string name="80404">There is still hope, but when you act remember that there is far more than your own life at stake. You *must* ascend the tower.</string>
<string name="80405">That is not clear to me. It may not even be an actual tower... but always with you the Tower card is the last I draw. Always.</string>
<string name="80406">The Tower card depicts a great tower being broken in two by a stroke of lightning. It symbolizes destruction, an end... a great fall due to pride. That is where your destiny lies.</string>
<string name="80407">Perhaps. Or it will be the one you must confront who falls due to pride. Look on this as your opportunity to decide which it shall be.</string>
<string name="80408">Such advice rarely is clear until it is past being of use... such is the nature of prophecy. I do urge you, however, to think on what I have said.</string>
<string name="80409">Eh? This &apos;tower&apos; you speak of. It is a card that means a fall from a great height, yes? Something great coming to ruin?</string>
<string name="80410">Hmmm. I wonder if that has anything to do with the tower statue. That&apos;s where the crystal was, after all.</string>
<string name="80411">The Tower could represent what you speak of, yes, but also a great many other things as well.</string>
<string name="80412">You means like little broken tower statue, maybe?</string>
<string name="80413">I speak of the Tower card, little one, though it may very well represent what you speak of... and a great many other things, as well.</string>
<string name="80414">Not one as I did before, perhaps, for your destiny has not changed. I can, however, provide you some limited advice on your immediate future... that is up to you.</string>
<string name="80415">I can also offer you any healing you might need, as well as access to my limited supply of potions and scrolls... should you desire them.</string>
<string name="80416">I&apos;m almost hesitant to ask... but is it possible for others to get a reading, as well?</string>
<string name="80417">Naturally, my dear. Be aware, however, that you may not like what I have to tell you.</string>
<string name="80418">Why would you say that? Is there something you already know about my future?</string>
<string name="80419">I... see sadness, my dear. If you wish to know more about it, we could certainly sit down and I could do a full reading for you.</string>
<string name="80420">Actually, come to think of it, I&apos;d rather not know. If there&apos;s sadness to come, I don&apos;t want to stand around wondering what I could do to stop it. Thank you anyhow.</string>
<string name="80421">Hmph. Xanos finds it hard to believe that you hold any true power, old woman.</string>
<string name="80422">I may not have the sort of power that you seek, my friend, but if you believe me devoid of knowledge then why did you steal in here yesterday asking for a reading?</string>
<string name="80423">Xanos did no such thing!</string>
<string name="80424">I see. My mistake. Perhaps you thought we were playing a simple game of diamondback, yes?</string>
<string name="80425">Bah. Your technique is flawed, anyhow. You are supposed to tell Xanos he gets rich and powerful, not that he dies alone and other drivel.</string>
<string name="80426">You may choose to listen or not. That is your choice, my friend.</string>
<string name="80427">Ooooo... that sounds neat! Can you reads Deekin&apos;s future?</string>
<string name="80428">I have already read your future this very trip, little kobold. How very different do you think the outcome will be already?</string>
<string name="80429">Oh. Deekin was hopings for future where he not gets eaten by big monster. That too much to ask?</string>
<string name="80430">&lt;StartAction&gt;[chuckle!]&lt;/Start&gt; It is destiny that swallows you, little one, and not any creature. Ponder my other words to you and perhaps then we can speak again.</string>
<string name="80431">I can offer you healing, free should you need it. I also have a limited supply of potions and scrolls and similar goods... for a small fee, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="80432">I would also have once offered to look into your future... alas, I lost my cards to the looting kobolds in Hilltop. Perhaps one day I will find some new ones.</string>
<string name="80433">It may not be much assistance to one as skilled and powerful as you are, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;, but I can only do what I can.</string>
<string name="80434">Since my cards were so kindly recovered, I can also offer you advice on your future... should you choose to hear it, that&apos;s up to you.</string>
<string name="80435">Then you are fortunate, for many find the prospect of crossing this desolation a terrible one indeed. The Anauroch was not always as you see it, however. Once it was great for more than its size.</string>
<string name="80436">It is a desolate place, that&apos;s true. An immense wasteland that stretches for many leagues in every direction. But it was not always so... once it was great for more than its size.</string>
<string name="80437">Enough with the pleasantries. I have questions.</string>
<string name="80438">Fine, except for the fighting... which you didn&apos;t join in.</string>
<string name="80439">I should be going</string>
<string name="80440">I need some healing.</string>
<string name="80441">I&apos;d like to see what you have in stock.</string>
<string name="80442">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Show her the crystal.]&lt;/Start&gt; Have you ever seen anything like this?</string>
<string name="80443">Tell me what you know about this desert.</string>
<string name="80444">I don&apos;t need to know any of this.</string>
<string name="80445">What does that have to do with this desert?</string>
<string name="80446">Why did the Empire fall?</string>
<string name="80447">There are no traces of it?</string>
<string name="80448">Tell me about the Netheril Empire.</string>
<string name="80449">That&apos;s all I need to hear.</string>
<string name="80450">Flying cities? Do they still exist?</string>
<string name="80451">I could use some advice on my future.</string>
<string name="80452">Tower? What tower?</string>
<string name="80453">Are you saying that *I* will fall due to pride?</string>
<string name="80454">This is of no help at all.</string>
<string name="80455">Bah! I don&apos;t believe any of this!</string>
<string name="80456">Thank you very much.</string>
<string name="80457">Can you give me another reading?</string>
<string name="80458">I don&apos;t know. What can you do for me?</string>
<string name="80459">It&apos;s been tolerable, so far.</string>
<string name="80460">It doesn&apos;t seem so great to me.</string>
<string name="80461">You don&apos;t suppose we&apos;ll see some Asabi again, do you?</string>
<string name="80462">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80463">Okay, okay, forget I mentioned it. My brother has this *thing* against them Asabi. Just because they tried to eat him once. Pfft.</string>
<string name="80464">Blech. I got sand in my mouth. Again.</string>
<string name="80465">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80466">Hmm. Come to think of it, you&apos;re right, brother. That *does* taste like last night&apos;s soup, doesn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="80467">Crimeny! I wonder how long the trip through the desert&apos;s going to be this time!</string>
<string name="80468">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80469">Shush, you. I don&apos;t need to hear that kind of talk when we still got more than a week to go.</string>
<string name="80470">I suppose you&apos;ll be trying to find that guide, then, hey?</string>
<string name="80471">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80472">He may still be alive, brother. You have to try and think positive.</string>
<string name="80473">What are the chances that guide&apos;s still alive, you think?</string>
<string name="80474">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80475">True. If it had been the Asabi, like my brother said, then the guide would be a goner for sure. Lizard folk having funny tastes and all.</string>
<string name="80476">That poor guide. Torias says they&apos;ll be sucking all the juices out of him before morning comes.</string>
<string name="80477">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80478">Really? I&apos;m not so sure I&apos;d want to see that.</string>
<string name="80479">Well, now, isn&apos;t that the guide there?</string>
<string name="80480">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80481">Sure it is. And he doesn&apos;t have any of his inner juices sucked out at all. Are you sure you&apos;re the guide we started out with, you?</string>
<string name="80482">Err... yes. I am Zidan, complete with bodily juices, yes...</string>
<string name="80483">Huh. Well, go figure.</string>
<string name="80484">Aren&apos;t we leaving yet? The guide&apos;s back now, isn&apos;t he?</string>
<string name="80485">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80486">Quiet, you. The sooner we get underway, the sooner we&apos;ll get to the Ao encampment.</string>
<string name="80487">If you got any business, you might want to talk to Katriana.</string>
<string name="80488">Ughh... what was in the soup this morning?</string>
<string name="80489">That kobold&apos;s not exactly the best cook. My stomach is grumblin&apos; something fierce...</string>
<string name="80490">Hmph. You know, I bet anyone we meet will just assume the big folk here are in charge.</string>
<string name="80491">Heh... have you seen &apos;em big folk trying to sleep in the wagons? Pretty funny.</string>
<string name="80492">Hey there. Always nice to have some regular-sized folk about.</string>
<string name="80493">You&apos;re not so frightenin&apos;, you know. Gigantic as you are and all.</string>
<string name="80494">You large folk can&apos;t find the wagons too comfortable, I bet.</string>
<string name="80495">How are you faring, big &apos;un?</string>
<string name="80496">Ahh!</string>
<string name="80497">Grrr!</string>
<string name="80498">Short doesn&apos;t mean weak!</string>
<string name="80499">That&apos;s it! You&apos;re dead!</string>
<string name="80500">Pick on a halfling, will you?!</string>
<string name="80501">Take that!</string>
<string name="80502">You&apos;re askin&apos; for it!</string>
<string name="80503">I&apos;ll get you!</string>
<string name="80504">You are too kind, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="80505">Thank you for aiding me.</string>
<string name="80506">Ahh... that feels much better.</string>
<string name="80507">Much obliged!</string>
<string name="80508">You have my thanks!</string>
<string name="80509">I am completely healed... thank you!</string>
<string name="80510">This recently-burrowed hole leads down into what appears to be an underground cave. With nothing to tie a rope to and no clear way to descend, climbing down into the cave may be tricky.</string>
<string name="80511">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the hole alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80512">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Dexterity]&lt;/Start&gt; Climb down into the hole.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80513">This recently-burrowed hole leads down into what appears to be an underground cave. With nothing to tie a rope to and no clear way to descend, climbing down into the cave may be tricky.</string>
<string name="80514">What? What did I do that would be worthy of such a suspicious tone, I wonder?</string>
<string name="80515">I have two words for you, dear cousin. &quot;Bandits&quot; and &quot;asleep while on watch&quot;.</string>
<string name="80516">That&apos;s more like five words. And besides, I had a full stomach that night. You can&apos;t expect a man to stay awake all night after eating a full pot roast, can you?</string>
<string name="80517">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; Just be careful, will you? Daschnaya&apos;s predicted some trouble and I don&apos;t want to take any chances.</string>
<string name="80518">Hmph. Daschnaya&apos;s always predicting trouble...</string>
<string name="80519">Between you and your companions and that odd little kobold we hired on outside of Hilltop, our group is much larger than it normally is. I&apos;m surprised we haven&apos;t drawn more attention by now.</string>
<string name="80520">I trust crossing the desert isn&apos;t completely unbearable? You&apos;ll be alright for the night?</string>
<string name="80521">I&apos;ll leave you alone, then. You can handle yourself, I&apos;m sure. Just be careful... the desert gets colder than you&apos;d think during the night. And don&apos;t wander too far from the fire.</string>
<string name="80522">If you need any assistance or have any questions, Zidan here can help you out. He&apos;s the guide I hired for us back at Blacksands.</string>
<string name="80523">I would be most pleased to help however I am needed.</string>
<string name="80524">Yes, well... that&apos;s good. As for me, the desert makes me tired and cranky. I&apos;m going to bed. Good night to you both.</string>
<string name="80525">Not much. This caravan isn&apos;t meant for carting along passengers, after all. Still, I wouldn&apos;t want you dropping dead from heat exhaustion or the like.</string>
<string name="80526">Actually, I would have thought we&apos;d have had a bit of trouble before now. There&apos;s no way we can pass through the Anauroch unnoticed with a caravan this crowded.</string>
<string name="80527">Daschnaya knows that, too. But she wouldn&apos;t say anything if it was just a hunch... and that makes me nervous. I&apos;d suggest sleeping with your hand on your blade.</string>
<string name="80528">Hmm. Well, the big half-orc kept complaining about the sand and finally went indoors a couple of hours ago. Can&apos;t imagine what he&apos;s up to.</string>
<string name="80529">As for the dwarven lass, I think she wandered off to eat her dinner alone. Hope she doesn&apos;t get too far from camp... it&apos;s not safe out there.</string>
<string name="80530">As for the dwarven lass, she&apos;s right here with you. Been whispering sweet nothings with Torias for half the trip, I see.</string>
<string name="80531">Just exchanging trade secrets. Nothing more than that.</string>
<string name="80532">Are we talking about the same Torias?</string>
<string name="80533">I did have to threaten to break all of his fingers once. He&apos;s been a perfect gentleman ever since, I assure you.</string>
<string name="80534">I&apos;ll have to remember that trick. My cousin can be a bit of a handful.</string>
<string name="80535">Well, your big half-orc friend is right here as you can obviously see. He&apos;s rather hard to miss.</string>
<string name="80536">Pfah. The &quot;big half-orc&quot; has a name, little squishable halfling girl.</string>
<string name="80537">I know I&apos;ve thought of a few.</string>
<string name="80538">That is funny. Xanos will remember to laugh when a giant desert bird swoops down and carries you off to become a very tiny snack.</string>
<string name="80539">Keep it up, sorcerer, and you can sleep with the oxen.</string>
<string name="80540">I did. Haven&apos;t you seen him? My first impulse was that it wouldn&apos;t be a good idea considering the trouble we had earlier... but this fellow seems pretty earnest.</string>
<string name="80541">Not only that, he seemed pretty desperate to hire on. I&apos;m paying him almost nothing... although his cooking skills have been pretty questionable. I suppose you get what you pay for.</string>
<string name="80542">That&apos;s it. I&apos;d almost forgotten. He spends all day with Daschnaya, so I&apos;ve barely seen him... she seems to have taken a shine to the creature, oddly enough.</string>
<string name="80543">I&apos;m surprised you haven&apos;t spotted him. He mentioned you several times when we first spoke.</string>
<string name="80544">Oh, something about you being a great hero and how he wanted to be just like you. It was cute, actually.</string>
<string name="80545">I must admit, it took awhile before I got accustomed to it. You&apos;ve got more on your mind than just traveling, however, I suppose.</string>
<string name="80546">If you like. You might want to wait until the morning, however, as mostly everyone&apos;s retired for the evening. It&apos;s up to you.</string>
<string name="80547">Not now!</string>
<string name="80548">Those? Stingers, they&apos;re called. Half man, half scorpion. I haven&apos;t seen them on the last two trips through... it was too much to hope that I&apos;d never see them again, I see.</string>
<string name="80549">But that&apos;s not important, right now. Have you see Zidan or not?!</string>
<string name="80550">No, he&apos;s not! He was out here, fighting... I saw him! Damn it anyway, we *need* him in order to cross the desert!</string>
<string name="80551">I don&apos;t mean to sound uncaring, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but the plain fact is that we *need* Zidan in order to cross the desert!</string>
<string name="80552">You might not care either way, but that doesn&apos;t change the fact that we *need* him! How else are we supposed to cross the desert?!</string>
<string name="80553">Torias! Is there any sign of him?!</string>
<string name="80554">Ah, where is that drunkard of a brother? Oh, I see him. Maybe he is looking for Zidan, too.</string>
<string name="80555">Nope. Nothin&apos;. He&apos;s just up an&apos; vanished, as near as I can tell.</string>
<string name="80556">Damn it! I knew this was too good to be true! We can&apos;t go anywhere without our guide or we&apos;ll be lost for sure!!</string>
<string name="80557">Split up my men so that the stingers can pick them off one by one? Not on your life, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We don&apos;t do things that way.</string>
<string name="80558">Let me put it this way: we can head back to Blacksands and hope we don&apos;t get lost en route and delay our trip by about a week hiring a new guide.</string>
<string name="80559">Or you can volunteer yourself to go and look for Zidan and pray to the gods that those stingers haven&apos;t torn him apart for a late-night snack. Your choice.</string>
<string name="80560">Good. I&apos;m glad that&apos;s settled. Should you need any supplies, by the way, I have plenty to sell you now.</string>
<string name="80561">Excellent. We&apos;ll keep an eye out for you. Don&apos;t take any foolish risks unless you absolutely have to.</string>
<string name="80562">Oh, and don&apos;t expect to be sneaking up on the stingers, from what I have been told, they have a special ability to detect vibrations, so they will know you are coming.</string>
<string name="80563">You mean like chasing after poisonous creatures into their own lair in the middle of an unfamiliar desert?</string>
<string name="80564">You mean besides the foolish risk we are already undertaking.</string>
<string name="80565">Correct. I&apos;m glad we understand each other.</string>
<string name="80566">Is that so? There&apos;s something wrong with earning &lt;CUSTOM1010&gt; gold, I suppose? What did you have in mind?</string>
<string name="80567">Don&apos;t mind if I do.</string>
<string name="80568">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Alright, then. Have it your way... *another* 100 gold on top of your reward. You drive a hard bargain.</string>
<string name="80569">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I don&apos;t think you really need any more incentive than you already have. Off you go.</string>
<string name="80570">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. Fine, fine. Another 100 gold it is. You&apos;re robbing me blind, however, you know that?</string>
<string name="80571">I trust that&apos;s finally enough for you. Now... don&apos;t you have a guide to find?</string>
<string name="80572">Be that as it may, gold is all I really have to offer. Take it or leave it.</string>
<string name="80573">So that&apos;s the way it is, is it? Sorry, but unless you can turn into a halfling on the spot, there&apos;s just no future between us. Let&apos;s keep our mind on business, shall we?</string>
<string name="80574">You&apos;re not bad for a halfling, but let&apos;s keep our mind on business, shall we? I don&apos;t like to get the two mixed up.</string>
<string name="80575">I&apos;d sooner kiss a stinger. Let&apos;s keep our mind on business, shall we?</string>
<string name="80576">Oh no you don&apos;t. I&apos;m paying you all I can afford to. Try to milk any more out of me and it&apos;ll be more profitable to turn around and head back to Blacksands, it will.</string>
<string name="80577">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I really don&apos;t like the possibility of a delay any more than you do... but I&apos;m hardly in a position to be throwing about gold.</string>
<string name="80578">How about this: I&apos;ll give you five hundred gold if you bring the guide back. Then I&apos;ll talk to him about how much of that is coming out of his own pay.</string>
<string name="80579">That&apos;s enough of a reward, isn&apos;t it? Now, is there something else?</string>
<string name="80580">Oh? What might those be?</string>
<string name="80581">Very well. Anything else you&apos;d like?</string>
<string name="80582">Not really. Just don&apos;t go out there alone... and speak to Daschnaya if you get hurt. She can mend you up just fine, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="80583">I don&apos;t. I&apos;ve heard, however, that stingers take slaves... we can only hope that was their intent. At least they&apos;d keep him alive.</string>
<string name="80584">We&apos;re not very far in, but if I were you I wouldn&apos;t pin your hopes on the scenery becoming very varied. That&apos;s why it&apos;s so easy to get lost here... only a native can tell one sand dune from the next.</string>
<string name="80585">More than I&apos;d like. The guides tend to give their hives a wide berth, but the creatures tunnel under the earth and spring up to ambush you.</string>
<string name="80586">Most of them only look like men... really they&apos;re feral and vicious beasts who think only of blood-letting and gathering slaves. Some of them can be quite intelligent, however.</string>
<string name="80587">I&apos;ve heard tell of stinger mages and priests, but I&apos;ve never seen one. All I know is that it&apos;s best to avoid the poison in their tail... deadly stuff, that.</string>
<string name="80588">Daschnaya made some antidotes once that might work. Try talking to her. Oh... and if you manage to kill any of those stingers, feel free to bring me their poison glands. Worth a pretty coin, they are.</string>
<string name="80589">For the usual. Slaves. Food. Bounty. Where one of us ranks on that list I really couldn&apos;t say... I&apos;ve never heard tell of anyone escaping them before.</string>
<string name="80590">That&apos;s a good question. I explained to your Master Drogan that there&apos;s no guarantee that your friend Garrick will still be where we dropped him off, but he seemed unconcerned.</string>
<string name="80591">About a week&apos;s travel into the desert, there&apos;s a small temple encampment that we tend to stop at. Worshippers of Ao... harmless folk, really.</string>
<string name="80592">This Garrick fellow seemed to think that was where he needed to be. Talked a lot about &quot;excavations&quot; and similar kinds of work.</string>
<string name="80593">I think he was on the lookout for ruins dating back to the old Netheril Empire, actually. Your Master Drogan said he&apos;s something of an expert on the topic... I&apos;m not surprised.</string>
<string name="80594">No doubt it will require even more mindless wandering in the desert once we get there. Hmph.</string>
<string name="80595">No doubt. But that&apos;s not my responsibility.</string>
<string name="80596">Master Drogan said he knew this man Garrick, so we&apos;ll have to trust that he knows best.</string>
<string name="80597">Sure thing. Watch the sticky fingers, however... I have enough trouble keeping my eyes on Torias.</string>
<string name="80598">This is your show, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and not mine. I didn&apos;t ask you to come along, remember? I have to make a living and not give all my goods away for free.</string>
<string name="80599">You may be a halfling, but you&apos;re not my cousin or my &lt;brother/sister&gt;, are you? I have to make a living and not give my goods away for free.</string>
<string name="80600">With that said, I&apos;m sure I can come up with a reasonable discount for you, seeing as I&apos;d rather see Zidan saved than not. Fair enough?</string>
<string name="80601">As I see it, you&apos;re the one who needs to find that fellow we dropped off so badly. We&apos;re not the ones in a rush to get across the desert.</string>
<string name="80602">So you can either get off your backside and earn your keep or you can sit tight and accept the delay. That&apos;s not blackmail, that&apos;s just the way it is.</string>
<string name="80603">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; None of us get exactly what we want, now, do we? Isn&apos;t this the sort of adventuring you like to do anyway? So go to it... adventure!</string>
<string name="80604">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I really don&apos;t like the possibility of a delay any more than you do... but I&apos;m hardly in a position to be throwing about gold.</string>
<string name="80605">How about this: I&apos;ll give you five hundred gold if you bring the guide back. Then I&apos;ll talk to him about how much of that is coming out of his own pay.</string>
<string name="80606">So I trust that&apos;s settled, then? Should you need any supplies, by the way, I have plenty in store to sell you now.</string>
<string name="80607">Take one of your friends from the school. That&apos;s what they&apos;re here for, aren&apos;t they? Or take that kobold, Deekin, with you... he seems eager enough.</string>
<string name="80608">But I need everyone else here to guard the caravan in case those things decide to come back. You won&apos;t begrudge us that, I hope.</string>
<string name="80609">I really don&apos;t know. But there has to be some evidence around that shows where the stingers came from, doesn&apos;t there?</string>
<string name="80610">I don&apos;t propose that it will be an easy task to find Zidan and bring him back, but what choice do we have, really?</string>
<string name="80611">You know a little about tracking and such, don&apos;t you? Find out where the stingers came from, follow them back to their lair!</string>
<string name="80612">Yes, of course, but none of us are natives! The Anauroch Desert is huge! Unless you want to risk wandering off to your death, you have a guide with you!</string>
<string name="80613">What? Why not?! Don&apos;t just leave him out there... we need him!</string>
<string name="80614">You found him? Then you&apos;ll have to go back! Quickly, go!</string>
<string name="80615">That&apos;s progress, at least. Keep on looking... he must be in there somewhere.</string>
<string name="80616">Damn. Well... what can I do to help?</string>
<string name="80617">I would not advise that, Madame Katriana.</string>
<string name="80618">Neither would I, to be honest. It&apos;s good to have you back... none the worse for your experience, I see.</string>
<string name="80619">That is true. The thanks must go to &lt;FirstName&gt; for that.</string>
<string name="80620">True enough. Well, &lt;FirstName&gt;... you rescued Zidan, as you said you would. I suppose you&apos;ll be wanting your &lt;CUSTOM1010&gt; gold?</string>
<string name="80621">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Fine, fine... though I&apos;ll point out we *did* have a deal., and that all this urgency to cross the desert is your doing, not mine!</string>
<string name="80622">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The offer was &lt;CUSTOM1010&gt; gold and you&apos;ll get &lt;CUSTOM1010&gt; gold and not a copper more. No hard feelings, but business is business.</string>
<string name="80623">As for you, Zidan, we&apos;ll have to discuss just what your rescue is worth in relation to our deal...</string>
<string name="80624">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose so... even though we *did* have a deal, as you&apos;ll recall. I&apos;m grateful, however, so I&apos;ll overlook that.</string>
<string name="80625">So here, then... &lt;CUSTOM1010&gt; gold. Hopefully I&apos;ll make up for that in trade. We&apos;ll also need to discuss what your rescue is worth in relation to our deal, Zidan.</string>
<string name="80626">I... I... yes, of course, Madame Katriana...</string>
<string name="80627">But... but I have already paid &lt;FirstName&gt; for my rescue!</string>
<string name="80628">That&apos;s between you and &lt;him/her&gt;, isn&apos;t it? It doesn&apos;t have anything to do with me... or your fee, as the case may be.</string>
<string name="80629">Now, then... I trust we&apos;re ready to move on? &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="80630">Right, then. Don&apos;t take all day, though... I don&apos;t need to wait until something else descends upon us here. Tell me when you&apos;re done.</string>
<string name="80631">Good. Torias, what&apos;s the delay?! Why aren&apos;t we moving yet?!</string>
<string name="80632">And here I was enjoying this relaxing stop of ours...</string>
<string name="80633">I said move it, lazy bones! Everyone on your feet... we leave NOW!</string>
<string name="80634">What?! After all those demands and such? You&apos;re a strange one, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I&apos;ll give you that. I&apos;ll take it, though, and give you my thanks.</string>
<string name="80635">And you, Zidan, are one lucky man. That reward was going to come out of your pay.</string>
<string name="80636">You... are too kind, Madame Katriana...</string>
<string name="80637">Don&apos;t I know it.</string>
<string name="80638">&lt;StartAction&gt;[snicker!]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80639">I can find you something to do, cousin, if you&apos;ve got enough spare time to be eavesdropping.</string>
<string name="80640">Err... but I have already given much of my gold to &lt;FirstName&gt;...</string>
<string name="80641">Well that sounds appropriate somehow, don&apos;t you think? It was &lt;FirstName&gt; who risked &lt;his/her&gt; neck to save you.</string>
<string name="80642">True enough. Well, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you rescued Zidan just as I&apos;d hoped you would. I suppose you&apos;ll be wanting a reward?</string>
<string name="80643">Fair enough. How does &lt;CUSTOM1010&gt; gold grab you?</string>
<string name="80644">Fair enough. You, my dear Zidan, are one lucky man... that reward was going to come out of your pay.</string>
<string name="80645">Oh. Fair enough, I suppose... you&apos;re a kind &lt;man/woman&gt;. You have my sincere thanks in return.</string>
<string name="80646">Hmph. I suppose you&apos;re right... though I hate over-paying the help. Here, then, Zidan. For all the trouble.</string>
<string name="80647">Thank you kindly, Madame Katriana. And you, as well, &lt;FirstName&gt;... this is most unexpected.</string>
<string name="80648">Yes, well... we&apos;re just glad that you&apos;re safe, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="80649">When did I become invisible? &lt;FirstName&gt; wasn&apos;t the only one there, you know.</string>
<string name="80650">Of course, my lady. You have my apologies... I did not mean to exclude you.</string>
<string name="80651">Oh yes. Let&apos;s forget the half-orc was at all involved, shall we? Bah.</string>
<string name="80652">My apologies, sir. Of course you deserve my gratitude, as well.</string>
<string name="80653">I&apos;ll be fine. Don&apos;t worry about me.</string>
<string name="80654">And if I&apos;m not alright? What are you going to do about it?</string>
<string name="80655">Do you think there&apos;s going to be trouble?</string>
<string name="80656">Where are my companions?</string>
<string name="80657">Did you say you hired a kobold?</string>
<string name="80658">Is his name Deekin?</string>
<string name="80659">He did? What did he say?</string>
<string name="80660">I should get some sleep.</string>
<string name="80661">Bah. I hate this desert.</string>
<string name="80662">Maybe I should go and speak to him.</string>
<string name="80663">Wait one second... what *were* those creatures?!</string>
<string name="80664">I don&apos;t know. Is he in one of the wagons?</string>
<string name="80665">Thank you for the personal concern and gratitude.</string>
<string name="80666">Who cares? He probably fell in battle.</string>
<string name="80667">Do you want me to look for him?</string>
<string name="80668">Go and look for him, then, if you&apos;re so worried.</string>
<string name="80669">We&apos;ll just have to make do without him, won&apos;t we?</string>
<string name="80670">Very well. I will do what I can.</string>
<string name="80671">I should be going.</string>
<string name="80672">I think we need to re-negotiate my reward, first.</string>
<string name="80673">Forget about it.</string>
<string name="80674">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I want another 100 gold.</string>
<string name="80675">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I want another 100 gold.</string>
<string name="80676">I think we still need to negotiate.</string>
<string name="80677">I want something in return besides just gold.</string>
<string name="80678">I was thinking about something a little more personal...</string>
<string name="80679">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I could use a little incentive from you for this mission.</string>
<string name="80680">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="80681">I have no more questions.</string>
<string name="80682">Do you have any advice for me?</string>
<string name="80683">How do you know this Zidan isn&apos;t dead?</string>
<string name="80684">What can you tell me about this desert?</string>
<string name="80685">What do you know about these stingers?</string>
<string name="80686">Is there anything that can counter that poison?</string>
<string name="80687">Why would they have attacked the caravan?</string>
<string name="80688">Just where will I find Garrick, anyway?</string>
<string name="80689">What kinds of excavations? Did he say?</string>
<string name="80690">Show me what you have in stock.</string>
<string name="80691">I have to *buy* my supplies off of you?</string>
<string name="80692">I don&apos;t appreciate being blackmailed into helping.</string>
<string name="80693">Fine. You don&apos;t leave me much choice.</string>
<string name="80694">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I could use a little incentive.</string>
<string name="80695">I don&apos;t suppose I get any help in this, do I?</string>
<string name="80696">Just how am I supposed to look for him?</string>
<string name="80697">Wait a second, I thought you&apos;d been across this desert before?</string>
<string name="80698">I rescued Zidan, but haven&apos;t brought him back yet.</string>
<string name="80699">I found Zidan, but I haven&apos;t been able to rescue him yet.</string>
<string name="80700">I&apos;ve found the stingers&apos; caverns, but no sign of Zidan yet.</string>
<string name="80701">No, I haven&apos;t found him yet.</string>
<string name="80702">Sounds good to me.</string>
<string name="80703">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; This was harder than I&apos;d bargained for. I want compensation... now.</string>
<string name="80704">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think I deserve a bit more than that, don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="80705">I have something to do, first.</string>
<string name="80706">Yes, let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="80707">Forget about it. We can leave, now... that&apos;s good enough for me.</string>
<string name="80708">You&apos;re damned right I do.</string>
<string name="80709">We can leave, now... that&apos;s reward enough for me.</string>
<string name="80710">Getting Zidan back alive is reward enough.</string>
<string name="80711">Give it to Zidan. He deserves it for what he&apos;s been through.</string>
<string name="80712">Talona grant us victory!!</string>
<string name="80713">Hsss!! Perish!!</string>
<string name="80714">Fool! Here you shall die!</string>
<string name="80715">You shall be sacrificed to the Lady of Poison!</string>
<string name="80716">The Lady of Poison shall drink your blood!</string>
<string name="80717">Hsss! You will die in agony!</string>
<string name="80718">Talona shall have your soul!</string>
<string name="80719">Mm. I could go for some water. It seems my flask has nothing but wine in it... I wonder who did that?</string>
<string name="80720">Eh. Don&apos;t mind me. Maybe you should be talking to Katriana... she&apos;s getting that look like she&apos;s about to explode, you know?</string>
<string name="80721">Do you have sand in your ears? I think I have sand in my ears. I hate the bloody desert.</string>
<string name="80722">Now that&apos;s a shame. Guide&apos;s gone missin&apos;, here we are stuck in the middle of the desert at the mercy of scorpion men... sounds like it&apos;s time for a drink.</string>
<string name="80723">Hmmmn. Can&apos;t say I&apos;ve ever gotten drunk much with &lt;race&gt; folk like yourself. Tried some &lt;race&gt; ale once. Vile stuff, no offense. Blech.</string>
<string name="80724">You know, I had a woodsy acquaintance once much like yourself. Had a knack for turning tree sap into a swill that would lay me flat for a week. Wonderful chap.</string>
<string name="80725">Heh... last time a saw a magely type like yourself drink, we had to clear the entire bar after he tried to light his pipe. You know... drunken fireball and such.</string>
<string name="80726">I must admit, I would&apos;ve thought you holy types to be a bit more stodgy about the spirits. You know... that whole holier-than-thou bit. Good to see that isn&apos;t the case.</string>
<string name="80727">Would you believe Katriana doesn&apos;t drink? Not even a fine ale. She&apos;s not like you and me, aye... I say let halflings be halflings!</string>
<string name="80728">You know... come to think of it, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen elves drink anything other than honeydew-smelling stuff. But they must, I suppose... they make a lovely wine.</string>
<string name="80729">You know, I&apos;ve always liked getting drunk with a decent gnome. Not that there are many. Decent gnomes, I mean... there&apos;s plenty of them other kinds.</string>
<string name="80730">And remain hyper-conscious for all the fear and paranoia that&apos;s sure to set in while we&apos;re waitin&apos; on you? No thanks. This seems quite called for, thank you very much.</string>
<string name="80731">Pfft. Now you&apos;re starting to sound like Katriana. Personally, there&apos;s not much else that I&apos;d *want* to think about.</string>
<string name="80732">Ahhh. Now that&apos;s what I call a remedy for danger.</string>
<string name="80733">Now then. What can I do for such a lovely lady such as yourself?</string>
<string name="80734">Yep. I&apos;ll raise a toast for you while you&apos;re gone. Best keep your hopes up and not assume that guide is all bloated and poisoned-like by now, eh?</string>
<string name="80735">Stay here, stay drunk. We&apos;ll make our way back to Blacksands eventually. But, then, you&apos;re in kind of a hurry, aren&apos;t you? Very sad, really.</string>
<string name="80736">Eccchh... not much. Poisonous as a desert viper, though, I&apos;ll tell you that. You can cut out those glands, by the way. Worth good gold, they are.</string>
<string name="80737">Hah! I&apos;d like nothing better, actually. But Katriana&apos;d have my hide. She wants me here guarding the caravan, an&apos; not wandering off doing something interesting for once.</string>
<string name="80738">An&apos; besides... it looks like you&apos;ve got all the help you can handle between that snarly half-orc an&apos; that fine dwarven lass. Mmm, I like her.</string>
<string name="80739">And then there&apos;s always that eager kobold Katriana hired on. I could use him away from dinner for a while... you take my meaning?</string>
<string name="80740">And Deekin! You not forgets about help you gets from Deekin!</string>
<string name="80741">You hired on that smelly little cook? That&apos;s a new one.</string>
<string name="80742">Deekin is good cook!</string>
<string name="80743">I don&apos;t even want to know what was in that soup last night. Maybe it&apos;s best that &lt;FirstName&gt; takes you with, you take my meaning?</string>
<string name="80744">Yes. Deekin gets to be great hero!</string>
<string name="80745">Right, right. Off you go, then.</string>
<string name="80746">You&apos;re too kind, Torias.</string>
<string name="80747">Mmmn. And that form-fitting leather of yours. Yup, I like that, too.</string>
<string name="80748">I take it back.</string>
<string name="80749">Who are you calling snarly, little pipsqueak?</string>
<string name="80750">Well... you, actually.</string>
<string name="80751">That is good. Just so long as we are clear, you and I.</string>
<string name="80752">Eh. Not much. Katriana&apos;s a fine cousin, but she tries to keep me working from dawn to dusk, you know? But the caravan&apos;s not so bad, I s&apos;pose.</string>
<string name="80753">If you ever need some goods of the not-so-legitimate kind... you know who to talk to. Never mind the vanilla stock Katriana sells.</string>
<string name="80754">Oh... here and there. You know. A bit from this town, a bit from that village. It&apos;s all good.</string>
<string name="80755">You want to see what Torias has in his booty bag, eh? Well, alright... just not a word to the cousin or that&apos;s it for my side business.</string>
<string name="80756">Now then. What can I do for such a fine lad such as yourself?</string>
<string name="80757">Hmmn. I knew another bard, once, who actually sang better after a bottle or two of elven wine. Offended everyone in the room, for sure, but he sounded good.</string>
<string name="80758">Hmmn. I once knew this monk who believed drunkeness was next to godliness. Didn&apos;t bathe much, either. Had a wicked belch, though.</string>
<string name="80759">Hmmn. I remember a certain rogue who got so drunk he fell off a roof in mid-heist. Not, ummm, anyone you would know or anything...</string>
<string name="80760">Hmmn. I remember this ranger who I used to share an ale with. He put an arrow in the mayor&apos;s backside by accident. Laughed all the way to the stockade, he did.</string>
<string name="80761">Hmmn. I remember this druid who would magically grow grapes in the grove and make the best wine. They found him in a vat one morning. Sad, really.</string>
<string name="80762">Hmmn. We had this dwarven barbarian who came into town when I was growing up. Acquired a secret fixation for gnomish brandy. Sad case, really.</string>
<string name="80763">Hah! I knew a warrior once who refused to go into battle unless he was tanked up on dwarven ale. Then he&apos;d pass out and the enemy&apos;d think he was dead. Lived a long time, though.</string>
<string name="80764">Hmmn. I knew a paladin once who had a little fixation for mead. Seems someone told him nothing so sweet could be alcoholic. Not the brightest fellow, I&apos;ll admit. Kept falling off his horse.</string>
<string name="80765">Hmmn. I knew a priest once who we used to find on the steps of Brandobaris&apos;s temple every twelve-day. Gave good sermons. On the other days, I mean.</string>
<string name="80766">Aye? Then here... I have an extra flask. Don&apos;t tell Katriana it came from me, however.</string>
<string name="80767">Aye? You haven&apos;t dug up that guide yet, eh? No, I s&apos;pose I&apos;d have heard about that by now.</string>
<string name="80768">Well I&apos;ll be a wee skinned kitty. You&apos;re alive after all, Zidan!</string>
<string name="80769">This is true. I am alive... and grateful.</string>
<string name="80770">No offense, but I sort of thought you&apos;d be a bloated corpse with a bunch of scorpion kiddies sucking the bodily fluids out of you by now. Gosh, lucky.</string>
<string name="80771">Err... yes... that is quite an image you conjure...</string>
<string name="80772">Well, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you&apos;d best trot him over to Katriana. Maybe she&apos;ll actually stop to breathe, for once.</string>
<string name="80773">You bet I am. Short on spirits, too... I&apos;m eager to find the next outpost.</string>
<string name="80774">Err... I&apos;m sure Katriana will want to see Zidan, ya know.</string>
<string name="80775">Well, are we going to be underway yet? What&apos;s the catch? I&apos;m short on spirits here!</string>
<string name="80776">If you wish. It doesn&apos;t bother me.</string>
<string name="80777">Don&apos;t you think you should stay sharp, just in case?</string>
<string name="80778">Drink? Is that all you can think about?</string>
<string name="80779">I should go.</string>
<string name="80780">Do you have any advice for me?</string>
<string name="80781">Do you know anything about these stingers?</string>
<string name="80782">How would you like to join me to look for the guide?</string>
<string name="80783">Just what do you do around here, anyway?</string>
<string name="80784">And just where do you get your goods?</string>
<string name="80785">I&apos;d like to see what you have for sale.</string>
<string name="80786">I&apos;ll join you, if you don&apos;t mind.</string>
<string name="80787">Perhaps you&apos;re right.</string>
<string name="80788">Greetings. I am most pleased to be the one who shall lead this caravan through the great desert. My name is Zidan.</string>
<string name="80789">I... I am free! Oh, what sheer relief! I am forever grateful to you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;! How can such a rescue ever be repaid?</string>
<string name="80790">It was a close thing. The creatures were about to sacrifice me to their dread goddess... in a manner I would not wish on my worst enemy.</string>
<string name="80791">Please... I will follow you out of this place. I saw very little when I was dragged in, I do not think I can find my way out on my own.</string>
<string name="80792">Really? Xanos can not think of many things he would not wish on his worst enemies.</string>
<string name="80793">Then it is fortunate we came when we did. You are a lucky man.</string>
<string name="80794">I agree whole-heartedly, my lady. I will feel safer, however, once we have returned to the caravan.</string>
<string name="80795">Really? What kind of way is that? Deekin needs to know... he gots to write it down.</string>
<string name="80796">I would rather not think of it, kobold.</string>
<string name="80797">Okay. Deekin just makes something up, then. He just thinks back to what Old Master would do... and that is lots, let Deekin tells you.</string>
<string name="80798">I... I have only the gold Madame Katriana forwarded me when I was hired. These scorpion creatures saw no need to take it, I suppose. It... it is not much, however.</string>
<string name="80799">There is no need to threaten my life, &lt;sir/madam&gt;... I know what you have done for me. It is just that... the only other thing I possess is an heirloom of my family line...</string>
<string name="80800">As... as you wish. Here, the heirloom and gold both.</string>
<string name="80801">That is it? Bah! If we did not need you to guide us out of this forsaken desert, I would recommend to &lt;FirstName&gt; that &lt;he/she&gt; kill you anyway.</string>
<string name="80802">I don&apos;t mind lifting a few coins now and then from those who can spare it, but &lt;FirstName&gt;... really, isn&apos;t this beneath you?</string>
<string name="80803">Dibs! Dibs on gold! Deekin calls dibs!</string>
<string name="80804">Then take it. It would not have meant anything had I been killed, no?</string>
<string name="80805">Ummm... be easier to collect, though, maybe.</string>
<string name="80806">I am grateful never the less. If you had not arrived when you did, the creatures would surely have sacrificed me to their dread goddess!</string>
<string name="80807">What? You mean she comes and eats you? I needs to know... Deekin gots to write this all down.</string>
<string name="80808">Spare us the melodrama, little man. You are needed to guide us, and that is the only reason you live. Be thankful.</string>
<string name="80809">It appears they worship Talona, the goddess of poison. I can&apos;t imagine her methods of sacrifice are exactly... pleasant.</string>
<string name="80810">Please! I... I am being held here by a... a magical force! Free me, I beg you!</string>
<string name="80811">What would you have of me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="80812">As you wish, but do not be gone for long. I do not wish to be taken by these creatures once more.</string>
<string name="80813">It will be a relief. Lead on.</string>
<string name="80814">I owe you my life, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I shall always be grateful for your assistance.</string>
<string name="80815">No need. I&apos;m just happy you&apos;re unharmed.</string>
<string name="80816">Gold sounds fine, or something better if you have it.</string>
<string name="80817">Then forget it. It&apos;s not worth my time.</string>
<string name="80818">Cough up something better or I kill you here, fool!</string>
<string name="80819">Oh, never mind. This isn&apos;t worth my time.</string>
<string name="80820">Keep it. The gold will have to do.</string>
<string name="80821">That should suffice.</string>
<string name="80822">I will take it anyway.</string>
<string name="80823">I wouldn&apos;t have bothered if you weren&apos;t needed to guide the caravan.</string>
<string name="80824">Never mind.</string>
<string name="80825">Stay here for a moment.</string>
<string name="80826">Come with me now.</string>
<string name="80827">I... I won&apos;t be able to survive much longer!</string>
<string name="80828">They wish to sacrifice me! Please hurry!</string>
<string name="80829">If you have any mercy in your heart, free me!</string>
<string name="80830">You... you are from the caravan! Please, help me! I beg you!</string>
<string name="80831">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80832">Yes, there was a foul taste to dinner last night.</string>
<string name="80833">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80834">Well, nobody ever said that a kobold was a proper cook, but he volunteered.</string>
<string name="80835">Deekin hear that.</string>
<string name="80836">Foul taste? But Deekin uses perfect amount of ox urine, just like mammy did!</string>
<string name="80837">There is no such thing as a wookalar.</string>
<string name="80838">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80839">No, Uncle Duffer was eaten by a manticore, not a wookalar.</string>
<string name="80840">Now that&apos;s not a very nice thing to say to &lt;him/her&gt;.</string>
<string name="80841">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80842">You did too. Don&apos;t blame my hearing everytime I call you out for saying nasty things.</string>
<string name="80843">The Bedine&apos;re not so bad. You just don&apos;t like their camels.</string>
<string name="80844">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80845">No, I guess the hungry Bedine must have killed all the camels. I guess the nomads are good for something after all.</string>
<string name="80846">Watch your tongue there, Birgen. It&apos;s not him that smells, it&apos;s you.</string>
<string name="80847">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80848">Once we get access to the water, I&apos;m going to soak your head for a bit.</string>
<string name="80849">What do you think are worse, stingers or ill-tempered dwarves?</string>
<string name="80850">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80851">Yes, it is more acceptable to smack a stinger with a hammer.</string>
<string name="80852">I promise, if you continue to make rude comments about me, you will find out just how much worse a dwarf can be.</string>
<string name="80853">That half-orc nearly squashed me flat last night when I went to bed.</string>
<string name="80854">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80855">What do you mean it was an ox? Oh, I guess that&apos;s what the smell was.</string>
<string name="80856">I did no such thing and I resent the accusation!</string>
<string name="80857">Crimeny! This trip through the desert&apos;s taking a long time!</string>
<string name="80858">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80859">If you&apos;re so thirsty, mister grumbles, why don&apos;t you go deal with the problem? I didn&apos;t think so.</string>
<string name="80860">Hope we can get to that water soon.</string>
<string name="80861">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80862">Quiet, you. The sooner we get underway, the sooner we&apos;ll get to the Ao encampment.</string>
<string name="80863">So we got the water we need? That&apos;s a relief.</string>
<string name="80864">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80865">So what? There&apos;s nothing wrong with wanting a bath. You should try it yourself sometime, brother.</string>
<string name="80866">I see you have returned. Have you gotten permission to take their water?</string>
<string name="80867">It should not be this difficult, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Please hurry. I do not wish to linger here.</string>
<string name="80868">Holy Yondalla, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I give you the simplest of jobs and already you have forgotten?</string>
<string name="80869">Go to the Bedine and negotiate for water for our caravan. Please. I hope I do not have to write this down for you!</string>
<string name="80870">Good luck.</string>
<string name="80871">Ummm... Deekin gots notes here, somewhere, just holds on...</string>
<string name="80872">Never mind that, kobold. I am perfectly capable of reminding &lt;him/her&gt;.</string>
<string name="80873">You wouldn&apos;t believe the number of blows &lt;FirstName&gt; takes to the head every day. Really it is a wonder &lt;he/she&gt; can remember not to drool most of the time.</string>
<string name="80874">I wonder if that is what is wrong with Torias? No, I suppose that&apos;s just because of the drink.</string>
<string name="80875">Are they still adamant about the ban on the waterhole? That was many years ago! This is simply ridiculous.</string>
<string name="80876">Zombies? I hate undead! Oh, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I... really did not stress how bad our situation is. One of the water barrels was kicked by an oxen on the way here, you see.</string>
<string name="80877">If we can get no water here, we will not have enough to get us through to another oasis. I fear that you are going to have to help the Bedine destroy this Kel Garas.</string>
<string name="80878">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; I hate bullies. I always have. Usually they only act that way because they are compensating for some kind of weakness.</string>
<string name="80879">Sometimes a good leader must act the role of a bully, when it is in the best interests of a larger goal.</string>
<string name="80880">Maybe, but sometimes a good leader accepts that he or she cannot win every battle.</string>
<string name="80881">You never mets the Old Master, then.</string>
<string name="80882">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; I hate bullies. I always have. Usually they only act that way because they are compensating for some kind of weakness.</string>
<string name="80883">You never mets the Old Master, then.</string>
<string name="80884">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; If I truly thought it would make the difference between life and death for you, I would certainly do so, but I have every confidence in your abilities.</string>
<string name="80885">However, I will give you this potion for free. It may come in quite useful if you are facing undead. That is as far as my generosity stretches.</string>
<string name="80886">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; If I truly thought it would make the difference between life and death for you, I would certainly do so, but I have every confidence in your abilities.</string>
<string name="80887">However, I am willing to let you have several potions that I imagine you will find useful. That is as far as my generosity stretches.</string>
<string name="80888">If I thought you would possibly not succeed, I would of course make everything available. Luckily for my purse, I have the fullest confidence in your abilities.</string>
<string name="80889">I will, of course, give you the best prices I can, considering the difficult market.</string>
<string name="80890">That is a poor excuse for being tightfisted. Surely you could just... lend us some magical artifacts?</string>
<string name="80891">And you can just lend me some gold in return. Why, I&apos;ll even let you keep such items, and I&apos;ll just keep the gold.</string>
<string name="80892">You talks like Deekin thinks, halfling lady. Great hero do anything, and kicks butt too.</string>
<string name="80893">Yes, well... so I&apos;ve seen. I&apos;ll admit that &lt;he/she&gt;&apos;s been earning &lt;his/her&gt; fare on the caravan so far.</string>
<string name="80894">You means that barrel Deekin accidentally... ummm,  never minds...</string>
<string name="80895">And whose bright idea was it to put the water barrels within kicking range of the stupid beasts?</string>
<string name="80896">Watch your tone, Xanos! When an ox gets an idea in its skull, nothing stops it.</string>
<string name="80897">That is wonderful to hear, though it certainly took you long enough. Well, let us know if you&apos;re ready to continue on, and we&apos;ll collect what water we need and go.</string>
<string name="80898">Right. We&apos;ll wait until you&apos;re ready, then.</string>
<string name="80899">Good. I, for one, would like to reach the Ao encampment as quickly as possible. Let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="80900">We could be in some trouble, friend. The oxen have gone through the water rations much faster than expected. There is an oasis near here, but we have had some trouble with the tribe that guards it.</string>
<string name="80901">You have a way of dealing with problems that I seem to lack. If you could just go and talk to the Bedine, maybe they would allow us to restock our water supplies.</string>
<string name="80902">If you would rather not feel the dry sand in your mouth as your body is wracked with the pain that is dying of thirst, then bloody well do as I say. It is a simple task.</string>
<string name="80903">To us it seemed a simple thing; to allow our oxen to walk into the water hole. It was our first time crossing the desert and we did not know the proper customs.</string>
<string name="80904">We were never welcomed back, though we would never do such a thing again. We need this water, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="80905">They poops in water, maybe?</string>
<string name="80906">Nothing so distateful, no. The Bedine consider the oasis something of a sacred place, however. It&apos;s tied into their local history, somehow.</string>
<string name="80907">It doesn&apos;t seem that difficult to predict that others might become upset when your beasts of burden empty their bladders in their water hole.</string>
<string name="80908">Not now, but we had been at another oasis where the animals and Bedine bathed in the water.</string>
<string name="80909">Hah! I suppose I should be a little upset if your beasts relieved themselves in my water supply too. That is why Xanos always prepares for the worst.</string>
<string name="80910">Are you saying you have water left?</string>
<string name="80911">I should certainly think so... &lt;StartAction&gt;[Shakes his canteen.]&lt;/Start&gt; That is... strange. I could have sworn Xanos had some left.</string>
<string name="80912">Anyways, the Bedine consider the oasis something of a sacred place. It&apos;s tied into their local history, somehow.</string>
<string name="80913">Good. Return as soon as possible. It would be a good thing if we were able to continue tomorrow morning.</string>
<string name="80914">Best of luck.</string>
<string name="80915">Certainly. Gold is always welcome.</string>
<string name="80916">I&apos;m eager to collect our water and be out of here. Are you ready to go?</string>
<string name="80917">Not yet.</string>
<string name="80918">What was I supposed to do again?</string>
<string name="80919">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="80920">There is a problem.</string>
<string name="80921">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Tell her about Kel Garas.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80922">I will be going. </string>
<string name="80923">I would like to make a purchase. </string>
<string name="80924">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Your life is on the line here too. Refuse to help me and death might come swifter than you expect.</string>
<string name="80925">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Don&apos;t you think I should have free access to anything that could help us?</string>
<string name="80926">Should you not allow me full, free access to your wares, then?</string>
<string name="80927">We can use the water.</string>
<string name="80928">I have some things to do.</string>
<string name="80929">I&apos;m ready to go now.</string>
<string name="80930">Get your own water.</string>
<string name="80931">What kind of problems did you have with them?</string>
<string name="80932">I will try.</string>
<string name="80933">I will be going.</string>
<string name="80934">I would like to make a purchase.</string>
<string name="80935">Yes, let&apos;s go.</string>
<string name="80936">When evil grows unchecked, then shall one destroy the guardians and prove &lt;his/her&gt; worth to wield the Desert&apos;s Fury.</string>
<string name="80937">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[This altar seems to suck the very light from the room. From markings, runes and graven images you can tell this is an altar to the dark god Jergal.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80938">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the altar alone.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80939">&lt;StartAction&gt;Spit on the altar.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80940">&lt;StartAction&gt;Pretend to pray faithfully.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80941">&lt;StartAction&gt;Pray faithfully.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80942">Eh, my head really hurts. A little water would be nice about now. Or some wine. Come to think of it, I might even be willing to drown myself in a barrel of orcish ale.</string>
<string name="80943">I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m already out. Once we get permission to go up to the water hole, I&apos;m going to scavenge for some more... supplies. Katrina will be too busy to complain.</string>
<string name="80944">Come back soon, preferably with a vat of wine.</string>
<string name="80945">Thanks, I&apos;ll stay here and guard the oxen. You never know when a Bedine warrior will get hungry, and then watch out!</string>
<string name="80946">They make a very foul brew, but if you don&apos;t have anything else, it&apos;s better than being sober. That&apos;s about the extent of my knowledge, although they do have prickly honor. </string>
<string name="80947">Stick to your word until it&apos;s time to run, &lt;FirstName&gt;, that&apos;s my suggestion.</string>
<string name="80948">You not knows much beyond what goes in your mouth, Deekin thinks.</string>
<string name="80949">Well, keep up that wit, kobold, and you won&apos;t know much beyond the dagger that&apos;s in your belly. Hmph.</string>
<string name="80950">Hey, Torias, I think I found a bottle of wine!</string>
<string name="80951">Really? Where is it?</string>
<string name="80952">Oh dear, I was wrong. It&apos;s just a dried-out, useless halfling sot.</string>
<string name="80953">I hate dwarves that think they&apos;re witty.</string>
<string name="80954">You are not of much help, halfling. Perhaps if you drank less your head would be filled with more than fog.</string>
<string name="80955">Ugh... my head hurts so much I can&apos;t even think of a good comeback. Wait... you stink and your mother dresses you funny. That&apos;s the best I can do.</string>
<string name="80956">You show it who&apos;s the daddy?</string>
<string name="80957">Sorry. I wouldn&apos;t have the slightest idea, not being a priest and all. But I would suggest that you do so very carefully. Personally I would rather stay here and get drunk, but I&apos;m all out of wine, so off you go.</string>
<string name="80958">Torias, you aren&apos;t terribly funny when you are sober.</string>
<string name="80959">Ouch! Xanos has heard better jokes from the kobold!</string>
<string name="80960">Ooo! Deekin gots to write that one down!</string>
<string name="80961">Hmph. My head&apos;s pounding too much. You want some advice, look for it amongst my plethora of goods... there&apos;s always something useful in there. Just don&apos;t tell the cousin.</string>
<string name="80962">Don&apos;t get eaten. I&apos;ve always found that to be good, sound, sensible advice.</string>
<string name="80963">You want to see what Torias has in his booty bag, eh? Well, alright... just not a word to the cousin or that&apos;s it for my side business.</string>
<string name="80964">Ehhhh... what now? Can&apos;t ya leave a halfling to his misery?</string>
<string name="80965">I heard ya got us the water we need. Whew... by Brandobaris&apos;s hairy feet! I can&apos;t wait to get out of this desert!</string>
<string name="80966">I should go.</string>
<string name="80967">Why don&apos;t you come with me?</string>
<string name="80968">What do you know about the Bedine?</string>
<string name="80969">How do you kill a mummy?</string>
<string name="80970">Do you have any advice for me?</string>
<string name="80971">I&apos;d like to see what you have for sale.</string>
<string name="80972">So you shall go and negotiate for our water? Good luck to you. I certainly would not want to deal with the Guardian Bedine.</string>
<string name="80973">Be wary, &lt;FirstName&gt;. These are a strange people.</string>
<string name="80974">The Bedine of this oasis are a strange lot. I do not know too much about them, but the rest of the Bedine do not deal with the Guardians. It is said that they are cursed.</string>
<string name="80975">We are a nomadic people, but this tribe lives here on a permanent basis. The legends of our people say that this tribe was once part of us, but one day they appeared here, strange and elusive.</string>
<string name="80976">One day a foolish Bedine nomad decided to steal an heirloom of this tribe. He was caught, and the leader of this tribe cursed him and all other Bedine, so that we can never enter the oasis.</string>
<string name="80977">We call them the guardians, though we do not know what it is they are guarding. You could ask them, but I would do so in a polite way.</string>
<string name="80978">The artifact was very powerful, they said. It had a specific purpose, one that the Bedine could not fulfill, though they never told us what it was. We do not communicate with them anymore.</string>
<string name="80979">We find ourselves getting more nauseous the closer we get. Right now I can feel the effects only slightly. Were I to get much closer I would start to feel cramping in my bowels.</string>
<string name="80980">It is hard to fight an enemy while your body is trying to excrete waste out every opening. An effective curse, you might say.</string>
<string name="80981">I see you have returned. Did you have any luck?</string>
<string name="80982">Yes, be wary. This is a dangerous place.</string>
<string name="80983">That is excellent news. We should be leaving soon then.</string>
<string name="80984">That is horrible. When this caravan has crossed the desert I shall spread the word among my people. Perhaps we will be able to help the survivors, if there are any.</string>
<string name="80985">I will do my best, though I have never been into this oasis before.</string>
<string name="80986">You have done an excellent job. Maybe you have the soul of a Bedine.</string>
<string name="80987">Good bye.</string>
<string name="80988">What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="80989">Why aren&apos;t you doing it? You&apos;re the guide.</string>
<string name="80990">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="80991">Do you know why they stay here?</string>
<string name="80992">Why would they curse all other Bedine?</string>
<string name="80993">What happens if you try to enter the oasis?</string>
<string name="80994">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="80995">We have permission to use the water.</string>
<string name="80996">The Bedine have mostly been slaughtered. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Tell him about the undead.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="80997">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="80998">Why not?</string>
<string name="80999">Greetings to you, stranger. You have come to the Oasis of the Green Palm in a time of great danger. I am afraid there is nothing here for you other than death... and the curse of undeath.</string>
<string name="81000">There is a threat against all who come to this cursed place, but it does not originate with those of my tribe.</string>
<string name="81001">As I said before, there is nothing for you here... least of all the water that once flowed in our oasis. If you do not desire to walk the night without a soul, I suggest you move on.</string>
<string name="81002">A powerful creature, an ancient foe of my people, has once again arisen. He has taken our water, destroyed the temple of the Morninglord, and sent his undead minions against us.</string>
<string name="81003">His minions drag the corpses of my people down into his tomb, where he brings them back to life and sends them to fight us. Our numbers dwindle as his grow... and without even water to sustain us, we shall soon fall.</string>
<string name="81004">No water at all. The creature has dried even the water in my canteen, such is his power. </string>
<string name="81005">Over one hundred of my people have died in the last few days, and you claim this is directed at you? Do not disregard the lives of my people in such a selfish manner.</string>
<string name="81006">If you are completely out of water, then you are correct. Very well, even though this tale is not normally told outside the Bedine I suppose it is only fair that you know of the cursed creature who hunts us both.</string>
<string name="81007">I suppose you face the same death as we do. Very well, even though this tale is not normally told outside the Bedine I suppose it is only fair that you know of the cursed creature who hunts us both.</string>
<string name="81008">His name is Kel-Garas. The legends, passed down from father to son for ages in our tribe, tell us that Kel-Garas hails from an age long past... in the time of the Netheril Empire he was an evil necromancer and disciple to the god, Jergal.</string>
<string name="81009">You must recover the rod that binds Kel-Garas to this mortal plane. Only when it is destroyed on the altar of Lathander will we be truly free of his evil.</string>
<string name="81010">Before you face Kel-Garas in his tomb, I would first suggest you enter the crypt by the oasis. It is the burial place of al-Rashid, my distant ancestor who was the first to gain the power to fight Kel-Garas.</string>
<string name="81011">My ancestor&apos;s weapon lies within... very effective against the undead, though the legends say it failed him in the end and holds no power when wielded by those of our blood. That is why we buried it with him.</string>
<string name="81012">You are not of our blood, obviously. It may be the weapon would work in your hands... and I have little doubt al-Rashid would gladly forgive the intrusion if it meant the death of Kel-Garas.</string>
<string name="81013">Oo! Deekin not of your blood!</string>
<string name="81014">That... is true. I mean no offense, little one, but I would sooner take heart should my ancestor&apos;s weapon find its way into the hands of your &lt;master/mistress&gt;, here.</string>
<string name="81015">A powerful weapon to be weilded against our foe! This is fortuitous, is it not?</string>
<string name="81016">A weapon against the undead? I bet Katriana would pay handsomely for it! If you do not find it useful, &lt;FirstName&gt;, perhaps we should...</string>
<string name="81017">Do not discuss such things in front of me! The weapon is a relic of my ancestors; do not treat it as a common prize, to be bartered away!</string>
<string name="81018">My people have been mostly destroyed and our belongings taken. Whatever you can recover from Kel-Garas, you may keep. You also get the water you desperately need.</string>
<string name="81019">Now we get to the crux of the situation... what do we get besides water?</string>
<string name="81020">It is dead, so it can be of no further aid to us, sadly. But I will tell you all I can.</string>
<string name="81021">Do you need other answers, then?</string>
<string name="81022">My ancestor, al-Rashid, made a bargain with it, as I said.</string>
<string name="81023">Ah, I see. Of course it wanted its freedom, but my ancestor had no knowledge of how to open its Netherese prison.</string>
<string name="81024">So instead my ancestor had to promise that he and his descendants would remain in this valley as keepers... we would watch over Kel-Garas and kill him, if ever we got the opportunity.</string>
<string name="81025">Why the phaerimm wanted this from us, there is no way to know. Perhaps the phaerimm knew of Kel-Garas, or feared him? Either way it wished him dead.</string>
<string name="81026">And so my family, my tribe, has stayed in this valley ever since. We are the Keepers of this oasis; a dark duty that has caused other Bedine to shun us. But such is how it has always been.</string>
<string name="81027">Xanos knows the answer to that; it would want to be free! To be locked in stasis for years would be horrible.</string>
<string name="81028">I believe my power lies in the ability to remove Kel-Garas&apos;s access to his magic, though obviously I have never had the means to test it.</string>
<string name="81029">Inside his tomb, Kel-Garas is safe from me. Were he ever to come out, things would be much different. Or, at least, I hope they would... since my power has diminished, even that is no longer certain.</string>
<string name="81030">It is far away from here, many leagues to the southeast. I would gladly show you the way, but it is a pointless trek now... there is nothing of interest that remains there.</string>
<string name="81031">It was... like nothing I have seen before. Not a demon, nor a humanoid... it seemed more of an ethereal being. Perhaps during the age of Netheril it was a common thing, but certainly no longer.</string>
<string name="81032">I do not know. There was evidence that some force had opened its prison and fought it, but it was long gone, whatever it was.</string>
<string name="81033">Perhaps, but I don&apos;t see how. The prison is many leagues from here, and I suspect the phaerimm was dead long before Kel-Garas&apos;s power began to grow.</string>
<string name="81034">It has nearly been destroyed. Both the temple and my ancestor&apos;s crypt are overrun with zombies. What else can I tell you?</string>
<string name="81035">That crypt is the burial place of al-Rashid, my distant ancestor who was the first to gain the power to fight Kel-Garas. I would suggest you enter the crypt before you go to the tomb.</string>
<string name="81036">My ancestor&apos;s weapon lies within... very effective against the undead, though the legends say it failed him in the end and holds no power when wielded by those of our blood. That is why we buried it with him.</string>
<string name="81037">You are not of our blood, obviously. It may be the weapon would work in your hands... and I have little doubt al-Rashid would gladly forgive the intrusion if it meant the death of Kel-Garas.</string>
<string name="81038">Oo! Deekin not of your blood!</string>
<string name="81039">That... is true. I mean no offense, little one, but I would sooner take heart should my ancestor&apos;s weapon find its way into the hands of your &lt;master/mistress&gt;, here.</string>
<string name="81040">A powerful weapon to be wielded against our foe! This is fortuitous, is it not?</string>
<string name="81041">A weapon against the undead? I bet Katriana would pay handsomely for it! If you do not find it useful, &lt;FirstName&gt;, perhaps we should...</string>
<string name="81042">Do not discuss such things in front of me! The weapon is a relic of my ancestors; do not treat it as a common prize, to be bartered away!</string>
<string name="81043">Many generations after my family took up their duty in this valley, a stranger from beyond the desert came to us. He was half-dead from starvation and thirst, but with our aid he survived.</string>
<string name="81044">He told us that his god had commanded him to come here... that the Morninglord hated undeath above all else and would assist us. It was he who built the temple.</string>
<string name="81045">He died long ago, of course, but our people took up his faith and became priests after him. Now... now there is nothing left. All the priests are dead and only the altar remains.</string>
<string name="81046">What questions would you ask?</string>
<string name="81047">We were once a nomadic tribe, connected to the other tribes of the Bedine, but when we swore to guard against Kel-Garas we moved here. Now the other Bedine believe we are cursed and avoid us.</string>
<string name="81048">The phaerimm&apos;s power was a gift, but also a curse, since it meant we could never leave this oasis until the mummy was utterly destroyed.</string>
<string name="81049">That... requires a larger explanation that dates back to Kel-Garas&apos;s rise, long ago.</string>
<string name="81050">Of course. All my knowledge is at your disposal.</string>
<string name="81051">Kel-Garas&apos;s strength has been growing, and it obviously has reached the point where he was able to reach out from within his tomb and parch the very spring from which the oasis flows.</string>
<string name="81052">Even though he remains in his tomb, our tribe is under siege... and he is winning.</string>
<string name="81053">You must first destroy his body, which is neither an easy task nor will it be permanent... Kel-Garas is immortal, after all. The source of his eternal life lies within the rod he holds.</string>
<string name="81054">According to the legends, whoever recovers the rod can place it on the altar of the Morning Lord and Lathander will destroy its power, for none hate the undead more than him.</string>
<string name="81055">The rod&apos;s destruction will end Kel-Garas&apos;s existence forever, and only that can restore the water to the oasis and give us hope of survival.</string>
<string name="81056">When the Bedine first battled Kel-Garas after his rising, he was all but invincible. Many thousands fought only to be slaughtered by his magic or turned into ghastly undead.</string>
<string name="81057">We were desperate for aid, for anything that could stop this evil. And we found it... or, rather, one of my own ancestors did.</string>
<string name="81058">A prison built by the ancient Netherese, perhaps similar to the one Kel-Garas himself had once been held in, I do not know. This one, however, still held its occupant.</string>
<string name="81059">It called itself &apos;phaerimm&apos; and was unlike anything else my ancestor had ever seen. It had great power, however, power as great as that of Kel-Garas.</string>
<string name="81060">It was this power that my ancestor bargained for and was granted, a power that would drive Kel-Garas back into his tomb and keep him there forever.</string>
<string name="81061">It does. The power has been passed down in each generation of my bloodline. Should Kel-Garas ever leave his tomb, I could perhaps even destroy him.</string>
<string name="81062">Ahhh, if only I could venture within, myself, to face the creature directly. Should we enter the tomb, however, our own power is nullified by Kel-Garas&apos;s magic and we are helpless. Some have... still tried.</string>
<string name="81063">The most recent was my own uncle, Hammad, the last to hold the power before me. He entered and... returned a fortnight later, a zombie himself. I was forced to slay him, my own kin, and banish his soul.</string>
<string name="81064">There are many things I could brave, stranger, but undeath... no, not that. Anything but that.</string>
<string name="81065">Alas, our time grows short and I am sure Kel-Garas knows this. I am the last of my own blood and the power that was handed down to me... it has been waning even as Kel-Garas&apos;s own power grows.</string>
<string name="81066">When I noticed my power beginning to fade, I voyaged to the distant prison my ancestor had found long before... to speak to this same phaerimm if it still existed.</string>
<string name="81067">It was dead. How it was killed I never found out, but I can only assume that its death has caused its power within me to fade... and, at the same time, allowed Kel-Garas&apos;s to increase.</string>
<string name="81068">There was no sign of who killed it. I assume that with the creature&apos;s death, my powers will fade until I am normal.</string>
<string name="81069">Many creatures have the ability to nullify the powers of a rogue, yet this doesn&apos;t stop me from doing what I know I must.</string>
<string name="81070">Only a fool goes where he cannot be sure of victory. It is lucky that Xanos is here, or who could triumph over this creature?</string>
<string name="81071">That not sounds like it ended good...</string>
<string name="81072">Because he lacked the power to defeat his rivals in life, Kel-Garas sought powers through death, that he might find a way to become the supreme ruler amongst the Netherese.</string>
<string name="81073">Kel-Garas became a creature of undeath, gaining the abilities of the supernatural plus retaining all the power he held in life. He did not, however, anticipate the reaction of his rivals to this change.</string>
<string name="81074">So it would seem. All things must come to their end, good or evil, as did even the great Netheril Empire itself. In fact, it was the Empire&apos;s fall that allowed Kel-Garas to live.... but I get ahead of myself.</string>
<string name="81075">Many have thought so... there are wizards today who seek lichdom, after all. But it is foolishness to believe that such evil will not be countered by good. The world must always seek a balance.</string>
<string name="81076">If you do not wish to hear the entire tale, I can sum it up for you, though I will take no blame if you lack any depth to your understanding. I do not enjoy catering to fools.</string>
<string name="81077">Kel-Garas&apos;s soul is tied to a magical rod, which he keeps on his person at all times. So long as the rod continues to exist, so does he.</string>
<string name="81078">If you wish the water to return to this oasis, you will have to go into the tomb and defeat Kel-Garas himself... then return to the surface with his rod in order to destroy it.</string>
<string name="81079">Kel-Garas is immortal, so the only way he can be permanently destroyed is by placing the rod on the altar to the Morning Lord within his temple, here, and allowing Lathander to remove its foul power forever.</string>
<string name="81080">I trust that was a brief enough tale... or do you have questions?</string>
<string name="81081">As part of Kel-Garas&apos;s change into his evil, undead form, his own soul had been trapped within a rod that he kept close at hand... for this rod could be used against him.</string>
<string name="81082">Kel-Garas&apos;s rivals discovered this fact and had the rod stolen. They performed a great binding ritual upon it that drove Kel-Garas deep into the earth and imprisoned him there.</string>
<string name="81083">Kel-Garas&apos;s immortal form was protected by the power of Jergal, himself, and not so easily destroyed. Even the great power wielded by the mages of that age could but contain him, in the end.</string>
<string name="81084">And then, after Kel-Garas had been imprisoned for centuries, the Empire fell and its magic vanished. The binding that held Kel-Garas was broken and he was once again free. He recovered the rod and then built an elaborate tomb from which he planned to rule.</string>
<string name="81085">In the end it was my own people, the Bedine, who stopped Kel-Garas from succeeding. But only at great cost.</string>
<string name="81086">Are there other questions you have?</string>
<string name="81087">I did ponder thoughts of becoming a lich once, but I decided that there would be too many people who would seek to destroy Xanos. I will have enough enemies without that.</string>
<string name="81088">Then you have foreseen a possibility that Kel-Garas did not.</string>
<string name="81089">That is because Xanos learns from the mistakes of others.</string>
<string name="81090">An undead priest? Then this is a creature that cannot be turned!</string>
<string name="81091">He has many protections, young dwarf, but he must be defeated.</string>
<string name="81092">That sound like bad news. Old Master once tell Deekin story about dragon that do that. Old Master say he look terrible without skin.</string>
<string name="81093">The horror of the undead goes far beyond their appearance, little one.</string>
<string name="81094">Yes, an empire of wealth and magic of a level unseen anywhere in Faerun today. Kel-Garas was a Netherese priest of Jergal, though the legends say he also conspired to become ruler of the Empire, itself.</string>
<string name="81095">In the time of Netheril, Jergal was a powerful god of evil and darkness. It is said his power has diminished in this age, if he even exists at all, though Kel-Garas remains as powerful as ever.</string>
<string name="81096">It is said that Kel-Garas used the powers offered to him by Jergal and attempted to gain rulership of the Empire, itself. That is how he became what he is now.</string>
<string name="81097">He tried, though he ultimately did not succeed. There were many who sought to rule the Empire in that age, and Kel-Garas had many rivals with powers that paralleled his own.</string>
<string name="81098">Powerful creatures usually collect powerful items. This could be a good opportunity for us.</string>
<string name="81099">It is never just a simple job, is it? We could not just come up here and ask to use the water... no! We have to go and fight undead and other, more powerful creatures.</string>
<string name="81100">Ooo! You says creature? Wait! Deekin gets out notes... he gots to write this all down!</string>
<string name="81101">You return, I see. Do you desire to hear our tale now, or no?</string>
<string name="81102">As you desire. I suggest you leave this oasis soon, if you can, for your own safety.</string>
<string name="81103">Very well, even though this tale is not normally told outside the Bedine I suppose it is only fair that you know of the cursed creature who hunts us both.</string>
<string name="81104">I see you have returned, wanderer. How goes the battle with my ancient foe?</string>
<string name="81105">The shifting sands are ever treacherous, but trust must be placed somewhere. I beg you... do not fail us, wanderer.</string>
<string name="81106">Excellent. Perhaps the time of Kel-Garas&apos;s doom has finally come. The Bedine shall hold you in honor, if you honor your word to us. </string>
<string name="81107">I pray that al-Rashid&apos;s weapon will aid you in the battle to come. May the wings of the flies of a thousand camels speed you to victory.</string>
<string name="81108">I know it is, but I have given you all I can. I will pray that your path will be true and your choices wise.</string>
<string name="81109">I agree, the task is difficult. Here, let the strength of my blood fill yours. </string>
<string name="81110">The effect will not last forever, but it should stand you in good stead. Be swift, wanderer, that you might take Kel-Garas by surprise.</string>
<string name="81111">I will help as much as I can.</string>
<string name="81112">Kel-Garas&apos;s soul is tied to a magical rod, which he keeps on his person at all times. So long as the rod continues to exist, so does he.</string>
<string name="81113">If you wish the water to return to this oasis, you will have to go into the tomb and defeat Kel-Garas himself... then return to the surface with his rod.</string>
<string name="81114">Kel-Garas is immortal, so the only way he can be permanently destroyed is by placing the rod on the altar to the Morning Lord within his temple, here, and allowing Lathander to remove its foul power forever.</string>
<string name="81115">May the gods of my people guide you to swift victory, wanderer.</string>
<string name="81116">A magnificent triumph! You are truly one with the spirit of the Bedine! There is just one more task, and you must hurry, if you are to return life to the oasis.</string>
<string name="81117">The rod must be taken into the temple to be destroyed. Once Kel-Garas is destroyed, the water will flow in the oasis once more.</string>
<string name="81118">Please, wanderer, do not utter such words. My people&apos;s lives depend on you to destroy this evil. Your people will suffer and die without the water.</string>
<string name="81119">Even if you survive without the water, if you do not destroy the rod, Kel-Garas will not rest until you are dead and the rod is back in his possession. </string>
<string name="81120">Legend tells us that Lathander himself will destroy the destructive power within the rod and replace it with the power of healing. If it is a reward you wish, then the gift of the god is yours.</string>
<string name="81121">Xanos has no wish to have this mummy hunting him down for the rest of my life. We must destroy this rod.</string>
<string name="81122">Why there be always more to do? This takes forever to writes down...</string>
<string name="81123">I suppose you could, but legend tells us that Lathander himself will destroy the destructive power within the rod and replace it with the power of healing, no trifling thing.</string>
<string name="81124">It seems only fitting that such an honor should fall on you, my friend.</string>
<string name="81125">This is hardly a difficult choice, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Let us destroy the rod and collect the reward. We can always use more healing.</string>
<string name="81126">Before you go, legend tells us that Lathander himself will destroy the destructive power within the rod and replace it instead with the power of healing. It seemed fitting to me that you should be rewarded.</string>
<string name="81127">Should there be any trouble, my men and I shall try to help you.</string>
<string name="81128">Destroy the rod, quickly!</string>
<string name="81129">Victory is ours, wanderer. I am pleased to note that your actions were ever honorable. I thank you for all that you have done. </string>
<string name="81130">Tell little Katriana that her caravan is welcome to return to us at any time and water will always be free for her.</string>
<string name="81131">It was our pleasure. There was much looting of the evil temple, I am proud to say!</string>
<string name="81132">Xanos is glad that you acknowledge his help, but it is only proper that you should also thank my assistant, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="81133">Ah... yes... well... I was thanking both of you, of course.</string>
<string name="81134">Ummm... Deekin helps, too, you know.</string>
<string name="81135">Of course you are correct, my little friend. I thank you both.</string>
<string name="81136">We bless the day the gods saw fit to bring you to us, wanderer. </string>
<string name="81137">Is that a threat?</string>
<string name="81138">Where are these zombies from? </string>
<string name="81139">All I need is some water.</string>
<string name="81140">Do you not have any reserves of water?</string>
<string name="81141">We will need to work together, then. I must have water.</string>
<string name="81142">Why do these things always happen to me?</string>
<string name="81143">As I too need water, it seems our lives are intertwined.</string>
<string name="81144">Our caravan is in desperate need of water.</string>
<string name="81145">I will be going now.</string>
<string name="81146">So what do I get for helping you?</string>
<string name="81147">I want to know more about this phaerimm.</string>
<string name="81148">I have no further questions about the phaerimm.</string>
<string name="81149">Why did it give you this power?</string>
<string name="81150">But what did it get in return?</string>
<string name="81151">What sort of power, exactly, did it give you?</string>
<string name="81152">Where is this prison it was in?</string>
<string name="81153">What manner of creature was it?</string>
<string name="81154">How did it die?</string>
<string name="81155">Could Kel-Garas have been responsible?</string>
<string name="81156">I have questions about this oasis.</string>
<string name="81157">Tell me about the crypt.</string>
<string name="81158">Tell me about the Temple of The Morninglord.</string>
<string name="81159">I have other questions.</string>
<string name="81160">I want to know about your people.</string>
<string name="81161">What is a phaerimm?</string>
<string name="81162">I want to know more about Kel-Garas.</string>
<string name="81163">How did Kel-Garas get rid of all the water?</string>
<string name="81164">So how do you propose we defeat Kel-Garas?</string>
<string name="81165">Have you tried fighting Kel-Garas directly?</string>
<string name="81166">What did he find?</string>
<string name="81167">Does this power still exist?</string>
<string name="81168">You are a coward! Why have you not used your power to destroy him already?</string>
<string name="81169">Are you too afraid to face Kel-Garas in his own lair? </string>
<string name="81170">Why only if he leaves his tomb?</string>
<string name="81171">Why the shift in power?</string>
<string name="81172">What do you know of Kel-Garas, himself?</string>
<string name="81173">Such evil is always undone, in the end.</string>
<string name="81174">There must be great power beyond death.</string>
<string name="81175">Is this story much longer?</string>
<string name="81176">I really do not want to hear the whole tale.</string>
<string name="81177">How do I destroy the rod?</string>
<string name="81178">Never mind. Continue on. </string>
<string name="81179">Please continue.</string>
<string name="81180">Why did they not just destroy him?</string>
<string name="81181">Why would his rivals drive him underground?</string>
<string name="81182">That&apos;s all my questions about Kel-Garas.</string>
<string name="81183">What cost was that?</string>
<string name="81184">Tell me about the Netheril Empire.</string>
<string name="81185">Tell me about Jergal.</string>
<string name="81186">And did he rule the Empire?</string>
<string name="81187">No, that&apos;s not necessary.</string>
<string name="81188">Yes, tell me what&apos;s going on.</string>
<string name="81189">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="81190">I have found al-Rashid&apos;s weapon.</string>
<string name="81191">It goes poorly. This is a difficult task.</string>
<string name="81192">I have questions for you.</string>
<string name="81193">What was I supposed to do again?</string>
<string name="81194">I have the rod.</string>
<string name="81195">I would like to keep the rod. It seems quite valuable.</string>
<string name="81196">Could I not just give it to you to do?</string>
<string name="81197">I will do it, then. </string>
<string name="81198">I will do that.</string>
<string name="81199">Go in peace, stranger. If you have business, I suggest you speak to Ali.</string>
<string name="81200">I greet you, stranger. It is too bad that you have come to our oasis at such an inopportune time.</string>
<string name="81201">We will die soon, and the desert shall take us... and then the evil lord shall escape his tomb at last. These are dark days, indeed.</string>
<string name="81202">I am afraid I possess no supplies to sell you, stranger.</string>
<string name="81203">You must speak to Ali, stranger. He will know what to do.</string>
<string name="81204">You are the one out of prophesy! Salaam, &lt;FullName&gt;. Your name will remain on our tongues and on the tongues of our children for generations.</string>
<string name="81205">The ox, having gotten used to your presence, appears to no longer be bothered by you.</string>
<string name="81206">Ironic as it might seem, the ox wishes you would stand downwind so it wouldn&apos;t have to smell you anymore.</string>
<string name="81207">Should I worry about your sanity when you begin mooing at the oxen that way, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="81208">The ox proceeds to launch into a long exposition on why the gods should never have created tsetse flies.</string>
<string name="81209">The ox wishes you would open the gate so it could run free. Then it looks around at all the sand and hastily changes its mind.</string>
<string name="81210">The ox tells you how much it would like to give the caravan wagons a good stomping.</string>
<string name="81211">The ox wishes that it could have a long drink and a bucket of oats.</string>
<string name="81212">The ox explains in slow and repetitive snorts just how much it really hates all the sand.</string>

<string name="81247">Stranger! You have destroyed much of what I created. Tell me, do you feel an urgent need to fight me and die, or do you have time to... parley?</string>
<string name="81248">I hoped you might have had more of a mind than that, but you have proven me wrong. Very well, we will fight, though I tell you now, even if you defeat me again, you will never be rid of me.</string>
<string name="81249">Kel Garas oct hothik Ral!</string>
<string name="81250">When a living person enters my dominion, I always assume they are here to destroy me or to rob me. Either way, I must protect myself and my... people.</string>
<string name="81251">But do not worry, you are alive and my people can be brought back too, so no harm is done. Will you speak?</string>
<string name="81252">There is always something to learn from speaking to another, particularly if the other has a mind of any value. Believe me, I could teach you all sorts of things. </string>
<string name="81253">But you have to be willing to listen and learn and share your thoughts as well. Is this something that interests you?</string>
<string name="81254">It has been long years since I had anyone to converse with. Let me get a sense of you, first.</string>
<string name="81255">A worshiper of the natural order? I should have known! Your kind deserve only the most painful kind of death!</string>
<string name="81256">A holy priest? I should have known! Your kind deserve only the most painful kind of death!</string>
<string name="81257">An unholy priest came to my lair? I am sorry I attacked you then. This has all the markings of a most profitable relationship.</string>
<string name="81258">Ah, I sense the mystic forces you hold under your control. Many of my enemies and allies were mages of great power.</string>
<string name="81259">A thief are you? Well do I understand the greed for something I did not possess. We might have much in common.</string>
<string name="81260">An entertainer? I never had much use for your sort in life, but now that I face eternity with only the mindless dead to keep me company, I find you intriguing.</string>
<string name="81261">Ah, I see you are a warrior of some power. I have known some generals with strong, tactical minds. We shall see how yours compares.</string>
<string name="81262">So what is your name, &lt;class&gt;?</string>
<string name="81263">Come now, if we are to speak in earnest we must have free exchange of information. I, as you already know, am Kel Garas of the Netheril, and a priest of Jergal.</string>
<string name="81264">Then our exchange ends here. Now death awaits you with eagerness.</string>
<string name="81265">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; So that is how it is going to be, is it? Very well, I shall call you Katriana, though I doubt it is your name.</string>
<string name="81266">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; Greetings, Katriana. Welcome to the dead lands of Kel Garas, though, as I am sure you have noticed, I am not quite dead.</string>
<string name="81267">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; So that is how it is going to be, is it? Very well, I shall call you Torias, though I doubt it is your name.</string>
<string name="81268">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; Greetings, Torias. Welcome to the dead lands of Kel Garas, though, as I am sure you have noticed, I am not quite dead.</string>
<string name="81269">Greetings, &lt;CUSTOM502&gt;. Welcome to the dead lands of Kel Garas, though, as I am sure you have noticed, I am not quite dead.</string>
<string name="81270">I was once a powerful priest of the Netherese. But I am sure you have heard the tale from the twisted minds of the Bedine warriors. Perhaps you have questions of me?</string>
<string name="81271">Let me see that. It looks very familiar. Hmm, I cannot seem to recall where I have seen it before. Perhaps if I could hold it, I could divine what it is with my powers.</string>
<string name="81272">You can trust me, &lt;CUSTOM502&gt;. Just let me hold the crystal and I can tell you exactly what it is.</string>
<string name="81273">You have the source! With it I can truly reign supreme! Nothing will ever be able to destroy me! I shall take it from your corpse and then raise you so that you may serve me!</string>
<string name="81274">&lt;FirstName&gt;, what are you doing? Ixnay on the ystalcray!</string>
<string name="81275">Hmm, you are an unusual duo. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="81276">How would you feel about a tribe of people whose sole purpose was to destroy you? But you have me wrong; I do not hate them. I have only contempt for them.</string>
<string name="81277">They are mere dregs, an entire people whom civilized society holds in contempt. They have no homes, no palaces, no great libraries, nothing other than their lives. </string>
<string name="81278">When they are swept away, no one shall remember them, nor care that they are gone. I respect those who make something worth remembering. How about you? </string>
<string name="81279">Will you have anything worth remembering when your time has ended?</string>
<string name="81280">Then you are a fool, and I have no time to suffer fools. Your time is over now, and none shall remember nor mourn your passing.</string>
<string name="81281">And when you die, who will remember? Your kin? Your spawn? No, they shall take your kingdom and it shall be divided and fall and all you accomplished will have been for naught.</string>
<string name="81282">The ravages of time wear even stone to the ground, and your enemies shall pull down your monuments and use the stone to build their castles.</string>
<string name="81283">And the moment you die, others will take your wealth and you will be forgotten. Such things are transitory.</string>
<string name="81284">Who are the great heroes of the Netheril? We had some, but they are forgotten. Such things are transitory.</string>
<string name="81285">That is why I became what I am today, that I might live and be my own monument. Someday all shall know and fear me. Have you other questions?</string>
<string name="81286">There are... certain individuals I have held in contempt. I do not think there is such a great difference between the two.</string>
<string name="81287">That is a feeling Xanos knows well. There are many I have only contempt for.</string>
<string name="81288">Wait, wait! Deekin not writes so fast! Speaks slower!</string>
<string name="81289">Contrary to what many people believe, my people were not evil by nature. We were arrogant and powerful, and that led many of us to commit evil deeds.</string>
<string name="81290">There was a purity to the power that we wielded, so far superior to the magic of today. There are too many limits for true power.</string>
<string name="81291">We broke mountains, and then built cities that flew through the air. We fought our enemies with spells that could wreak havoc as far as the eyes could see.</string>
<string name="81292">Such power is not available in this world. Not since the disappearance of my people.</string>
<string name="81293">We did fail, but I still live. Perhaps more of my people survive somewhere else. I have felt... something different, recently. </string>
<string name="81294">Ah, but it matters not. It is my turn to ask you a question. I know so little about the world beyond this temple. Is there a power you serve? A great king?</string>
<string name="81295">The path to power comes to he who serves those more powerful, until he is more powerful than anyone else. You will learn this, &lt;CUSTOM502&gt;, or be destroyed by those with the power.</string>
<string name="81296">What else would you like to know?</string>
<string name="81297">Most people who serve others and then betray them, are soon betrayed themselves. You should have learned that lesson already Kel Garas.</string>
<string name="81298">You are an annoying little dwarf. &lt;CUSTOM502&gt;, you need to learn to keep your servants under better control. That is why I prefer mine dead.</string>
<string name="81299">I am not &lt;his/her&gt; servant!</string>
<string name="81300">But you should be, little dwarf. &lt;He/She&gt; is obviously your superior.</string>
<string name="81301">These are words of wisdom, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Listen well and we may learn a great deal from this one.</string>
<string name="81302">I was a powerful priest in the church of Jergal... a powerful god in my time. Despite my position in the church, I wanted more. I wanted to usurp the power of the mages and rule Netheril.</string>
<string name="81303">I did the research and found that I could increase my powers in the church and eventually in my society, but only if I were immortal. The ceremony was performed and I bound my soul to a magical rod.</string>
<string name="81304">Indeed. The rod was stolen by my enemies, just as it was by you presently, and I was cast out of Netheril society, buried in a cave, unable to rise and use my powers. </string>
<string name="81305">If my soul remained with my body, then the destruction of my corpse would end my life. By joining it with the magical rod, blessed and protected by Jergal, I survive death all the better.</string>
<string name="81306">The rod was stolen by my enemies, just as it was by you presently, and I was cast out of Netheril society, buried in a cave, unable to rise and use my powers. </string>
<string name="81307">Then, after an age of imprisonment, I found myself free... but entirely alone.</string>
<string name="81308">Then they have better knowledge then I would have thought, but I am sure the next part they would not know about. </string>
<string name="81309">Indeed, you have the bartering stick, if I may use that turn of phrase. I suppose the fools told you to destroy me by destroying the rod. Always there is someone who would destroy those who would be great.</string>
<string name="81310">But what will this creature trade for his eternal soul? That is what I am wondering.</string>
<string name="81311">A statement I myself have made in the past. This is a learned... man. We should pay attention to what he has to say.</string>
<string name="81312">Hey! Old Master used to say that all the time!</string>
<string name="81313">The Netherese disappeared with all of their cities and magic. I have no idea what became of them, other than the one who possessed my soul. I found his corpse near here, in fact, my body being drawn to my soul.</string>
<string name="81314">I was torn by the loss of my people, and I was determined to discover what had happened to them. Then I found a true horror.</string>
<string name="81315">Not so quickly. I have told you some of my story, but now it is my turn. Information is valuable and not to be easily given away.</string>
<string name="81316">I want to know something about you. Tell me; was your father a &lt;class&gt; too?</string>
<string name="81317">And driven by your mother&apos;s accomplishments, you decided that you just had to make more of your life, to prove you were as good; no, better than she was.</string>
<string name="81318">My, what a heart wrenching tale, &lt;CUSTOM502&gt;. I can see it now, driven by the loneliness of not having a father, you vowed to do more with your life.</string>
<string name="81319">Ah yes, I can almost smell the stench of the nobility flowing through your veins. Driven by the right to rule, you set out to show everyone you were worthy of your birthright.</string>
<string name="81320">And driven by your father&apos;s accomplishments, you decided that you just had to make more of your life, to prove you were as good; no, better than he was.</string>
<string name="81321">Ah yes, I can almost smell the stench of the common blood, flowing through your veins. Ashamed of the life your parents led, you vowed to make more of your life.</string>
<string name="81322">My, what a heart wrenching tale, &lt;CUSTOM502&gt;. I can see it now, driven by the loneliness of the orphanage; you vowed to make something better of your life.</string>
<string name="81323">Yes, you are as easy to read as a simple text. Go ahead, tell me I am wrong.</string>
<string name="81324">That&apos;s right. Lie to yourself and try to make up excuses for your choices in life, but in the end you will see that I was right.</string>
<string name="81325">Of course I am. The sorrows of life drive all her creatures down similar paths. We can lie to ourselves and believe that our choices are somehow more noble than others, but it is nothing more than a lie.</string>
<string name="81326">So where were we?</string>
<string name="81327">I was hoping I could trust you, but I do not think I know you well enough. I guess it is time to find out how well you die.</string>
<string name="81328">Well, I know a little bit about you, but I guess the most important knowledge must come now.</string>
<string name="81329">Are you willing to make a deal with me, knowing that it means you must betray your friends, the Bedine?</string>
<string name="81330">No, you must choose your path and choose it now. Once you decide, there shall be no going back. Now choose, yes or no?</string>
<string name="81331">Then it is time to find out how well you die. Farewell, fool.</string>
<string name="81332">Well then, we are entered into a contract. So here is the deal. I have created a dagger with special properties similar to the rod that holds my soul.</string>
<string name="81333">You take this dagger, and plunge it into the body of the Bedine leader. The dagger will consume his soul, killing him instantly.</string>
<string name="81334">I shall leave here until the fool is dealt with. When the deed is done, take the dagger and place it on the altar. Doing this will curse the altar.</string>
<string name="81335">Jergal will use the energy of the Bedine&apos;s soul to forge you a powerful item. Use it or sell it, I care not. I will be going now. </string>
<string name="81336"> You shall never see me again, until the time of my triumphant return. I shall remember what an excellent servant you have made. Perhaps I will give you a kingdom or two to run.</string>
<string name="81337">Oh, and one last thing, I will take the rod and return the water to the oasis. You have my permission to partake of as much as you wish.</string>
<string name="81338">Here is the dagger. Good luck, my evil friend.</string>
<string name="81339">Quick and easy; this is a powerful weapon. Whatever shall we do? I will allow you to make this decision, my friend.</string>
<string name="81340">Like the ultimate thief, I would say. Still, this gives me an uneasy feeling. Please choose carefully.</string>
<string name="81341">That sound like nice knife. You makes one for Deekin, maybe?</string>
<string name="81342">Silence, fool creature.</string>
<string name="81343">Very well, what do you want to know about?</string>
<string name="81344">A creature of great evil, a phaerimm... enemy to the people of Netheril and itself trapped in a prison of their making... had twisted the minds of a Bedine tribesman and granted him great power to destroy me.</string>
<string name="81345">My research was lost as I fled back here to my lair, where I was able to block the creature&apos;s magic with my own protections.</string>
<string name="81346">I believed I was trapped in my tomb indefinitely, but it seems something has gone right finally and I have grown in strength.</string>
<string name="81347">I do not know. Perhaps Jergal waxes in power once again, or perhaps the phaerimm perished, weakening the Bedine. Or something else beyond my awareness has occurred. Does it truly matter?</string>
<string name="81348">But now it is my turn to ask a question again. You left home to become an adventurer, and you obviously have the skills of some experience.</string>
<string name="81349">Someone must have become the replacement parental figure in your life. Was he or she kind? Did you love your mentor?</string>
<string name="81350">Only a fool cannot admit weakness. You had a mentor and you loved him like he was your own father.</string>
<string name="81351">Do you believe the lies you tell yourself? It is only a fool who cannot admit weakness. At least a part of you loved your mentor.</string>
<string name="81352">Every lie you tell tells me more about you. Every lie pushes you a little closer to the same path that I walked. You loved your mentor.</string>
<string name="81353">Every lie you tell tells me more about you. Every lie pushes you a little closer to the same path that I walked. There was a mentor and you loved him like a true father.</string>
<string name="81354">We all love our mentors in one way or another. I loved mine even as I killed her. She made an excellent sacrifice.</string>
<string name="81355">And yet there is a part of you that would liked to have tested your mentor... to best him, and to watch his life&apos;s blood flowing from a mortal wound of your own making. </string>
<string name="81356">What a moronic statement! Even as you hide behind the veneer of diplomacy, your soul is stained and someday you shall find that the dark path has consumed you so greatly, you enjoy evil.</string>
<string name="81357">Do you see the path before your feet? Even if you destroy me, your evil nature will bloom, as it always does.</string>
<string name="81358">What he says is true! How I would have enjoyed that contest. Maybe I will still have the chance, though I would not kill Drogan, just teach him a lesson for once.</string>
<string name="81359">Yes, I am. But unlike you, I have never sought to hide my nature behind a guise of righteousness. </string>
<string name="81360">Oh, &lt;CUSTOM502&gt;, this is such fun. It is your turn. Ask your questions.</string>
<string name="81361">There lies the difference between us. I would never have hurt Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="81362">Old Master was mentor to little Deekin. He threatens to eats Deekin lots.</string>
<string name="81363">Phaerimm are creatures that destroy all other magic-using creatures of any race. By almost any definition, that would make them evil, no?</string>
<string name="81364">Truthfully, it is humorous, don&apos;t you think? I mean here are these people, thinking they are doing the world a great service for the good of all, yet binding themselves to a creature of pure malice.</string>
<string name="81365">Yes, they do not even comprehend the irony of thier situation. Irony is the most beautiful form of humor.</string>
<string name="81366">Exactly! Irony is the most beautiful form of humor.</string>
<string name="81367">Then you must have scrambled your brain with all the fighting you have been doing. Irony is the most beautiful form of humor.</string>
<string name="81368">I told you, I was researching what happened to my people. Taking over the world would have made that research easier.</string>
<string name="81369">I do not see the profit in ruling over the dead. Of what use is an empty world?</string>
<string name="81370">You fail to see the grand scheme, but then, you are short, you must fail to see a lot of things.</string>
<string name="81371">You live only at the mercy of Xanos and his brave companion!</string>
<string name="81372">Perhaps, or perhaps I will just keep coming back until you are so weakened that you can no longer defeat me. Then you would be my undead slaves.</string>
<string name="81373">Bleh. That just because boss not kills you rest of way, yet.</string>
<string name="81374">Silence, fool lizard, lest I show you first-hand the glory of undeath!</string>
<string name="81375">Ummm... okays. Deekin just goes back to writing epic story...</string>
<string name="81376">Hrrrrm. A paladin, I see. And one who speaks with the undead? You are nothing more than a dissembler, fool, and I shall rend you apart with my unholy powers!</string>
<string name="81377">I am here only to destroy you, evil creature!</string>
<string name="81378">You try to kill me and then wish to speak?</string>
<string name="81379">Why should I want to speak with you?</string>
<string name="81380">I will speak with you.</string>
<string name="81381">I do not wish to share my name with you.</string>
<string name="81382">I said no.</string>
<string name="81383">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; My name is Katriana.</string>
<string name="81384">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - lie]&lt;/Start&gt; My name is Torias.</string>
<string name="81385">I am &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="81386">I have no questions for you.</string>
<string name="81387">Are you interested in making a deal?</string>
<string name="81388">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Pull out tower crystal.]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you know what this crystal is?</string>
<string name="81389">Why do you need to hold it?</string>
<string name="81390">I don&apos;t think so. It is important.</string>
<string name="81391">Definitely not.</string>
<string name="81392">I&apos;m not sure...</string>
<string name="81393">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Put the crystal away.]&lt;/Start&gt; No.</string>
<string name="81394">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Quickly put it away.]&lt;/Start&gt; Uh, never mind. I have a different question.</string>
<string name="81395">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Show him the crystal anyways.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81396">Why do you hate the Bedine so much?</string>
<string name="81397">I do not care for such things.</string>
<string name="81398">Someday I will forge a kingdom.</string>
<string name="81399">They shall build monuments to me, someday.</string>
<string name="81400">I will have riches beyond belief.</string>
<string name="81401">My fame shall live on. </string>
<string name="81402">Tell me about the Netherese.</string>
<string name="81403">I would love such power.</string>
<string name="81404">Not so powerful that they survived though.</string>
<string name="81405">So why did they fail?</string>
<string name="81406">There are kings and tyrants, but I serve none of them.</string>
<string name="81407">I serve my god.</string>
<string name="81408">I serve my people.</string>
<string name="81409">I serve no one.</string>
<string name="81410">Tell me your version of the story.</string>
<string name="81411">You mean the rod I stole?</string>
<string name="81412">Well, that was pretty stupid.</string>
<string name="81413">Why would you bind it to a rod?</string>
<string name="81414">This is pretty much exactly what the Bedine told me.</string>
<string name="81415">And now I have the rod they placed your soul in.</string>
<string name="81416">What happened to your people?</string>
<string name="81417">How did you get free?</string>
<string name="81418">Enough, I want to ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="81419">Hurry up and finish your story.</string>
<string name="81420">What did you find?</string>
<string name="81421">No, but my mother was.</string>
<string name="81422">I never knew my father.</string>
<string name="81423">No, he was a noble.</string>
<string name="81424">Yes, he was.</string>
<string name="81425">No, he was a commoner.</string>
<string name="81426">No, I am an orphan.</string>
<string name="81427">You know nothing about me.</string>
<string name="81428">You are wrong.</string>
<string name="81429">You are close.</string>
<string name="81430">I have no more questions.</string>
<string name="81431">Is there no other way?</string>
<string name="81432">No. I will not betray them.</string>
<string name="81433">Yes, if it is worth my while.</string>
<string name="81434">They are not my friends. I merely sought water from them.</string>
<string name="81435">I like it, so far.</string>
<string name="81436">What do I get for doing this?</string>
<string name="81437">What happens then?</string>
<string name="81438">I changed my mind. I think I will destroy you instead.</string>
<string name="81439">Give me the dagger.</string>
<string name="81440">Very well.</string>
<string name="81441">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="81442">Finish telling me your story.</string>
<string name="81443">What has bolstered your powers? </string>
<string name="81444">I do not wish to answer that.</string>
<string name="81445">No, I used him for my own purposes and left when he had nothing more to give.</string>
<string name="81446">He was a good teacher, but I had no feelings for him.</string>
<string name="81447">There was no mentor in my life.</string>
<string name="81448">Yes. He was a good teacher.</string>
<string name="81449">Yes, there is truth in what you say.</string>
<string name="81450">You have your opinions; I have mine.</string>
<string name="81451">Perhaps you are right.</string>
<string name="81452">You are disgusting.</string>
<string name="81453">The Bedine said the creature was combating your evil.</string>
<string name="81454">Why should I believe this phaerimm was evil?</string>
<string name="81455">What fools.</string>
<string name="81456">Somewhat ironic I suppose.</string>
<string name="81457">I don&apos;t find that funny.</string>
<string name="81458">You spoke of research; I thought you were trying to take over the world.</string>
<string name="81459">&lt;StartAction&gt;The magical crystal that you received from the Formians begins to feel warm in your hands...&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="81508">Welcome to Musharak&apos;s Fine Desert Emporium! I am Musharak, sole proprietor and scrounger of the only mid-Anauroch mercantile business.</string>
<string name="81509">How might I serve you today, good &lt;lord/lady&gt;? Would you care to see Musharak&apos;s generous supply of goods at low, low prices?</string>
<string name="81510">Well, I am disappointed that you don&apos;t want to buy anything right now, but I guess you&apos;ll come around.</string>
<string name="81511">In hopes that you will soon be in the purchasing mood, I will answer whatever questions you have.</string>
<string name="81512">Very good. Now, we should get down to business. How about I show you my fabulous merchandise?</string>
<string name="81513">I do not like to talk about my neighbors much. They are odd, but accommodating.</string>
<string name="81514">They are excavating in the Valley of the Winds. I told the fools that if they found any powerful magic items, I would pay gold for them, but they seem to think they should keep it all. Greedy fools.</string>
<string name="81515">If you speak to the minister, I heard rumors that one of the mages returned from the valley today, pretty roughed up. That is all I know about it though. None of my business.</string>
<string name="81516">Have you ever cut a worm in half and noticed that both halves keep on living? Well, I have noticed that, but I do not know how they manage it.</string>
<string name="81517">I do not know how these fools survive either, but there you have it. Every once in a while they come to me and purchase supplies. But I rely more on my income from trading with the Bedine tribes.</string>
<string name="81518">The minister is the leader of this group, if it can be said that anyone is a leader here. Do not ask him about his religion though, unless you really want to waste a day or two.</string>
<string name="81519">If you need to find him, he is in the big temple. I would not bother if I were you, but it is your time.</string>
<string name="81520">Surely a simple merchant and scrounger is unworthy of your scrutiny, but if you insist, I suppose I can reveal a bit about myself.</string>
<string name="81521">Very well, now that you know I am just a kind and caring individual, how would you like to support my twenty three children and buy some of my goods?</string>
<string name="81522">NO! None. What a frightening thought that is. What would make you think such a thing?</string>
<string name="81523">Of course I did. I want you to buy something from me. Have you never haggled with a merchant before? Few of them have children, but most of them will tell you they do. Now, want anything else?</string>
<string name="81524">It is very hard for a hobgoblin to make a living in large, civilized cities, and hobgoblin communities are simply too dangerous, so I came to the desert to sell supplies to the Bedine.</string>
<string name="81525">Then I heard about this encampment. The Aoists were selling water to the Bedine for pitifully low prices, so I came here for a visit. I liked what I saw, so I decided to settle down here.</string>
<string name="81526">Every item is wonderfully crafted and will never break, bruise, spoil or run out of charges (unless it is designed to do so). </string>
<string name="81527">If you want it, I can get it... well, so long as you are not trying to buy any of the Aoist wine. That Jasmeena can be so frustrating and the minister is even worse!</string>
<string name="81528">We have lived in the same encampment for a few years now, and he still refuses to tell me his name. It has become something of a game now. I will throw a probing question at him and see how well he can deflect it.</string>
<string name="81529">But that should tell you something of his personality. He is obsessed with his religion, and I will not tolerate talk of such things. Duvockri is offended by such utterings.</string>
<string name="81530">&lt;StartAction&gt;[He shows you a small idol.]&lt;/Start&gt; Duvockri is the hobgoblin god of trickery. I keep my idol and offer it small gifts to help protect me from being fooled as I fool others.</string>
<string name="81531">Congratulations. No, really, how wonderful for you. Oh dear, I think I just dribbled a little sarcasm onto my tunic. </string>
<string name="81532">Unless she sent you here with a regular supply of wine for me to sell, I really could care less. Sorry.</string>
<string name="81533">Jasmeena is a Bedine woman who lives here with the Aoists and makes a special holy wine. I have no idea why she stays, but she is devoutly loyal to the minister, though not an Aoist.</string>
<string name="81534">Her pathetic, subservient view of life has led her to make a special wine that the Aoists treat as almost holy. Can you believe she does not even charge them for the wine?</string>
<string name="81535">She is one of those pathetic druids who stumble around trying to save every ant and flea, with no real understanding of what is truly important: gold! She and the fool of a minister belong together.</string>
<string name="81536">Like yourself, Jasmeena is a noble druid whose purpose in life is to assist nature here in the nearly lifeless desert. She and the fool of a minister belong together.</string>
<string name="81537">Oh no, ha ha, certainly not. He is an old man, while she is a young woman. I simply meant that they have much in common, with unusual ways of looking at the world.</string>
<string name="81538">My, you are terribly observant. I assure you, I, Musharak, may have the body of a hobgoblin, but I have the mind of an elf and the heart of a dwarf. And do not worry; their original owners were well compensated.</string>
<string name="81539">If I only had the feet of a halfling I would be the most well rounded individual in the realms. Hmm, well, anyways. Was there more to your question?</string>
<string name="81540">Well then, perhaps you are in a pleasant, spendthrift mood now?</string>
<string name="81541">They really are an interesting little group, so long as they keep their religious ideas to themselves and keep paying me for the supplies they need. </string>
<string name="81542">It was very kind of them to allow me to take over trading the water to the Bedine. I was afraid they might put up a fuss, but they just looked at my guard, Ludo, and shrugged.</string>
<string name="81543">Say hello to the nice &lt;lord/lady&gt;, Ludo.</string>
<string name="81544">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Grunt]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81545">See? We are all getting along so well. How lovely. Now, how would you like to browse my wares and maybe make a purchase or two?</string>
<string name="81546">Sort of like a little protection scheme you have then?</string>
<string name="81547">A protection scheme? Not a bad idea.</string>
<string name="81548">And who are you going to say you are protecting them from?</string>
<string name="81549">Good point. Besides, the poor fools can barely afford supplies. </string>
<string name="81550">Great Duvockri, I should think not! Most of my kind could hardly string a four-word sentence together. I do not claim any great virtue, but neither would I stab you in the back just to test my blade.</string>
<string name="81551">All that I am, is a humble merchant, though I am the best in this part of the world. Alright, so perhaps I am not humble. I am also a scrounger, but what good merchant is not?</string>
<string name="81552">&lt;StartAction&gt;[He shows you a small idol.]&lt;/Start&gt; Duvockri is the hobgoblin god of trickery. I keep my idol and offer it small gifts to help protect me from being fooled as I fool others.</string>
<string name="81553">Ever get caught in a sandstorm and suddenly feel the need to relieve your bowels? I imagine I am only slightly less of an annoyance than that.</string>
<string name="81554">But just like the sandstorm, in the end, I really just do not care. I am me and they can take me as I am. They are far too nice to chase me off.</string>
<string name="81555">Ha, you caught me there. Occasionally a caravan, such as the one you came in with, will wander through, but I am the only steadfast merchant here. </string>
<string name="81556">Most of my gold comes from supplying the locals, trading water to the Bedine tribes (an excellent trade there), from passing caravans and the occasional adventurer.</string>
<string name="81557">Now what kind of fool would I have to be to do such a thing? I was a traveling merchant, making minor deals with the Bedine until I found out about this little settlement.</string>
<string name="81558">They were trading this water for supplies from the tribes, so I thought it would be a good idea to settle down and help out both sides.</string>
<string name="81559">Now I sell the water to the Bedine and supplies to the Aoists. How could I possibly have a better set up than this?</string>
<string name="81560">You are absolutely right. I was really very impressed that they gave in so easily. It was a most fortunate turn of events. Most neighbors would have put up a fight, thrown rocks, done something.</string>
<string name="81561">It is really very strange that they are being so obdurate now. I could make my fortune if they would just tell me the secret to making their wine, or at least let me sell some.</string>
<string name="81562">That is the only secret they seem to care about. They will talk about everything else for hours on end. Do not get them started on a conversation about the holy glory of ambivalence.</string>
<string name="81563">Have you ever experienced a moment in life where the universe suddenly come to a halt and you think you are on the verge of understanding all the deepest questions about life? </string>
<string name="81564">Have you ever stood on the precipice of a mountain in the early morn, surrounded by fog and then suddenly the sun rose, the fog lifted and it was like you were seeing perfection?</string>
<string name="81565">I do not pretend to be a poet, friend, but my first sip of this wine changed the way I look at life. That was the moment I knew I could live in this desolate place and still feel fulfilled. That is how good it is.</string>
<string name="81566">Deekin feel that way one time when his old master let him sit on his head and master breathes ice on human knights. It like watching little statues.</string>
<string name="81567">You sat on a dragon&apos;s head?</string>
<string name="81568">Well, me was composing song for master and me tells him Deekin gots to get it right. Now how that song goes?</string>
<string name="81569">Ah, thank you, I will take your word on it. No need to sing anything.</string>
<string name="81570">That is a good question. It is irrelevant however, as they will not even listen to me on this matter. Maybe someday I shall convince them, or they will get a new minister who might take my offers seriously.</string>
<string name="81571">Oh, I know, but they know next to nothing about how to make a decent sale. They barely get by with the amount they trade, but I swear, I could be rich inside of five years selling their wonderful wine.</string>
<string name="81572">Would I like to find a beautiful, intelligent hobgoblin woman wandering the desert, looking for a mate? Of course I would, but I think it rather unlikely.</string>
<string name="81573">I am a very persuasive man, but they will not budge for me. Still, you are welcome to try. I would be willing to pay handsomely for such a deal. How does 2000 gold sound?</string>
<string name="81574">I have sold family members for less than that! How could you possibly ask for more? No, it cannot be done. Two thousand is all I can offer you. It is not like I am asking you to slay a dragon!</string>
<string name="81575">Good Duvockri, no! It is merely an expression. Why I do not have any family members to sell, even if I were inclined to do so. Actually, now that I think about it, who would buy a hobgoblin?</string>
<string name="81576">No! That is a bad thought. Even I would not sink so low! Now, are you going to try to do this for me, or not?</string>
<string name="81577">I doubt you could have done the deed anyways. It would be far to difficult for you, I fear.</string>
<string name="81578">Very well. If you are successful, I shall pray to Duvockri that your life will be free from treachery. Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="81579">He has a good point, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There is no real reason to get angry at him for having good business sense.</string>
<string name="81580">Let us say that you were interested in purchasing an item that I did not happen to have in stock. I would contact certain friends and see if I could find something you might find worth purchasing.</string>
<string name="81581">If you needed something a little faster than my friends could get it to me, I could scrounge around and see what I could find. There could be a cloak or robe, perhaps.</string>
<string name="81582">Sure, there might be a small tear and a spot of blood on it, but if you are in a hurry...</string>
<string name="81583">It is not how I prefer to do things, but some people can get in a downright hurry. If it bothers you overmuch, then don&apos;t ask.</string>
<string name="81584">Well, I certainly could, but you should probably peruse the wonderful stock that I already have, as the effort it takes to scrounge up a magical item makes the cost somewhat prohibitive.</string>
<string name="81585">Besides, it can take an awfully long time to reach my contacts and you would likely be gone before the item arrived.</string>
<string name="81586">If you would like, I can take a look around the encampment and see if there is anything interesting. That is a bit of time from my day, however. If you want me to see what I can find it will cost you 100 gold.</string>
<string name="81587">I always mind; but do not worry; I shall keep a smile on my face while my heart weeps on the inside.</string>
<string name="81588">Ah, well, maybe you should sell me some of your own valuables. I am always interested in a good deal.</string>
<string name="81589">The word is *acquire*, not steal. Steal is such an ugly word. If it would sooth your conscience, I will promise to pay the owner if I find something for you. Is that good enough?</string>
<string name="81590">I will start working on that right away. In the mean time, is there anything else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="81591">A magical robe is always a good thing. Xanos always likes something that provides protection.</string>
<string name="81592">Oooo... maybe you gets Deekin a magic lute that makes big fireballs! Deekin makes even better companion for hero with that.</string>
<string name="81593">A magic fireball lute? Try not to get your hopes up. I have my doubts.</string>
<string name="81594">Deekin could use good cloak too, he guesses.</string>
<string name="81595">Now that has a certain ring to it, doesn&apos;t it. A scrounger... well, conjours up images anyways.</string>
<string name="81596">Where you gets these parts? Deekin could use nimble fingers like gnomes.</string>
<string name="81597">You travel with a kobold bard and you think a hobgoblin merchant is strange? Well, it takes all kinds.</string>
<string name="81598">Hah! We shall have to tell that one to little Dorna. It will be as much fun as turning invisible and pulling the tale of a wildcat.</string>
<string name="81599">I do not care for your sense of humor, hobgoblin. Control your tongue or I shall be forced to remove it.</string>
<string name="81600">My apologies, mistress, I meant no offense to you. All I meant was that my heart was noble and true, like a dwarf&apos;s.</string>
<string name="81601">Hmph, and I should be mollified by that? I am not so easy.</string>
<string name="81602">Since you were so kind as to set up my supply, I will sell you some for very cheap, say 200 gold for a bottle.</string>
<string name="81603">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you know that I charge 500 gold for each bottle of this fine wine? People will pay that much! 100 gold is a fine price.</string>
<string name="81604">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, quit flexing your muscles in my face! 150 gold, and that is my final offer.</string>
<string name="81605">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you know that I charge 500 gold for each bottle of this fine wine? People will pay that much! 100 gold is a fine price.</string>
<string name="81606">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, fine, but do not expect me to be pleased at almost giving it away. 150 gold, and that is my final offer.</string>
<string name="81607">Excellent. I am certain you will enjoy it. Will there be anything else?</string>
<string name="81608">Excellent. I am certain you will enjoy it. Will there be anything else?</string>
<string name="81609">For a friend? Of course, of course. Cannot have it known that a hero like yourself was drinking alcohol. Do not worry, should anyone ask, I will swear up and down that it was for your... friend. </string>
<string name="81610">Unfortunately you are asking the wrong person. The minister of the Aoists is the one who controls the wine, while Jasmeena makes it. </string>
<string name="81611">I would surely love the honor of selling the Aoist wine, but I have been unsuccessful in arranging a deal with either of them.</string>
<string name="81612">Since you were so kind as to set up my supply, I will sell you some for very cheap, say 200 gold for a bottle.</string>
<string name="81613">Suit yourself. There are plenty of wealthy people who will spend the 500 gold I normally charge them. More gold for me.</string>
<string name="81614">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you know that I charge 500 gold for each bottle of this fine wine? People will pay that much! 100 gold is a fine price.</string>
<string name="81615">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, quit flexing your muscles in my face! 150 gold, and that is my final offer.</string>
<string name="81616">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you know that I charge 500 gold for each bottle of this fine wine? People will pay that much! 100 gold is a fine price.</string>
<string name="81617">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, fine, but do not expect me to be pleased at almost giving it away. 150 gold, and that is my final offer.</string>
<string name="81618">Excellent. I am certain you will enjoy... I mean, your friend will enjoy it very much. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Wink.]&lt;/Start&gt; Will there be anything else?</string>
<string name="81619">Excellent. I am certain you will enjoy... I mean, your friend will enjoy it very much. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Wink.]&lt;/Start&gt; Will there be anything else?</string>
<string name="81620">A repeat customer: my favorite kind! How might I help you?</string>
<string name="81621">Good enough. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="81622">I had a look around the camp and spoke to some... well... people, and they have something that was found in the Valley of the Winds. It is a magical belt, and it cost me fair coin to buy it.</string>
<string name="81623">In this case there was no other way for me to acquire the item, so I hope you are ready to pay 40000 gold for it. The item will allow you to move quickly and absorbs damage, so it is quite powerful.</string>
<string name="81624">That is very disappointing, but I hope you will be able to purchase it later.</string>
<string name="81625">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah! My seventeen children would starve should I accept an offer like that. I can go no lower than 40000 gold.</string>
<string name="81626">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah! My seventeen children would starve should I accept much less than that. You may steal the belt from me for a mere 35000 gold.</string>
<string name="81627">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah! My seventeen children would starve should I accept an offer like that. I can go no lower than 40000 gold.</string>
<string name="81628">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah! My seventeen children would starve should I accept an offer like that. You may steal the belt from me for a mere 35000 gold.</string>
<string name="81629">Excellent. That is what I love to hear. It is always a pleasure to please a customer, especially when it also helps fill the coffers. Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="81630">Excellent. That is what I love to hear. It is always a pleasure to please a customer, especially when it also helps fill the coffers. Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="81631">How dare you come here and try to change my religion! Duvockri take you! I have my own god. I have no need for their pathetic one!</string>
<string name="81632">Of course I am right, though I am slightly disappointed that you would give up so easily. It has been a while since I had a good argument. Ah well, why don&apos;t you assuage your guilt by spending some money?</string>
<string name="81633">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I do not take kindly to your aspersions, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I am willing to overlook them, because I value your business. </string>
<string name="81634">Well now, why did you not say so in the first place? For profit, I am sure Duvockri would be willing to smile on a good bit of trickery! Right, you can tell them I am now a devout Aoist.</string>
<string name="81635">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Duvockri is the hobgoblin god of trickery... I think I can see the point you are making. I even think Duvockri would find it amusing. Right, you can tell them I am now a devout Aoist.</string>
<string name="81636">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I do not take kindly to your aspersions, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I am willing to overlook them, because I value your business. </string>
<string name="81637">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah... sure... I can see your point. There could be some profit in such a conversion. Right, you can tell them I am now a devout Aoist.</string>
<string name="81638">Good point. I guess I will have to give up my idol. Do not worry Duvockri, someday we may be rejoined, but for now I must live my faith. Oh, friend, I hope he understands why I must do this.</string>
<string name="81639">I need some time to think about things. You should go and tell the Minister. Now, how much can I gouge customers for a single bottle of wine?</string>
<string name="81640">Hah! A good leader must be flexible in all things, especially religion. Those who cling too hard to one god tend to make foolish mistakes. If I were a god I would detest such followers, even as I used them.</string>
<string name="81641">What kind of nonsense are they spouting now, or did you fill their heads with delusions of grandeur? I see no profit in sharing with them!</string>
<string name="81642">Of course I am right, though I am slightly disappointed that you would give up so easily. It has been a while since I had a good argument. Ah well, why don&apos;t you assuage your guilt by spending some money?</string>
<string name="81643">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; They are, are they? Well, that makes a difference. I can charge a great deal more for a small amount of wine than for barrels of water.</string>
<string name="81644">Ah, friend, I can hear the clinking of the gold in my coffers already. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh... sob.]&lt;/Start&gt; What beautiful music!</string>
<string name="81645">Tell my neighbors that I shall gladly share my profits on both the water and wine. And let it not be said that Musharak is never generous.</string>
<string name="81646">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I do not take kindly to your threats, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I am willing to overlook them, because I value your business. </string>
<string name="81647">Just keep your nose out of something you obviously do not understand. If the Aoists are so determined to make profit, they may come to me themselves and bring wine with them.</string>
<string name="81648">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Uh... I get your meaning, good &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I... I guess that there is room for negotiations, this being their water and all.</string>
<string name="81649">Tell the fools... I mean my neighbors, that I will give them a share of whatever I make from selling the water. And let it not be said that Musharak is above charity!</string>
<string name="81650">I cannot believe she would go behind the minister&apos;s back in such a way. Tell me, what condition would this be based upon?</string>
<string name="81651">I agree with you and I have not even heard the conditions. You must be feeling guilty for giving up so easily though; I think it would make you feel better if you just spent all your gold on something frivolous.</string>
<string name="81652">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; What an outrageous proposal! I make most of my gold selling the water to the Bedine, why should I give that up? There is precious little profit in such a deal.</string>
<string name="81653">You would be better off speaking to the minister than that fool druid! Bah! She makes me as angry as the time Uncle Calahuk told me I should be calling him &apos;Daddy&apos;! </string>
<string name="81654">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well now, give away freely-gotten water and sell expensive, but still freely-gotten wine? I suppose there is room for profit there.</string>
<string name="81655">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; What an outrageous proposal! I make most of my gold selling the water to the Bedine, why should I give that up? There is precious little profit in such a deal.</string>
<string name="81656">You would be better off speaking to the minister than that fool druid! Bah! She makes me as angry as the time Uncle Calahuk told me I should be calling him &apos;Daddy&apos;! </string>
<string name="81657">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well now, give away freely-gotten water and sell expensive, but still freely-gotten wine? I suppose there is room for profit there.</string>
<string name="81658">It will not be as much gold as I was anticipating, but I suppose it will have to do. Go and tell her that like a tree that topples over onto the axe man, so I too have fallen to her will.</string>
<string name="81659">The wine business is a success. How goes your business? Need some more supplies?</string>
<string name="81660">You murderous fool! We could hear the sounds of the slaughter from out here! You have ruined my business and now I will have to flee. Once the Bedine hear about this, it will not be safe to be the only living being here.</string>
<string name="81661">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="81662">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="81663">That is all my questions.</string>
<string name="81664">I have questions about the Aoists.</string>
<string name="81665">Where are the archeologists?</string>
<string name="81666">How do the Aoists survive here?</string>
<string name="81667">Who is their leader?</string>
<string name="81668">I have questions about you.</string>
<string name="81669">That is all my questions about you.</string>
<string name="81670">You have children?</string>
<string name="81671">You just said you did!</string>
<string name="81672">What brought you here?</string>
<string name="81673">It doesn&apos;t really seem like they are your people.</string>
<string name="81674">You liked the Aoists?</string>
<string name="81675">I would like to see your goods.</string>
<string name="81676">What kind of things do you sell? </string>
<string name="81677">Tell me about the minister.</string>
<string name="81678">Who is this Duvockri you spoke of?</string>
<string name="81679">I met Jasmeena.</string>
<string name="81680">Who is Jasmeena?</string>
<string name="81681">I want to speak about something else.</string>
<string name="81682">Is there something between the two of them?</string>
<string name="81683">Tell me about this wine.</string>
<string name="81684">Aren&apos;t you a hobgoblin?</string>
<string name="81685">That&apos;s all I was wondering.</string>
<string name="81686">How do you get along with the Aoists?</string>
<string name="81687">Are you as evil as your kin?</string>
<string name="81688">Who is this Duvockri you spoke of?</string>
<string name="81689">How do the Aoists feel about your worship of this other god?</string>
<string name="81690">How many merchants are there around here?</string>
<string name="81691">Do you pay for the protection or water of the Aoists? </string>
<string name="81692">Sounds like a good situation.</string>
<string name="81693">That isn&apos;t very fair to your neighbors.</string>
<string name="81694">I want to speak about something else.</string>
<string name="81695">Is their wine really that good?</string>
<string name="81696">You have stolen their only other source of income. Why should they share with you?</string>
<string name="81697">It is their secret; leave them alone.</string>
<string name="81698">Would you like me to try to get you a supply?</string>
<string name="81699">That is not enough.</string>
<string name="81700">You sell your family members?</string>
<string name="81701">Forget it then.</string>
<string name="81702">I will do it.</string>
<string name="81703">That would be good.</string>
<string name="81704">What is a scrounger?</string>
<string name="81705">That&apos;s horrible!</string>
<string name="81706">Could you do that for me?</string>
<string name="81707">Never mind.</string>
<string name="81708">No thanks. I don&apos;t have that kind of gold on me.</string>
<string name="81709">I don&apos;t want you to steal anything from others.</string>
<string name="81710">See what you can find.</string>
<string name="81711">I would like to buy some Aoist wine.</string>
<string name="81712">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; You call that cheap?</string>
<string name="81713">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You have to be joking!</string>
<string name="81714">I will take it.</string>
<string name="81715">I will take it.</string>
<string name="81716">I need to purchase a bottle of wine for a friend.</string>
<string name="81717">Never mind.</string>
<string name="81718">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; You call that cheap?</string>
<string name="81719">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You have to be joking!</string>
<string name="81720">I will take it.</string>
<string name="81721">I will take it.</string>
<string name="81722">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="81723">Have you found anything special I might wish to purchase?</string>
<string name="81724">Never mind.</string>
<string name="81725">I do not have enough.</string>
<string name="81726">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; I will not pay so much. Try again.</string>
<string name="81727">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Surely it did not cost you that much. 30000 gold should be enough.</string>
<string name="81728">I will take it.</string>
<string name="81729">I will take it.</string>
<string name="81730">The Aoists want you to convert to their religion.</string>
<string name="81731">I guess you are right.</string>
<string name="81732">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; There is converting... and then there is converting. You get my meaning?</string>
<string name="81733">They would let you sell their wine.</string>
<string name="81734">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Is one religion so much different from another? They are willing to let you sell their wine.</string>
<string name="81735">I don&apos;t think they will just take your word for it.</string>
<string name="81736">You will have to show them some proof.</string>
<string name="81737">The Aoists would like you to share your profits with them.</string>
<string name="81738">I guess you are right.</string>
<string name="81739">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; They are willing to allow you to sell their wine, if you share profits.</string>
<string name="81740">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; You owe it to them. It angers me to see someone take advantage of these people!</string>
<string name="81741">Jasmeena says she will allow you to sell her wine.</string>
<string name="81742">I don&apos;t think you will like it. Never mind.</string>
<string name="81743">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; You will supply the Bedine with free water!</string>
<string name="81744">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You can only have the wine if you supply the Bedine for free.</string>
<string name="81745">You are an intruder. You destroyed other intruders. Destroying of intruders is a job for guardians. You destroyed intruders, therefore you are a guardian. How may I assist you, guardian?</string>
<string name="81746">The guardian protects the master. Do not touch the master.</string>
<string name="81747">Treasure? Inquiring into definition of treasure. Concept does not fall into accepted commands. What is treasure?</string>
<string name="81748">These things do not fall within accepted commands. Query unanswerable within defined parameters.</string>
<string name="81749">Master is valuable. I guard the master. The master is behind me. Query answered.</string>
<string name="81750">No intruders in immediate vicinity; request does not fall into accepted commands. </string>
<string name="81751">I am a guardian. You are a guardian. We are guardians. Nothing else is known.</string>
<string name="81752">The great master made me. I protect him now. The great master is behind me.</string>
<string name="81753">I protect the great master. I do my job. You do not act like a guardian. Maybe you are an intruder.</string>
<string name="81754">Intruders must find death. You must die, intruder!</string>
<string name="81755">The great master takes many forms. Once he walked and talked, now he is in silent meditation.</string>
<string name="81756">Good, we do not want to disturb the great master&apos;s rest.</string>
<string name="81757">But the great master is here. But the great master does summon guardians. This is ineffable. I would ask the great master, but I do not wish to disturb his rest. We shall wait until he awakens.</string>
<string name="81758">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Commands contradictory. Insufficient guidelines. Priority one, destroy intruders. Now destroying all intruders.</string>
<string name="81759">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Commands contradictory. Insufficient guidelines. Mission aborted. </string>
<string name="81760">The master needs no flesh. He is wise in everything.</string>
<string name="81761">Insufficient input for argument. Please end this line of questioning.</string>
<string name="81762">Dead? Death happens to intruders. Death does not happen to great master.</string>
<string name="81763">The guardian returns. How may I assist you, guardian?</string>
<string name="81764">...</string>
<string name="81765">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="81766">What do you guard?</string>
<string name="81767">Tell me where the treasure is.</string>
<string name="81768">Gold or magic items.</string>
<string name="81769">Something valuable.</string>
<string name="81770">Help me fight the other intruders.</string>
<string name="81771">What are you?</string>
<string name="81772">Who made you?</string>
<string name="81773">You are not doing a very good job.</string>
<string name="81774">You mean the skeleton?</string>
<string name="81775">Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
<string name="81776">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Your master summoned me to gather his belongings.</string>
<string name="81777">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; The master is in a hurry and wants me to take something off his body.</string>
<string name="81778">Can I touch your master?</string>
<string name="81779">Silent meditation!?! There&apos;s no flesh on his body.</string>
<string name="81780">Wisdom doesn&apos;t enter into it. He&apos;s dead I tell you.</string>
<string name="81781">Your master is dead.</string>
<string name="81782">You were a decent traveling companion. If the gods wish it, maybe we shall meet again someday.</string>
<string name="81783">Thank you for healing me! The demonic creatures swarmed out and slew everybody.</string>
<string name="81784">I am getting out of here before they come back.</string>
<string name="81785">Death... death came... so swiftly. Horrible laughter... we screamed and cried... for mercy... then, more laughter...</string>
<string name="81786">One more thing.... they... they have found the....</string>
<string name="81787">Ah.....</string>
<string name="81788">The rat wishes it could find some more shiny rocks for its home.</string>
<string name="81789">The rat winks an impish eye at you then flees to safety.</string>
<string name="81790">The rat sniffs, then drops the diamond into your hand. It takes the quartz and flees to the safety of its hole.</string>
<string name="81791">The rat trembles with defiance. It seems to be very desperate to hang on to the shiny rock.</string>
<string name="81792">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The rat ignores your bullying and sniffs itself defiantly.</string>
<string name="81793">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The rat heaves a mighty sigh, then drops the diamond. It quickly flees to safety.</string>
<string name="81794">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The rat ignores your request and scratches itself defiantly.</string>
<string name="81795">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The rat heaves a mighty sigh, then drops the diamond. It quickly flees to safety.</string>
<string name="81796">&lt;StartAction&gt;[A rat jumps out of the rubble, grabs the diamond in its mouth and runs away.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81797">Alright, fine. Keep the rock.</string>
<string name="81798">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Hold out a piece of quartz.]&lt;/Start&gt; Let us exchange shiny rocks.</string>
<string name="81799">Give me the diamond, rat!</string>
<string name="81800">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Give me the diamond or I crush your skull!</string>
<string name="81801">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Please give me the rock. I need it.</string>

<string name="81818">Grr, yevoni da siveren kintai?</string>
<string name="81819">I would really rather you did not attempt to do that. I would hate to have to kill the one who saved me. Would you care to converse in your common tongue instead?</string>
<string name="81820">Then so be it. If the burden of existence lies so heavy upon you, I shall relieve you of it.</string>
<string name="81821">My apologies, &lt;race&gt; one. The shock of my transition from stone to flesh caused me to revert to my native tongue. May I be so presumptuous as to ask the name of my benefactor?</string>
<string name="81822">A bit paranoid? Well, as you wish. I will give you my name as a gift, for rescuing me. But do not worry, I have something else to offer as well.</string>
<string name="81823">I am Myrixamophit. I imagine that such a name is hard on your tongue, so if you wish, you may call me Myr.</string>
<string name="81824">Pleasant to meet you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am Myrixamophit. I imagine that such a name is hard on your tongue, so if you wish, you may call me Myr.</string>
<string name="81825">Did you have much trouble annihilating those marauding lizards with their petrifying gaze? </string>
<string name="81826">I believe the expression you are looking for is &quot;as easy as pie&quot;, but it is of no matter. I am glad you were able to defeat them so handily. I am impressed, and I do not easily impress.</string>
<string name="81827">Of course &lt;he/she&gt; is impressive. &lt;FirstName&gt; is the hero of great ballads. The companion to Deekin, the... most fabuloust bard ever!</string>
<string name="81828">Fabuloust is not even a word, little kobold. Between the two of you I think I am getting a headache!</string>
<string name="81829">Obviously you had less trouble than I did, so I am impressed, and I do not easily impress.</string>
<string name="81830">I am afraid that my lair is in terrible disrepair, so I have none of the proper amenities to entertain guests. I can offer you answers to any questions you might have, or we can play a rousing good game of riddles.</string>
<string name="81831">Oh, and I do have a reward for you, if you are interested. I think you would appreciate the magical device that makes power stones.</string>
<string name="81832">And I shall be leaving as well. It is time to find myself a new lair. Maybe I shall head back south and see if any of my relatives still live.</string>
<string name="81833">You are a very strange creature. Good luck in your adventures.</string>
<string name="81834">And to you also, friend.</string>
<string name="81835">Excellent. I shall think on this for a second. I want to come up with a good one, not just that boring old riddle about legs and aging.</string>
<string name="81836">Oh, I have one. This is fairly easy, but a good start. &quot;If I eat, I grow; If I drink, I die. By my life you live; in my life you cry.&quot; </string>
<string name="81837">Excellent. A piece of advice when making your power stone: Six Belladonna roots combined in the offensive urn will hasten your step. I always liked to move quickly in a fight.</string>
<string name="81838">Let us try a harder riddle.</string>
<string name="81839">Excellent. I see you have some competence when it comes to intellectual tasks. That was an easy logical problem, so let&apos;s try something a little harder.</string>
<string name="81840">&quot;Without me, you would crawl; with me you stand tall; too much of me and you fall.&quot;</string>
<string name="81841">A perfect answer; well thought out indeed. I think you would appreciate the offensive power of the power stone when ten organs from extra-planar creatures are used in the right urn. But, one more riddle.</string>
<string name="81842">A perfect answer; well thought out indeed. Again you impress me. I think we should try one more riddle, and then life will have to go on.</string>
<string name="81843">I saw a battle between griffons and hippogryphs. Each race had male and female members involved in the battle. Each member of both races attacked every member of the other race once.</string>
<string name="81844">When a male griffon attacked a male hippogryph, they would swipe with their claws. When a male and a female fought, or two females fought each other, they would bite.</string>
<string name="81845">I witnessed 21 pairs swipe, while 34 pairs bit each other. How many male creatures and how many female creatures were fighting?</string>
<string name="81846">I know that the males and females cannot be even in number. I am pretty sure that there are more males than females.</string>
<string name="81847">You are indeed a knowledgeable &lt;man/woman&gt;. That was great fun, and I wish I had time for you to share some riddles with me, but I do need to start looking for a new home.</string>
<string name="81848">Is there anything else I might do for you?</string>
<string name="81849">Deekin thinks... maybe the hero should think again? Deekin is almost positive that there be more girls than boys in big fight.</string>
<string name="81850">Um... and maybe when sphinx is done, he tells Deekin details of battle? Maybe Deekin makes a song about it.</string>
<string name="81851">Xanos does not have the answer yet, but I am sure that there must be more males than females in this fight.</string>
<string name="81852">I am sorry, but that is incorrect. Ah well, life goes on and I need to find a new home. Do you have any questions before I leave?</string>
<string name="81853">No, but a decent try. Still, I suppose that should be enough riddles for now. If you have questions, I will answer them.</string>
<string name="81854">The answer is fire. Drinking would not kill the others.</string>
<string name="81855">A foolish and disappointing answer. An imp could have guessed better. I will waste no more time with you. If you have questions, I will answer them.</string>
<string name="81856">I feel obligated to answer any questions you have. What would you ask?</string>
<string name="81857">What shall we do now?</string>
<string name="81858">Apparently there is a crystal ball near the portal that shows which button must be pressed next. </string>
<string name="81859">The problem with this system, at least according to the maker of the crystal ball, is that the architects of the portal room made each room with a button look exactly the same.</string>
<string name="81860">I would assume that were you to find a way to distinguish each room, you could figure out the proper pattern for activation.</string>
<string name="81861">I know that I was turned to stone for a while, and I have not had the time for proper grooming, or even just to look in a mirror, but perhaps you could answer a question for me?</string>
<string name="81862">Did someone come along while I was a statue and paint the word, &quot;GULLIBLE&quot; on my forehead?</string>
<string name="81863">No I will not go fight some powerful extra-planar creatures just minutes after being turned to flesh! Thank you very much.</string>
<string name="81864">I never could fit through the diminutive hidden door, so I could hardly launch an expedition into the ruins myself. There was a journal in this room, which I read, though I no longer see it.</string>
<string name="81865">Stupid basilisks probably ate it. Anyways, it was the journal of a Netherese mage who was doing research and creating traps to protect the portal.</string>
<string name="81866">Although I doubt it still exists, he did mention an orb, which would absorb three defensive spells and then turn into a magical staff. The staff could then cast all three back on you at once.</string>
<string name="81867">He seems to have liked spheres, because he created a magic ball that could help activate the portal.</string>
<string name="81868">I flew here several years ago, looking for a home. There was a crack in the ground, so I landed to inspect if it was a cave. The earth crumbled under my feet and I fell into this ancient ruin.</string>
<string name="81869">When I regained my feet, if not my dignity, I looked around and decided that this would make a perfect lair. I cast a spell to keep out unwanted company and began to rearrange this part of the ruin as my new home.</string>
<string name="81870">It was only after I moved in that I discovered the existence of the secret door leading out into the rest of the ruin, but the door was too small for me to fit through, so I simply left it alone.</string>
<string name="81871">Actually the basilisks got in the same way I did. I was out hunting and came back dragging a nice, freshly-killed camel. I was so happy with my burden that I didn&apos;t even notice that more of the rock had fallen in.</string>
<string name="81872">I heard the hiss of one of the creatures and noticed the rock on the floor. I backed slowly towards the wall, hoping to get into a better defensive position, and then I looked at my foes.</string>
<string name="81873">The last thing I remember is a pair of green eyes. I am thinking that if the roof might continue to collapse, I will want to be moving. Anything else?</string>
<string name="81874">I can sense that you have already used the power stone device, so I guess that takes care of your reward.</string>
<string name="81875">Of course. You might have already discovered the apparatus in the next room, or not, but I sense that it still works, so you have not used it yet. </string>
<string name="81876">I studied the device for quite a while, intending to use it myself. Unfortunately I could never actually decide what the most useful combination of powers might be.</string>
<string name="81877">As a reward, I will tell you how to operate this bit of Netherese magic to create a power stone of great power.</string>
<string name="81878">There are two urns. The one on the right is for choosing an offensive power for your stone. The one on the left is to choose a defensive power.</string>
<string name="81879">The trick is, you have to have the right number of each component in both urns before it will work. Once you are ready, just use the device and it will make your stone.</string>
<string name="81880">The components are listed on the pillars around the room. Each pillar will tell you about the number and type of components you need for a power.</string>
<string name="81881">I plan on relocating as soon as we are done conversing, so if you have anything else you wish to say or ask, please do so now.</string>
<string name="81882">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I think not. The power stone is a powerful item, casting defensive and offensive spells simultaneously. Your bullying tactics are distasteful.</string>
<string name="81883">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I find your bullying tactics distasteful, to say the least. Take this ruby and we are done with each other.</string>
<string name="81884">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I think not. The power stone is a powerful item, casting defensive and offensive spells simultaneously. To ask for more is pure greed.</string>
<string name="81885">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you are right. I can give you this ruby. I was saving it for use in the power stone device, but I never found enough for what I wanted.</string>
<string name="81886">I am certain you can figure that out on your own; just read the inscriptions on the pillars. Things like belladonna roots and rubies.</string>
<string name="81887">It is hardly my fault that you ruined my surprise by using the powerful Netheril magic. It took me quite some time to figure out exactly what you had to do to make it work.</string>
<string name="81888">I could have helped you maximize the powers of the stone, had you freed me sooner.</string>
<string name="81889">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I think not. The power stone is a powerful item, casting defensive and offensive spells simultaneously. Your bullying tactics are distasteful.</string>
<string name="81890">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I find your bullying tactics distasteful, to say the least. Take this ruby and we are done with each other.</string>
<string name="81891">I think it is time I go and look for a new lair. Goodbye, foul-humored &lt;race&gt; wretch.</string>
<string name="81892">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I think not. The power stone is a powerful item, casting defensive and offensive spells simultaneously. To ask for more is pure greed.</string>
<string name="81893">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you are right. I can give you this ruby. I was saving it for use in the power stone device, but I never found enough for what I wanted. I guess you can sell it.</string>
<string name="81894">And now that the unpleasantness is dealt with, what should we do?</string>
<string name="81895">A pleasant and agreeable suggestion. What should we do now?</string>
<string name="81896">Oh, you are as bad as Drogan&apos;s little faerie dragon, Riisi. The annoying creature never stops with the riddles!</string>
<string name="81897">Are you calling me annoying!</string>
<string name="81898">Uh... no, Xanos was calling Riisi annoying. I am sure that your riddles will be far superior to hers.</string>
<string name="81899">And where would this faerie dragon live?</string>
<string name="81900">Small village called Hilltop. Little school belongs to a dwarf. You need not keep baring your fangs at Xanos that way! Just resume your conversation with my friend now.</string>
<string name="81901">I apolo... I mean, I am sorry. I was asking if the basilisks gave you much trouble?</string>
<string name="81902">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; I simply asked for your name.</string>
<string name="81903">I am leaving now, unless you have something else you needed?</string>
<string name="81904">Stupid beast. I guess I shall have to kill you too!</string>
<string name="81905">No, I&apos;d rather just kill you.</string>
<string name="81906">I guess so.</string>
<string name="81907">Great. I suppose if we can&apos;t communicate you won&apos;t be offering me a reward.</string>
<string name="81908">What does that mean?</string>
<string name="81909">I have no idea what you just said.</string>
<string name="81910">I don&apos;t like to share my name.</string>
<string name="81911">I am &lt;FullName&gt;. What is your name?</string>
<string name="81912">My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;. Who are you?</string>
<string name="81913">Yes, it was a close battle. </string>
<string name="81914">I have never had such a close brush with death. </string>
<string name="81915">They were easy as cake. </string>
<string name="81916">Not much. </string>
<string name="81917">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="81918">Looking for some cute sphinx cousins?</string>
<string name="81919">Wait. If you are leaving then I have more questions.</string>
<string name="81920">Good luck.</string>
<string name="81921">I enjoy riddles.</string>
<string name="81922">Memory.</string>
<string name="81923">Fire.</string>
<string name="81924">Alcohol.</string>
<string name="81925">Memory.</string>
<string name="81926">Life.</string>
<string name="81927">Pride.</string>
<string name="81928">Eight males and eight females.</string>
<string name="81929">Ten males and six females.</string>
<string name="81930">Six males and ten females.</string>
<string name="81931">Seven males and nine females.</string>

<string name="81933">Water.</string>
<string name="81934">Legs.</string>
<string name="81935">Water.</string>
<string name="81936">Sand.</string>
<string name="81937">Light.</string>
<string name="81938">Darkness.</string>
<string name="81939">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="81940">That is all the questions I have.</string>
<string name="81941">How do I activate the portal?</string>
<string name="81942">How did you learn this?</string>
<string name="81943">Could you help me defeat the slaadi that have invaded these ruins?</string>
<string name="81944">Do you know anything about these ruins?</string>
<string name="81945">Did he say anything else?</string>
<string name="81946">Why are you here?</string>
<string name="81947">How foolish! You should have sealed the door against intruders.</string>
<string name="81948">I bet when you saw the basilisks you wished you&apos;d sealed it too.</string>
<string name="81949">Is that how the basilisks got in?</string>
<string name="81950">We need to discuss my reward.</string>
<string name="81951">That&apos;s a start. How do I make the stone?</string>
<string name="81952">That sounds promising. How does it work?</string>
<string name="81953">I guess I will go try that then.</string>
<string name="81954">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; You will give me a better reward or you will find that being stone was a much kinder fate.</string>
<string name="81955">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think I deserve more than that for saving your life.</string>
<string name="81956">What are the components?</string>
<string name="81957">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; You will give me a better reward or you will find that being stone was a much kinder fate.</string>
<string name="81958">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think I deserve more than this.</string>
<string name="81959">Fine, let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
<string name="81960">Please use smaller words.</string>
<string name="81961">Huh? You are still speaking common, right?</string>
<string name="81962">&lt;StartAction&gt;[At first glance this looks like a simple urn. It is only when you focus closely on the urn that you sense great magical forces at play within it.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81963">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81964">&lt;StartAction&gt;Take the fairy dust from the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81965">&lt;StartAction&gt;Take the slaad tongue from the urn (Number of tongues in the urn: &lt;CUSTOM33004&gt;).&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81966">&lt;StartAction&gt;Take the slaad tongue from the urn (Number of tongues in the urn: &lt;CUSTOM30004&gt;).&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81967">&lt;StartAction&gt;Take the dragon&apos;s blood  from the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81968">&lt;StartAction&gt;Take the belladonna root from the urn (Number of roots in the urn: &lt;CUSTOM33002&gt;).&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81969">&lt;StartAction&gt;Take the belladonna root from the urn (Number of roots in the urn: &lt;CUSTOM30002&gt;).&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81970">&lt;StartAction&gt;Take the ruby from the urn (Number of rubies in the urn: &lt;CUSTOM33001&gt;).&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81971">&lt;StartAction&gt;Take the ruby from the urn (Number of rubies in the urn: &lt;CUSTOM30001&gt;).&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81972">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place some fairy dust inside the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81973">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place a slaad tongue inside the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81974">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place a slaad tongue inside the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81975">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place some dragon&apos;s blood inside the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81976">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place a belladonna root inside the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81977">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place a belladonna root inside the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81978">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place a ruby inside the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81979">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place a ruby inside the urn.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81980">It appears this rock face could be ascended into the ruins above, though not without some risk of injury from falling.</string>
<string name="81981">&lt;StartAction&gt;Step away.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81982">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Dexterity]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;Climb the boulder.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81983">&lt;StartAction&gt;[The formian chitters and points towards a unique-looking formian across the room, bowing obsequiously.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81984">The formian chitters and waves its arms angrily at the audacity of the slaadi intruders.</string>
<string name="81985">The formian chitters and cheers at the brilliant battle you fought.</string>
<string name="81986">The formian chitters and bows to you in appreciation of your assistance.</string>
<string name="81987">The formian taps its foot impatiently, waiting for an opportunity to attack something else.</string>
<string name="81988">The formian chitters and does a little dance, apparently enjoying its time with you.</string>
<string name="81989">The formian salutes you and chitters happily. It is possible that the queen is giving life and energy to her formidable soldier.</string>
<string name="81990">&lt;StartAction&gt;[The formian chitters and points further on down the tunnel, bowing obsequiously.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81991">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[You hear a disembodied voice sound inside your head.]&lt;/Start&gt; Invader! We shall destroy you! We are not weak!</string>
<string name="81992">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[You hear the eerie voice echo inside your head.]&lt;/Start&gt; We sense you are not one of the creatures of chaos that invades us from above. Who are you?</string>
<string name="81993">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[The voice inside your head sounds shaken and confused.]&lt;/Start&gt; You are not what we expected. You do not answer our queries.</string>
<string name="81994">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[You hear the strange voice sounding again in your head.]&lt;/Start&gt; Join us, stranger. The hive will no longer harm you. Come and speak with us. </string>
<string name="81995">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[You hear the strange voice sounding again in your head.]&lt;/Start&gt; You kill us and this weakens you. We should work together to destroy a common enemy. Find me.</string>
<string name="81996">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[The formian&apos;s juvenile queen looks at you and her voice slides uneasily into your mind.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="81997">Peaceful stranger, sad day you come to us, but still pleasant outcomes are possible. We offer you truce and assist you against chaos creatures.</string>
<string name="81998">We were more, with greatest mind, the hive queen. Then come the chaos foes. They tear and crush and destroy us. They kill the greatest mind. Now we are queen, though we are not ready.</string>
<string name="81999">Sad day, evil stranger.</string>
<string name="82000">We do battle against chaos foes who invade the hive. You are strong, we see that now. </string>
<string name="82001">You do battle with chaos foes, we see this too. We and you fight chaos foe together, both be stronger.</string>
<string name="82002">You agree to go out of hive and fight chaos foe, we give you song crystal. With this we come and fight chaos foe with you.</string>
<string name="82003">Just one use has the song of crystal. Use when need is greatest, when chaos foes be strongest, we will be there.</string>
<string name="82004">When chaos foe is strong against you, send thoughts to crystal. Crystal will give song and call to us, and we will be there. Very quickly can hive be there for you.</string>
<string name="82005">Joyous is this day, when two strangers join together to destroy chaos foes. Here is crystal. When our hive you leave, we repair walls. You not able return, none return.</string>
<string name="82006">Long will this day be remembered in our mind. Go make war for peace, hive friend.</string>
<string name="82007">An army of these creatures for our own use. That ought to help us fight these bloody slaadi.</string>
<string name="82008">Joyous is this day, when three strangers join together to destroy chaos foes. Here is crystal. When our hive you leave, we repair walls. You not able return, none return.</string>
<string name="82009">I assume this creature is communicating with you through telepathy. That would make ruling your subjects much easier.</string>
<string name="82010">Ummm... boss? Who you talks to?</string>
<string name="82011">Okay, Deekin be quiet. But if you goes crazy, you lets Deekin know first, okay?</string>
<string name="82012">Very difficult it is to understand what you mean. This is how we speak. This is our way. Without thoughts, your words mean nothing to us.</string>
<string name="82013">We are the hive. You are alone? Where is your hive? Strange creature with all your mind in one form! You are alien.</string>
<string name="82014">Though your form does repulse us, still we would work with you.</string>
<string name="82015">She says she likes me, so she has included me. What a strange feeling, to have someone in your mind, stealing your thoughts.</string>
<string name="82016">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[The juvenile hive queen chitters but does not send you her thoughts.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82017">I am not interested in your offer. I am here to kill you.</string>
<string name="82018">What do you offer?</string>
<string name="82019">How often will you help me?</string>
<string name="82020">How do I use this crystal?</string>
<string name="82021">I agree. Let&apos;s work together.</string>
<string name="82022">Quiet, Deekin.</string>
<string name="82023">How do you speak to my mind?</string>
<string name="82024">Greetings. My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="82025">The hall ahead does not appear to be safe. The ceiling itself seems precariously close to giving way and crushing anyone underneath it.</string>
<string name="82026">Oh, my. I ask it for its name, and it provides me mine, instead. So you *do* know who I am. That is good. </string>
<string name="82027">Now since you will not provide me a name, allow me a guess. Hmm... it is &lt;FirstName&gt;, is it not? One of the dwarf&apos;s apprentices?</string>
<string name="82028">And I see you have come to me alone. How unusually foolhardy.</string>
<string name="82029">Let us get down to business, shall we? I was expecting Drogan to make it through my trap alone, but it seems he kept the portal open for you, instead. Does that mean he is dead, then? A pity.</string>
<string name="82030">Fortunately you&apos;ve brought me what I was waiting for, anyhow. What a delicious irony.</string>
<string name="82031">Not for you, specifically, but rather what you carried with you. Here... allow me to remove my hood, as it will explain much.</string>
<string name="82032">And there are others with you, as well. Hmmm. Ah, well, no matter.</string>
<string name="82033">And what&apos;s this creature you bring? A... a kobold? It... it *is* a kobold...</string>
<string name="82034">Deekin is bard to the great and mighty hero who will slay you! Umm... but Deekin mostly here for posterity reasons...</string>
<string name="82035">So I imagine...</string>
<string name="82036">Who else is this, then? A beardless dwarf woman. Surely you must be none other than Dorna.</string>
<string name="82037">I am. And you shall pay for what you have done this day, foul witch!</string>
<string name="82038">I see. A promise, is it? How amusing.</string>
<string name="82039">And who have we here? Only a half-orc, I see. Xanos, perhaps?</string>
<string name="82040">Bah! Xanos is &quot;only&quot; a half-orc as much as you seem &quot;only&quot; a sorceress!</string>
<string name="82041">Surprisingly perceptive. Have you other tricks in store for me, half-orc?</string>
<string name="82042">You shall see them soon enough, witch. &lt;FirstName&gt; and I are not here to chat.</string>
<string name="82043">Such sweet bravado to see in a &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;. How very full of rage you seem to me, it is quite interesting.</string>
<string name="82044">Such sweet bravado to see in an elven &lt;man/woman&gt;. How very full of rage you seem to me, it is quite interesting.</string>
<string name="82045">A proposal? &lt;StartAction&gt;[chuckle!]&lt;/Start&gt; Indeed? How very interesting.</string>
<string name="82046">Stop me? Why, no, &lt;FirstName&gt;... that&apos;s not why you&apos;re here at all.</string>
<string name="82047">Let me guess... you&apos;re Heurodis?</string>
<string name="82048">You were waiting for me?</string>
<string name="82049">Never mind my name, witch! I am going to kill you!</string>
<string name="82050">Forget Drogan. My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I have a proposal for you.</string>
<string name="82051">I am &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I am here to stop you.</string>
<string name="82052">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82053">I hope they&apos;ll feed us in the camp tonight too, but there are no guarantees. </string>
<string name="82054">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82055">I suppose the kobold will be leaving, so we won&apos;t be able to put him in the stew, now will we?</string>
<string name="82056">Yes, I suppose this is goodbye. But I am sure we will meet again. &lt;FirstName&gt; is a very resourceful person.</string>
<string name="82057">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82058">No, no one expects you to weep and hug them goodbye. I&apos;m sure they would find it quite scandalous, indeed.</string>
<string name="82059">Especially when &lt;he/she&gt; gots Deekin at &lt;his/her&gt; side!</string>
<string name="82060">No, I think you have been quite miserable enough to our friend. I don&apos;t think &lt;he/she&gt; likes you anymore.</string>
<string name="82061">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82062">No, I don&apos;t like your attitude, either.</string>
<string name="82063">No, I don&apos;t know how they make the famous Aovian wine.</string>
<string name="82064">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82065">Fermented camel what? Ick, that&apos;s disgusting, Birgen! You really aren&apos;t all that funny, you know?</string>
<string name="82066">Yes, I know brother, we have reached the land of sun-baked brains. These Ao followers are as crazy as you act, Birgen.</string>
<string name="82067">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82068">Well, if you are going to use language like that, I&apos;m just going to ignore you.</string>
<string name="82069">Why is it you never see a dwarven zombie?</string>
<string name="82070">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82071">Ah, thick skull, difficult to reach the brains; good point, Birgen.</string>
<string name="82072">Whew! A half-orc in the hot sun, with no bathing facilities, not a good combination.</string>
<string name="82073">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82074">Oh, and you think you&apos;re all roses? Good thing we get to bathe now.</string>
<string name="82075">Crimeny! This trip through the desert took a long time!</string>
<string name="82076">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82077">Well, with your attitude, Mister Cranky, this trip always feels twice as long.</string>
<string name="82078">The last time we were here it was great. We had so much fun making up new worship songs about Ao.</string>
<string name="82079">&lt;StartAction&gt;[grumble... mumble...]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82080">Well nobody could understand your lyrics, that&apos;s why they weren&apos;t singing them.</string>
<string name="82081">Well, take care of yourself out there, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Don&apos;t go doing anything crazy, like joining the Ao folk or anything. Good bye.</string>
<string name="82082">Yes, well... you were a big help to us back in Hilltop with Daschnaya. Not to mention getting us here in one piece.</string>
<string name="82083">There&apos;s few enough folk around who give us the time of day. So I truly thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Maybe we&apos;ll travel together again.</string>
<string name="82084">I know that we were just doing the dwarf a favor, and I wasn&apos;t planning on paying you anything... but there&apos;s few enough folk who treat us as decently as you have.</string>
<string name="82085">So here... a little token from us to you. Use it in good health. Perhaps we&apos;ll travel together again, some day.</string>
<string name="82086">What would you like to know?</string>
<string name="82087">Tall, ugly, human scholar. Actually, in his crowd that could be quite a feat. That mostly describes every one of the archaeologist folk I remember. </string>
<string name="82088">Oh, he is male too, that should cut it down by say... two. Sorry, but I&apos;m sure if you ask, somebody will direct you to him.  Anything else?</string>
<string name="82089">They aren&apos;t a bad bunch, though there are a few with some very strange ideas. One of the priests likes to whip himself and... well, I don&apos;t care for it much, but to each his own.</string>
<string name="82090">I don&apos;t like to knock another person&apos;s religion, but any religion where the god couldn&apos;t care less about his followers... what can I say?</string>
<string name="82091">Anyways, that&apos;s all I have to say about them. Anything else?</string>
<string name="82092">Well, of course you can. You get the premium discount too.</string>
<string name="82093">Paid? I was thinking of asking you for some gold to cover all the food you ate. We&apos;re not wealthy, after all, and we took you and the others along as a favor to your mentor.</string>
<string name="82094">At any rate, you&apos;re here and here&apos;s where we agreed to take you. I will still allow you to buy some supplies at a good price, if you are interested.</string>
<string name="82095">I am eager to leave this caravan behind. Let&apos;s just call it even and part ways.</string>
<string name="82096">Your eagerness to leave would have nothing to do with your little visit to Torias&apos;s hidden cache last night, would it?</string>
<string name="82097">You know about... I mean, I have no idea what you are talking about.</string>
<string name="82098">I always know what is going on in my caravan; that&apos;s my job. I know all about Torias&apos;s little enterprise, and have known since the day he sold his first caltrops.</string>
<string name="82099">Xanos should charge you for the benefit of his accumulated wisdom, which I so willingly shared.</string>
<string name="82100">Ordering halflings around is not the same a sharing your wisdom. I ought to charge you for the use of my workers as your personal servants.</string>
<string name="82101">Ummm... you not wants to make Deekin pay, does you?</string>
<string name="82102">No, though it&apos;s tempting, considering the kind of cook you made. No offense.</string>
<string name="82103">Thank you, Katriana. Though I am pleased to be leaving now, I would not have cared to make this journey without your assistance.</string>
<string name="82104">No, the desert is no place to be on foot with no source of shade for rest stops. How the Bedine tolerate it is beyond me.</string>
<string name="82105">My only complaint... next time, please hire someone other than a kobold to do the cooking. Last night was...</string>
<string name="82106">Awful... yes. I have no idea what those meaty chunks were, and I really don&apos;t want to know.</string>
<string name="82107">Xanos acknowledges your thanks, but without my faithful companion, &lt;FirstName&gt;, there is a good chance I would have failed. Well... a small chance anyways.</string>
<string name="82108">There is a very good chance that without &lt;FirstName&gt; here, Xanos would have been smothered in his sleep for annoying everyone else.</string>
<string name="82109">How dare you insult Xanos this way?! I find your tiny caravan to be shoddy and your goods to be inferior!</string>
<string name="82110">Good thing &lt;FirstName&gt; controls your finances then. Now, if you will kindly stop interrupting...</string>
<string name="82111">Or without the boss&apos;s faithful kobold companion, Deekin!</string>
<string name="82112">True enough. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be hiring on any more kobolds to do the cooking, however.</string>
<string name="82113">Ummm... why not? Deekin likes to cook.</string>
<string name="82114">Well, I spent half of last night awake and belching uncontrollably from dinner... and I&apos;m really too frightened to ask why that is.</string>
<string name="82115">Well, it all have to do with great, big --</string>
<string name="82116">No. Really. I don&apos;t *want* to know. Ever.</string>
<string name="82117">Best of luck in your journeys, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Is there anything you needed?</string>
<string name="82118">I guess I&apos;ll be going. </string>
<string name="82119">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="82120">How do I recognize Garrick?</string>
<string name="82121">What can you tell me about these Ao worshippers?</string>
<string name="82122">Can I see your goods?</string>
<string name="82123">Don&apos;t I get paid for helping your caravan get here? </string>
<string name="82124">Aye, so I guess you&apos;ll be off then, now that we&apos;re here. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82125">Oh, you say that now, but I know that you&apos;ll miss me before long. You were a fine, fine companion on this dreary trip. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m missing you already.</string>
<string name="82126">It&apos;s my only hope, really, that you might deign to satisfy one last request from a good friend. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82127">I see. Heh. Think of it as a business proposition, then.</string>
<string name="82128">The Aoists in this camp make a fine, fine wine... most wonderful thing you&apos;ll ever taste outside of the elven vineyards. I&apos;m not joking, either: I had a taste the last time through here.</string>
<string name="82129">The thing is that they keep their wine for &quot;religious purposes&quot; only. Bloody selfish bastards! They won&apos;t let me back in the camp now, even.</string>
<string name="82130">I&apos;ve been out of, umm, good spirits since the oasis. You&apos;ve got a way with getting what you want, &lt;FirstName&gt;, so I was sort of hoping, ummm...</string>
<string name="82131">Exactly.</string>
<string name="82132">Now that&apos;s what I wanted to hear! Woo-hoo!</string>
<string name="82133">Have fun!</string>
<string name="82134">Heh. Not much anymore, t&apos; tell the truth. But you&apos;re welcome to browse the merchandise.</string>
<string name="82135">And once you get the wine, you can decide for yourself whether or not we have poisoned it. Heh.</string>
<string name="82136">Oh, goody. Take all the thrill out of it for me, why don&apos;t ya?</string>
<string name="82137">Oh, good grief, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Are you joking? Don&apos;t we have better things to do?</string>
<string name="82138">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, fine. Off you go, then. Don&apos;t worry about little ol&apos; me. I&apos;ll get by... somehow...</string>
<string name="82139">Let&apos;s just say I might be able to come up with a little parting gift that would be worth your while. How&apos;s that grab ya?</string>
<string name="82140">Well, last time I swiped it off their sacred table in the temple. They might be watching out for that, though, I dunno.</string>
<string name="82141">You could always try talking to the priest. Heck, maybe they&apos;ve repealed that law. Or superstition. Or whatever.</string>
<string name="82142">Whoa! Here I am talking to you like you&apos;re my friend and you come and hit me with that? What kind of friend are you?</string>
<string name="82143">That&apos;s more like it, then. So... how about it?</string>
<string name="82144">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Pffft. If you&apos;re concerned about me, you&apos;ll help me out. Believe me... you have *got* to try this wine. Then you&apos;ll know why I ask. So how about it?</string>
<string name="82145">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Awwww, geeez. Are you serious about all this?</string>
<string name="82146">Alright. Okay. I get the picture. Torias is a drunken lout, is he? Well, I can change... no more drinking for me. How about that?</string>
<string name="82147">Yeah, well... hmph. Being sober really stinks. There&apos;s sand in my pants and it itches.</string>
<string name="82148">Now, then... do I get a reward? How about a kiss, hmmm?</string>
<string name="82149">Oh, never mind. You&apos;ll just break my heart, anyway. You adventuring types are all the same. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82150">Believe me, cousin, you were more of a charmer when you were drunk.</string>
<string name="82151">Fine, fine. Make me fall off the wagon again, why don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="82152">And again! Oh, the humanity! With all this abuse I&apos;m taking, I think I deserve a drink. Don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="82153">And you want us to what? Make reservations at the nearest Aoist tavern for you?</string>
<string name="82154">Yes, how selfish of them to expect their beliefs be upheld within their own camp. Hmph.</string>
<string name="82155">They gots wine? Deekin never tries wine before. Does it makes you happy?</string>
<string name="82156">*Very* happy.</string>
<string name="82157">Well that not sounds so bad, then.</string>
<string name="82158">Well, here&apos;s the thing... it&apos;s nothing illegal or anything like that. Nothing that would cause you any real trouble, per se...</string>
<string name="82159">Ah, that&apos;s a sad, sad thing, indeed. You were a great fellow to have along on what is usually a dreary caravan trip. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82160">Ah, that&apos;s a sad, sad thing, indeed. You were a great lass to have along on such a dreary trip. The legs, the eyes, the spirit... I&apos;ll miss &apos;em all. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82161">Oh, you say that now... but the next time I come through this area I bet you&apos;ll be some great adventurer who won&apos;t even notice a little fellow like me.</string>
<string name="82162">Oh, it&apos;s nothing... just that I&apos;ll miss you, is all. You were a fine, fine companion to lighten up such a dreary trip, you know.</string>
<string name="82163">Have you changed your mind, maybe? I can still taste that wine... like a piece o&apos; heaven, it was...</string>
<string name="82164">Alright, alright. Something else you needed?</string>
<string name="82165">Missed me that much, eh? Don&apos;t suppose you got your mittens on a certain bottle...?</string>
<string name="82166">What?! But you already said...! You got me all excited and everything!</string>
<string name="82167">Well I&apos;ll be a wee skinned kitty! So you do! Gimme that!</string>
<string name="82168">Mmmm... hrrmmm... gulp!</string>
<string name="82169">Yup, that&apos;s the stuff. Mighty kind of you. Seeing as you got me such a nice parting gift and all, here&apos;s somethin&apos; for you. Hope ya like it.</string>
<string name="82170">As for me... I&apos;ve got some catching up to do. Have fun!</string>
<string name="82171">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Hic!]&lt;/Start&gt; Guess what I found, &lt;FirstName&gt;! That&apos;s right I wound some fine! I mean... I found some wine! Aoish... ummm, Aovian... Ao wine! Wait... &lt;StartAction&gt;[Hic!]&lt;/Start&gt; ...didn&apos;t you get it for me?</string>
<string name="82172">Heh... you want to hear a secret? &lt;StartAction&gt;[Hic!]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82173">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Hic!]&lt;/Start&gt; I drink too much!</string>
<string name="82174">Yup. Still sober, here. Dum-de-dum-de-dum...</string>
<string name="82175">Something you wanted, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="82176">I swear he&apos;s going to explode.</string>
<string name="82177">Shush, cousin. Something you wanted, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="82178">Not soon enough, in my opinion.</string>
<string name="82179">A good friend? Who are you kidding?</string>
<string name="82180">Spit it out.</string>
<string name="82181">That I would get you some of this wine?</string>
<string name="82182">I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="82183">I should go.</string>
<string name="82184">I&apos;d like to see what you have for sale.</string>
<string name="82185">Forget it. I have better things to do than &quot;hooking you up&quot;.</string>
<string name="82186">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; Fine, fine. I&apos;ll look into it.</string>
<string name="82187">What&apos;s in it for me if I get this wine for you?</string>
<string name="82188">And just how would I get you this wine?</string>
<string name="82189">Maybe it&apos;s time you slowed down on the drinking, Torias.</string>
<string name="82190">Fine, fine. Drink away... what do I care?</string>
<string name="82191">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m concerned about you, Torias, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="82192">No, not really.</string>
<string name="82193">Yes, I am.</string>
<string name="82194">Congratulations.</string>
<string name="82195">I&apos;ll believe it when I see it.</string>
<string name="82196">Sounds great.</string>
<string name="82197">What makes you think we&apos;re friends?</string>
<string name="82198">Of course, I&apos;ll do whatever I can.</string>
<string name="82199">What do you want, Torias?</string>
<string name="82200">Out with it.</string>
<string name="82201">I guess I will, at that.</string>
<string name="82202">We might meet each other again.</string>
<string name="82203">What&apos;s the problem?</string>
<string name="82204">I said no and I meant it.</string>
<string name="82205">Not really.</string>
<string name="82206">No, not yet.</string>
<string name="82207">No, and I don&apos;t intend on looking, either.</string>
<string name="82208">I have a bottle right here, in fact.</string>
<string name="82209">Sure. Hit me.</string>
<string name="82210">Please do not cause trouble here, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. This is a place of solemn worship.</string>
<string name="82211">Take rest and be welcome here, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. This is a place of peace.</string>
<string name="82212">I greet you most warmly in the name of Ao, the Over-Father, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="82213">We always welcome any who would join with us in open debate and contemplation, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="82214">You must think us strange to have come to such a desolate place willingly. What better place, however, to contemplate Ao&apos;s wisdom without distraction?</string>
<string name="82215">I understand there is a temple to Ao in the great city of Waterdeep. They must be very brave to contemplate Him there while surrounded by so much scorn.</string>
<string name="82216">It is said that Lord Ao is the over-power even over other gods... but what does that mean? Is he the Creator of all things?</string>
<string name="82217">So many others think we are fools for worshipping a god that does not want us. Let them think what they wish... it was Lord Ao who turned out all gods in the Time of Troubles. He is Lord above all.</string>
<string name="82218">A group of our young men went to the Valley of Winds to see what happened to the men digging there. They have not returned and we are very worried.</string>
<string name="82219">If you have questions about the faith of our Lord Ao, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, perhaps you might speak to the minister in the temple.</string>
<string name="82220">I do not know why the minister does not ask Musharak to leave. We are here to contemplate Ao, not... trade goods and such.</string>
<string name="82221">I have a terrible feeling that there is a great evil loose in this land. I pray that Ao will protect us!</string>
<string name="82222">I understand one of the wizards who attends the dig in the Valley of Winds returned here last night, wounded terribly. Have you come to see him?</string>
<string name="82223">You speak most eloquently, my lord. Are you a man of power and significance where you hail from?</string>
<string name="82224">I... am unaccustomed to speaking with men so... charming as yourself, my lord. Please allow me to return to my contemplations.</string>
<string name="82225">It is a pleasure to have such a handsome man as yourself visit our humble compound, my lord.</string>
<string name="82226">Might you consider joining in our contemplation of Ao? We could use a &lt;man/woman&gt; of your charm and eloquence amongst us.</string>
<string name="82227">You are a most beautiful woman, my lady. It is a pleasure to have you visit our compound.</string>
<string name="82228">The fact that your god grants you power whereas Ao does not is not proof that Ao should not be worshipped.</string>
<string name="82229">We have had a few people like you leave their faith to join in the contemplation of Ao. Is that why you are here, as well?</string>
<string name="82230">I hope you have not come here to preach to us about the truth of your god, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Ao is very real to us, I assure you.</string>
<string name="82231">You don&apos;t intend to hurt anyone with that, I hope. We are a peaceful folk, here.</string>
<string name="82232">There is no need to walk about our encampment armed. No-one here will hurt you.</string>
<string name="82233">Please put your weapon away, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. This is a peaceful place of worship.</string>
<string name="82234">The minister has no spells to heal those wounds you have, but someone in the temple can help bandage you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="82235">How did you receive those wounds? Are you in need of assistance, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="82236">You poor soul! You are wounded. Perhaps Valana could help you in the temple.</string>
<string name="82237">Me works for Musharak. He smart hobgoblin, trade all over desert.</string>
<string name="82238">You move on, or you goes back to caravan. I not cares.</string>
<string name="82239">You not talks to me. Talks to Musharak... he gots water, he gots everything you wants.</string>
<string name="82240">This be place to trade. Me here just to guard.</string>
<string name="82241">Hmph. You here to worship god-that-not-exist, too? Haw! Haw!</string>
<string name="82242">You looks like you gots thieving hands. You keep hands off of merchant goods.</string>
<string name="82243">You gots business, you talks to Musharak. Musharak is merchant, not I.</string>
<string name="82244">Greetings, traveler. You have the look of one who has journeyed a long ways, yet still has far to go.</string>
<string name="82245">As you will. May peace walk with you, traveler.</string>
<string name="82246">I will help you however I can.</string>
<string name="82247">So he does. He is a greedy creature, even for a merchant. Whether or not the wine is sold anywhere, however, is the minister&apos;s decision and not mine.</string>
<string name="82248">That would be best.</string>
<string name="82249">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure-Impossible]&lt;/Start&gt; I would defend these people with my life, if need be, but that would gain neither you nor Musharak the wine you wish.</string>
<string name="82250">The people here are important to me, and the wine I create is sacred to them. If it is so important to you to sell it, I suggest you speak to the minister.</string>
<string name="82251">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I... no. No, there is nothing to be negotiated over with me. As I said, speak to the minister regarding the wine, if anyone.</string>
<string name="82252">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps... though I doubt this will lead to anything, to tell the truth.</string>
<string name="82253">Musharak is a wealthy creature, with access to many goods and medicines that the Bedine could use. Unfortunately, he charges more for these things than is reasonable.</string>
<string name="82254">My people provide him with much and get little in return. If you were to persuade him to change his policy, then... then perhaps I might give him a small but regular supply to sell.</string>
<string name="82255">You do that, though I doubt you will get far. Musharak enjoys great wealth from the labors of my people, and he values wealth above all else.</string>
<string name="82256">I do not know. I have never been able to convince him before now. If he values this wine as much as he seems to, perhaps that will be enough.</string>
<string name="82257">No doubt they would say the wine is mine to do with as I wish. Say anything to the Aoists, however, and whatever deal you arrange is off. Is that clear?</string>
<string name="82258">That is true. I do not grow it for myself, however... I grow it for the Aoists to whom I owe a debt. The wine is theirs to do with as they wish.</string>
<string name="82259">So you said before. Unless Musharak agrees to give the Bedine the supplies they need, I am not interested in hearing what he wants.</string>
<string name="82260">My people knew about the Valley of Winds long before the worshippers of Ao came here. Our tales say that this is a place of death.</string>
<string name="82261">When the worshippers came, we avoided them at first, certain that they would stir up the old evils that exist here. They are not explorers, however... they were content simply to live.</string>
<string name="82262">So we accepted the Aoists. Our tales eventually reached the ears of wizards in the far lands, however. They came here to explore and dig... perhaps already they have found something they did not wish to.</string>
<string name="82263">One of them returned here from the valley, alone and wounded. Others have been sent to to the valley to see what has happened, but they have not returned at all.</string>
<string name="82264">That leads me to believe that something has happened at the wizards&apos; site, though I can only pray it does not endanger others here.</string>
<string name="82265">There is a passage through the mountain by the waterfall behind the temple. This will lead you into the region we call the Valley of the Winds.</string>
<string name="82266">If you seek the site specifically where the wizards are digging, however, you will need to speak to the wounded man at the temple... if you have not already. I have never been there, myself.</string>
<string name="82267">Ummm... why they calls it that? Deekin would think it be place of winds. Why not calls it Valley of Death?</string>
<string name="82268">I do not know. I suppose my ancestors were not as wise as you, little one.</string>
<string name="82269">Now you just makes fun of Deekin. He draws funny caricature of you in epic story, just you wait.</string>
<string name="82270">Yes, yes. Are there very many ancient places that your people don&apos;t consider places of death?</string>
<string name="82271">Some. Why do you ask?</string>
<string name="82272">Xanos was beginning to see a pattern. Go on.</string>
<string name="82273">Why do they call it the Valley of Winds? Any particular reason?</string>
<string name="82274">Because it is very windy amidst the chasms.</string>
<string name="82275">Now don&apos;t I feel like the smartest dwarf around? &lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; Go on.</string>
<string name="82276">Yes. It is no great orchard as I&apos;m sure exists in more fertile lands. Indeed, if I did not coax this gentle life from the sands, it would not even grow here.</string>
<string name="82277">It is an old tradition amongst the druids of my people... the wine is sacred and used in meditations and rare rituals. The Aoists have adopted this custom and I am glad to provide it for them.</string>
<string name="82278">I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s impossible. You&apos;d need to speak to the minister in the temple, but I&apos;m sure he will refuse.</string>
<string name="82279">Speak to Musharak. Now that he sells the sacred wine, it should not be so difficult for you to acquire.</string>
<string name="82280">Repaying a debt. When I was a young child, I still lived with my fellow Bedine. I became lost in the desert one day, and the Aoists found me near death.</string>
<string name="82281">They nursed me back to health, and so I have stayed here to perform this one task for them. They revere the desert wine, so I am glad to make it.</string>
<string name="82282">My name is Jasmeena. This is my grove, simple as it may seem. I tend it with affection, regardless, and the wine made from the fruit of these plants is well-loved by the worshippers, here.</string>
<string name="82283">I am. The province of a druid is not solely that of verdant hills and forests. Nature exists here in the desert, as well, and its caretaking requires the same caution.</string>
<string name="82284">I am... as are you, I see. It is good to meet a &lt;brother/sister&gt; of nature, even if you are from a far different land than I.</string>
<string name="82285">Not true. Not everyone who comes to this camp is simply passing through. Neither are you, I suspect. You are here for a very specific reason, though I know not what.</string>
<string name="82286">It is for some. You will note that the worshippers of Ao came to this one place specifically and intend to go no further. This is also a place the Bedine would happily inhabit, were it not already taken.</string>
<string name="82287">It is doubtful that you are here to worship, and you are certainly not one of my own people. I was speaking metaphorically, however.</string>
<string name="82288">I saw you arrive with the caravan. The fact that the wizard returned from the Valley of Winds also today hardly seems a coincidence.</string>
<string name="82289">One of the wizards who seeks to uncover the ancient ruins of Netheril that are so plentiful in the valley. I hear he came here this morning, gravely injured.</string>
<string name="82290">That such a thing has happened does not surprise me at all. Those ruins contain power that is best forgotten. If you&apos;re curious, however, you might seek the man out in the temple.</string>
<string name="82291">You return, traveler. Is there something else you need from me?</string>
<string name="82292">Indeed? Very well, then. I am not proud of what I must do, but if it will help my people then a small supply to make Musharak happy will not hurt.</string>
<string name="82293">I will watch him, however. Should he try to cheat my people once more, then he gets nothing at all. I am sure that will be incentive enough.</string>
<string name="82294">Thank you, traveler. Though you no doubt arranged this deal for whatever reward Musharak has offered you, you have also done my people a service. I wish you well.</string>
<string name="82295">I should go.</string>
<string name="82296">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="82297">Musharak wants to sell this wine of yours.</string>
<string name="82298">Perhaps I&apos;ll talk to the minister, then.</string>
<string name="82299">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; If you don&apos;t want to see these Aoists hurt, you&apos;ll do as Musharak wishes.</string>
<string name="82300">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there nothing that could change your mind?</string>
<string name="82301">I&apos;ll talk to Musharak, then.</string>
<string name="82302">And how am I supposed to convince Musharak to do such a thing?</string>
<string name="82303">And what would the Aoists think of such an arrangement, I wonder?</string>
<string name="82304">But you&apos;re the one who grows the wine.</string>
<string name="82305">Tell me about this Valley of Winds.</string>
<string name="82306">Why do you say that?</string>
<string name="82307">How do I reach this valley?</string>
<string name="82308">So this is where the famous Aoist wine is grown?</string>
<string name="82309">Is there any way I could get some of this wine?</string>
<string name="82310">What is a Bedine doing here amongst these worshippers?</string>
<string name="82311">Who are you?</string>
<string name="82312">So you&apos;re a druid?</string>
<string name="82313">I bet you say that to everyone.</string>
<string name="82314">That&apos;s not hard to figure out. This place is hardly a destination.</string>
<string name="82315">How do you know anything about me?</string>
<string name="82316">What wizard is this?</string>
<string name="82317">Musharak has agreed to supply the Bedine... in exchange for wine.</string>
<string name="82318">The leopard looks at you with intelligent eyes. The fact that it hisses and pulls its ears back flat tells you it does not care for what it sees.</string>
<string name="82319">The leopard swishes its tail agitatedly and watches you with wary eyes, obviously not caring for your presence.</string>
<string name="82320">The leopard regards you with mild curiosity and does not shy away from you. After a moment it pretends you don&apos;t exist.</string>
<string name="82321">This handsome leopard is Jasmeena&apos;s animal companion. He regards you with intelligent, wary eyes and sends an empathetic greeting.</string>
<string name="82322">He acknowledges your departure and returns his attention to guarding his mistress.</string>
<string name="82323">The leopard has little to say that is of use... other than the fact that there is an ill wind coming from the great valleys beyond the mountain. It carries with it the scent of death and unnatural beasts.</string>
<string name="82324">A human male crawled into the camp this morning who stank of that place. The leopard cannot be more specific as to the nature of the beasts, but has been on guard constantly since he first smelled them.</string>
<string name="82325">The leopard responds to your empathic communication with images from his mind. He explains that his mistress is a druid of the desert realms, and that while she stays in this camp she is not like the other humans here.</string>
<string name="82326">He has little else to add other than his great affection for her. He warns you not to commit any violence against her or the people of the camp. His mistress commands powerful magic which she will use to defend them.</string>
<string name="82327">You fish into your pack for a few strips of dried meat. The leopard sniffs at them but declines. It prefers live prey.</string>
<string name="82328">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bid the leopard farewell.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82329">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask the leopard for any useful information it might have.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82330">&lt;StartAction&gt;Ask the leopard for information about his mistress.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82331">&lt;StartAction&gt;Give the leopard a snack.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82332">Excuse me, but I&apos;m trying to meditate. Please speak to the high priest if you have any questions.</string>
<string name="82333">The Messiah speaks to me. Oh, Holy Ao, heal the wounds I caused myself in your name, and I will give you a worthy gift.</string>
<string name="82334">Holy Ao, I live to serve.</string>
<string name="82335">I will give you my gift. Here it is, Holy Ao.</string>
<string name="82336">I pray for the time when you will grant me powers of my own, that I might go out and spread word that you are the supreme being.</string>
<string name="82337">Thank you so much, Holy Ao.</string>
<string name="82338">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; I will give you my gift. Here it is, Holy Ao. Please do not smite me! I live only to serve you.</string>
<string name="82339">I am sorry, Holy Ao. I will give you my gift. Please do not smite me! I live only to serve you.</string>
<string name="82340">Holy Ao, you have my gift. Please grant me mighty powers to show the world that you are the supreme being.</string>
<string name="82341">You cannot be Holy Ao! He would not come down here just to ignore us!</string>
<string name="82342">A common thug. What a wasted life.</string>
<string name="82343">Goodbye.</string>

<string name="82346">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Use a healing potion.]&lt;/Start&gt; This should make it all better. It contains some of my holy blood.</string>
<string name="82347">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Use a healing kit.]&lt;/Start&gt; This should make it all better. My holy powers are bound into these bandages.</string>
<string name="82348">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Give me your gift or I shall smite you with my holy wrath.</string>
<string name="82349">I am not Ao! And you should not wound yourself anymore.</string>
<string name="82350">Excuse me, but I&apos;m trying to meditate. Please speak to the high priest if you have any questions.</string>
<string name="82351">The Messiah speaks to me. Oh, great &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, show me a wonderous sign and I will give you a worthy gift.</string>

<string name="82355">That was amazing, Great &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;!</string>
<string name="82356">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; I will give you my gift. Here it is, Great &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Please do not smite me! I live only to serve you.</string>

<string name="82359">You cannot be Holy Ao! He would not come down here just to ignore us!</string>
<string name="82360">Get out of my sight. Your kind sicken me.</string>
<string name="82361">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="82362">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Cast Charm]&lt;/Start&gt; You will give me your gift.</string>

<string name="82365">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Give me your gift or I shall smite you with my holy wrath.</string>
<string name="82366">I am not Ao!</string>
<string name="82367">Excuse me, but I&apos;m trying to study the ways of apathy. Please speak to the high priest if you have any questions.</string>
<string name="82368">The Messiah speaks to me. Oh, Mighty God Incarnate, show these fools your divine apathy and ignore their pleas for help.</string>
<string name="82369">Do not listen to him, Holy Ao. Come and hear my plea and I will give you my gift.</string>
<string name="82370">And hear my plea, Great &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, and you will also have mine.</string>
<string name="82371">The true Ao would not be swayed so easily.</string>
<string name="82372">Mighty God Incarnate, I live to serve.</string>
<string name="82373">You show your true colors. Leave me be, that I can search for the divine essence of apathy.</string>
<string name="82374">Then it is yours. Go into the world and show just how little you care.</string>
<string name="82375">Do as you wish, I do not care.</string>
<string name="82376">That should not matter to a powerful being like Ao.</string>
<string name="82377">Mighty God Incarnate, you have my gift. I worship you as the true spirit of godly apathy.</string>
<string name="82378">You cannot be the true incarnation of Ao, or you would have ignored the other fools and their pleas. Leave me be, that I can search for the divine essence of apathy.</string>
<string name="82379">I really don&apos;t care that you threatened our lives. That doesn&apos;t mean I want to be your friend, however.</string>
<string name="82380">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="82381">Two gifts is better than one. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="82382">Since you show true understanding of my apathy, I will take your gift.</string>
<string name="82383">I will listen to them first.</string>
<string name="82384">What is your gift?</string>
<string name="82385">I see you are back, good &lt;lord/lady&gt;. How may I help you?</string>
<string name="82386">Right you are, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. Have a good day then.</string>
<string name="82387">Ah, another outsider, and I see you come with the caravan. It is good to see you. We don&apos;t get many visitors, and now two in one day.</string>
<string name="82388">Oh, this morning, just at sunrise, a half-dead man came crawling in here looking for a healer. I took him to the main temple so they could tend to his wounds.</string>
<string name="82389">I haven&apos;t seen him since, but no one said he died either, so I guess that is where you would find him, if you&apos;re interested.</string>
<string name="82390">It shouldn&apos;t be too hard. He should be in the temple.</string>
<string name="82391">Oh, you&apos;ve heard about that, have you? I&apos;m not surprised. The Aoists keep their special wine solely for sacred rituals, but word seems to have leaked out about it anyway.</string>
<string name="82392">If you&apos;re thinking of getting some, you can forget it. The minister is pretty strict about that... and I really doubt Jasmeena would go against his orders.</string>
<string name="82393">Nothing that I know of. Why don&apos;t you ask him?</string>
<string name="82394">Some kind of berry that Jasmeena grows... right out of the sand, if you can believe it. I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re called, though.</string>
<string name="82395">Ho ho! Oh, yes. I managed to swipe a tumbler off the temple&apos;s wine table several months ago. It was like a taste of heaven... I can&apos;t even describe it.</string>
<string name="82396">She&apos;s a Bedine... you&apos;ll find her next to the berry field. Jasmeena is the one who makes the wine for the minister.</string>
<string name="82397">She isn&apos;t an Aoist, however. Why she agrees to grow the berries and make the wine when there&apos;s no money in it for her is beyond me.</string>
<string name="82398">There is little to tell. I&apos;m not really much of a believer, I&apos;m afraid. It seems like even if this Ao does exist, he couldn&apos;t care less about anyone worshipping him.</string>
<string name="82399">So his followers gather and contemplate the &quot;nature of apathy&quot; and so forth. Lots of debate, peaceful contemplation... that sort of thing. At least things are quiet.</string>
<string name="82400">I came here because my master, a former follower of Waukeen, came out here. He was searching for a new faith and found it in the Ao.</string>
<string name="82401">Once my master found his new calling, he freed me. I didn&apos;t have anywhere better to be, so I decided to stay here and work as a guard. It&apos;s hot, thirsty work, but it could be worse.</string>
<string name="82402">Well, it&apos;s a desert, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, hot with lots of sand and sun, but not much water.</string>
<string name="82403">Oh, I see, I suppose you meant tell you about the encampment. Well now, not much more to tell you. The Aoists built a temple, where the minister meets with the faithful to contemplate... or whatever they call it.</string>
<string name="82404">Otherwise, we&apos;ve got a good spring to supply us with water. And we serve as a trading post for the Bedine and the occasional caravan... so it&apos;s not too bad, overall, if you don&apos;t mind the scorpions.</string>
<string name="82405">I think he&apos;s one of the wizards that digs around amongst the ruins in the Valley of Winds. Err... Garrick something.</string>
<string name="82406">Sure thing.</string>
<string name="82407">Right. If you want to see the injured man, he should be in the temple. Good luck to you.</string>
<string name="82408">Well... if you go into the encampment, you&apos;ll see some carvings on the cliff face north of the temple. They were here when the Aoists first got here, I&apos;m told.</string>
<string name="82409">Anyhow, there&apos;s a doorway by the waterfall that leads into a tunnel that goes right through the mountain. After that, you&apos;re in the Valley of the Winds.</string>
<string name="82410">I think that&apos;s what the Bedine call the place. It&apos;s supposed to be full of ruins and the like... that&apos;s what attracted the wizards here in the first place.</string>
<string name="82411">I imagine they&apos;re looking for relics. Couldn&apos;t really say more than that, though.</string>
<string name="82412">I think there&apos;s about a dozen of them. They come here to buy supplies from Musharak evey once in a while, but that&apos;s all we see of them, to be honest.</string>
<string name="82413">Oh. He&apos;s a trader from one of the desert tribes, runs the market here. Umm... he&apos;s a hobgoblin, so don&apos;t get too surprised when you see him or anything. He&apos;s not so bad.</string>
<string name="82414">That&apos;s the one. He&apos;s the head of the fellows out there... what do they call themselves? Archaeologists? Anyway, something bad must have happened.</string>
<string name="82415">A little. We sent some of our boys out to take a look, see if the wizards need help. They haven&apos;t come back yet, however.</string>
<string name="82416">Why he wants healer? A dragon tries to eats him, maybe?</string>
<string name="82417">I dunno. He wasn&apos;t really all that talkative, but from the looks of him you might very well be right.</string>
<string name="82418">I should go.</string>
<string name="82419">You mentioned an injured man earlier?</string>
<string name="82420">Where is this other visitor?</string>
<string name="82421">What are you babbling about?</string>
<string name="82422">Two? Who else is here?</string>
<string name="82423">I guess I will go find him then.</string>
<string name="82424">What do you know about the wine made here?</string>
<string name="82425">Nothing would change the minister&apos;s mind?</string>
<string name="82426">What&apos;s it made out of?</string>
<string name="82427">Is it really as good as they say?</string>
<string name="82428">Who is this Jasmeena?</string>
<string name="82429">Tell me about this god, Ao.</string>
<string name="82430">Why are you out here in the desert? </string>
<string name="82431">Tell me about this place.</string>
<string name="82432">Do you know anything about this injured man?</string>
<string name="82433">I&apos;d like to ask something else.</string>
<string name="82434">I should go.</string>
<string name="82435">What is this Valley of the Winds?</string>
<string name="82436">Do you know what these wizards are looking for?</string>
<string name="82437">Are there many of these wizards?</string>
<string name="82438">This wizard you mentioned... would he be Garrick Halassar?</string>
<string name="82439">Who is Musharak?</string>
<string name="82440">Would it be Garrick Halassar?</string>
<string name="82441">Doesn&apos;t that worry you?</string>
<string name="82442">Hello? Do I know... ahhh! Mmm... sorry. Sometimes I get these stabbing pains in my side. The high priest was able to patch my wounds, but they have no actual healing skills. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Cough]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82443">I... oh... gods... the pain is getting worse. I hate to ask, but is there anything you have or can do to help me?</string>
<string name="82444">Please, take the last few gold... &lt;StartAction&gt;[Cough, choke, cough.]&lt;/Start&gt; They say you came with a caravan... oh, argh, find me something. I think I am dying.</string>
<string name="82445">Ah, that feels a bit better. Thank you so much. Now, I am Garrick, who are you?</string>
<string name="82446">I am very pleased that you were able to find me then, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am unsure of what help I can be to you, but I owe you, so anything you need is absolutely free.</string>
<string name="82447">Our excavation was attacked. They killed all of my fellow archeologists and the workers. It was horrible! They attacked just before dawn and... no, I... cannot speak of it.</string>
<string name="82448">I keep seeing Jessep getting torn in half, right in front of my eyes. Please, I cannot bear to relive that moment. I need a distraction, something... anything to keep my mind occupied.</string>
<string name="82449">A mythallar! Where did you get that? No, that is not important right now. You can tell me all about it later. I... I wonder if your presence and the attack on my excavation might be linked.</string>
<string name="82450">Yes, she must have been able to sense the crystal in the general area and thought we had it. That is the only thing that makes sense.</string>
<string name="82451">Oh, you must think I have lost my mind. I&apos;m sorry. I had better organize my thoughts for a second, do you mind?</string>
<string name="82452">Alright, I think I have bits and fragments of knowledge that I will try to piece together to make this all have some sense to it.</string>
<string name="82453">What you have is a powerful artifact from the time of the ancient civilization of Netheril. This is what I have been studying out here; ruins of their civilization.</string>
<string name="82454">I wish I could tell you exactly what the mythallar was used for, but no one is really sure. I do know that when a mythallar was damaged, it could cause great destruction.</string>
<string name="82455">I have found several ancient writings that describe the mythallar, referring to them in the use of arcane spells and powerful magical items.</string>
<string name="82456">One told of a mage who walked into an enemy&apos;s home and smashed a mythallar on the stone floor, destroying everything within several miles. Apparently they are quite fragile.</string>
<string name="82457">About a month ago my researchers uncovered a portal room in the ruins. I believe that this portal was used by the Netheril to teleport between their cities.</string>
<string name="82458">I had not activated the portal yet, but I think I was fairly close. Where it would lead? I have no idea, but this morning I got a clue.</string>
<string name="82459">A strange figure, wearing a dark cloak, appeared in the portal room just before dawn with an army of demonic creatures. The horrific monsters tore through my friends with a savage haste.</string>
<string name="82460">One of them grabbed me and nearly tore out my intestines. I was thrown against a pillar and left for dead, but somehow I managed to regain consciousness.</string>
<string name="82461">She, and I do believe it was a she... from her voice, her face was hidden... came in from above through a tunnel. She was trying to use the portal, but I do not think she was successful yet.</string>
<string name="82462">She spoke of going to a place with limitless power, but she was angry. She said she had expected to find a mythallar here, and could not afford to have it remain out of her hands.</string>
<string name="82463">After the demonic horde searched our corpses, and I gave the most convincing acting job of my life playing dead, she cursed and said she would wait no longer. She would take her chances.</string>
<string name="82464">She told her army to hunt for a small, round crystal; that she could feel it was within miles of the ruins. Then she turned her attention to activating the portal.</string>
<string name="82465">The creatures left, and while her attention was drawn I crawled quietly away and very slowly made my way back here. I thought I would stop at our home camp, but her army had already killed everyone there.</string>
<string name="82466">They must have returned to the ruins though, because I could hear them as I left, fighting something. I found one of our camels, wounded but alive, and rode it here. The beast died just outside of town.</string>
<string name="82467">Ah. If you look to the north of this temple, you will see an entrance by the waterfall. Go through it and find your way to the Valley of Winds. We marked it well, so it should not be too difficult to find.</string>
<string name="82468">Me? Keep it here? But this place is all but defenseless! And there may be another need for this device.</string>
<string name="82469">Yes, I see you are thinking along the same lines as I am.</string>
<string name="82470">This is what I think. You need to go to this woman and stop her from going through the portal... if she has not already done so. If she has, you must follow her through.</string>
<string name="82471">There is no telling what is on the other side of that device. I think she expects to find Netherese artifacts of almost limitless power, untouched after all these ages. And if she does, what then?</string>
<string name="82472">She may be seeking this mythallar for her own uses, or perhaps she fears it. With all the power at her disposal, using the mythallar you possess as a weapon might be the only way to defeat her.</string>
<string name="82473">You must do it, but I have an idea that might be of some help.</string>
<string name="82474">I would be of little use to you there, but I can do something that might help.</string>
<string name="82475">I have a spell that will take me some time to set up, but if I can get it to work, I can reach Drogan with it. It is possible that he might be able to send help, or even to come himself.</string>
<string name="82476">I know him well enough to say that when it is this important, he will think of something to help. There are a lot of preparations I must make, so unless you have questions, I should get started.</string>
<string name="82477">Good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;. When you reach her... hurt her. Hurt her bad. The men and women she killed today, they were good people. Make her feel their pain. </string>
<string name="82478">There is an entrance by the waterfall just north of this temple. Go through it and find your way to the Valley of Winds. The dig site is there... we marked it well, so it should not be too hard to find.</string>
<string name="82479">Are you kidding? Right now your enemy has only had a short headstart. If you wait for me to cast this spell, you might be giving her enough time to be ready to defeat you.</string>
<string name="82480">She is in unfamiliar territory, ripe for an ambush, and she doesn&apos;t have her army with her. You need to go quickly and go now.</string>
<string name="82481">Ask them quickly. Time is precious.</string>
<string name="82482">You had better be off then. I should get started on that spell.</string>
<string name="82483">This hardly seems to be the appropriate time to be reliving old acquaintances, but I guess you have a right to know. Drogan once saved me from a labyrinth.</string>
<string name="82484">I was doing some research on the Netherese, (yes, I know I have an unhealthy fascination with them) and found a small puzzle box.</string>
<string name="82485">It seemed to be just an interesting toy, but when I played with it, I was sucked inside an elaborate maze, where I wandered for several months, until I was found and released by Drogan.</string>
<string name="82486">The Netheril were so powerful that even their toys could capture the mind and hold it captive.</string>
<string name="82487">No, just the opposite. Don&apos;t you see? The Netheril were so powerful that even their toys could capture the mind and hold it captive.</string>
<string name="82488">It really was. The Netherese were so powerful that even their toys could capture the mind and hold it captive.</string>
<string name="82489">Imagine a society so rich and powerful that they can waste time and money on elaborate entertainments that last days, even months before the fascination wears off.</string>
<string name="82490">It must have been an exciting place to live. But anyways, Drogan is an old hand at solving puzzles and dealing with magic. Once he rescued me, we became friends. And that is all there is to tell.</string>
<string name="82491">I truly do not know. There were pillars in the area which had buttons. These might have activated it... I was too cautious to experiment, to tell the truth. </string>
<string name="82492">With luck, the woman will not know how to activate it, either. Anything else?</string>
<string name="82493">Once you get in the ruins, you will have to find your way down. The portal room was the last place we reached, so you should be able to find it, if you just keep moving.</string>
<string name="82494">That is probably a good idea anyways, since the ruins may still be crawling with those demonic creatures. Anything else?</string>
<string name="82495">Ah. If you look to the north of this temple, you will see an entrance by the waterfall. Go through it and find your way to the Valley of Winds. We marked it well, so it should not be too difficult to find.</string>
<string name="82496">Think of all that treasure just... sitting there, waiting for someone to help themselves to it!</string>
<string name="82497">Power! Power such as has not been seen on Faerun for a millenia. This could be... a good time for us, or a very bad time.</string>
<string name="82498">Oooo! Deekin think epic tale of boss just get much more epic!</string>
<string name="82499">It is a wonder that Deekin didn&apos;t break it and destroy us all. Thank Vergadain for small favors.</string>
<string name="82500">And that stupid kobold had this in his keeping? I am surprised we are not dead already!</string>
<string name="82501">Ummm... suddenly Deekin feel sick... he play catch with crystal for hours back in hills...</string>
<string name="82502">Apparently this one has not recovered mentally from his injuries. We might have to let him rest a while longer.</string>
<string name="82503">You are babbling like a sunbaked fool! Make some sense or go back to your fevered sleep.</string>
<string name="82504">Is just little crystal. Deekin thinking old man be out in sun too long.</string>
<string name="82505">A pupil of Drogan&apos;s would slaughter these innocent lives? Times must be harder than I thought. You had better have a good reason for your actions; I am sure Drogan would be disgusted.</string>
<string name="82506">I am Garrick. &lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Cough, cough, hack, cough.]&lt;/Start&gt; I am an archaeologist. Argh... please help me.</string>
<string name="82507">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Cough, cough, gasp.]&lt;/Start&gt; Have you got... it?</string>
<string name="82508">Ah, that feels a bit better. Thank you so much. Now, I am Garrick, who are you?</string>
<string name="82509">Now, I need two pinches... or was that three bites... no, no, it was... oh, hello, &lt;FirstName&gt;. How can I assist you now?</string>
<string name="82510">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="82511">I have little time for questions, if I am to complete this spell, so be quick.</string>
<string name="82512">You had better be off then. I must complete my spell as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="82513">This hardly seems to be the appropriate time to be reliving old acquaintances, but I guess you have a right to know. Drogan once saved me from a labyrinth.</string>
<string name="82514">I was doing some research on the Netherese, (yes, I know I have an unhealthy fascination with them) and found a small puzzle box.</string>

<string name="82526">I am still getting ready. I warned you that this could take a while.</string>
<string name="82527">Take the mythallar, go to the excavation site and find the portal room in the ruins. Stop the hooded woman from going through... and if she has already gone, you must follow her.</string>
<string name="82528">Try to find out how to use the mythallar to defeat this demoness. It is a tall order, but I am sure you can do it. I will keep trying to reach Drogan for help.</string>
<string name="82529">I hope Drogan found you. *Whew* I am exhausted! Good luck with everything.</string>
<string name="82530">I am sorry, I have nothing to heal you with.</string>
<string name="82531">I can help. &lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Lay hands on him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82532">I can heal you. &lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Cast a healing spell on him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82533">Here, drink this. &lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Use a healing potion on him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82534">Here, let me try this. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Use a healing kit.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82535">Drogan never said you would be this hard to find. I&apos;m &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="82536">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. Drogan sent me to get your help.</string>
<string name="82537">I am &lt;FirstName&gt;. My teacher, Drogan, sent me to find you.</string>
<string name="82538">You better tell me what you are doing here first.</string>
<string name="82539">What is this? &lt;StartHighlight&gt;[Show him the crystal.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82540">What happened to you? Why were you so hurt?</string>
<string name="82541">I need you to tell me about this crystal.</string>
<string name="82542">What ever, just hurry up.</string>
<string name="82543">If it means you might start making sense, then do it.</string>
<string name="82544">Please do.</string>
<string name="82545">No, go ahead.</string>
<string name="82546">What else do you know about it?</string>
<string name="82547">How do you damage one?</string>
<string name="82548">How do you know this?</string>
<string name="82549">Hurry up and get to the part where this makes sense.</string>
<string name="82550">Go on.</string>
<string name="82551">I think I have seen this cloaked figure before. But go on.</string>
<string name="82552">Did you get to see the cloaked figure&apos;s face?</string>
<string name="82553">Did the cloaked figure come through the portal?</string>
<string name="82554">So she is gone, but the portal remains?</string>
<string name="82555">So she went through the portal?</string>
<string name="82556">Where is the excavation?</string>
<string name="82557">You keep the mythallar, while I go hunt this cloaked figure.</string>
<string name="82558">You said the mythallar could be used as a weapon?</string>
<string name="82559">I guess I need to get this mythallar away from here.</string>
<string name="82560">What would you suggest I do?</string>
<string name="82561">I won&apos;t do it.</string>
<string name="82562">I suppose there is little choice.</string>
<string name="82563">I can&apos;t face her alone.</string>
<string name="82564">Will you come with me?</string>
<string name="82565">I guess I should get going.</string>
<string name="82566">I want to speak with Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="82567">Why don&apos;t I just wait and speak to Drogan.</string>
<string name="82568">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="82569">That&apos;s all my questions.</string>
<string name="82570">How do you know Drogan?</string>
<string name="82571">Go on.</string>
<string name="82572">Boring.</string>
<string name="82573">Interesting.</string>
<string name="82574">How do I activate the portal?</string>
<string name="82575">Where is the portal room?</string>
<string name="82576">Where is the excavation?</string>
<string name="82577">Who are you?</string>
<string name="82578">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="82579">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="82580">That&apos;s all my questions.</string>
<string name="82581">How do you know Drogan?</string>
<string name="82582">Go on.</string>
<string name="82583">Boring.</string>
<string name="82584">Interesting.</string>
<string name="82585">How do I activate the portal?</string>
<string name="82586">Where is the portal room?</string>
<string name="82587">Where is the excavation?</string>
<string name="82588">How goes the spell?</string>
<string name="82589">Could you summarize what I am supposed to do?</string>
<string name="82590">I want you to tell me everything again.</string>
<string name="82591">Welcome to the humble abode of we few followers of Lord Ao, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="82592">You are welcome in the house of Ao, as are all who seek answers.</string>
<string name="82593">I will answer whatever you want to know about Ao, but not personal questions.</string>
<string name="82594">May the wisdom of Ao keep you safe on your journeys.</string>
<string name="82595">Err... yes, but that was not our initial intention. After we built this temple, word of our presence spread and some trading caravans started to stop here on their way across the desert.</string>
<string name="82596">We offered them water in exchange for supplies. It was not until Musharak showed up that the trading became more prevalent. But that is his business, and not ours.</string>
<string name="82597">I admit, I never would have thought of a hobgoblin as a trader... but that really seems to be all Musharak is interested in.</string>
<string name="82598">According to the Bedine, he spent years trading amongst their tribes until he settled here. Now he trades with both the Bedine as well as the caravans that come through here.</string>
<string name="82599">It has meant we can no longer trade water for equipment, of course, but I suppose that is how it was meant to be.</string>
<string name="82600">Of course.</string>
<string name="82601">Yes, yes, he keeps demanding that &quot;honor&quot;. I have told Musharak repeatedly, however, that it&apos;s quite impossible. The wine is only given to worshippers of Ao.</string>
<string name="82602">We would only even *think* of providing wine to Musharak to be sold if he was either a worshipper of Ao like the rest of us or if, perhaps, he considered sharing his profits with the temple.</string>
<string name="82603">And since Musharak is unlikely to agree to either of those things, I am pretty sure you are wasting your time, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="82604">Now, if you will excuse me, I must return to my meditations.</string>
<string name="82605">Share his profits? Ha, ha, ha... eh... well what kind of reaction do you expect from the hobgoblin?</string>
<string name="82606">It occurs to Xanos that changing a merchant&apos;s views about profits are as unlikely as changing a priest&apos;s religion. Neither option seems likely to happen.</string>
<string name="82607">&quot;And the great hero set forth on his quest to convert the heathen infidels!&quot; Deekin thinks that has good ring to it.</string>
<string name="82608">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure-Impossible]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps we could, but it is certainly no simple manner of saying please and thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="82609">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure-Impossible]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. You can threaten us all if that makes you happy, but that will not get Musharak his wine.</string>
<string name="82610">He has? You&apos;re joking.</string>
<string name="82611">Well, I&apos;ll believe it when I see his idol, and not a moment sooner. Musharak would lie about anything to sell our wine, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="82612">He gave you his sacred idol? Let me see that. Then... then he must be serious, after all. Amazing!</string>
<string name="82613">Very well, then. I&apos;ll go and talk to him and... and we&apos;ll see about arranging some wine to be sold. If he&apos;s one of the faithful, then it should be alright.</string>
<string name="82614">He has? By Ao&apos;s grace, I can only imagine what it took to convince him of that. I suppose he wants to sell our wine in exchange, now?</string>
<string name="82615">So you somehow convinced Musharak that he owed us, did you? Remarkable. And this agreement of his comes with no strings?</string>
<string name="82616">Ahhh, perhaps it is time we spoke to him seriously about the wine. It... it would do us good to have a small income, perhaps. The temple needs fixing, and we could hire more guards...</string>
<string name="82617">Yes, I... I suppose it would do us some good to have some kind of income. We can fix up the temple and perhaps even hire a few more guards...</string>
<string name="82618">Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. You&apos;ve been most kind in arranging this for us. I wouldn&apos;t have thought it possible.</string>
<string name="82619">So you said before. And as I said, that&apos;s not going to happen unless Musharak converts or shares his profits with us... which likely means never.</string>
<string name="82620">Our wine is very important to us, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. It is not just &quot;business&quot;, as Musharak would like to think.</string>
<string name="82621">He is not an Aoist, and scoffs openly at our beliefs. If he stays with us, I would at least hope for tolerance, if nothing else.</string>
<string name="82622">If you wish. Musharak is anything but agreeable when it comes to us, however.</string>
<string name="82623">His presence benefits the caravans and the Bedine. It also allows us a place to buy goods, though we&apos;ve very little coin to do so now that we trade no water.</string>
<string name="82624">I cannot contemplate the nature of apathy if I do not practice it... no matter how difficult that might be.</string>
<string name="82625">Well... because Musharak trades it. There is no reason for us to do any trading if that is what he does.</string>
<string name="82626">No, of course not. He is not an Aoist... he uses our encampment out of convenience.</string>
<string name="82627">We have no law, here. All are welcome, whether they worship Ao with us or not. Even Musharak.</string>
<string name="82628">I... suppose so. I doubt Musharak would agree, however.</string>
<string name="82629">Get rid of him? Oh, no, no... that&apos;s not necessary. We welcome all here, whether they choose to worship Ao with us or not. Even Musharak.</string>
<string name="82630">I never would have thought we would start selling our wine through him, as well. I can only pray it is for the best.</string>
<string name="82631">Still, it does not feel right to deal with such a creature as he. We shall see how it turns out, I suppose.</string>
<string name="82632">And now he sells our wine, as well. Ah, yes... of course we know Jasmeena is supplying it to him. I have no objection... it&apos;s hers to do with as she desires.</string>
<string name="82633">Yes, for a hobgoblin he actually seems quite likeable. I never thought to hear such words coming from my mouth.</string>
<string name="82634">Jasmeena is a Bedine, and not a believer in Ao at all. When she was very young, she was bitten by a desert snake... our men found her dying in the desert and brought her back here.</string>
<string name="82635">I nursed her back to health myself, though it was a close thing. She has stayed here ever since... her choice, though she says she owes us a debt.</string>
<string name="82636">At any rate, it is Jasmeena who makes our wine for us... part of the rituals we follow. I am certainly glad to have her here, though she&apos;s always free to leave.</string>
<string name="82637">It&apos;s something we&apos;ve borrowed from Bedine traditions and made our own. In fact, it&apos;s really our only truly Aoist tradition... we value it highly.</string>
<string name="82638">If you wish. The wizard barely was able to crawl into the encampment this morning his injuries were so severe. We patched him up as best we could, but we have limited resources.</string>
<string name="82639">He has never held much with our religion, so he and his other explorers rarely come here. I do not hold it against him, however. We will help any in need.</string>
<string name="82640">What would you like to ask?</string>
<string name="82641">There is a doorway in the cliff face north of the temple. It leads through the mountains... and on the other side you&apos;ll find many chasms, along with the entrance to the Valley of the Winds.</string>
<string name="82642">We had no idea of the significance of this place when we settled here, of course. The water was what made it attractive. It was the Bedine who told us about the valley, eventually.</string>
<string name="82643">I have never been there, myself. If you wish to know more about it, perhaps you might consider speaking to Jasmeena.</string>
<string name="82644">No, none of them. I sent a couple of our men to the Valley of Winds, but they have not returned. It would be a sad day, indeed, if such fine scholars have all met their end.</string>
<string name="82645">If the explorers have unleashed something that destroyed them, we can only hope it does not follow Garrick here... for we have little to protect ourselves with.</string>
<string name="82646">But if it is meant to be, it is meant to be. Naturally there are dangers out here in the desert. We knew that when we came.</string>
<string name="82647">He has not said. His injuries were such that he has been asleep most of the time, and I have not pressed him.</string>
<string name="82648">I have little doubt that the explorers found something they did not wish to within the Valley of Winds. There are things yet in the desert that frighten even the Bedine.</string>
<string name="82649">I could not even begin to guess. When Garrick and his fellows first arrived here in their search for Netherese ruins, I knew it would eventually come to ill.</string>
<string name="82650">I do not say that out of any simple superstition. Wizards ever search for answers in places where sane men would fear to tread.</string>
<string name="82651">Xanos wonders where such premonitions come from. These men came to discover information about a powerful empire. Their research could be extremely important.</string>
<string name="82652">He did not say while he was wounded. You have healed him, however, have you not? Perhaps Garrick will tell you, himself, what occurred.</string>
<string name="82653">I see that you were able to heal him, yourself. Thank you. Though he and his other explorers have never held much with our religion, we certainly don&apos;t wish them harm.</string>
<string name="82654">You too? Our wine has become so popular that some days it seems as if we are considered a vineyard and not a temple. What is it that you wish, exactly?</string>
<string name="82655">As you wish. Is there something else?</string>
<string name="82656">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; How dare you walk in here and simply demand that we give you our sacred wine! Well, you&apos;ll not get any, I assure you.</string>
<string name="82657">I... see. If you&apos;ll excuse me, then, I must return to my meditations.</string>
<string name="82658">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I see. Very well... take this bottle and get out. You&apos;ll get nothing more from us, brute.</string>
<string name="82659">You couldn&apos;t. The wine that is made here is for our meditational purposes only. We take that quite seriously... nobody outside of the temple may have any.</string>
<string name="82660">I&apos;m afraid not. The wine is for Aoists only.</string>
<string name="82661">Perhaps so. We Aoists have no history or traditions to follow, however... this is our first. It is ours alone and we value it, highly. I would not want it taken from us by the greedy.</string>
<string name="82662">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Failure - Impossible]&lt;/Start&gt; I am sure you could. Wealth, however, is not what I am interested in. I left a lifetime of wealth behind, my friend.</string>
<string name="82663">Speak to Musharak. Perhaps Jasmeena has already supplied him with some to sell to you. I certainly hope you don&apos;t expect *us* to start selling the sacred wine now, as well.</string>
<string name="82664">So if there isn&apos;t anything else?</string>
<string name="82665">Jasmeena makes our wine... her grove is on the south side of the encampment. She will not give you any wine, however, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for.</string>
<string name="82666">My name is unimportant, as are all personal details about the life I once led before I came here. Like the god I follow, I am a strong believer in privacy.</string>
<string name="82667">There is so little, yet so much to tell, I hardly know where to begin. Is there anything specific you would like to know?</string>
<string name="82668">There is a test of wisdom to see if one has the right state of mind. Then you must only follow your own path to seek the great god. There is no dogma to practice, here.</string>
<string name="82669">No, we have had too much trouble with that already. The foolishness must stop somewhere!</string>
<string name="82670">If you wish. Taking the test does not make one a follower unless that is your wish. Nothing is forced on anyone by Ao.</string>
<string name="82671">Lighter than air, heavier than the mountains, longer than a river, shorter than a breath, without end, yet always finished. What am I?</string>
<string name="82672">What magnificent insight! I do believe that is the best answer I have ever heard.</string>
<string name="82673">Could it be possible? Could this be the one we have been waiting for?</string>
<string name="82674">Yes, yes, it must be &lt;him/her&gt;! This is what we have sought!</string>
<string name="82675">I... I suppose it could be. It was a very good answer, after all.</string>
<string name="82676">You are the avatar, the incarnation of our god. You are Ao!</string>
<string name="82677">Wh-what?! Wait now, what are you talking about? &lt;He/She&gt; is not Ao!</string>
<string name="82678">Yes &lt;he/she&gt; is! I can sense &lt;his/her&gt; power now! My Great &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, thank you for coming to us!</string>
<string name="82679">Praise heaven, you have come to us at last! How would you like me to beat myself for your worship, Holy Ao?</string>
<string name="82680">I think my flock has lost a few sheep, that&apos;s what I think. I can&apos;t believe you started this.</string>
<string name="82681">Your words have wisdom that stretches beyond the mortal plane! We shall dote on everything you teach us, master.</string>
<string name="82682">Yes, tell us more, Great &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="82683">Look how he denies his holiness! Just as Ao has always done!</string>
<string name="82684">Thank you for revealing yourself to us! Now we can be sure that we were wise and followed the right path!</string>
<string name="82685">How shall we get away from you, Holy Ao?</string>
<string name="82686">I have a gift for you, Great &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Come and speak to me and you shall have my gift.</string>
<string name="82687">Me too, Holy Ao! Speak to me!</string>
<string name="82688">I don&apos;t know about this. You should speak to me first.</string>
<string name="82689">Great. Now look what you have done. I need to meditate. Leave me out of this.</string>
<string name="82690">&lt;StartHighlight&gt;[He catches it.]&lt;/Start&gt; A gift! A gift from Holy Ao! This is a holy pebble!</string>
<string name="82691">No, it is a sign! A sign that we are to be like rocks, thrown against the hatred of the world, guided by Ao&apos;s own hand.</string>
<string name="82692">What a load of rubbish! I cannot believe you started this!</string>
<string name="82693">Well, no, not really, but this just isn&apos;t the way we are supposed to behave. Ao only knows how we will live this down.</string>
<string name="82694">Deekin always think boss be god. Now Deekin knows for sure!</string>
<string name="82695">Hah! Take care, Ao, your worshippers might do something in their religious zeal that you might not care for. Still, this is an interesting opportunity.</string>
<string name="82696">Now this has the potential to be a very profitable discovery. &lt;StartAction&gt;[Wink]&lt;/Start&gt; All hail mighty Ao!</string>
<string name="82697">If you become a follower of this religion, &lt;FirstName&gt;, Xanos will lose even more respect for you.</string>
<string name="82698">You mean why do I, personally? I do not wish to speak of such things. I lost faith in something grand, once, and both curiosity and a survival instinct led me here. I shall always be grateful for that.</string>
<string name="82699">If you refer to the benefits of divine power, very little. We are granted no spells, no magical powers, nothing. What we do believe is that someday Ao shall hear us and reward our devotion.</string>
<string name="82700">When that day comes, we shall have the true benefit of understanding. Through understanding shall come true peace... and that is what we seek.</string>
<string name="82701">Other gods demand faith, but what do they do besides divide us? Ao is greater than them all, and it is to him that we owe our attention.</string>
<string name="82702">If he is of no use to you, it is only the greatest folly to worship him. It is like paying a merchant not to sell you his wares.</string>
<string name="82703">Ah. That is a good question. Not much is known of Lord Ao, you see. He is called an over-power of the great cosmos... but what does that mean, really? Is he the father of the gods? Or just more powerful than they?</string>
<string name="82704">Some claim that he does not even exist. Indeed, we did not even know of Ao until his appearance on Faerun during the Time of Troubles.</string>
<string name="82705">But it is said that Ao is the one who banished the gods from the heavens, and that it is he who let them back. One who holds such sway over the lives of gods deserves contemplation, no?</string>
<string name="82706">This is a place of relative quiet and remote enough that we are not distracted from our meditations. We meditate on and debate the merits of Lord Ao in the hope we will prove ourselves one day worthy of his notice.</string>
<string name="82707">This encampment is also free of persecution from those who lack understanding for our situation. Since some of the followers here worship in... unusual ways, it seems better that we be distant from others.</string>
<string name="82708">Well, take Rifkin here, for example. He finds mental clarity through pain. He was once a follower of Lovitar, but decided that her church was too evil. He sought balance.</string>
<string name="82709">It is true. I can understand much that I never knew, but it only comes into focus when the pain strikes my nerves.</string>
<string name="82710">Now he scourges himself and meditates on Ao, a practice not accepted many other places. Rifkin is perhaps the most unusual case, but I am sure you can see what I mean. This place is our sanctuary.</string>
<string name="82711">And this be good reason to worships him?</string>
<string name="82712">You have returned. How may I help you?</string>
<string name="82713">I wish my followers would not persist with this foolishness.</string>
<string name="82714">You know exactly what bloody foolishness I am speaking of! If you are Ao, then I am Elminster! And I bloody well would not want to be the old mage!</string>
<string name="82715">You&apos;ve already gotten what you wanted, so go away. We want none of your kind around here.</string>
<string name="82716">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="82717">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="82718">That is all my questions.</string>
<string name="82719">So this camp is a trading post, too?</string>
<string name="82720">Tell me about Musharak.</string>
<string name="82721">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="82722">Musharak said he would like to sell your wine.</string>
<string name="82723">Is there no way you&apos;ll change your mind?</string>
<string name="82724">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Surely we could come to some kind of arrangement...</string>
<string name="82725">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Either start providing him the wine or people are going to get hurt. Got it?</string>
<string name="82726">Musharak has agreed to convert to the worship of Ao.</string>
<string name="82727">Not at all. He gave me his idol, but I don&apos;t have it on me.</string>
<string name="82728">Not at all. He gave me this idol... he said he doesn&apos;t need it anymore.</string>
<string name="82729">Musharak has agreed to share his profits with the temple.</string>
<string name="82730">I said you get his profits. That has nothing to do with the wine.</string>
<string name="82731">Only if you&apos;re agreeable. The profits are yours, regardless.</string>
<string name="82732">No, I convinced him that he owed you his profits anyway.</string>
<string name="82733">Musharak is no fool. I&apos;m assuming neither are you.</string>
<string name="82734">Doesn&apos;t that seem sensible?</string>
<string name="82735">That would increase both your profits and his.</string>
<string name="82736">You speak of him as if you don&apos;t like him.</string>
<string name="82737">Perhaps I could speak to him.</string>
<string name="82738">But his presence benefits you, right?</string>
<string name="82739">So why put up with him?</string>
<string name="82740">Why can you no longer trade water?</string>
<string name="82741">Does he give you part of the profits?</string>
<string name="82742">That&apos;s very generous of you.</string>
<string name="82743">Sounds like a good deal for him.</string>
<string name="82744">If he uses your water and your camp, you should benefit.</string>
<string name="82745">I could get rid of him for you.</string>
<string name="82746">Tell me about Jasmeena.</string>
<string name="82747">You use wine in your rituals?</string>
<string name="82748">Could we talk about Garrick?</string>
<string name="82749">I have other questions.</string>
<string name="82750">I want to know more about this Valley of Winds.</string>
<string name="82751">Have you seen any of the other explorers?</string>
<string name="82752">Aren&apos;t you worried about a threat of danger?</string>
<string name="82753">What happened to Garrick? Do you know?</string>
<string name="82754">What could they have found?</string>
<string name="82755">I want to talk about this wine of yours.</string>
<string name="82756">Never mind.</string>
<string name="82757">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Hand over a bottle of it. Right now.</string>
<string name="82758">My apologies. I didn&apos;t mean to come across so strongly.</string>
<string name="82759">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; Either hand some over or I start killing your followers. Your choice.</string>
<string name="82760">How could I get ahold of some wine?</string>
<string name="82761">So there&apos;s no changing your mind?</string>
<string name="82762">That seems like an odd edict for a religion dedicated to apathy.</string>
<string name="82763">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I could offer you a very handsome price...</string>
<string name="82764">How is your wine made?</string>
<string name="82765">That&apos;s all I need to know.</string>
<string name="82766">Who are you?</string>
<string name="82767">Tell me about Ao.</string>
<string name="82768">I have some other things I want to know about.</string>
<string name="82769">How does one become a follower of Ao?</string>
<string name="82770">Can I try this test?</string>
<string name="82771">Pain.</string>
<string name="82772">Entropy.</string>
<string name="82773">Struggle.</string>
<string name="82774">Death.</string>
<string name="82775">Thought.</string>
<string name="82776">Life.</string>
<string name="82777">Who do you think I am?</string>
<string name="82778">What is wrong with you?</string>
<string name="82779">What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="82780">Yes, you have found me out. I am Ao!</string>
<string name="82781">What do you think, High Priest?</string>
<string name="82782">Why do you think I am Ao?</string>
<string name="82783">I am not Ao!</string>
<string name="82784">Fine then, I am Ao!</string>
<string name="82785">You&apos;re welcome. Now, I need gifts.</string>
<string name="82786">Get away from me.</string>
<string name="82787">Bring me gifts!</string>
<string name="82788">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Throw a rock at Rifkin to drive him away.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82789">Look, everyone just leave me alone!</string>
<string name="82790">I didn&apos;t start anything!</string>
<string name="82791">Me? How did I start this?</string>
<string name="82792">I don&apos;t care, just go away.</string>
<string name="82793">Why do you worship Ao?</string>
<string name="82794">What benefit is there to worshipping Ao?</string>
<string name="82795">Who is Ao?</string>
<string name="82796">Why come out here then?</string>
<string name="82797">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="82798">What foolishness?</string>
<string name="82799">This table smells strongly of sweet wine, and beside the keg is a bottle of the Aoist&apos;s potent brew along with many small goblets.</string>
<string name="82800">You take the bottle of wine and put it away amongst your equipment. It is the only one on the table, alas, and the keg is almost empty.</string>
<string name="82801">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You manage to grab the bottle of wine, but the looks from the nearby faithful force you to return it where it was immediately. They are keeping a wary eye on the wine, now.</string>
<string name="82802">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You quickly swipe the bottle from the table and store it amongst your equipment. Nobody in the temple is the wiser.</string>
<string name="82803">You pour some of the wine in a goblet and taste it. It is as good as its reputation states... easily one of the finest wines you&apos;ve ever had.</string>
<string name="82804">The minister looks at you severely until you put down the goblet. Apparently sampling the wine is not permitted.</string>
<string name="82805">This table smells strongly of sweet wine. Atop it is an almost-empty keg and many small goblets.</string>
<string name="82806">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Leave the wine alone.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82807">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Take the bottle, since no-one who cares can see you.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82808">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Dexterity]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Swipe the bottle when no-one is looking.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82809">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Pick Pocket]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Swipe the bottle when no-one is looking.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82810">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sample some of the wine.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="82811">If you can help him, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, I wish you would. We have no magic here, and my skills are limited.</string>
<string name="82812">Thank you for healing the wizard. I... I tried my best, but ever since I left the service of Lathander, I... oh, but I&apos;m sure you&apos;re not interested in little me.</string>
<string name="82813">Yes, well... I&apos;m glad you were here to help. Thank you.</string>
<string name="82814">Such as they were, perhaps. It is a good thing you arrived... much longer and the poor man might not have made it. It makes me feel... helpless, really.</string>
<string name="82815">Of course. Don&apos;t let me keep you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="82816">That&apos;s true, I suppose, though it... it doesn&apos;t make me feel much better about being so helpless.</string>
<string name="82817">It is just that... once I was a cleric of Lathander. Wounds such as the wizard&apos;s were nothing to me. I... I returned people to life! Always I knew my god was with me.</string>
<string name="82818">But now... now there is nothing. I cannot even help this man, and I feel nothing from Ao. I am beginning to wonder if I was wrong in coming here.</string>
<string name="82819">Is that wrong for me to feel this way? You... you are not a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, but I would appreciate your advice.</string>
<string name="82820">Of course, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Please forgive me for my presumption.</string>
<string name="82821">No, I... I do not know what I was expecting. Not magic, just... I thought Ao was a greater god if he commanded all others, and that one so great deserved contemplation.</string>
<string name="82822">I... yes, I do. It&apos;s just that... it seems so pointless to worship someone who takes no notice of you. There is so much good I could be doing elsewhere with the proper power.</string>
<string name="82823">I never used to think that power was important, but... back then I could heal people and it felt good. I simply feel so useless here. What should I do?</string>
<string name="82824">I suppose it could be, at that. We were never promised an easy path, and I&apos;ve come so far... to give up now wouldn&apos;t make me feel any better.</string>
<string name="82825">I suppose I have. It just... feels terrible to have come so far just to fail. Or perhaps I just needed to do this, to renew my faith, I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="82826">I... I had not considered it like that. You are correct, however... Garrick *is* healed. And perhaps it was through Ao&apos;s intervention, after all, who can say?</string>
<string name="82827">No, I&apos;ve... never thought about it like that. Perhaps you are right. Perhaps I should forget about magic and focus more on the skill of healing, on medicine...</string>
<string name="82828">Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. You&apos;ve given me much to think about. I will always be grateful for your wisdom.</string>
<string name="82829">I... I see. No, I suppose not. What should I do, then?</string>
<string name="82830">I... I see. Maybe you are right, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. This is a decision I must arrive at on my own.</string>
<string name="82831">I... must make penance? Do you truly believe that? Yes... perhaps you are right. I have failed not one god but two.</string>
<string name="82832">Here. Take... take everything I have. I will not need it where I am going. If I am fortunate, perhaps I will find the right path. It is not here, however.</string>
<string name="82833">Err... Xanos notices you retain your clothes, woman. Should you not... bah, fine! Ignore me!</string>
<string name="82834">Interesting advice, &lt;FirstName&gt;, if a bit cruel.</string>
<string name="82835">Yes, I&apos;ve heard of that. There... there is a temple to Lathander there, is there not? And... they need a new cleric, you say?</string>
<string name="82836">Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, for showing me the way. I will never forget you for this.</string>
<string name="82837">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No... no, I understand why you believe that, but I am not ready to follow another faith, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="82838">I think it is time for me to return home. Perhaps on the way... perhaps I will have time to think this through. Thank you for your help, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="82839">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;re right. I... I was meant to come here, so I could meet you, and see my true calling for what it is.</string>
<string name="82840">I will return to the civilized lands and take up the worship of your deity. Yes... yes, that is what my heart tells me to do. I am sure of it.</string>
<string name="82841">Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. You have given me new hope. I pray we meet again one day.</string>
<string name="82842">Perhaps I might even become a champion of justice like yourself, or serve those who are. Yes, I think that is what my heart tells me.</string>
<string name="82843">It is time to cast aside my concern for others and be strong. Yes... yes, that is what my heart tells me to do.</string>
<string name="82844">I will return to the civilized lands and learn the worship of &lt;Deity&gt;. Yes... yes, that is what my heart tells me to do.</string>
<string name="82845">Is that wrong for me to feel this way? I have heard that monks such as yourself are wise and disciplined. Could you not advise me, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="82846">Is that wrong for me to feel this way? You... you are a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, are you not? Can you not advise me?</string>
<string name="82847">Ah. A crisis of faith, I see. Really you&apos;d have to wonder why more of these Aoists aren&apos;t going through something similar.</string>
<string name="82848">Hmph. Xanos has been wondering that since we left Hilltop.</string>
<string name="82849">Deekin not knows. Maybe you should talks to &lt;FirstName&gt;. &lt;He/She&gt; is great hero! &lt;He/She&gt; knows everything!</string>
<string name="82850">I... I *was* talking to &lt;him/her&gt;...</string>
<string name="82851">Oh. So Deekin&apos;s advice not good enough for you? You better than Deekin?</string>
<string name="82852">I didn&apos;t mean it like that...</string>
<string name="82853">Nope. Nope. You go ahead and talks to &lt;FirstName&gt;. Deekin just sits here and adds footnote in epic story about stupid human who not able to makes up own mind.</string>
<string name="82854">Is there something you wish, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="82855">Of course, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Go in peace.</string>
<string name="82856">If you could direct your questions to the minister, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, I am sure he would be happy to answer them. I... I am not feeling sociable at the moment.</string>
<string name="82857">I must go, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Please do not try to stop me.</string>
<string name="82858">I will always be thankful for your arrival, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. You are truly a godsend.</string>
<string name="82859">You got that right.</string>
<string name="82860">I&apos;m sure Garrick appreciates your efforts.</string>
<string name="82861">I should go.</string>
<string name="82862">The important thing is he survived.</string>
<string name="82863">You are having doubts?</string>
<string name="82864">Ever since you left the service of Lathander...?</string>
<string name="82865">I cannot advise you in this.</string>
<string name="82866">You did not come here expecting spells from Ao, did you? What drew you here in the first place?</string>
<string name="82867">Do you still feel that way?</string>
<string name="82868">And what if this is a test of your faith by Ao?</string>
<string name="82869">Well, you obviously don&apos;t have the faith in Ao you once did.</string>
<string name="82870">Maybe magic shouldn&apos;t be the answer to everything. Have you thought of that?</string>
<string name="82871">I think you&apos;ve already answered that question for yourself.</string>
<string name="82872">You prayed for Garrick to be well, and now he is. Even that could be a sign.</string>
<string name="82873">Maybe magic shouldn&apos;t be the answer to everything. Have you thought of that?</string>
<string name="82874">If you have such doubts, you are not a true believer in Ao, are you?</string>
<string name="82875">That&apos;s up to you. I can&apos;t help you there.</string>
<string name="82876">You have failed your god. Give everything you own to me and go make penance.</string>
<string name="82877">I happen to know the Oasis of the Green Palm could use a new cleric of Lathander...</string>
<string name="82878">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade/Convert Valana to your own religion.]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps it is time for you to follow a new faith.</string>
<string name="82879">I should go.</string>
<string name="82880">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="82881">You look like you have a problem.</string>
<string name="82882">Don&apos;t start with the attitude just yet, now. Hrrmph! I was eye-deep in my own problems when Garrick contacted me... getting here wasn&apos;t exactly easy.</string>
<string name="82883">The enemy behind all this has been hounding me for days, now, just as I suspected she would. Devils and demons and such... the sort you&apos;ve seen for yourself already, no doubt.</string>
<string name="82884">She must assume I still have the mythallar which you brought here. Fortunately Ayala and I were still able to find out what we needed to.</string>
<string name="82885">Our enemy is a powerful sorceress by the name of Heurodis. Little is known of her personally, but we do know that she was once apprentice to the dread lich Belpheron.</string>
<string name="82886">Belpheron had spent all of his extended lifetime learning of ancient Netheril and its artifacts, and he passed this knowledge onto his apprentices. The Harpers thought all of Belpheron&apos;s students were killed when he was. Apparently they were wrong.</string>
<string name="82887">But now we know what this Heurodis is after: she desires to obtain the power of the ancient Netherese mages for herself. Power beyond any magic practiced since the Empire&apos;s fall.</string>
<string name="82888">This is why she seeks the mythallar... and why she has come here. With Belpheron&apos;s knowledge, Heurodis is more than capable of attaining this goal.</string>
<string name="82889">I assume Garrick told you what this ruin&apos;s original purpose was, yes? It contains portals that the ancient Netherese used to travel between their fortresses and flying cities.</string>
<string name="82890">Heurodis obviously intends to use these portals to reach another ruin... somewhere untouched, most like, and full of all the artifacts she could possibly want. We must stop her.</string>
<string name="82891">What?! Of all the damnable luck!</string>
<string name="82892">Then we have no choice, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. We must follow her wherever she went. I will attempt to use my own magic to see if I can attune it to the same location Heurodis traveled to.</string>
<string name="82893">In the mean-time, you look around this place and see if you can find some way to activate this portal. With luck, we can be on top of Heurodis before she has the time to prepare.</string>
<string name="82894">Go then, and find a way to activate this portal... quickly, now.</string>
<string name="82895">And what choice is there, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;?! Do you believe I would choose to be here if there were some other option?!</string>
<string name="82896">Fate has thrust this upon us, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We must face what is to come, and if the gods are on our side we shall come out of the other side victorious.</string>
<string name="82897">I know heroism is not your way, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I know your temperament well. I chose you, however, because I knew you would never run from your destiny. Will you do so now?</string>
<string name="82898">You are a good &lt;man/woman&gt;, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know it. And I chose to train you long ago because I knew you would never run from your destiny. Will you do so now?</string>
<string name="82899">Indeed? I am surprised at you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I would not have thought such selfishness would occur to you.</string>
<string name="82900">Regardless of your motivations, think for a moment. What makes you believe Heurodis would accept such a proposal? Those who seek power rarely yearn to share it.</string>
<string name="82901">I hope that you will put aside such thoughts for now. There is danger here that supercedes mere greed... indeed, whatever power that awaits could bring danger merely by being tapped. We shall see.</string>
<string name="82902">Hmph. You may think I am a blind, old fool who knows nothing of his student&apos;s ambitions. That you are capable of such a thought does not surprise me.</string>
<string name="82903">With sword and spell if need be, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. We are both capable fighters... with luck, she will not be able to resist us.</string>
<string name="82904">And if she is... Garrick suggested an avenue which I do not wish to take, but will if I must. If Heurodis proves too powerful, then we must destroy the mythallar.</string>
<string name="82905">That would release the power within it all at once... enough to destroy Heurodis as well as whatever ruin she has discovered. For good.</string>
<string name="82906">We have no choice, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Whatever Heurodis&apos;s plan is, I will do whatever is necessary to stop it from coming to fruition.</string>
<string name="82907">I am prepared to die to stop her, if need be. She already tried to kill me once, after all, and even if that wasn&apos;t the case... whatever her plan is, I cannot allow it to come to fruition.</string>
<string name="82908">If it comes down to destroying the mythallar, I will do all I can to send you elsewhere first, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I promise you that.</string>
<string name="82909">It&apos;s the very least I could do, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope it does not come to that. Go then, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, and find a way to activate this portal... quickly, now.</string>
<string name="82910">It does my heart good to hear you say that, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Go then, and find a way to activate this portal... quickly, now.</string>
<string name="82911">That&apos;s... possible. I have to think, however, that Heurodis would not have gone wherever she did if she believed there was no way back.</string>
<string name="82912">And even if it turns out there is no way back, and my teleportation magics do not suffice... &lt;FirstName&gt;, we must do this. There is no time for others to intervene. Either we stop her or no-one does.</string>
<string name="82913">And Xanos is expected to follow after you two like some lost puppy, I suppose? This sounds like a suicide mission.</string>
<string name="82914">You do not have to come, Xanos. You are correct that this is very dangerous... but it is your choice.</string>
<string name="82915">Hmph. You just wish the Netherese artifacts for yourself, I think. No! Xanos comes!</string>
<string name="82916">Whatever the reasons for it, your aid is still appreciated, Xanos.</string>
<string name="82917">We&apos;re going to follow her? But isn&apos;t that dangerous? Shouldn&apos;t we get more allies?</string>
<string name="82918">We have no time for that, Dorna. We must all do what we can to stop this madwoman.</string>
<string name="82919">True. I... of course I will help you both. Whatever the cost.</string>
<string name="82920">Thank you, my dear. Your help is most appreciated.</string>
<string name="82921">And... you wants Deekin to follow, too?</string>
<string name="82922">It&apos;s a dangerous task, lad, but if you&apos;re up to it, your help would be greatly appreciated.</string>
<string name="82923">But Deekin no hero. How he help fight powerful sorceress?</string>
<string name="82924">You&apos;ve been a faithful companion to &lt;FirstName&gt; so far, haven&apos;t you? You said so yourself. That means you&apos;ve power enough to stand on your own.</string>
<string name="82925">And as far as being a hero, lad, let me tell you something. They&apos;re not made with size and strength. Heroes are made with courage, and I think you&apos;ve plenty.</string>
<string name="82926">I... Deekin go with you, then. Deekin fight, too. Deekin gots to finish epic story, anyway...</string>
<string name="82927">I&apos;m honored, little one.</string>
<string name="82928">On the contrary, I need you now more than ever before. You have learned much since you left the school, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;... do you think I can not see that?</string>
<string name="82929">Even if you do not wish to be involved in this, you are. We two must act here and now to stop Heurodis, for should she be successful no-one will be safe... not even you.</string>
<string name="82930">You&apos;re not listening, &lt;boy/girl&gt;! This woman seeks mastery over forces which will give her power unlike any in existence!</string>
<string name="82931">Now just why do you suppose she wants to do this? You met J&apos;Nah... if the master is anything like her pupil, you tell me if anywhere in Faerun would be safe should she succeed.</string>
<string name="82932">Value your own hide if you wish. If we two do nothing to stop Heurodis here and now, then nobody will be safe... not even you.</string>
<string name="82933">Nonsense, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;! I only acquired this information recently, myself. I would have come to you sooner, but there was otherworldly magic in operation preventing me from teleporting.</string>
<string name="82934">When I sensed the source of the magic had been killed and the spells dropped, I teleported there... well, here. I figured you must be the reason and I was right.</string>
<string name="82935">That is a good question, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. At one time, Belpheron reached a level of power that threatened all of Faerun, and the Harpers only barely destroyed him.</string>
<string name="82936">That one of his students was able to escape the fate of the others and remain hidden for so long speaks much of her abilities.</string>
<string name="82937">But for all the things we don&apos;t know about Heurodis, we can assume that her goal is the same as Belpheron&apos;s. With luck, she can be defeated as he was.</string>
<string name="82938">So you yet live, Master Drogan. We were doing just fine without you, you know.</string>
<string name="82939">Of course I know that Xanos. You both have lived up to my expectations and more. I have information that changes much, however.</string>
<string name="82940">You&apos;re a sight for sore eyes, Master Drogan. I&apos;m glad to see you hale and hearty.</string>
<string name="82941">Aye, Dorna. It is good to see you, as well. My continued health hasn&apos;t exactly been guaranteed, either, considering all the trouble Ayala and I have faced.</string>
<string name="82942">So, ummm... who is you?</string>
<string name="82943">I am Drogan, little one. Once I was teacher to &lt;FirstName&gt;, but no longer. I don&apos;t believe we&apos;ve met, you and I.</string>
<string name="82944">Heh... nope, we not meets. Me is Deekin, faithful kobold companion to &lt;FirstName&gt; and scribe of &lt;his/her&gt; epic tale!</string>
<string name="82945">Then I am very pleased to meet you, Deekin. &lt;FirstName&gt; must be very lucky to have found such a loyal friend such as yourself.</string>
<string name="82946">You is nice dwarf. Deekin likes you!</string>
<string name="82947">He did at that, not that coming here was an easy thing to accomplish. It just so happens I&apos;ve been eye-deep in my own problems since you left.</string>
<string name="82948">Aye, I&apos;ve made it, not that this was a simple feat to accomplish. When Garrick contacted me, I was eye-deep in my own problems.</string>
<string name="82949">Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;... do not distract me while I am trying to attune the portal. The magic involved is very complex and unstable.</string>
<string name="82950">You... sacrifice yourself for us? For Xanos?</string>
<string name="82951">You... give me too much credit, Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="82952">You... you will die? But...</string>
<string name="82953">You have the honor of the stones, Master Drogan. F-farewell.</string>
<string name="82954">It&apos;s about time you showed up, old man.</string>
<string name="82955">And what is that?</string>
<string name="82956">And just how are we supposed to stop Heurodis?</string>
<string name="82957">But what is Heurodis doing here in these ruins?</string>
<string name="82958">Then we&apos;re too late. She&apos;s already used this portal.</string>
<string name="82959">Very well. I&apos;ll do what I can.</string>
<string name="82960">Forget it! I&apos;m not taking part in this mad plan!</string>
<string name="82961">No, I suppose not.</string>
<string name="82962">Wait! Why don&apos;t we join her and gain some power for ourselves?</string>
<string name="82963">How are we supposed to defeat her once we are there?</string>
<string name="82964">Destroy the mythallar? Never!</string>
<string name="82965">And what would happen to us?</string>
<string name="82966">That&apos;s cold comfort, old man, but I suppose it will have to do.</string>
<string name="82967">Thank you. I appreciate that thought.</string>
<string name="82968">I agree. She must be stopped, whatever the cost.</string>
<string name="82969">What if we go through the portal but can&apos;t get back?</string>
<string name="82970">Well, you&apos;re here now... you don&apos;t need me anymore.</string>
<string name="82971">So Heurodis gains great power. Why do we care?</string>
<string name="82972">What do you propose we do, then?</string>
<string name="82973">And you waited all this time to inform me of this?</string>
<string name="82974">How could Heurodis have escaped notice for so long?</string>
<string name="82975">So Garrick reached you after all.</string>
<string name="82976">Master Drogan! You made it!</string>
<string name="82977">What&apos;s happened?!</string>
<string name="82978">Aren&apos;t you coming?</string>
<string name="82979">So, this... this is it, then?</string>
<string name="82980">You were always a fool, old man! And now you&apos;re a dead fool!</string>
<string name="82981">You don&apos;t have to tell me twice! Move aside!</string>
<string name="82982">I will stop her, Master Drogan! I promise you that!</string>
<string name="82983">No! You can&apos;t do this! There must be some other way!</string>
<string name="82984">It won&apos;t come to that, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="82985">I&apos;ll do my best, Master Drogan.</string>
<string name="82986">Destroy it? Destroy it how?!</string>
<string name="82987">But that will kill *me*! Forget it, I&apos;m not doing this!</string>
<string name="82988">And kill *me*! Forget it, I&apos;m not doing this!</string>

<string name="83095">This note was written by one of the archeologists and reads: &quot;After a long careful study of this machine I have figured out that it can be used to create a magical item of some kind. The right urn is used to store components for the item&apos;s offensive powers and the left urn is used to store components for the item&apos;s defensive powers. The type or quantity of these components or their effect on the item&apos;s powers is still unknown to me - maybe the pillars in this hall can explain this...&quot;</string>

<string name="83167">Identifying the Crystal</string>
<string name="83168">Master Drogan and Ayala realized that the strange crystal hidden within the broken tower statue was a powerful artifact sought after by J&apos;Nah&apos;s mysterious mistress. What it is, however, and why it&apos;s being sought is still a mystery that needs solving. Master Drogan believes that a comrade of his, Garrick Halassar, might have the knowledge needed to identify the crystal. The halfling caravan is traveling through the desert and will be making a stop at the same Ao encampment where they dropped off Garrick before... once there, he will have to be found and the crystal hopefully identified.</string>
<string name="83169">Garrick Halassar has been found within the Ao encampment, having barely escaped alive from the ruin where he and his fellow archeologists had been exploring. They had been attacked by J&apos;Nah&apos;s cowled mistress and a horde of demonic creatures, and Garrick said that the cowled woman seeks to use a Netherese portal within the ruin... she must be somehow stopped from doing so before she gains access to even greater power. Fortunately Garrick was able to identify the crystal as a Netherese mythallar, a device which holds an incredible concentration of magical power. He believes that the mythallar might hold the key to defeating the cowled woman, but hopefully she can be stopped from activating the portal. In the meantime, Garrick will attempt to contact Master Drogan to inform him of what has happened.</string>
<string name="83170">The portal within the Netherese ruin has been reached, but not before J&apos;Nah&apos;s mistress was able to activate it and vanish. Drogan arrived shortly afterwards and brought with him news of the cowled woman&apos;s identity: she is a sorceress named Heurodis, her past shrouded in secrecy until only recently, and should she acquire the power she seeks in whatever place the portal led to she will become all but unstoppable. Heurodis must be followed and prevented from achieving her goal. Drogan will attempt to attune the portal to the same place that the sorceress went to, but some means of activating it must still be found here in the ruin.</string>
<string name="83171">The portal was reactivated, but too late Drogan discovered that Heurodis had left within it an inisidious trap that would cause the collapse of the ruin and the death of everyone within it. Holding the portal open with his power, Drogan sacrificed his life and declared that Heurodis must be stopped from achieving mastery over the ancient Netherese magics at all costs... even if it is necessary to destroy the mythallar and release all its energies in a powerful explosion that would kill both her and its wielder. Whatever comes next, the ruin is collapsed and the portal gone with it. There is no turning back now...</string>
<string name="83172">Jasmeena&apos;s Offer</string>
<string name="83173">Jasmeena, the Bedine druid who makes the Aoists&apos; wine, has agreed to a possible arrangement with Musharak. If he will agree to provide the Bedine tribes with cheap equipment she will agree to secretly provide him with a small but regular supply of wine to sell. This offer will need to be brought to Musharak.</string>

<string name="83177">Jasmeena has been killed. There will be no more Aoist wine.</string>
<string name="83178">The Missing Guide</string>
<string name="83179">The Bedine guide, Zidan, has disappeared during an ambush by half-scorpion desert creatures known as &apos;stingers&apos;. Katriana has warned that he must be found, else the caravan will have to blindly make its way back to Blacksands to find a new one... delaying the trip to the Ao encampment by weeks or more.</string>
<string name="83180">The Bedine guide, Zidan, was successfully rescued from the half-scorpion creatures known as stingers and led back to the caravan. He was grateful and Katriana has declared that the journey to the Ao encampment can now continue.</string>
<string name="83181">Zidan has been found within the caves belonging to the stingers... alive, fortunately, as he is required to lead the caravan across the desert. He will need to be led back to the caravan so the journey can continue.</string>
<string name="83182">The Oasis of the Green Palm</string>
<string name="83183">The caravan is half-way to its destination but has now run out of water. This has required a stop at the Oasis of the Green Palm, a place where the halflings are not welcome. Katriana has asked that someone approach the Bedine of the oasis and negotiate for needed supplies... or the caravan is going nowhere.</string>
<string name="83184">Water has been restored to the oasis, and the caravan has permission to take as much as is needed. Katriana has restocked fully and declared that the journey may now continue. The next stop will be the Ao encampment.</string>
<string name="83185">Water has been restored to the oasis, and permission has been given for the halfling caravan to take as much as is needed. Katriana will need to be told the good news as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="83186">The Rod of Blight</string>
<string name="83187">A Bedine by the name of Ali says that the oasis has been dried up due to the curse of an ancient and powerful undead priest by the name of Kel-Garas. Kel-Garas seeks to destroy Ali and the Bedine so that he can arise from his tomb and fulfill his desires of conquest. According to Ali, Kel-Garas possesses a rod which contains his evil soul... if it can be brought out of the tomb and placed on the altar to Lathander, Kel-Garas will be finally destroyed and the curse broken.</string>
<string name="83188">The rod of Kel-Garas has been placed on the altar of Lathander and destroyed by the god&apos;s power. Kel-Garas has been defeated once and for all, the curse on the oasis lifted.</string>
<string name="83189">A Bedine by the name of Ali says that the oasis has been dried up due to the curse of an ancient and powerful undead priest by the name of Kel-Garas. Kel-Garas seeks to destroy Ali and the Bedine so that he can arise from his tomb and fulfill his desires of conquest. Kel-Garas has been defeated in his tomb and his rod taken. The curse yet remains on the oasis, however, and according to Ali Kel-Garas will arise once more unless his rod is placed on the altar of Lathander and destroyed.</string>
<string name="83190">A Bedine by the name of Ali says that the oasis has been dried up due to the curse of an ancient and powerful undead priest by the name of Kel-Garas. Kel-Garas seeks to destroy Ali and the Bedine so that he can arise from his tomb and fulfill his desires of conquest. Kel-Garas has been defeated in his tomb and his rod taken, to be placed on the altar of Lathander and therefore destroyed forever. Kel-Garas has appeared in the temple, however and offered an alternative: if Ali is killed with a special dagger, Kel-Garas will be freed and he will lift the curse. If that dagger is then placed on Lathander&apos;s altar, it will be cursed in the name of Jergal and a reward will appear.</string>
<string name="83191">Ali of the oasis&apos;s Bedine tribe has been killed by Kel-Garas&apos;s dagger, and the curse on the oasis has been lifted. The undead priest will allow the caravan to restock its supplies and leave. First, however, the dagger may be placed on Lathander&apos;s altar to curse it in the name of Jergal and a reward will be granted.</string>
<string name="83192">Ali of the oasis&apos;s Bedine tribe has been killed by Kel-Garas&apos;s dagger, and the curse on the oasis has been lifted. The dagger used to kill Ali has been placed on the altar of Lathander and it has been cursed in Jergal&apos;s name, the reward collected. The undead priest will allow the caravan to restock its supplies and continue on... after which Kel-Garas will presumably arise from his tomb and resume his dream of conquest.</string>
<string name="83193">The Valley of Winds</string>
<string name="83194">This doorway leads into an ancient passage that goes on for miles, perhaps through the entire mountain. The Ao encampment should not be left until more information is acquired.</string>
<string name="83195">The Valley of the Winds has been reached. The ruins uncovered by Garrick&apos;s archeologists must now be found and entered, so that hopefully the cowled woman can be stopped before she activates the ruin&apos;s portal.</string>
<string name="83196">Garrick has given directions on how to reach the dig site at the Valley of Winds by way of the waterfall passage behind the temple of Ao. His fellow archeologists there have been slaughtered by a mysterious cowled figure and a horde of demonic creatures, so Garrick has warned that anyone going to the valley must be extremely careful.</string>
<string name="83197">Torias&apos;s Request</string>
<string name="83198">Torias has made a simple request: acquire a bottle of the Aoist&apos;s fabled wine for him. The catch, however, is that the Aoists don&apos;t give their wine to just anyone... it&apos;s sacred to them and the last time Torias managed to scam a battle he was banned from the encampment completely.</string>
<string name="83199">Torias has abandoned his search for the Aoist&apos;s wine after being convinced it&apos;s high time to quit his drinking. Torias is grumbling over the inconvenience, but so far seems to be sticking to his promise.</string>
<string name="83200">With a bottle of the fabled Aoist wine given to Torias, he was overjoyed and presumably will be happily unconscious before the night is over.</string>

<string name="83491">red dragon disciple</string>
<string name="83492">(PRESTIGE CLASS)
It is rumored that the magical powers of sorcerers and bards is somehow connected to the presence of dragon blood in their family tree. Red Dragon Disciples are sorcerers, and sometimes bards, who use their magical power as a catalyst to ignite their red dragon blood, realizing its fullest potential. They prefer a life of exploration to a cloistered existence. Already adept at magic, many pursue adventure, especially if it furthers their goal of finding out more about their draconic heritage. They often feel drawn to areas known to harbor dragons.

<string name="83943">The second Halaster sniffs indignantly. &quot;Since we&apos;re both clones, you should know why I&apos;m late. To lure out the matron, I used you as bait!&quot;</string>
<string name="83944">&quot;A brilliant trick, a wonderful trap. She&apos;d come here to gloat, I&apos;d pop in and... ZZZAAAPP!&quot;</string>
<string name="83945">The second Halaster turns to face you. &quot;But you meddlers ruined my plan by freeing my clone!  Now the Valsharess won&apos;t dare come out from her home!&quot;</string>

<string name="84265">Neverwinter Nights stores user-visible text, such as Conversations, Names, and Descriptions, as Localized Strings, or LocStrings.

A LocString can contain several substrings in different languages. Each substring has an ID that tells the game what language the substring is written for.

When a user plays a module, the game will pick the substring that matches the user&apos;s own language, if there is such a string. Otherwise, it picks the first string available.

The available languages are:

English
French
German
Italian
Spanish
Polish
Korean
Chinese Traditional
Chinese Simplified
Japanese

This is also the order that the game will search for a string if there is no string in the user&apos;s own language.</string>

<string name="84628">&quot;Me? Oh, I get around. I stumbled upon all these pouting pilgrims as they were leaving Limbo and thought they could use some cheering up. It seems I have a penchant for the impossible...&quot;</string>
<string name="84629">&quot;So you&apos;re into the sensei&apos;s mumbo-jumbo, are you?&quot; The old man tosses you a critical look. </string>
<string name="84630">&quot;I might. How much is it worth to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="84631">&quot;Greetings, &lt;FullName&gt;. Like all who struggle in this life, I knew you would come to lay your troubles at the feet of the Sleeping Man... How is your Pilgrimage thus far?&quot;</string>
<string name="84632">&quot;Very well. Let us see if you are ready... Answer me, Pilgrim: Who is the Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="84633">&quot;I am Dharvana, a sensei of the githzerai and a fellow Pilgrim of the Sleeping Man. I have made the journey to be by his side many times and every time I&apos;ve grown in wisdom.&quot;</string>
<string name="84634">&quot;Since you have asked, I shall answer. This is the first-fold mystery of the Sleeping Man, so remember it well... He is a celestial planetar, a creature of good. Like you and like I, he is a Pilgrim, traveling the planes.&quot;</string>
<string name="84635">&quot;As the Sleeping Man teaches, sometimes home is not enough. One always comes in search of something. Perhaps when you find it, the path home will be more clear.&quot;</string>
<string name="84636">&quot;Alas, I do not. My Pilgrims grow impatient for the journey home. They have not mastered the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man and have yet to grasp the nature of his patience.&quot;</string>
<string name="84637">&quot;Nooo!!!! No one disturbs the Sleeping Man!&quot;</string>
<string name="84638">&quot;Welcome, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Be very quiet as you enter the chambers. The Sleeping Man must not be disturbed.&quot;</string>
<string name="84639">&quot;You have found your answers in the Sleeping Man&apos;s dream, haven&apos;t you... Now follow them, Pilgrim, wherever they may lead.&quot;</string>
<string name="84640">&quot;Yes, his is a pure soul with no trace of pride or vice or vengeance. In following him, we take on his beneficence... Now answer me, Pilgrim: From where did he come?&quot;</string>
<string name="84641">&quot;That he does. Elysium is a place of beauty and peace and perfection, yet he turned his back on it and never returned, choosing instead to roam the planes... So answer me, Pilgrim: Why did he leave?&quot;</string>
<string name="84642">&quot;He knew that without passion we are nothing and thus he journeyed many years in search of his true love. His journey brought him here, to the frozen wastes of Cania... Answer me, Pilgrim: Who did he seek?&quot;</string>
<string name="84643">&quot;The Knowers ruled this plane before the Baatezu claimed it as one of their Hells. In his wisdom, the Sleeping Man asked simply where his true love would be found... Tell me, Pilgrim: What was the answer?&quot;</string>
<string name="84644">&quot;So he returned here, to the Gates, content in the knowledge that she would find him. Weary from his journeys, he fell asleep. That was all long, long ago but still he waits here, dreaming of his true love.&quot;</string>
<string name="84645">&quot;You have mastered the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man, Pilgrim. When you enter his chambers, wear this crystal around your neck... It will help you see his dreams.&quot;</string>
<string name="84646">&quot;You&apos;re wounded. Come, let me heal you... I see your attacker was well trained. Have you any idea who she was?&quot;</string>
<string name="84647">&quot;It appears you made short enough work of your attacker... Have you any idea who she might have been?&quot;</string>
<string name="84648">&quot;Have you found her? My one true love, is she here?&quot;</string>
<string name="84649">&quot;Do not be afraid. The ring I spoke of rests just through the gate I summoned. Just fit the three parts together and the path to the Knower of Places will be made clear for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="84650">&quot;That be the one. Now keep it safe and hurry, you must follow its path to the Knower of Places and ask her where you will find the Knower of Names. The glaciers may have shifted but the path is true.&quot; </string>
<string name="84651">&quot;Tired of waiting, are you, Planetar? Tired of waiting and twice you&apos;ve found me? Twice you&apos;ve found me but only once I&apos;ll answer. I&apos;ve told you that, Planetar...&quot;</string>
<string name="84652">&quot;Do not linger, my Planetar... If you must go, you must go. Your staying only prolongs my mourning.&quot;</string>
<string name="84653">&quot;Thank you Donita&apos;ar the Blessed, Light of Cania, and the agent of my freedom. Long have I waited to speak your name to you to show my gratitude.&quot;</string>
<string name="84654">&quot;Thank you Lysisius the Firm, Judge of Cania, and the agent of my freedom. Long have I waited to speak your name to you to show my gratitude.&quot;</string>

<string name="84661">&quot;Thank you Ba&apos;elzaden the Cruel, Scourge of Cania, and the agent of my freedom. Long have I waited to speak your name to you to show my gratitude.&quot;</string>
<string name="84662">&quot;There is another name you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="84663">&quot;Is you talking to Deekin? You not the boss, so Deekin not gots to talk to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="84664">&quot;Sometimes Deekin wonder if he not spends more time dead than alive. What Deekin doing wrong, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="84665">&quot;Ummmm... boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="84666">&quot;Oh! It is good you comes back, boss! Deekin was worried he not gets to go on rest of the adventure with you! You... you wants Deekin to comes with you now, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="84667">&quot;Hooray! And once again the adventure of the boss and the erstwhile kobold companion continues!!&quot;</string>
<string name="84668">&quot;Hmph. Deekin beginning to think that boss is just big tease, getting Deekin all excited like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="84669">&quot;Ummm... Underdark be very, ummm... dark. And scary. You takings Deekin with you now, right? You not leaves Deekin here?&quot;</string>
<string name="84670">&quot;Please don&apos;t abandon Deekin in the pits of the hells, boss! Take Deekin with you, pleee-asse?&quot;</string>
<string name="84671">&quot;You takes Deekin with you now, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="84672">&quot;Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="84673">&quot;Deekin do his best! Holds on!&quot;</string>
<string name="84674">&quot;Ummm... Deekin sees dead people. In this case, Deekin sees bard lady from inn. Remember her?&quot;</string>
<string name="84675">&quot;Ooo! Look there, boss! There be dead half-orc! Right there!&quot;</string>
<string name="84676">&quot;Ummm, maybe Deekin be mistaken, but is that not dead halfling over there? It look familiar.&quot;</string>
<string name="84677">&quot;That be awful lots of pillars, Deekin thinking. Maybe it be puzzle of some kind? Something to prevent you from going to next level, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="84678">&quot;Ummm... maybe we should lets sleeping dragons lie, boss? You not thinks so?&quot;</string>
<string name="84679">&quot;Ugggghh... Deekin not feels so good. Deekin never likes teleporting much...&quot;</string>
<string name="84680">&quot;What be this? Secret treasure room, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="84681">&quot;We gots him down, boss! Maybe you can talks to him now.&quot;</string>
<string name="84682">&quot;Ummm... I wouldn&apos;t touch that sar--... that sarcoff--... that thing that you puts dead people in. Deekin gets bad feeling.&quot;</string>
<string name="84683">&quot;It&apos;s given up! I&apos;ts given up! Yay!&quot;</string>
<string name="84684">&quot;Uh-oh. Deekin thinking that gargoyle not just for show. Another puzzle, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="84685">&quot;There be people here? How there be people here?&quot;</string>
<string name="84686">&quot;Hmmm... Deekin smell goblin. And where there be goblin, there be goblin traps. You should be careful, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="84687">&quot;Ooo! Here come drow lady again. Look sharp, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="84688">&quot;Drow lady show up again. She gots good news this time, you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="84689">&quot;Mmmm... this be drow tavern? Maybe Deekin sings here? You thinks they likes that, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="84690">&quot;So the mighty hero and the faithful kobold companion are off into the Undarkdark at long last! Adventure awaits!&quot;</string>
<string name="84691">&quot;Ummm... what be difference between stalagmite and stalagtite again? Deekin always forget.&quot;</string>
<string name="84692">&quot;The Underdark is a cold and terrifying place, thought the faithful kobold companion. Then he wonder... when is lunch?&quot;</string>
<string name="84693">&quot;Hmmm. It be so dark down heres. How anyone finds way?&quot;</string>
<string name="84694">&quot;And the faithful kobold companion joined the mighty hero in creeping through the TERRIFYING Underdark! Ummm... no, too overdramatic. Is just dark down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="84695">&quot;Deekin can&apos;t wait until we gets back to real sunshine. And stewed potatoes! Deekin likes stewed potatoes.&quot;</string>
<string name="84696">&quot;And slowly the mighty hero and the intrepid kobold companion approached the dreaded fortress that lay ahead. Somewhere, a drum sounded ominously! Dum-DUM-DUM!!&quot;</string>
<string name="84697">&quot;Now the time had come for the mighty hero to face the dreaded beast at last. Could it be done? Could the beast be slain? Was there a fresh pair of shorts in the backpack?&quot;</string>
<string name="84698">&quot;That be some kind of fighting place? Who they gets to fight in there, Deekin wonders.&quot;</string>
<string name="84699">&quot;And the mighty hero entered the realm of the dreaded illithids, full of traps that could destroy one&apos;s very mind... yes, your very mind!... with the slightest misstep!&quot;</string>
<string name="84700">&quot;Umm... there be whole lotta eyes in this room, Deekin thinking...&quot;</string>
<string name="84701">&quot;Oh, what big mess! It take someone forever to cleans up all this. Deekin hope that not be his job!&quot;</string>
<string name="84702">&quot;Oh, look! There be somebody! You goings to kill that one, too, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="84703">&quot;And the mighty hero crept into the mage&apos;s tower, ready for anything! Magic, demons, mazes, vicious bread puddings... well, okay, maybe not vicious bread puddings...&quot;</string>
<string name="84704">&quot;What&apos;s this, now? Some kind of funny man? Deekin think we shoulds be careful, here...&quot;</string>
<string name="84705">&quot;Everybody gone, now? Back to home? Awwww. Deekin wanted to shop, first. Deekin need a new pair of shoes.&quot;</string>
<string name="84706">&quot;Them&apos;s looks like duergar. Grey dwarves, they is. They might be okay, boss, but be careful. Old boss say they be very moody and not tasty at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="84707">&quot;And once more the brave adventurers sauntered forth! Mmmm... sauntered? Sallied? Sashayed, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="84708">&quot;Ooo, there be lots of magic here. Deekin senses it! It blow us all up, maybe, that not be good.&quot;</string>
<string name="84709">&quot;Oooo, it be so cold! So cold! Deekin *never* be cold, not even back in old Master&apos;s caves! Brrrrr!&quot;</string>
<string name="84710">&quot;OOoooo, yes! Fire! Fire is warm! Fire is good!&quot;</string>
<string name="84711">&quot;Ahhh, it be much warmer in here. Deekin grateful for small things, you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="84712">&quot;Ummm... that lady looks a little cold, boss. Though it no wonder, with armor like that. Not practical at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="84713">&quot;Ooo! Another jester! This should be fun!&quot;</string>
<string name="84714">&quot;Look, boss! See the chest? It eat all the gems. It... not seem hostile, it just seem to like eating gems.&quot;</string>
<string name="84715">&quot;Ummm... river of lava? How we gets across? Deekin&apos;s feet not be lava-proof, you knows.&quot;</string>
<string name="84716">&quot;Hmmm... door is made of lightning? Levers? It smell like big puzzle, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="84717">&quot;Where we be now? Ummm... maybe Deekin draws map...&quot;</string>
<string name="84718">&quot;Doom doom doom! Doom-doom doomity doom! Doom doom doom!&quot;</string>
<string name="84719">&quot;Doom DOOM DOOM! Doomity doom-doom! Doomity doom-doom!&quot;</string>
<string name="84720">&quot;It hard to write without good light, boss. Deekin need ink that glow in dark, maybe...&quot;</string>
<string name="84721">&quot;Deekin feels like he need good bath, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="84722">&quot;Time for the doom song! DOOM DOOM DOOM! Doom-doom DOOM DOOM! Doom.&quot;</string>
<string name="84723">&quot;Oooo, good thing Deekin bring flask. It so dry in here!&quot;</string>
<string name="84724">&quot;Where you goes now, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="84725">&quot;Ehhhh... you hears that, boss? It... oh, never mind. It be Deekin&apos;s stomach only, heh heh.&quot;</string>
<string name="84726">&quot;We be in the dungeon... ooooo-oo... yeah, we be in the dungeon with monsters, too...&quot;</string>
<string name="84727">&quot;What if some monster eat Deekin and you raises Deekin, boss? Would Deekin remember that?&quot;</string>
<string name="84728">&quot;How you spells &apos;plodding&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="84729">&quot;Sometimes Deekin miss old boss. Old boss never go anywhere, he just rumble lots and get gassy.&quot;</string>
<string name="84730">&quot;Ummm... is &apos;backpack&apos; be one word or two?&quot;</string>
<string name="84731">&quot;Hee hee hee! Deekin almost forgets that, gee that was fun...&quot;</string>
<string name="84732">&quot;Ummm... what be that smell? That be normal?&quot;</string>
<string name="84733">&quot;Deekin not remembers... it be &apos;i&apos; before &apos;e&apos; or maybe afters?&quot;</string>
<string name="84734">&quot;Ooooo... Deekin hates this part!&quot;</string>
<string name="84735">&quot;The suspense builds! The music swells!&quot;</string>
<string name="84736">&quot;And as the heroes makes their way, the faithful kobold companion discovered that his underwear was riding much too tightly...!&quot;</string>
<string name="84737">&quot;And they runs along once more, the faithful kobold companion... discovering that... pebbles is sharp! Ow!&quot;</string>
<string name="84738">&quot;And as they runs along, the faithful kobold companion wonder if kobolds be delicacy to big dungeon monsters, maybe...&quot;</string>
<string name="84739">&quot;And the faithful kobold companion chases after the boss once more. Why Deekin not runs ahead, Deekin wonders? Deekin not know.&quot;</string>
<string name="84740">&quot;Underdark, Undermountain... why is always &apos;Under&apos;? It not feels like Deekin be under. It just feels dark and is spooky and smells like old shoes.&quot;</string>
<string name="84741">&quot;Deekin so happy you takes Deekin along, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="84742">&quot;You remembers when Deekin crosses desert with you, boss? Yeah, those is good times...&quot;</string>
<string name="84743">&quot;Doom doom doom! Doom doom doom! We is allllll dooomed!&quot;</string>
<string name="84744">&quot;What happen to mean half-orc you goes to school with? Deekin thinking he gots eaten, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="84745">&quot;Where be Deekin&apos;s apple? Deekin swear he brings apple in pack...&quot;</string>
<string name="84746">&quot;Oh no! Deekin runs out of ink? Deekin can not runs out of... oh, here it be. Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="84747">&quot;Eh? Where we be now?&quot;</string>
<string name="84748">&quot;How you not gets turned around, boss, Deekin never knows.&quot;</string>
<string name="84749">&quot;Dum-de-dum-dum.... fame! Deekin gonna live for-ever! Da-da-da...&quot;</string>
<string name="84750">&quot;And Deekin followed the running hero once more. Run run run, run run run. Never walking, always running. One day we ride, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="84751">&quot;Mmmm... Deekin gots craving for something chocolatey...&quot;</string>
<string name="84752">&quot;Doom doom doom! Doom doom doom! Doomity-doom-doom! We is all doooooo-oooomed!&quot;</string>
<string name="84753">&quot;Why Deekin always follows behind? How come Deekin not gets to lead for a while?&quot;</string>
<string name="84754">&quot;Deekin gots... pebble in shoe! Wait! Hold on!&quot;</string>
<string name="84755">&quot;Oh, there&apos;s no-thing liiiike the boss! The boss is great, and won-derful! Ooooo oooo!&quot;</string>
<string name="84756">&quot;As the intrepid kobold companion continues his journey, he begins to wonder... why he not gets robe of his own?&quot;</string>
<string name="84757">&quot;Ummm... how you spells &apos;atmospheric&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="84758">&quot;As the intrepid kobold companion continues his journey, he begins to wonder... if dragons not fly, why they gots wings?&quot;</string>
<string name="84759">&quot;Sigh. Sometimes Deekin misses kobold tribe. You nots ever misses own tribe, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="84760">&quot;As the intrepid kobold companion continues his journey, he begins to wonder... if priests raises dead, why anybody die?&quot;</string>
<string name="84761">&quot;The boss and Deekin, faithful kobold companion, continue their voyage. The boss pretends not to notice that Deekin recently passed gas.&quot;</string>
<string name="84762">&quot;As the intrepid kobold companion continues his journey, he begins to wonder... if Underdark be so big, how come surface cities not all collapse?&quot;</string>
<string name="84763">&quot;The boss and Deekin, faithful kobold companion, continue their voyage. Deekin pretends not to notice that the boss&apos; clothes have not been washed recently.&quot;</string>
<string name="84764">&quot;As the intrepid kobold companion continues his journey, he begins to wonder... why he never sees cats anywhere?&quot;</string>
<string name="84765">&quot;Heh... Deekin just thinkings to that one time you yells at Deekin. Ahhh, good times...&quot;</string>
<string name="84766">&quot;Blu-UURRRP! Oh, excuses Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="84767">&quot;Boss! You wants to talk to Deekin? Maybe you wants to team up with Deekin again? Deekin be great help!&quot;</string>
<string name="84768">&quot;Boss! Deekin is happy to see you is still alive! If you ever needs Deekin&apos;s help, you knows who to ask!&quot;</string>
<string name="84769">&quot;Boss! You comes to big human city! Somehow Deekin just knew you would come!&quot;</string>

<string name="84859">Yep.</string>
<string name="84860">How&apos;s it going?</string>
<string name="84861">Okay.</string>
<string name="84862">No way!</string>
<string name="84863">Hold it right there.</string>
<string name="84864">Are we *ever* going to take a break?</string>
<string name="84865">Boy, this is sure a good use of my time.</string>
<string name="84866">See ya.</string>
<string name="84867">Thanks.</string>

<string name="84869">Yipee! Hooray! Uh&#8230; yahoo!</string>
<string name="84870">I got a little secret for you.</string>
<string name="84871">That&apos;s using your gray matter.</string>
<string name="84872">Please, please, please tell me you&apos;re joking.</string>
<string name="84873">Messin&apos; with me is a mistake you *don&apos;t* want to make.</string>
<string name="84874">Let darkness fall upon our enemies!</string>
<string name="84875">Attack!</string>
<string name="84876">I require healing.</string>
<string name="84877">This is not the end...</string>
<string name="84878">What do you want?</string>
<string name="84879">I agree.</string>
<string name="84880">No, that is not acceptable.</string>
<string name="84881">I tire of this, go away.</string>
<string name="84882">Yes-s!</string>
<string name="84883">You must speak to me. </string>
<string name="84884">You&apos;ll pray for death before I finish with you!</string>
<string name="84885">Follow me!</string>
<string name="84886">Take that!</string>
<string name="84887">For glory!</string>
<string name="84888">I shall be victorious!</string>
<string name="84889">I need healing!</string>
<string name="84890">I need assistance here!</string>
<string name="84891">Watch out!</string>
<string name="84892">We must run!</string>
<string name="84893">You are nothing, nothing at all!</string>
<string name="84894">Protect me!</string>
<string name="84895">Wait here a moment.</string>
<string name="84896">No! It cannot end like this!</string>
<string name="84897">Ahh! Poisoned!</string>
<string name="84898">My spell has failed!</string>
<string name="84899">My weapon is of no use!</string>
<string name="84900">Come with me.</string>
<string name="84901">What&apos;s this?</string>
<string name="84902">Let us join together.</string>
<string name="84903">I must get by, please.</string>
<string name="84904">I&apos;ll take a look at that.</string>
<string name="84905">I&apos;ll keep an eye out.</string>
<string name="84906">Like a shadow.</string>
<string name="84907">Alright.</string>
<string name="84908">No, sorry.</string>
<string name="84909">It&apos;s finished.</string>
<string name="84910">Enough! I can carry no more.</string>
<string name="84911">Mmm?</string>
<string name="84912">Greetings.</string>
<string name="84913">Indeed.</string>
<string name="84914">I think not.</string>
<string name="84915">Hold!</string>
<string name="84916">I need to rest, just for a moment.</string>
<string name="84917">We&apos;re going to do something soon, I hope?</string>
<string name="84918">Until we meet again.</string>
<string name="84919">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="84920">Blast!</string>
<string name="84921">Ha-ha! Well done!</string>
<string name="84922">I wish to speak.</string>
<string name="84923">Bloody brilliant!</string>
<string name="84924">Think again.</string>
<string name="84925">Anger me and you&apos;ll be sorry.</string>
<string name="84926">I hear the battle calling&#8230; attack!</string>
<string name="84927">Death is coming for you!</string>
<string name="84928">You&apos;re going down!</string>
<string name="84929">You can&apos;t win!</string>
<string name="84930">Quickly; I need healing.</string>
<string name="84931">I could use a hand here.</string>
<string name="84932">We&apos;ve got company.</string>
<string name="84933">Fall back! Fall back!</string>
<string name="84934">Is that the best you&apos;ve got?</string>
<string name="84935">Stay close and cover my back.</string>
<string name="84936">Stay here.</string>
<string name="84937">Can&apos;t last much&#8230; longer.</string>
<string name="84938">Poison??!!</string>
<string name="84939">My spell&apos;s failed!</string>
<string name="84940">This weapon has no effect!</string>
<string name="84941">Let me take the lead.</string>
<string name="84942">You&apos;ve got to see this.</string>
<string name="84943">Let&apos;s join up.</string>
<string name="84944">Step aside.</string>
<string name="84945">Open this lock for me.</string>
<string name="84946">Let&apos;s take a closer look.</string>
<string name="84947">Softly, now. Very softly.</string>
<string name="84948">No problem.</string>
<string name="84949">Sorry, I can&apos;t help you.</string>
<string name="84950">Another job well done.</string>
<string name="84951">This equipment is too heavy for me.</string>
<string name="84952">What do you need?</string>
<string name="84953">Hello.</string>
<string name="84954">Sure.</string>
<string name="84955">No.</string>
<string name="84956">Wait.</string>
<string name="84957">I need to stop and rest.</string>
<string name="84958">Maybe we should get moving.</string>
<string name="84959">Bye.</string>
<string name="84960">Thanks.</string>
<string name="84961">Damn!</string>
<string name="84962">Well done!</string>
<string name="84963">Can we talk for a second?</string>
<string name="84964">Good idea.</string>
<string name="84965">I&apos;m not so sure about that.</string>
<string name="84966">Don&apos;t make me do something you&apos;ll regret.</string>
<string name="84967">Time to spill some blood!</string>
<string name="84968">You&apos;re no match for me!</string>
<string name="84969">Feel my fury!</string>
<string name="84970">You&apos;re going down!</string>
<string name="84971">I&apos;m hurt! Somebody heal me.</string>
<string name="84972">Give me some help over here.</string>
<string name="84973">Enemies, dead ahead.</string>
<string name="84974">Retreat!</string>
<string name="84975">Come on - take your best shot!</string>
<string name="84976">Guard me.</string>
<string name="84977">Hold your position.</string>
<string name="84978">Darkness&#8230; closing in.</string>
<string name="84979">I&apos;ve been&#8230; poisoned!</string>
<string name="84980">That spell didn&apos;t work!</string>
<string name="84981">This weapon is useless!</string>
<string name="84982">Follow me!</string>
<string name="84983">Look at this.</string>
<string name="84984">Let&apos;s join forces.</string>
<string name="84985">Move aside.</string>
<string name="84986">Open that lock.</string>
<string name="84987">Search around.</string>
<string name="84988">Stay as quiet as possible.</string>
<string name="84989">Easy enough.</string>
<string name="84990">Sorry, no can do.</string>
<string name="84991">All done.</string>
<string name="84992">Can&apos;t&#8230; move. Too much&#8230; equipment.</string>
<string name="84993">Yes?</string>
<string name="84994">Greetings.</string>
<string name="84995">Yes.</string>
<string name="84996">No.</string>
<string name="84997">Stop right there.</string>
<string name="84998">I could use a break.</string>
<string name="84999">Are we just going to stand here?</string>
<string name="85000">Farewell.</string>
<string name="85001">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="85002">Boiling blood and swinging swords!</string>
<string name="85003">To the victor go the spoils!</string>
<string name="85004">We should talk.</string>
<string name="85005">A good plan.</string>
<string name="85006">That&apos;s a terrible plan!</string>
<string name="85007">You won&apos;t like me when I&apos;m angry.</string>
<string name="85008">Some fights cannot be avoided. Into the fray!</string>
<string name="85009">This wound won&apos;t heal soon!</string>
<string name="85010">Time to break some bones!</string>
<string name="85011">That&apos;ll leave a mark!</string>
<string name="85012">My injuries need tending.</string>
<string name="85013">I could use some assisstance.</string>
<string name="85014">I have spotted our foe.</string>
<string name="85015">We need to retreat!</string>
<string name="85016">You pathetic waste of flesh!</string>
<string name="85017">Protect me for a moment.</string>
<string name="85018">I think you should wait here.</string>
<string name="85019">My injuries are too great...</string>
<string name="85020">Foul poison taints my blood!</string>
<string name="85021">My spell has failed.</string>
<string name="85022">No effect? I must try something else!</string>
<string name="85023">I will take the lead.</string>
<string name="85024">You need to see this.</string>
<string name="85025">We should join together.</string>
<string name="85026">I&apos;ll ask you to move aside.</string>
<string name="85027">Pick this lock for me.</string>
<string name="85028">We need to examine this more closely.</string>
<string name="85029">Now we move without a sound.</string>
<string name="85030">That is certainly possible.</string>
<string name="85031">Impossible.</string>
<string name="85032">I&apos;ve finished the task.</string>
<string name="85033">I can barely move with all this equipment.</string>
<string name="85034">What do you need.</string>
<string name="85035">Good day to you.</string>
<string name="85036">Certainly.</string>
<string name="85037">I&apos;m afraid not.</string>
<string name="85038">Stop.</string>
<string name="85039">We should rest and recuperate.</string>
<string name="85040">We are accomplishing nothing here.</string>
<string name="85041">Farewell.</string>
<string name="85042">You have my gratitude.</string>
<string name="85043">By the healer&apos;s staff!</string>
<string name="85044">Hooray!</string>
<string name="85045">I have news for you.</string>
<string name="85046">That seems like a wise course of action.</string>
<string name="85047">I think you should reconsider.</string>
<string name="85048">Tread carefully, or you&apos;ll awaken my wrath.</string>
<string name="85049">To arms! To battle!</string>
<string name="85050">Feel my sting!</string>
<string name="85051">I will not be defeated!</string>
<string name="85052">Your blood shall spill.</string>
<string name="85053">I have need of healing.</string>
<string name="85054">Can I get some help here?</string>
<string name="85055">The enemy is near.</string>
<string name="85056">We cannot win! We must escape!</string>
<string name="85057">You&apos;re nothing but a coward!</string>
<string name="85058">Somebody cover me!</string>
<string name="85059">Don&apos;t move from this spot.</string>
<string name="85060">I&#8230; I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to make it.</string>
<string name="85061">Ugh&#8230; it feels like&#8230; like poison.</string>
<string name="85062">My spell! It didn&apos;t work!</string>
<string name="85063">I&apos;m not even making a dent!</string>
<string name="85064">You better follow me.</string>
<string name="85065">Check this out.</string>
<string name="85066">We should join up.</string>
<string name="85067">Out of the way.</string>
<string name="85068">Get that lock open.</string>
<string name="85069">Let&apos;s look a little more closely.</string>
<string name="85070">They&apos;ll never see us now!</string>
<string name="85071">No problem.</string>
<string name="85072">Can&apos;t be done.</string>
<string name="85073">All done.</string>
<string name="85074">Could you pile a little more stuff one me?</string>
<string name="85075">Yes?</string>
<string name="85076">Hi there.</string>
<string name="85077">Sure.</string>
<string name="85078">Nope.</string>
<string name="85079">Wait.</string>
<string name="85080">Let&apos;s just wait a couple minutes.</string>
<string name="85081">Well, this is exciting.</string>
<string name="85082">See you later.</string>
<string name="85083">Thanks.</string>
<string name="85084">Son of she wolf!</string>
<string name="85085">All right!</string>
<string name="85086">Can we talk?</string>
<string name="85087">Good idea.</string>
<string name="85088">You&apos;re kidding, right?</string>
<string name="85089">I&apos;m not all smiles and grins, you know.</string>
<string name="85090">Now you shall taste my power!</string>
<string name="85091">Feel my wrath!</string>
<string name="85092">This is going to hurt!</string>
<string name="85093">Now you die!</string>
<string name="85094">Someone get over here and *heal* me!</string>
<string name="85095">I can&apos;t do this alone!</string>
<string name="85096">Our foe is just over there.</string>
<string name="85097">Fly, you fools!</string>
<string name="85098">I dare you to try something&#8230; anything.</string>
<string name="85099">Give me a little protection.</string>
<string name="85100">Stay right here, no matter what.</string>
<string name="85101">I can&apos;t last much longer.</string>
<string name="85102">To dust we return&#8230;</string>
<string name="85103">Poison? That&apos;s&#8230; that&apos;s hardly fair.</string>
<string name="85104">What?  My spell failed? Impossible!</string>
<string name="85105">My weapon has no effect!</string>
<string name="85106">Follow my lead.</string>
<string name="85107">You really need to see this.</string>
<string name="85108">There&apos;s strength in numbers.</string>
<string name="85109">Out of my way.</string>
<string name="85110">Somebody open this lock.</string>
<string name="85111">We should examine this in greater detail.</string>
<string name="85112">Silence is golden.</string>
<string name="85113">I&apos;m on it.</string>
<string name="85114">That&apos;ll never happen.</string>
<string name="85115">Another job well done.</string>
<string name="85116">I&apos;m not a pack mule! Remove this burden!</string>
<string name="85117">What?</string>
<string name="85118">I bid you good day.</string>
<string name="85119">I suppose so.</string>
<string name="85120">Never.</string>
<string name="85121">Wait!</string>
<string name="85122">I need to stop for a bit.</string>
<string name="85123">This isn&apos;t getting us anywhere.</string>
<string name="85124">So long.</string>
<string name="85125">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="85126">By the arch-wizard&apos;s eyebrows!</string>
<string name="85127">That&apos;s showing some razzle dazzle!</string>
<string name="85128">There&apos;s something you should know.</string>
<string name="85129">Brilliant!</string>
<string name="85130">Ludicrous! What were you thinking?</string>
<string name="85131">You dare to defy me?</string>
<string name="85132">Argali says death to you!</string>
<string name="85133">Argali to the front!</string>
<string name="85134">No one bests Argali!</string>
<string name="85135">Die!</string>
<string name="85136">Argali needs healing!</string>
<string name="85137">Argali needs assistance</string>
<string name="85138">No...Argali is slain...</string>
<string name="85139">Hello.</string>
<string name="85140">Argali agrees.</string>
<string name="85141">Argali does not agree.</string>
<string name="85142">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="85143">This is a most deserved victory!</string>
<string name="85144">Argali wishes to converse.</string>
<string name="85145">Look upon Argali and tremble!</string>
<string name="85146">Let the dance begin!</string>
<string name="85147">Blades, cut true!</string>
<string name="85148">Never say die!</string>
<string name="85149">A plague on both your houses!</string>
<string name="85150">Heal me while there&apos;s enough left of me to heal!</string>
<string name="85151">If anyone intends to rally to my aid, now might be a good time to make your entrance&#8230;</string>
<string name="85152">Thus it... ends&#8230;</string>
<string name="85153">Hail, traveler&#8230;</string>
<string name="85154">That could be arranged&#8230;</string>
<string name="85155">I&apos;m afraid not&#8230;</string>
<string name="85156">Travel well&#8230;</string>
<string name="85157">I&apos;ll raise a glass to that!</string>
<string name="85158">Psst. I&apos;d have a word with ye&#8230;</string>
<string name="85159">I have steel to back up my words. I recommend you have the same.</string>

<string name="85161">Now you&apos;re in for it!</string>
<string name="85162">You die now!</string>
<string name="85163">Here comes the pain!</string>
<string name="85164">It hurts! It hurts bad! Do something!</string>
<string name="85165">Help! Help! Somebody, heeelllpp!</string>
<string name="85166">Uh&#8230; hello.</string>
<string name="85167">Uh&#8230; yep.</string>

<string name="85173">Then they charges into certain death!</string>
<string name="85174">He smites his enemy!</string>
<string name="85175">Huzzah! </string>
<string name="85176">Oh! The kobold is in dire needs of a healer&apos;s art!</string>
<string name="85177">The tiny bard is beset on all sides! He calls for help!</string>

<string name="85183">Suddenly death was loooooming!</string>
<string name="85184">Oh! &#8230;the tragedy!</string>
<string name="85185">Too late he realizes their cowardly foe had poisoned him...</string>
<string name="85186">And just then, his magic fails!</string>
<string name="85187">The weapon could do nothing! Doom was at hand!</string>
<string name="85188">Come! Come! This way! Follow Deekin!</string>
<string name="85189">Ooo! Ooo! Here it is!</string>
<string name="85190">Come on, gather round!</string>

<string name="85219">To me!</string>
<string name="85220">Get on with it.</string>
<string name="85221">Perhaps.</string>
<string name="85222">Never.</string>
<string name="85223">Go away.</string>
<string name="85224">Victory was never in doubt.</string>
<string name="85225">I demand that you speak to me. Now!</string>

<string name="85497">You discovered this artifact when you were briefly trapped in the Plane of Shadows. Ever since you first picked it up, it has refused to leave your possession. Drop it, throw it away, crush it... always it immediately reappears, pulsing warmly with power as it ever does.

Its main ability that you know of is that it can teleport you to a pocket dimension ruled over by a mysterious being that calls itself the Reaper. The Reaper&apos;s dimension is a nexus of sorts.

The Reaper, not an unfriendly sort, allows you to use the relic to &quot;bind&quot; a location to a door in the dimension, allowing instant transportation back to that point. He will also teleport you to the dimension upon the moment of your death, saving you. The relic may only be used in this fashion, however... to bind a point or save you from death... if you have a Rogue Stone in your possession. The Reaper uses the power inherent within the gem to power the relic, consuming the gem in the process. Naturally this makes Rogue Stones even more valuable to you than they would be otherwise.

Where the Reaper comes from or how the relic stone was created has never been revealed to you. You suspect that one day its mysterious history will catch up with you. For the moment, however, it has been far more of a boon.</string>

<string name="85607">&quot;So this is it, the place where the Knower of Names was banished to... Be careful. True Names hold great power and with that comes great responsibility...&quot;</string>
<string name="85608">&quot;Old thoughts of Neverwinter have been preying upon me as of late.&quot;</string>
<string name="85609">&quot;I have been thinking more upon the nature of the Hells.&quot;</string>
<string name="85610">&quot;Welcome back. Is there any way I can help?&quot;</string>
<string name="85611">&quot;Yes? What is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="85612">&quot;The air is cold. Let us not linger out here for long.&quot;</string>
<string name="85613">&quot;Can you feel the warmth? They light the fires with berries of the Velox nettle. It is the only way to withstand the cold.&quot;</string>
<string name="85614">&quot;Come, it will be a bit warmer in here out of the winds.&quot;</string>
<string name="85615">&quot;I recommend steering clear of Arden, the jester there. He&apos;s a liar and a sneak if ever there was one.&quot;</string>
<string name="85616">&quot;Stay your attack. It doesn&apos;t look to pose any threat and, besides, its shell seems hard as rock. I suspect it&apos;s from those worthless gems it seems to feed on.&quot;</string>
<string name="85617">&quot;See that tributary across our path? It stems from the River Styx that charts its fiery course through the Nine Hells. We&apos;ll have to find some means across, though I can&apos;t fathom how.&quot;</string>
<string name="85618">&quot;It appears to be a puzzle. See those levers? I think they can be pulled more than once, if that&apos;s any help. And I suspect it&apos;s that door we&apos;re aiming for. There must be some way to stop the lightning.&quot;</string>
<string name="85619">&quot;I wonder if the flowers are in bloom in Neverwinter right now?&quot;</string>
<string name="85620">&quot;I wonder how large Cania is?&quot;</string>
<string name="85621">&quot;Brr. I feel like I could eat an entire bush of Velox berries right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="85622">&quot;Do you really think that we will get you back to Waterdeep before it&apos;s too late?&quot;</string>
<string name="85623">&quot;Grant us safe journeys, Tyr.&quot;</string>
<string name="85624">&quot;Do you think Lord Nasher still lives? He was an insufferable fool sometimes but I miss his company, all the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="85625">&quot;We must stay warm. Frostbite can be deadly if it goes untreated.&quot;</string>
<string name="85626">&quot;How long has it been since you freed me from the ice? I&apos;m beginning to lose track of time.&quot;</string>
<string name="85627">&quot;We have to keep moving.&quot;</string>
<string name="85628">&quot;Where are we? Have you been keeping a map?&quot;</string>
<string name="85629">&quot;No, no! Please, I have children. Choose again, I beg you!&quot;</string>
<string name="85630">&quot;Go away... I can&apos;t help you... I can&apos;t have you around... Just leave me be...&quot;</string>
<string name="85631">&quot;Who are you!? Why have you come here?&quot;</string>
<string name="85632">&quot;Why can&apos;t you people just leave me alone!?&quot;</string>
<string name="85633">&quot;All I wanted was to let go...&quot;</string>
<string name="85634">&quot;Please, I surrender! What&apos;s done is done...&quot;</string>
<string name="85635">&quot;I am Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, betrayer of the city of Neverwinter. What is it that you want of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="85636">&quot;Must you continue to torment me like this? Just leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="85637">&quot;Bah! Must you always be underfoot, lizard?&quot;</string>
<string name="85638">&quot;It&apos;s a wonder you aren&apos;t dead yet, you cold-blooded little runt.&quot;</string>
<string name="85639">&quot;How does it feel to be a trespasser in your father&apos;s house, Valen?&quot;</string>
<string name="85640">&quot;I&apos;ve been watching you in battle, Valen. The demon in you grows stronger with every fiend you kill...&quot;</string>
<string name="85641">&quot;I have noticed that there are things you prefer not to speak of, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="85642">&quot;The cold has made you weak and slow. I am already in another&apos;s employ.&quot;</string>
<string name="85643">&quot;The Land of the Living lies through that portal... All my past failings, all my mistakes, everything I did and didn&apos;t do in life...&quot;</string>
<string name="85644">&quot;He&apos;s watching us, dreaming about us. I can feel his mind crawling over our flesh... I don&apos;t like it here.&quot;</string>
<string name="85645">&quot;To the contrary, I think I&apos;ll savor the irony awhile...&quot;</string>
<string name="85646">&quot;That tree, I recognized it!&quot;</string>
<string name="85647">&quot;So this is it... This is where Mephistopheles banished his betrayers. Eleven generals of the Blood War and a pale-faced girl. It might be worth recruiting some of them to our cause...&quot;</string>
<string name="85648">&quot;Nothing. Just old memories of Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="85649">&quot;I am simply pondering the nature of the Hells, that is all.&quot;</string>
<string name="85650">&quot;Oh, what&apos;s this? Have you finally come to your senses and realized you have need of me?&quot; </string>
<string name="85651">&quot;Now there&apos;s a diabolical grin if I ever saw one. What are you plotting now?&quot;</string>
<string name="85652">&quot;Beware the cold. It kills the weak.&quot;</string>
<string name="85653">&quot;Velox berries. I&apos;m afraid their scent will be burned into my nostrils for some time to come, thanks to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="85654">&quot;At last, some warmth. Damn the devils and their infernal cold.&quot;</string>
<string name="85655">&quot;See Arden, the jester over there? He&apos;s a pompous weasel, full of lies, but he can have his uses. Shall we go speak with him?&quot;</string>
<string name="85656">&quot;Blast, do you see that? The beast has a shell as hard as rock. It must be a result of all those worthless jewels it&apos;s eating. Regardless, it doesn&apos;t seem hostile.&quot;</string>
<string name="85657">&quot;Blast, the river blocks us! We&apos;ll have to find some way across.&quot;</string>
<string name="85658">&quot;Damned puzzles! Let&apos;s see... Well it appears those levers can be pulled more than once, at least. And we must somehow break through the lightning that seals that door. I&apos;ll leave the rest to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="85659">&quot;If we grow hungry in the wastelands, I&apos;m eating you first.&quot;</string>
<string name="85660">&quot;If there&apos;s one thing I hate, it&apos;s this ceaseless daylight.&quot;</string>
<string name="85661">&quot;My blade hungers. Surely there must be another battle close by.&quot;</string>
<string name="85662">&quot;I&apos;ve decided that I like the color of bloodied ice. It sets off my eyes, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="85663">&quot;Do you think we&apos;ll ever get out of here?&quot;</string>
<string name="85664">&quot;What is this place? Do you know?&quot;</string>
<string name="85665">&quot;If your toes are turning black, it&apos;s from frostbite. I can cut them off with my knife if you need me to.&quot;</string>
<string name="85666">&quot;How long has it been since you freed me from the ice? I&apos;m beginning to lose track of time.&quot;</string>
<string name="85667">&quot;You&apos;re lost, aren&apos;t you...&quot;</string>
<string name="85668">&quot;How may I serve you, Sojourner?&quot;</string>
<string name="85669">&quot;Your destination lies here in Cania, thus may I comply... Behold, a Gate has been opened unto you, leading to the place where you last died.&quot;</string>
<string name="85670">&quot;Your destination lies here in Cania, thus may I comply... Behold, a Gate has been opened unto you that you might join with the leader of your fellows.&quot;</string>
<string name="85671">&quot;Behold, Sojourner... A Gate has been opened unto you, leading to the place where you last died.&quot;</string>
<string name="85672">&quot;Behold, Sojourner... A Gate has been opened unto you that you might join with the leader of your fellows.&quot;</string>
<string name="85673">And now you die!</string>
<string name="85674">This is not a good time to leave the area.</string>
<string name="85675">The chains will not move while the magical color sequence plays.</string>
<string name="85676">Your rest has been disturbed by a wandering monster.</string>
<string name="85677">There are no enemies within range.</string>
<string name="85678">&quot;Yes, Master Sodalis.&quot;</string>
<string name="85679">&quot;Strip this one and bring it to my chambers. Vix&apos;thra grows impatient with us and we must sacrifice a victim to the pit with no delay.&quot;</string>
<string name="85680">&quot;The gong has sounded. A Ceremony has been called for.&quot;</string>
<string name="85681">&quot;Vix&apos;thra turns his ancient gaze upon us.&quot;</string>
<string name="85682">&quot;Mighty is the will of Vix&apos;thra and great is his hunger.&quot;</string>
<string name="85683">&quot;Vix&apos;thra, Sage Protector, our Safeguard against all peril...&quot;</string>
<string name="85684">&quot;To thee we offer one of our own!&quot;</string>
<string name="85685">&quot;Are there any here who wish to serve the will of Vix&apos;thra?&quot;</string>
<string name="85686">&quot;Vix&apos;thra approves of his servant. Priests!&quot;</string>
<string name="85687">&quot;If none shall volunteer then there must be a Choosing.&quot;</string>
<string name="85688">&quot;Vix&apos;thra, show us your will!&quot;</string>
<string name="85689">&quot;Vix&apos;thra has chosen his servant. Seize her!&quot;</string>
<string name="85690">Blood we give the Elders...</string>
<string name="85691">Bones we give to you...</string>
<string name="85692">Descend, chosen of Vix&apos;thra, and serve his will for all time.</string>
<string name="85693">&quot;You have made it this far, have you?&quot;</string>
<string name="85694">&quot;You have no idea how foolish you are. You will have no chance against Vix&apos;thra, the sacred one.&quot;</string>
<string name="85695">&quot;Soon all the realms will worship him and his priesthood shall rule all the lands! Your soul will be Vix&apos;thra&apos;s for all eternity!&quot;</string>
<string name="85696">&quot;Well that was fun, wasn&apos;t it? Evil is vanquished! Do you know if they&apos;ve got another one of those stashed around somewhere?&quot;</string>
<string name="85697">&quot;This sure is a grand adventure, isn&apos;t it? Hunting down an evil god, battling drow, facing bloodsucking vampires at every turn... I could get used to this!&quot;</string>
<string name="85698">&quot;No... Please, I have no more blood to give...&quot;</string>
<string name="85699">&quot;Ungh... The pain, it hurts too much...&quot;</string>
<string name="85700">&quot;Thank you. I know I&apos;ve made a mess of the whole thing but at least I&apos;m not being held captive anymore. I don&apos;t know how I&apos;m going to explain this to my superiors...&quot;</string>
<string name="85701">&quot;I knew you&apos;d come back.&quot; You can tell by the moist streaks running down her cheeks that she&apos;s been crying.</string>
<string name="85702">&quot;Free me!&quot; she commands, her voice strong and fierce through her apparent pain. Her green eyes, bright as emeralds, pierce you with their gaze.</string>
<string name="85703">Pale Masters continue to gain spell uses per day. A wizard who becomes a pale master should purchase or find scrolls to memorize spells for these new spell slots.</string>
<string name="85704">A Pale Master/Monk is a potent adversary.</string>
<string name="85705">Come, thrall.</string>
<string name="85706">Now my brothers, we shall gain our Freedom!</string>
<string name="85707">We will begin bidding on the next lot soon.</string>
<string name="85708">A human female? I have yet to purchase a human thrall.</string>
<string name="85709">Freedom!</string>
<string name="85710">My mind! So empty. Must find brains!</string>
<string name="85711">Gaarrrrghh!</string>
<string name="85712">***The Intruder draws close.***</string>
<string name="85713">***I shall dispatch thralls at once.***</string>
<string name="85714">***The Intruder has not yet been stopped.***</string>
<string name="85715">***I shall deal with this myself!***</string>
<string name="85716">Something about the waterfall in front of you seems quite unreal.</string>
<string name="85717">Nothing seems to happen.</string>
<string name="85718">You have disbelieved an illusion.</string>
<string name="85719">This Creature was only an illusion!</string>
<string name="85720">There is currently no fight happening. Speak with the pit boss.</string>
<string name="85721">You recognize this wall of swords to be an illusion.</string>
<string name="85722">A Slave has reached freedom.</string>
<string name="85723">This is the Reaper; a dark and chilling creature who guards a plane of doors.</string>
<string name="85724">Pickets report the Matron&apos;s armies are only minutes away!</string>
<string name="85725">The Matron&apos;s armies are approaching!</string>
<string name="85726">The Matron&apos;s armies are very close!</string>
<string name="85727">The Matron&apos;s armies are almost here!</string>
<string name="85728">The Matron&apos;s armies are here!</string>
<string name="85729">I must see about our troops.</string>
<string name="85730">This catapult is already in use.</string>
<string name="85731">What have you done?</string>
<string name="85732">Traitor!</string>
<string name="85733">You&apos;ve doomed us all!</string>
<string name="85734">We are betrayed!</string>
<string name="85735">Fall back! Save the Seer!</string>
<string name="85736">The gates are broken. The way is clear!</string>
<string name="85737">They&apos;ve broken through!</string>
<string name="85738">Hang on, we&apos;ll get you out of there.</string>
<string name="85739">I think the worst of it is over.</string>
<string name="85740">Did you hear that?</string>
<string name="85741">They&apos;ve come from the river. How?</string>
<string name="85742">Thus all enemies of House Maeviir shall end.</string>
<string name="85743">And now to end your meddling.</string>
<string name="85744">Thus all enemies of the Valsharess shall end.</string>
<string name="85745">And now enough of you and your meddling.</string>
<string name="85746">Goodbye, mother.</string>
<string name="85747">Look out! The Enemy has found a way in.</string>
<string name="85748">Protect the Seer!</string>
<string name="85749">Wait a moment.</string>
<string name="85750">The first of you that breaks, I will slay myself!</string>
<string name="85751">The outer gates have been breached!</string>
<string name="85752">Why aren&apos;t you other guards helping?</string>
<string name="85753">The Valsharess is victorious here.</string>
<string name="85754">We must fall back.</string>
<string name="85755">They are retreating. We have won the battle.</string>
<string name="85756">Someone is summoning creatures into the courtyard!</string>
<string name="85757">Get out of the way!</string>
<string name="85758">What are you doing!</string>
<string name="85759">Stupid!</string>
<string name="85760">You have the brains of a rothe!</string>
<string name="85761">Ignorant fool!</string>
<string name="85762">Yes Sir!</string>
<string name="85763">I didn&apos;t think we would make it through, brother.</string>
<string name="85764">* You can not use this feat while silenced *</string>
<string name="85765">Some weapons have the Wounding item property on them. Once a character is wounded by one of these weapons they will continue to take damage until they have been healed by potion, spell or healing kit.</string>
<string name="85766">Betrayer!</string>
<string name="85767">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;? Where did *you* come from? We thought you were dead!&quot;</string>
<string name="85768">&quot;Mephistopheles is upon us!&quot;</string>
<string name="85769">&quot;Fall back! Fall back!&quot;</string>
<string name="85770">Durnan looks at you expectantly. &quot;Aye? Is there something you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="85771">&quot;Blast those four fools! What were they thinking? Rushing headlong into the well like a bunch of impatient children! Don&apos;t they realize how dangerous Undermountain is?&quot;</string>
<string name="85772">&quot;We must secure the portal! No more of those creatures can be allowed through it!&quot;</string>
<string name="85773">&quot;They are using my portal, dammit! *My* portal! Help us stop them!&quot;</string>
<string name="85774">&quot;Damn the infernal drow! A thousand deaths is not good enough for any one of them! Bah! At least that seems to have been the last of them... for now, anyways.&quot;</string>
<string name="85775">&quot;Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am glad that you made it at last. I trust your accommodations were adequate?&quot;</string>
<string name="85776">&quot;The city is under siege. Raiding parties of drow and other creatures rarely seen on the surface are attacking the city. We&apos;ve determined that these attacks are coming through Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="85777">&quot;That&apos;s what we need to find out. The labyrinth of Undermountain was created long ago by Halaster, a mage whose power may have rivaled even Elminster himself.&quot;</string>
<string name="85778">&quot;The labyrinth of Undermountain was created long ago by Halaster, a mage whose power may have rivaled even Elminster himself.&quot;</string>
<string name="85779">&quot;Halaster ruled Undermountain like a brutal tyrant. It was his magic that kept the creatures within from pouring out to overrun Waterdeep.&quot; </string>
<string name="85780">&quot;Now Halaster has suddenly decided to unleash his creatures on this city, and we need to find out why. I want to know what that mad mage is up to!&quot; </string>
<string name="85781">&quot;It&apos;s pretty clear that the answers we seek can&apos;t be found here on the surface. The only hope we have of stopping Halaster is to send someone down into Undermountain after him.&quot;</string>
<string name="85782">&quot;I see you have finally decided to join the rest of us.&quot;</string>
<string name="85783">The muscled half-orc regards you quietly before speaking. &quot;Yes? Is there something you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="85784">&quot;My name is Daelan, once of the Uthgardt Red Tiger tribe. I have traveled much of the civilized lands in the years since I left my people.&quot;</string>
<string name="85785">&quot;I see no reason for us to speak with each other. I doubt we have anything more to say.&quot;</string>
<string name="85786">&quot;You have returned. Is there something I can help you with?&quot;</string>
<string name="85787">&quot;I see you have survived the dangers of Undermountain... so far.&quot;</string>
<string name="85788">&quot;It is good to see you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Everything is going well, I hope?&quot;</string>
<string name="85789">&quot;How... how did I get here? I remember a fight and then... only darkness. Yet you seem familiar to me. You are... an ally, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="85790">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I have joined with somebody else.&quot;</string>
<string name="85791">&quot;Once again you have brought me back from the dead. I&apos;m sorry for failing you. I... I don&apos;t know what&apos;s wrong. I don&apos;t usually go down so easily.&quot;</string>
<string name="85792">&quot;May I have a word with you?&quot;</string>
<string name="85793">&quot;I see you have returned. Do you have need of me now?&quot;</string>
<string name="85794">&quot;Would you like me to join with you again?&quot;</string>
<string name="85795">&quot;Yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="85796">&quot;Sharwyn still lies where she first fell. We must find some way to restore her to life.&quot;</string>
<string name="85797">&quot;There... isn&apos;t that Tomi&apos;s body. I&apos;d recognize that rogue anywhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="85798">&quot;Those pillars must be some kind of magical test or puzzle. Undermountain is full of such traps.&quot;</string>
<string name="85799">&quot;Shhh... if that dragon awakes, we could be in for quite a battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="85800">&quot;Another of Halaster&apos;s tricks. Teleporters make it harder to find your way through this labyrinth.&quot;</string>
<string name="85801">&quot;Be careful here. Even hidden treasure might be trapped in Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="85802">&quot;Our enemy has surrendered. Victory is ours!&quot;</string>
<string name="85803">&quot;The stench of evil hangs upon this place. I have a bad feeling about that sarcophagus.&quot;</string>
<string name="85804">&quot;She yields, she yields! The battle is over.&quot;</string>
<string name="85805">&quot;I think these gargoyles may be another of Halaster&apos;s puzzles.&quot;</string>
<string name="85806">&quot;These people must be slaves of the mad mage.&quot;</string>
<string name="85807">&quot;This place bears the marks of goblin craftsmen... and the only thing goblins craft is traps.&quot;</string>
<string name="85808">&quot;That drow returns. Be on your guard.&quot;</string>
<string name="85809">&quot;It&apos;s that drow again. I&apos;m beginning to think she may be an ally after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="85810">&quot;Undermountain is a dangerous place... be on your guard at all times.&quot;</string>
<string name="85811">&quot;The monsters here are fierce, but it&apos;s the traps that truly make Undermountain an adventurer&apos;s graveyard.&quot;</string>
<string name="85812">&quot;Do you feel that? Eyes, watching us from the shadows.&quot;</string>
<string name="85813">&quot;My axe is ready to take down any who dare stand against us.&quot;</string>
<string name="85814">&quot;Doom DOOM DOOM! Doomity doom doom! Blast! That damned kobold&apos;s song is stuck in my head!&quot;</string>
<string name="85815">&quot;There&apos;s something unsettling about this place. You can taste the madness of its creator.&quot;</string>
<string name="85816">&quot;Undermountain... a fitting name. I can feel the weight of the stone above us, pressing down.&quot;</string>
<string name="85817">&quot;Listen! Something is following us... no, it&apos;s gone now.&quot;</string>
<string name="85818">&quot;Stay vigilant. Let your guard down here and you will soon be very dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="85819">&quot;The air here is heavy and stale. I miss the feel of a stiff wind against my face.&quot;</string>
<string name="85820">&quot;I hear the scurrying of rats and insects fleeing before our torches... and other things, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="85821">&quot;How much deeper can this dungeon go? We must be miles underground already.&quot;</string>
<string name="85822">&quot;Imagine how many bodies lie buried in here; adventurers who have entered but never come out.&quot;</string>
<string name="85823">&quot;What could possess someone - even a madman - to build a place like this?&quot;</string>
<string name="85824">&quot;Though they attack us, I feel sorry for the creatures trapped in this maze.&quot;</string>
<string name="85825">&quot;Our adventure here will make a fine tale for my tribe&apos;s storyteller... assuming we survive.&quot;</string>
<string name="85826">&quot;I prefer battle to the uncertainty of walking these trap filled halls.&quot;</string>
<string name="85827">&quot;How much worse can the Underdark be than the blackness here?&quot;</string>
<string name="85828">&quot;These cramped halls make me long for the open plains of my Uthgardt tribesmen.&quot;</string>
<string name="85829">&quot;Halaster&apos;s heart must be as black and cold as Undermountain itself.&quot;</string>
<string name="85830">&quot;Would you like me to join with you now?&quot;</string>
<string name="85831">&quot;Once again you have summoned me, mortal. What is it you need? Do you wish to see what items I have in stock? As you know, I carry only the finest of magical merchandise.&quot;</string>
<string name="85832">&quot;Damnable drow! Why must you keep... oh. I see you aren&apos;t one of those dark elves, after all. Well, this could change a few things.&quot;</string>
<string name="85833">&quot;I never liked the drow. Too demanding. Very difficult to do business with. Mortal, I am in your debt for freeing me from the clutches of those vile underground elves!&quot;</string>
<string name="85834">&quot;You again? What do you want, mortal?&quot;</string>
<string name="85835">&quot;I suppose I can accept your apology. After all, you did free me from those wretched drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="85836">&quot;You really are a slow learner, aren&apos;t you? Goodbye, mortal.&quot;</string>
<string name="85837">&quot;Of course. Just remember the rules: you can look, but you can&apos;t touch the merchandise until it&apos;s paid for. And my prices are non-negotiable.&quot;</string>
<string name="85838">&quot;You mortals and your curiosity. Halaster was always asking me the strangest questions, though he was quite mad, of course. I suppose your own inquiries will be much less... insane.&quot;</string>
<string name="85839">The leader of these duergar sizes you up before speaking. &quot;Another slaver, eh? Well, you don&apos;t want to go into Zorvak&apos;Mur without your leader wearing one of these.&quot; He raps the helm on his head.</string>
<string name="85840">&quot;Those mind flayers don&apos;t see much difference between slavers and slaves. If you aren&apos;t protected, they&apos;ll turn on you as soon as you speak to them. A free tip from one slaver to another.&quot;</string>
<string name="85841">One of the other duergar in the back chimes in. &quot;What&apos;s wrong with you, Yorag? We&apos;ve got the numbers advantage here. Let&apos;s pick up some more stock.&quot;</string>
<string name="85842">The leader rubs his chin thoughtfully. &quot;He makes a good point. You&apos;re outnumbered... and I bet you&apos;d fetch a nice price at the next slave auction.&quot;</string>
<string name="85843">&quot;No? We was just going to let you on by out of professional courtesy. But since you ain&apos;t a slaver, this changes things.&quot; The other duergar respond with a chorus of evil laughter.</string>
<string name="85844">&quot;We&apos;ll take that chance! Attack!&quot;</string>
<string name="85845">&quot;You were in that dungeon an awfully long time. It gave me a chance to talk things over with my crew. We&apos;ve decided we don&apos;t much like someone else moving in on our island.&quot;</string>
<string name="85846">&quot;We&apos;ve been working this island for nearly twenty years. We&apos;ve paid our dues in sweat and blood, and we&apos;ve defended our claim against all comers. It&apos;s nothing personal, surfacer.&quot;</string>
<string name="85847">&quot;We need that salvage from the Maker&apos;s lab to earn our living. We can&apos;t just let you walk off with your pick of the best stuff. We were here first, by rights we deserve a share of anything you found!&quot;</string>
<string name="85848">&quot;If you give us 10,000 gold pieces, we&apos;ll let you go on your way without any trouble. If not, we&apos;ll take what&apos;s rightfully ours by force.&quot;</string>
<string name="85849">&quot;Not many come to this island, especially not a surfacer like you. What are you doing here? Have you come as friend or foe? &quot;</string>
<string name="85850">&quot;Hello once again, surfacer. Is there something you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="85851">Shaori grunts in disgust. &quot;Can&apos;t you take a hint? Go away, leave me alone! I&apos;ve already told you everything I know, I&apos;ve answered all your stupid questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="85852">&quot;You should be out finding those mirror pieces before that drow. Or, better yet, go to the castle and get the mirror frame from the throne room. But whatever you do, just go away.&quot;</string>
<string name="85853">Shaori grits her teeth and snarls out, &quot;You again? At least that drow had the decency to leave me alone after we were done yapping. Why don&apos;t you do the same?&quot;</string>
<string name="85854">This winged elf wears the clothes of a monarch, though she hardly carries herself with a royal bearing. She fixes you with a mistrusting eye, then spits to clear her throat and asks, &quot;What do you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="85855">&quot;Questions, questions, questions! I had enough of questions when I was Queen. &apos;Please, Shaori, tell me this.&apos; and &apos;Please, Shaori, tell me that.&apos; Why do you think I left the castle?&quot;</string>
<string name="85856">&quot;I&apos;m not Queen Shaori anymore. I just want to be left alone. But I can&apos;t get any peace and quiet even in this cave! First Sabal and her drow come to bother me, and now you!&quot;</string>
<string name="85857">&quot;I must thank you for what you have done. You&apos;ve restored the mirror and broken the spell that bound us here. My city has been returned to its rightful place among the mountains of the Lost Peaks.&quot;</string>
<string name="85858">Shaori gives you a regal nod by way of greeting. &quot;Is there something else you need? If not, I will take my leave of this place as soon as you exit this cave.&quot;</string>
<string name="85859">The fool looks out at the carnage and bodies strewn about the throne room. &quot;I hope once Shaori is restored she leaves the blood here in the throne room to remind her people of the folly of war.&quot;</string>
<string name="85860">&quot;I cannot interfere until one of you is dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="85861">&quot;Between you and Sabal we now have all the missing pieces of the mirror. At last, this terrible curse on the Avariel will be lifted!&quot;</string>
<string name="85862">&quot;I knew you would be arriving soon, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Between you and Sabal you have now collected all five of the missing pieces from the broken mirror. Soon this terrible curse can be broken!&quot;</string>
<string name="85863">&quot;But I see this is confusing for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you like, I can explain what is happening.&quot;</string>
<string name="85864">&quot;But first we must decide which one of you shall get the mirror. After all, you both have some of the pieces. We must decide how we will settle this.&quot;</string>
<string name="85865">&quot;You&apos;ve returned, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I see you don&apos;t have all the missing pieces of the mirror yet. If you don&apos;t hurry, then Sabal will beat you to them.&quot;</string>
<string name="85866">&quot;I was wondering when you were going to arrive, &lt;FirstName&gt;. No doubt you have found our town strange and confusing. Now that you are here I hope I can clear everything up for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="85867">The twisted little elf nods by way of greeting. &quot;You&apos;ve returned, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Are you ready to hear my tale now? Are you willing to help us?&quot;</string>
<string name="85868">Aghaaz grins at your approach, a truly disturbing sight. &quot;Welcome once again, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. Do not worry, I have not forgotten my promise to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="85869">&quot;When the time comes my golems will march with you against this Valsharess you spoke of. Or are you here for some other reason?&quot;</string>
<string name="85870">Aghaaz grins at your approach, a truly disturbing sight. &quot;Back again? What do you want now, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="85871">&quot;We have no quarrel with you, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. I am Aghaaz, high priest of the Maker and leader of the sentient golems on this island.&quot;</string>
<string name="85872">&quot;We are the children of Alsigard the Maker, who gave us the gift of life itself. Being the strongest, the Maker saw fit to anoint me his high priest, to deliver his word and will to his other children.&quot;</string>
<string name="85873">&quot;Though golems, we are different than the mindless constructs that wander the level above. We are creatures of intelligence and will, beings of true self-awareness.&quot;</string>
<string name="85874">&quot;When the Maker descended to his inner sanctum, we were given the task of guarding this place from those who would destroy his work, like the duergar who loot the remains of our fallen siblings.&quot;</string>
<string name="85875">&quot;But I sense you are not like those duergar thieves. It seems you have come here for a different reason. That is why we parley with you now under a state of truce.&quot;</string>
<string name="85876">Aghaaz screams in rage. &quot;I shall crush you into dust!&quot;</string>
<string name="85877">Ferron&apos;s rebellion will fail. Bow down to Aghaaz now, or be destroyed!</string>
<string name="85878">Aghaaz was appointed by the Maker. He must rule until the Maker returns.</string>
<string name="85879">Ferron smiles at your approach. &quot;Welcome once again. As you can see, we are making our preparations to leave this place. It will be some time before we are ready to go, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="85880">&quot;As you have no doubt noticed, we act slowly. It took hundreds of years before we reached the decision to leave this island. It will take many more before we actually depart.&quot;</string>
<string name="85881">&quot;But have no fear: when you go to battle against the Valsharess, we will march with you. Or are you here for some other reason?&quot;</string>
<string name="85882">&quot;Put down your weapons, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. We mean you no harm. I am Ferron, leader of these rebel sentient golems you see in this room.&quot;</string>
<string name="85883">&quot;The golems here with me all share my belief: we are not slaves to the Maker. Like all creatures, we have the right to our freedom. Unfortunately our freedom will not come easily.&quot;</string>
<string name="85884">&quot;This may seem strange to you, but we are not like most golems. We are not mere constructs. We can think and feel. In all ways, we are as real and alive as you yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="85885">&quot;And, like all creatures, we have the right to our freedom. The golems here with me all share my belief: we are not slaves to the Maker. Unfortunately our freedom will not come easily.&quot;</string>
<string name="85886">&quot;We have fought to escape the chains of our slavery, but it is a war we can never truly win. Not without help. Please, creature, will you help us in our quest for freedom?&quot;</string>
<string name="85887">&quot;We will not let you destroy us!&quot;</string>
<string name="85888">Aghaaz has no claim over any of us! Why do you follow him?</string>
<string name="85889">The Maker is dead! Aghaaz rules only for Aghaaz. We will never bow down to him!</string>
<string name="85890">This drow commander gives you a brisk salute. &quot;Commander Imloth, at your service.&quot;</string>
<string name="85891">&quot;Is there anything you need, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I&apos;m pretty busy training my troops, but I can spare a few moments if it&apos;ll help you against the Valsharess and her followers.&quot;</string>
<string name="85892">Once again, this drow commander salutes you. &quot;Welcome back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Is there anything you need? I&apos;ll be happy to help you any way I can against the Valsharess and her followers.&quot;</string>
<string name="85893">&quot;This is Commander Imloth.  I have sent this wisp to act as my eyes and ears for the coming battle, and to allow me to communicate with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="85894">&quot;As the battle progresses, I will report to you any happenings on the battlefield that you need to be aware of so you can direct the troops as you see fit.&quot;</string>
<string name="85895">&quot;Are the defenses set, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="85896">&quot;I have nothing to add at the moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="85897">&quot;We have won the battle, but the war is far from over. The Valsharess&apos; forces have found a way to cross the Dark River and attack through the Lith My&apos;athar&apos;s port.&quot;</string>
<string name="85898">&quot;They&apos;re attacking the city core, the Seer is in danger! You must go there at once!&quot;</string>
<string name="85899">&quot;We have lost the first battle, but not the war. Lith My&apos;athar still has not fallen, and the Seer still lives.&quot;</string>
<string name="85900">&quot;You have a bit of time to regroup and arrange the forces here in the City Core before the army of the Valsharess resumes its assault.&quot;</string>
<string name="85901">&quot;I have no new information for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="85902">&quot;I have nothing new to report right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="85903">&quot;We must protect the Seer. If she falls, our cause is lost. The Valsharess&apos; forces have infiltrated the city and will soon be upon us. What forces we have left are now gathered here at your command.&quot;</string>
<string name="85904">&quot;I will try to remain near the Seer to protect her while you have free run of the battlefield.&quot;</string>
<string name="85905">&quot;I must go now. Our enemies are gathering.&quot;</string>
<string name="85906">We can&apos;t be sure. Maybe only a matter of days.</string>
<string name="85907">&quot;I am Cavallas of the Dark River. I alone can navigate its treacherous currents; all others will be swept away, or dragged down beneath its murky depths.&quot;</string>
<string name="85908">&quot;I&apos;ve been waiting for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="85909">&quot;I hear the Dark River&apos;s voice. It whispers secrets, like the dying gurgles of a drowning man. I know why you have come.&quot;</string>
<string name="85910">&quot;You seek to destroy the Valsharess; her death is your release. I can help you with this. I know the secrets of the islands; the Dark River whispers them to me when I glide across her waters.&quot;</string>
<string name="85911">&quot;Do you seek passage across the Dark River? There is no other who can guide you safely. Those who try have all drowned, and their bones have since been swept away.&quot;</string>
<string name="85912">&quot;I know much about the river&apos;s black waters, I know something of the islands these waters surround. But about your world - the world of earth and dry land - I know little.&quot; </string>
<string name="85913">&quot;The islands of the Dark River are places of secrets; places of power and danger. In these places you might find something to aid you against the Valsharess and her great army.&quot;</string>
<string name="85914">&quot;But though there are many tiny islands, there are two of particular note: the Isle of the Maker, and an island that is now home to a strange town that appeared from nowhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="85915">&quot;I am Cavallas of the Dark River. I am navigator, guide and keeper of its secrets. And I alone can take you to the islands you must visit.&quot;</string>
<string name="85916">Freedom or death!</string>
<string name="85917">&quot;I was a fool to trust you. Now I pay the ultimate price.&quot;</string>
<string name="85918">A drow thrall steps up to greet you, his head held high. &quot;Where is the warden? Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="85919">&quot;Why are you still here? I have promised to give you time to reach the Elder Brain before I launch the revolt, but I won&apos;t wait forever. My freedom can&apos;t be denied.&quot;</string>
<string name="85920">A gleam of wild hope appears in his eye. &quot;Dead? I am Argosus, leader of these thralls. Are you here to set us free, or do you also serve the illithid?&quot;</string>
<string name="85921">Kill them all!</string>
<string name="85922">May the darkness claim you!</string>
<string name="85923">I will drain you!</string>
<string name="85924">Death to you all!</string>
<string name="85925">Now! I need healing!</string>
<string name="85926">To my aid, damn you!</string>
<string name="85927">Our victims await&#8230;</string>
<string name="85928">Abandon the cause and regroup!</string>
<string name="85929">You dare to face me? Then let it be your doom!</string>
<string name="85930">Fight by my side!</string>
<string name="85931">Sheathe your anger! Now!</string>
<string name="85932">My spirit fades&#8230;</string>
<string name="85933">Gah! Something courses through me!</string>
<string name="85934">Nothing!</string>
<string name="85935">This worthless blade!</string>
<string name="85936">I suggest you follow&#8230;</string>
<string name="85937">What&apos;s this?</string>
<string name="85938">Gather here!</string>
<string name="85939">Out of my way.</string>
<string name="85940">Deal with these locks.</string>
<string name="85941">Search the place.</string>
<string name="85942">Into the shadows!</string>
<string name="85943">It can be done.</string>
<string name="85944">Impossible!</string>
<string name="85945">There, it&apos;s done.</string>
<string name="85946">I am not your pack mule&#8230;</string>
<string name="85947">What is it?</string>
<string name="85948">What now?</string>
<string name="85949">Perhaps.</string>
<string name="85950">I would doubt it.</string>
<string name="85951">Halt!</string>
<string name="85952">How long do you intend to drive us? It&apos;s time we rest.</string>
<string name="85953">The hourglass empties yet we do nothing&#8230;</string>
<string name="85954">Good riddance.</string>
<string name="85955">Yes, well&#8230; Thanks&#8230;</string>
<string name="85956">Tyr&apos;s folly&#8230;</string>
<string name="85957">Score one for the dark!</string>
<string name="85958">Lend me your ear!</string>
<string name="85959">Let&apos;s do it.</string>
<string name="85960">Hmph. If you say so&#8230;</string>
<string name="85961">One wrong move and I will scour the hells with your blood&#8230;</string>
<string name="85962">Lay the devils low!</string>
<string name="85963">For the glory of Tyr!</string>
<string name="85964">An end to this evil!</string>
<string name="85965">For Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="85966">Healers, I need your aid!</string>
<string name="85967">Rally to me!</string>
<string name="85968">There lies the foe!</string>
<string name="85969">Fall back that we might take them from the flanks!</string>
<string name="85970">I have paid for my crimes. You cannot harm me!</string>
<string name="85971">Stand guard over me! We must not fail!</string>
<string name="85972">Hold your fire! Let us give this battle pause!</string>
<string name="85973">I am not well&#8230;</string>
<string name="85974">A poison runs through me&#8230;</string>
<string name="85975">My spells, they fail me!</string>
<string name="85976">My blade rings false!</string>
<string name="85977">Follow me, then. I shall lead the way.</string>
<string name="85978">Over here. Do you see this?</string>
<string name="85979">We must gather together. There is safety in numbers&#8230;</string>
<string name="85980">Excuse me, I must pass&#8230;</string>
<string name="85981">I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s locked.</string>
<string name="85982">Search the place. I think there might be something here.</string>
<string name="85983">Hide yourselves.</string>
<string name="85984">I can do that.</string>
<string name="85985">I&apos;m sorry. It can&apos;t be done.</string>
<string name="85986">There, that should help.</string>
<string name="85987">I&apos;m sorry but I bear a heavy burden&#8230;</string>
<string name="85988">How can I help?</string>
<string name="85989">Welcome.</string>
<string name="85990">Of course.</string>
<string name="85991">No, I&apos;m afraid not.</string>
<string name="85992">What is the meaning of this?</string>
<string name="85993">If we intend to keep our health, I suggest we rest.</string>
<string name="85994">Time is not on our side. Let us not waste what little we have.</string>
<string name="85995">Journey well.</string>
<string name="85996">You have my thanks.</string>
<string name="85997">By the hells!</string>
<string name="85998">All praise to Tyr!</string>
<string name="85999">May I have leave to speak?</string>
<string name="86000">I agree, that sounds like the wisest course of action.</string>
<string name="86001">I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t like the sound of it.</string>
<string name="86002">I have endured more torments than you could ever dream of&#8230; Don&apos;t try my patience.</string>
<string name="86003">Show them no mercy&#8230;</string>
<string name="86004">Bones for Vix&apos;thra!</string>
<string name="86005">Blood for the Elders!</string>
<string name="86006">Sacrifice!</string>
<string name="86007">I bleed&#8230;</string>
<string name="86008">To me, my minions!</string>
<string name="86009">It&apos;s not over!</string>
<string name="86010">Welcome.</string>
<string name="86011">Of course&#8230;</string>
<string name="86012">Of course not&#8230;</string>
<string name="86013">Goodbye, then&#8230;</string>
<string name="86014">That will show them!</string>
<string name="86015">Listen here&#8230;</string>
<string name="86016">Bones for Vix&apos;thra, blood for the Elders&#8230;</string>
<string name="86017">Our enemies will be destroyed!</string>
<string name="86018">You will perish!</string>
<string name="86019">For the Avariel!</string>
<string name="86020">You cannot win.</string>
<string name="86021">I need healing.</string>
<string name="86022">Please - I need aid.</string>
<string name="86023">I bid you greetings.</string>
<string name="86024">Of course.</string>
<string name="86025">No.</string>
<string name="86026">Farewell.</string>
<string name="86027">That&apos;s the way to do it!</string>
<string name="86028">I must speak with you.</string>
<string name="86029">You will regret that.</string>
<string name="86030">The battle is joined!</string>
<string name="86031">Death from above!</string>
<string name="86032">My enemies fly before me!</string>
<string name="86033">For the Avariel!</string>
<string name="86034">My wounds are great&#8230; I need healing.</string>
<string name="86035">Please, I need assistance.</string>
<string name="86036">Greetings.</string>
<string name="86037">Yes.</string>
<string name="86038">No.</string>
<string name="86039">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="86040">Well done!</string>
<string name="86041">You must listen to what I have to say.</string>
<string name="86042">You just made a big mistake!</string>
<string name="86043">You will drown in your own blood!</string>
<string name="86044">The Dark River take you!</string>
<string name="86045">Death silence you!</string>
<string name="86046">Your secrets die with you now!</string>
<string name="86047">I grow weak&#8230; somebody, heal me.</string>
<string name="86048">I have need of aid.</string>
<string name="86049">Welcome.</string>
<string name="86050">Of course.</string>
<string name="86051">I&apos;m afraid not.</string>
<string name="86052">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="86053">Victory!</string>
<string name="86054">I have secrets you must hear.</string>
<string name="86055">The Dark River will swallow your soul!</string>
<string name="86056">Let&apos;s get them!</string>
<string name="86057">Taste my savage fury!</string>
<string name="86058">The rage of the Red Tiger unleashed!</string>
<string name="86059">For the Uthgardt!</string>
<string name="86060">Quickly - I need healing.</string>
<string name="86061">I need aid!</string>
<string name="86062">I see our foe.</string>
<string name="86063">Time to make a quick escape.</string>
<string name="86064">Do you dare attack me, cowards?</string>
<string name="86065">Protect me.</string>
<string name="86066">Hold your positions.</string>
<string name="86067">My injuries are grave. I need healing quickly.</string>
<string name="86068">Poison? I feel&#8230; unwell.</string>
<string name="86069">My spell has failed!</string>
<string name="86070">My attack - it has no effect!</string>
<string name="86071">Follow me.</string>
<string name="86072">Over here. I&apos;ve found something.</string>
<string name="86073">Quickly - attack formation!</string>
<string name="86074">Step aside so I may pass.</string>
<string name="86075">Open this lock.</string>
<string name="86076">We should search this place.</string>
<string name="86077">We must move quietly now.</string>
<string name="86078">I shall do as you ask.</string>
<string name="86079">I have failed in the task.</string>
<string name="86080">It is done.</string>
<string name="86081">Strong as I am this burden is quite heavy.</string>
<string name="86082">You need something?</string>
<string name="86083">Well met, friend.</string>
<string name="86084">Of course.</string>
<string name="86085">No.</string>
<string name="86086">Stop!</string>
<string name="86087">Perhaps we could rest now.</string>
<string name="86088">For adventurers we seem to be doing little adventuring.</string>
<string name="86089">Farewell.</string>
<string name="86090">I thank you for this.</string>
<string name="86091">By Uthgar&apos;s Blood!</string>
<string name="86092">Hurrah!</string>
<string name="86093">May I speak with you a moment?</string>
<string name="86094">An excellent idea.</string>
<string name="86095">Are you certain?</string>
<string name="86096">Beware lest you incur my wrath.</string>
<string name="86097">Kick them! Ooh, make them hurt!</string>
<string name="86098">For divine justice!</string>
<string name="86099">Why you little&#8230;</string>
<string name="86100">I&apos;ll kick you to hell and back, I will!</string>
<string name="86101">Ouch, ouch, ouch! Make it stop!</string>
<string name="86102">Help! Over here!</string>
<string name="86103">Hi!</string>
<string name="86104">You bet your bottom!</string>
<string name="86105">No way!</string>
<string name="86106">Toodle-oo!</string>
<string name="86107">Oh yay!</string>
<string name="86108">Hi! Excuse me. Hello?</string>
<string name="86109">Don&apos;t you dare! I&apos;ll sic an angel on you, I will!</string>
<string name="86110">I love a good fight!</string>
<string name="86111">How&apos;d you like that?!!</string>
<string name="86112">This is going to hurt!</string>
<string name="86113">You&apos;re finished!</string>
<string name="86114">I&apos;m hurt bad here.</string>
<string name="86115">Someone better give me a hand.</string>
<string name="86116">Yes?</string>
<string name="86117">Sure.</string>
<string name="86118">No.</string>
<string name="86119">Bye.</string>
<string name="86120">That&apos;s the way!</string>
<string name="86121">I&apos;ve got to tell you something.</string>
<string name="86122">You&apos;ll be sorry.</string>
<string name="86123">Time to spill some blood!</string>
<string name="86124">You&apos;re going down!</string>
<string name="86125">Feel the pain!</string>
<string name="86126">Taste my steel!</string>
<string name="86127">Someone fix up my wounds!</string>
<string name="86128">Give me ahand here.</string>
<string name="86129">Yeah?</string>
<string name="86130">Okay.</string>
<string name="86131">Nope.</string>
<string name="86132">See ya.</string>
<string name="86133">That&apos;s the way!</string>
<string name="86134">Listen up.</string>
<string name="86135">Don&apos;t even think about it.</string>
<string name="86136">Get the hell out of my inn!</string>
<string name="86137">Fall, foul creature!</string>
<string name="86138">They won&apos;t last long!</string>
<string name="86139">Die now!</string>
<string name="86140">I will die without some healing.</string>
<string name="86141">To me!</string>
<string name="86142">Greetings adventurer.</string>
<string name="86143">Yes?</string>
<string name="86144">No.</string>
<string name="86145">Fare well.</string>
<string name="86146">Yes! Victory!</string>
<string name="86147">I would speak with you.</string>
<string name="86148">You won&apos;t walk out of here alive.</string>
<string name="86149">Lay death at their doorstep&#8230;</string>
<string name="86150">Hark, the bell, it tolls for thee!</string>
<string name="86151">Death will set you free!</string>
<string name="86152">Shuffle off your mortal coil!</string>
<string name="86153">I am at death&apos;s door and can hear the knocking&#8230;</string>
<string name="86154">It is time you aid me&#8230;</string>
<string name="86155">Hail the dead.</string>
<string name="86156">Aye.</string>
<string name="86157">Nay.</string>
<string name="86158">May your spirit make its journey&#8230;</string>
<string name="86159">Peal the bells!</string>
<string name="86160">Hear me, all those with ears to hear&#8230;</string>
<string name="86161">Death is your only destiny&#8230;</string>
<string name="86162">Feel my power!</string>
<string name="86163">Fear my wrath!</string>
<string name="86164">Here comes the pain!</string>
<string name="86165">Time to die!</string>
<string name="86166">I need healing - now!</string>
<string name="86167">Give me some help!</string>
<string name="86168">And so it ends&#8230;</string>
<string name="86169">Greetings.</string>
<string name="86170">Of course.</string>
<string name="86171">I think not.</string>
<string name="86172">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="86173">Ha-ha-ha!</string>
<string name="86174">Well done.</string>
<string name="86175">We need to talk.</string>
<string name="86176">You&apos;ll regret that!</string>
<string name="86177">I will rend your flesh!</string>
<string name="86178">Time to die!</string>
<string name="86179">You cannot win!</string>
<string name="86180">I will destroy you!</string>
<string name="86181">I am wounded!</string>
<string name="86182">Come to me, quickly!</string>
<string name="86183">Welcome.</string>
<string name="86184">Of course.</string>
<string name="86185">I think not.</string>
<string name="86186">Farewell&#8230; and goodbye.</string>
<string name="86187">Excellent.</string>
<string name="86188">I must speak to you.</string>
<string name="86189">Don&apos;t do something you will regret.</string>
<string name="86190">Proceed to battle.</string>
<string name="86191">I must inflict pain.</string>
<string name="86192">I will destroy you.</string>
<string name="86193">Exterminate. Exterminate.</string>
<string name="86194">I am damaged.</string>
<string name="86195">Can another aid me?</string>
<string name="86196">I bid you greetings.</string>
<string name="86197">Affirmative.</string>
<string name="86198">Negative.</string>
<string name="86199">I bid you farewell.</string>
<string name="86200">An excellent result.</string>
<string name="86201">We must converse.</string>
<string name="86202">That will cause conflict.</string>
<string name="86203">For the Seer!</string>
<string name="86204">I will not fall!</string>
<string name="86205">Feel my wrath!</string>
<string name="86206">Victory is mine!</string>
<string name="86207">I could use some healing.</string>
<string name="86208">To my side!</string>
<string name="86209">Yes?</string>
<string name="86210">Right away.</string>
<string name="86211">No.</string>
<string name="86212">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="86213">Victory!!</string>
<string name="86214">I have news.</string>
<string name="86215">Don&apos;t even think about it.</string>
<string name="86216">We fight for freedom!</string>
<string name="86217">Live free or die!</string>
<string name="86218">Freedom or death!</string>
<string name="86219">Victory is ours!</string>
<string name="86220">I am wounded&#8230;</string>
<string name="86221">Qucikly - to my side!</string>
<string name="86222">Better to die free than to live a slave.</string>
<string name="86223">Yes?</string>
<string name="86224">Okay.</string>
<string name="86225">Of course not.</string>
<string name="86226">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="86227">Glory and honor are ours!</string>
<string name="86228">I must speak with you.</string>
<string name="86229">You will regret this.</string>

<string name="86232">Aribeth XP2 Blackguard</string>
<string name="86233">Vendui&apos;, surfacer. I greet you. Are you aware of who I am?</string>
<string name="86234">So you have made your decision. You are a fool, surfacer.</string>
<string name="86235">Die, then, with the rebels! I shall see you on your knees before me... and then you shall truly know what it is to suffer!</string>
<string name="86236">You have chosen wisely, surfacer. You need continue your charade with the rebels for only a short while before my army arrives at Lith My&apos;athar. Do not give yourself away.</string>
<string name="86237">I shall remove the geas I see that you are under now. After that you need only remember: the gates must be opened when my army arrives.</string>
<string name="86238">Now I will remove this foolish geas Halaster placed you under. After that is done, you need only remember: the gates must be opened.</string>
<string name="86239">You will not regret your decision. Ensure that I do not regret mine.</string>
<string name="86240">It seems your... information... is proving worthwhile after all, dread Mephistopheles.</string>
<string name="86241">The one you warned me of is reported to be within the Underdark now, working alongside the ragtag rebels who yet dare to oppose me.</string>
<string name="86242">You shall call me Valsharess! I have summoned and bound you, Mephistopheles, and you will bend to my will as you must!</string>
<string name="86243">I desire to know how this surfacer arrived in the Underdark so quickly. I desire to know exactly where this surfacer is.</string>
<string name="86244">And most of all I desire this surfacer dead!</string>
<string name="86245">Beyond *your* power, Mephistopheles? I would like to know how that is!</string>
<string name="86246">Continue to search for the surfacer. I *will* find him. And when I do, both he and every last one of those wretched rebels will pay!</string>
<string name="86247">Continue to search for the surfacer. I *will* find her. And when I do, both she and every last one of those wretched rebels will pay!</string>
<string name="86248">Our surfacer has grown to be a considerable problem. Why is it that you have not done as I have commanded, Mephistopheles? Why does the surfacer yet live?</string>
<string name="86249">No, I will not believe it! I will not have it!! I have bound you, foul devil, and you will do as I say!!</string>
<string name="86250">So you say. If you are attempting to elude me, Mephistopheles, I will discover it. You are mine to command.</string>
<string name="86251">This surfacer has proven elusive, too difficult to eliminate. Perhaps there is... something to what you say. Perhaps there is more here than meets the eye.</string>
<string name="86252">You. Male! Send for my commanders. I desire their presence now!</string>
<string name="86253">I will gather all my remaining forces, if I must. The rebels must be dealt with, and the surfacer... will hide from me no longer.</string>
<string name="86254">It seems our surfacer friend is with the rebel forces still, and has drawn near the fortress. Good. Use your power, dread Mephistopheles... bring the fool to me.</string>
<string name="86255">It appears my new ally is victorious. Excellent! Bring the surfacer to me, Mephistopheles. I would like an audience.</string>
<string name="86256">I will end this threat to me now, once and for all. I shall prove you wrong, devil... no one stands in my path!</string>
<string name="86257">There is much for us to do yet, but with the surfacer at our side... all becomes possible!</string>
<string name="86258">&quot;So we meet again, foolish one. This time in the flesh.&quot;</string>
<string name="86259">Vendui&apos;, my ally! I apologize to bring you here without warning, but I could not wait another moment for this meeting. Come, let us celebrate our victory!</string>
<string name="86260">Ha-ha ha ha! Do you see? The archdevil Mephistopheles has caged you with his power... a power that is mine to command, for I have caged him. He is my hound on a leash, and with him I shall become a goddess!</string>
<string name="86261">&quot;Welcome to my fortress. It is good to meet finally face to face.&quot;</string>
<string name="86262">&quot;Allow me to introduce the dread archdevil Mephistopheles to you. Come, Mephistopheles... give my ally a proper greeting, I command it.&quot;</string>
<string name="86263">&quot;I have done the impossible, you see. I have bound this fool devil to me as my servant. Like a hound on a leash, all of his hell-spawned power is mine to command. With your power added to his and mine, we are unstoppable!&quot;</string>
<string name="86264">&quot;We have much to discuss about our future, you and I. Follow me, then, and we shall do so in private.&quot;</string>
<string name="86265">Mephistopheles! I command you to show this fool surfacer what true pain is! Bring the wretched creature a slow and agonizing death... I wish to watch, and enjoy.</string>
<string name="86266">What?! What... what are you doing?! I command you to stop at once!!</string>
<string name="86267">&quot;Hold! Why are you two conversing? What are you trying to do, surfacer? Speak! I demand to know at once!!&quot;</string>
<string name="86268">&quot;Do you think me a fool?! You seek to usurp my control, steal my power! Jal khaless zhah waela! All trust is foolish! I shall not make that mistake again!&quot;</string>
<string name="86269">&quot;Mephistopheles is bound to me, cretin! He cannot betray me... not as you can. Jal khaless zhah waela! All trust is foolish! I shall not make that mistake again!&quot;</string>
<string name="86270">&quot;And I should have known better than to trust a lowly surfacer. Jal khaless zhah waela! All trust is foolish! I shall not make that mistake again!&quot;</string>
<string name="86271">&quot;Mephistopheles! I command you... destroy this surfacer! My Red Sisters, slay this fool now!!&quot;</string>
<string name="86272">How dare you oppose my will! You are mine to command! I have bound you, you *cannot* disobey!!</string>
<string name="86273">The situation is grim.  How long do you believe we have?</string>
<string name="86274">Do you not recognize one of our own? Nathyrra, you have returned.</string>
<string name="86275">And you. But I see you have returned with another... someone very important, indeed.</string>
<string name="86276">Lith My&apos;athar cannot survive this siege much longer, Matron Myrune.</string>
<string name="86277">You have to order the House Maeviir troops to press the attack.</string>
<string name="86278">What... what do you mean?</string>
<string name="86279">What? You cannot believe the Valsharess&apos; lies.</string>
<string name="86280">We are betrayed! The enemy is within the walls!</string>
<string name="86281">&quot;You are most welcome here, &lt;CUSTOM500&gt;. I am the Seer. I have awaited your arrival with great anticipation. Please, come... do not be alarmed.&quot;</string>
<string name="86282">&quot;I am sure you have many questions, and I assure you that they will be answered. I am curious first, however, as to how you came to appear before us.&quot;</string>
<string name="86283">&quot;I am sure you have many questions, but there is much we must tell you first. It is important you know something of the Valsharess, if you are to help us against her.&quot; </string>
<string name="86284">&quot;I believe it is time for our guest to learn more of the Valsharess, herself. Nathyrra, if you would be so kind...?&quot;</string>
<string name="86285">&quot;She summoned a powerful Duke of the Nine Hells, an archdevil she bound to her service. Drawing on this enslaved devil&apos;s power, she became a conqueror of the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="86286">&quot;That we do not know. Perhaps through some artifact or some long forgotten ritual. But whatever her methods, the results cannot be denied.&quot;</string>
<string name="86287">&quot;As each day passes, the Valsharess&apos;s hold over the Underdark strengthens and so does her power.&quot;</string>
<string name="86288">&quot;It involves you because she wants you dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="86289">&quot;I had the same dream,&quot; the Seer sighs. &quot;For whatever reason, destiny has singled you out as the instrument of the Valsharess&apos;s defeat.&quot;</string>
<string name="86290">&quot;There is only one thing that I can do. I must put my faith in the goddess... and that means putting our faith in you. Our fate lies in your hands.&quot;</string>
<string name="86291">&quot;I trust all goes well. Have you any news to report? Have you made any progress in your efforts to weaken the Valsharess and her followers?&quot;</string>
<string name="86292">&quot;It is good you are here, &lt;FullName&gt;. The army of the Valsharess is on the move. They are marching on Lith My&apos;athar.&quot;</string>
<string name="86293">&quot;I am glad to hear you say that. It is time to make our final stand. I have been given another vision... a vision of you leading our troops against the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="86294">&quot;No, it is time for us to make our final stand. Our fate will be decided here. Eilistraee has shown me a vision... a vision of you leading our troops to glory.&quot;</string>
<string name="86295">&quot;You have proven yourself worthy of this honor, &lt;FullName&gt;. Even House Maeviir will follow your orders in the coming battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="86296">&quot;We will make preparations all through the night. In the morning the enemy will arrive and the battle will begin. While we do this, you must rest. We will wake you before the battle starts.&quot;</string>
<string name="86297">&quot;This is your destiny, &lt;FullName&gt;. You cannot escape it. You have proven yourself worthy of this honor; even House Maeviir will follow you in the coming battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="86298">&quot;I should have seen the Maeviir betrayal coming. I&apos;ve been so focused on the Valsharess, that I failed to notice the enemy right beneath my nose.&quot;</string>
<string name="86299">&quot;The enemy has been driven back from the gates, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But another wave of attackers is already striking through the Ports.&quot;</string>
<string name="86300">&quot;The Valsharess must be growing in power. This is an ill omen, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You must go there right away. The defenders of Lith My&apos;athar need you now more than ever.&quot;</string>
<string name="86301">&quot;I believe the siege of Lith My&apos;athar is over, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The main army of the Valsharess has retreated. You have driven them back, and the Valsharess is on the run!&quot;</string>
<string name="86302">&quot;Fortunately for us, your arrogance is matched only by your power and skill in battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="86303">&quot;Your modesty is matched only by your courage and skill in battle. But even with all you have done, your task is not yet complete.&quot;</string>
<string name="86304">&quot;The enemy drow have pulled out of Lith My&apos;athar. They may be planning a... wait, do you hear that? No... it cannot be!&quot;</string>
<string name="86305">&quot;We must press our advantage before the enemy has time to recover from this defeat. You must lead our forces against the stronghold of the Valsharess and end her evil once and for all!&quot;</string>
<string name="86306">&quot;Yet again you have proven yourself, and once more you have shown the vision of  Eilistraee to be true. None of the Valsharess&apos; forces can stand against you.&quot;</string>
<string name="86307">The battle goes well, my friend. With your help, we have been victorious thus far. It is not over yet, however.</string>
<string name="86308">The Valsharess&apos;s fortress lies ahead. We must find a way to storm it if we are to end her tyranny once and for all!</string>
<string name="86309">Gone? No, this cannot be!</string>
<string name="86310">&quot;Hello, dear. I trust everything is well with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="86311">&quot;I can still feel my death, hanging on me, cold and eerie. I am glad to be back in this mortal realm again.&quot; She rubs her arms as if cold, looking distracted and somewhat distraught.</string>
<string name="86312">&quot;May we speak, dear?&quot;</string>
<string name="86313">&quot;Undermountain is a dangerous place. I suspect you need someone of faith to guide your way, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="86314">&quot;It is wonderful to see you again, dear. Have you a need of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="86315">&quot;Hello there, dear. What can I do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="86316">&quot;Would you like something else?&quot;</string>
<string name="86317">&quot;Then may Sehanine guide my hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="86318">&quot;Is that Sharwyn? Oh my! We should help her!&quot;</string>
<string name="86319">&quot;It&apos;s Daelan! And he&apos;s been killed! Please, let us help him!&quot;</string>
<string name="86320">&quot;Ah, it seems Tomi did not get very far. And it was I who insisted on sending him here alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="86321">&quot;Do you think these pillars are some form of puzzle? How odd. I feel as if we are being tested, somehow.&quot;</string>
<string name="86322">&quot;Beware the sleeping dragon. If we are to wake it, we should be prepared.&quot;</string>
<string name="86323">&quot;I... always feel disoriented after being teleported. Just give me a moment, please...&quot;</string>
<string name="86324">&quot;I think the little rodent has led us here. My! Aren&apos;t you an intelligent little creature!&quot;</string>
<string name="86325">&quot;He has given up! Let him surrender! Please!&quot;</string>
<string name="86326">&quot;I... don&apos;t have the senses of some damnable thief, but I do think there is danger here.&quot;</string>
<string name="86327">&quot;She&apos;s surrendered herself! Please, just... let her be for a moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="86328">&quot;The statues are part of some greater puzzle, no doubt. Just be careful, dear.&quot;</string>
<string name="86329">&quot;I am NOT clumsy! ...well, all right, I am not THAT clumsy.&quot;</string>
<string name="86330">&quot;The smell of goblins here is... nauseating. How could such tiny creatures survive here in Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="86331">&quot;Oh! It&apos;s Nathyrra again! She is *so* quiet!&quot;</string>
<string name="86332">&quot;Here is Nathyrra again. It is good to see she hasn&apos;t been hurt!&quot;</string>
<string name="86333">&quot;Oops! I think I knocked something over!&quot;</string>
<string name="86334">&quot;I don&apos;t want to step into any traps. I seem to do that too often.&quot;</string>
<string name="86335">&quot;Oh my! Did you hear that? Oh... maybe it was nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="86336">&quot;Why did they put me in a sarcophagus? Were they going to eat me later? Hmmm... I don&apos;t want to think about that...&quot;</string>
<string name="86337">&quot;Sehanine guide us through this terrible place.&quot;</string>
<string name="86338">&quot;This dungeon smells of... old death. I can&apos;t imagine anyone actually living here.&quot;</string>
<string name="86339">&quot;There seem to be bodies everywhere. What poor souls met their fates here?&quot;</string>
<string name="86340">&quot;How many heroes have met ignoble ends in these halls? It is sad to think about.&quot;</string>
<string name="86341">&quot;The good Durnan actually survived this place. Now that I&apos;ve seen it my respect for him increases.&quot;</string>
<string name="86342">&quot;Just be careful where you step, dear. I can heal you, but I&apos;d rather you just didn&apos;t get hurt.&quot;</string>
<string name="86343">&quot;I would never have pictured myself doing this back at the temple in Evereska.&quot;</string>
<string name="86344">&quot;Oh dear. There went my heel. Sigh...&quot;</string>
<string name="86345">&quot;Sehanine give me courage to walk into the shadows...&quot;</string>
<string name="86346">&quot;It already feels as if we are miles under the earth. To think that the Underdark is even further down... it seems unbearable to consider.&quot;</string>
<string name="86347">&quot;I&apos;m not sure... are we here to *rescue* Halaster or not? He... created all this horror, after all...&quot;</string>
<string name="86348">&quot;I&apos;ve been told the drow are related to my own people, but... sometimes I just can&apos;t believe it.&quot;</string>
<string name="86349">&quot;Oops! I spilled something on my armor...&quot;</string>
<string name="86350">&quot;Where did my symbol go? Did I drop it again?&quot;</string>
<string name="86351">&quot;I&apos;ve been told that these mind flayer creatures actually eat your... brain. Isn&apos;t that a horrifying thought?&quot;</string>
<string name="86352">&quot;We&apos;ve got to help all those poor people up in Waterdeep! They&apos;re counting on us!&quot;</string>
<string name="86353">&quot;Quickly! We must aid Durnan, or all shall be lost!&quot;</string>
<string name="86354">&quot;We must destroy this evil before it kills everyone here! Please help us!!&quot;</string>
<string name="86355">The elven cleric nods to you and smiles pleasantly as you approach. &quot;It is good to see you again.&quot;</string>
<string name="86356">&quot;You are welcome amongst us, dear. I understand everyone here has been awaiting your arrival with great anticipation.&quot;</string>
<string name="86357">The cleric&apos;s holy symbol marks her as a priestess of the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow. She nods respectfully to you. &quot;Blessed be, my friend.&quot;</string>
<string name="86358">&quot;We have been victorious! One blow struck against the evil that threatens this city!&quot;</string>
<string name="86359">&quot;I do not want to talk to you. You are cruel and nasty and spiteful and... and mean! Please, just leave me alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="86360">&quot;Back again, dear? Is there anything you need from me?&quot;</string>
<string name="86361">&quot;I see you made it out of Undermountain safe and sound. I suppose that&apos;s a good thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="86362">&quot;Welcome back. It&apos;s so good to see you again, dear. I trust things have been going well? I&apos;ve been praying to Sehanine to watch over you.&quot;</string>
<string name="86363">&quot;Are you... are you real? Or are you one of those Rakshasa in disguise? No... that makes no sense. They killed me, they would have no reason to bring me back to life.&quot;</string>
<string name="86364">&quot;Don&apos;t get in front of me! I&apos;m trying to remember everything that&apos;s going on, you know!&quot;</string>
<string name="86365">&quot;Don&apos;t talk, just... just hit something!&quot;</string>
<string name="86366">The striking woman chuckles as you approach. &quot;Good to see you again.&quot;</string>
<string name="86367">&quot;Ah, yes. You would be the one our dear innkeeper has been waiting on before he begins. How good of you to come.&quot;</string>
<string name="86368">The striking woman smiles at you brightly. &quot;Is there something I can do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="86369">&quot;This shall make a grand tale!&quot;</string>
<string name="86370">&quot;There&apos;s no real purpose in us speaking to one another, is there?&quot;</string>
<string name="86371">&quot;Back again? Something I can help you with, perhaps?&quot;</string>
<string name="86372">&quot;Still alive, I see.&quot;</string>
<string name="86373">&quot;This... this is Undermountain! How did I...? What happened? Did I die? Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="86374">&quot;Hello, there. A rather enjoyable adventure this is, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="86375">&quot;I don&apos;t think I will ever become accustomed to the idea of returning from the dead. My memories of what happens before you come back are so... hazy. I wonder why that is?&quot;</string>
<string name="86376">&quot;A moment, if you would.&quot;</string>
<string name="86377">&quot;Undermountain calls, I see? Do you need my assistance once more?&quot;</string>
<string name="86378">&quot;It is good to see you once again. Do you have need of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="86379">&quot;Yes? Is there something you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="86380">&quot;Is there something else, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="86381">&quot;So be it!&quot;</string>
<string name="86382">&quot;Now *this* should be interesting.&quot;</string>
<string name="86383">&quot;Aw, look. It seems we have a dead barbarian on our hands, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="86384">&quot;I think I see Tomi&apos;s body, there. You aren&apos;t going to raise him, are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="86385">&quot;How interesting... these pillars are, no doubt, part of a puzzle erected to bar our progress through Undermountain. Halaster seems to have made this entire place a... a deadly lunatic maze.&quot;</string>
<string name="86386">&quot;Careful. I don&apos;t think we want to wake up the beast without preparing properly.&quot;</string>
<string name="86387">&quot;Halaster&apos;s very fond of teleporting, I understand. Let&apos;s just... not try using them too often. I don&apos;t want to end up teleporting inside a dragon&apos;s belly, you know?&quot;</string>
<string name="86388">&quot;Ah-ha! The rat has led us to treasure, it seems. Isn&apos;t that always the way?&quot;</string>
<string name="86389">&quot;He has surrendered! Question the ogre while you can!&quot;</string>
<string name="86390">&quot;Hmmm. I sense a definite trap of some sort, here. Be wary of the sarcophagus.&quot;</string>
<string name="86391">&quot;She&apos;s surrendered. There&apos;s no need to continue fighting her... perhaps we should parley?&quot;</string>
<string name="86392">&quot;Perhaps the statue is part of another puzzle? Let&apos;s take a closer look, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="86393">&quot;What&apos;s this? Common folk here inside Undermountain? How very strange.&quot;</string>
<string name="86394">&quot;Can you see the traces? It looks like goblins in this area. We&apos;d best be careful... for goblins to survive here, they&apos;d have to be very cunning.&quot;</string>
<string name="86395">&quot;It is the drow, returned to us again, it appears.&quot;</string>
<string name="86396">&quot;Nathyrra has come back, silent as ever.&quot;</string>
<string name="86397">&quot;Why do dungeons always have to be so blasted cold? I&apos;m freezing.&quot;</string>
<string name="86398">&quot;Did someone write graffiti here? Hmmm... ahhhh... no, I guess that would be just a stain. Huh.&quot;</string>
<string name="86399">&quot;I&apos;m trying to think of how this adventure would be put to music... but I can&apos;t get that kobold&apos;s blasted &apos;Doom Song&apos; out of my head.&quot;</string>
<string name="86400">&quot;Hmph. I should have picked up some new boots.&quot;</string>
<string name="86401">&quot;Have you ever tried drawing a map by torchlight? This is so frustrating...&quot;</string>
<string name="86402">&quot;You know what Elminster says about Undermountain? &apos;The largest known mass grave in Faerun today.&apos; I believe it.&quot;</string>
<string name="86403">&quot;I wonder what happens to the dead in here? Is there some kind of... of eco-system? Or does magic take care of everything?&quot;</string>
<string name="86404">&quot;Halaster must summon creatures to fill his maze. There&apos;s no way such different monsters could exist so close to one another.&quot;</string>
<string name="86405">&quot;How sadistic and mad would Halaster have to be to... to *live* here?&quot;</string>
<string name="86406">&quot;Wait... did I mark this on the map right? Damn it!&quot;</string>
<string name="86407">&quot;You know, I began adventuring to be famous. Yet I always seem to end up traveling with someone who takes the credit.&quot;</string>
<string name="86408">&quot;Just watch. I&apos;m going to write some great song down here and then die horribly just so it can be found by some talentless bard years from now and *he&apos;ll* become famous.&quot;</string>
<string name="86409">&quot;You know what? This dungeon seems very clean to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="86410">&quot;The fact that Waterdeep, the largest city in Faerun, is RIGHT OVERHEAD --- that just blows my mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="86411">&quot;To think we got here through a well in an inn... a bit odd, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="86412">&quot;I&apos;ve heard there&apos;s a city in the Underdark if you go beneath the dungeon. It&apos;s called Skullport... I wonder if it&apos;s involved in all this somehow?&quot;</string>
<string name="86413">&quot;Dried blood. More dried blood. Bones. Yick.&quot;</string>
<string name="86414">&quot;Hmmm... is this off-tune? I can&apos;t decide.&quot;</string>
<string name="86415">&quot;I must admit, the thought of mind flayers... those things with the tentacles on their face... they give me nightmares.&quot;</string>
<string name="86416">&quot;Can you imagine if we actually receive the reward? All that gold... what would one do with it?&quot;</string>
<string name="86417">&quot;Don&apos;t start yappin&apos;! Fight, already!&quot;</string>
<string name="86418">&quot;What are ye standin&apos; about yammering? Kill somethin&apos;, will ya?&quot;</string>
<string name="86419">The halfling smiles brightly at you. &quot;Hey, now! Something else ya need?&quot;</string>
<string name="86420">&quot;Oi! I think everyone&apos;s been waitin&apos; on you. About bloody time ye popped down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="86421">The halfling rogue appraises you with a fair amount of disinterest before finally belching in an almost challenging manner. &quot;Yeah? Ya wants somethin&apos;, I bet.&quot;</string>
<string name="86422">&quot;Yeah! If that&apos;s all that bloody Undermountain has t&apos; throw at us, then there&apos;s nothin&apos; but smooth sailin&apos; ahead!&quot;</string>
<string name="86423">&quot;Well, if it isn&apos;t Tomi&apos;s very own personal savior! How&apos;s it goin&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="86424">&quot;Dyin&apos; makes ya bloody hungry, that&apos;s all I gots ta say. Nice ta see ya again, by the way. Thanks for the raise an&apos; all.&quot;</string>
<string name="86425">&quot;Dyin&apos; makes ya bloody hungry, that&apos;s all I gots ta say. So did ya decide you  needs Tomi Undergallows to travel with ya, now?&quot;</string>
<string name="86426">&quot;Ha! I knew you&apos;d come around eventually! You hear that, world?! Tomi&apos;s back on the road!!&quot;</string>
<string name="86427">&quot;Well, I&apos;ll be a nekkid monkey&apos;s uncle. Did I die again? And I was just about to gut the bloody bastard, too, wouldn&apos;t ya know it?&quot;</string>
<string name="86428">&quot;Aye? Don&apos;t suppose there&apos;s some reason for us ta chat, is there? Naw, didn&apos;t bloody well think so.&quot;</string>
<string name="86429">&quot;Am I glad to see you! I expect the gods&apos;re gettin&apos; tired of seein&apos; me. They&apos;re going ta start thinking I&apos;m just taunting them, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="86430">&quot;Oy! Listen up!&quot;</string>
<string name="86431">&quot;So... ya need Tomi&apos;s skills again? Undermountain has a lot of traps, ya know. Better we pair up than go it alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="86432">&quot;Right-o! Off we go!&quot;</string>
<string name="86433">&quot;So are we off, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="86434">&quot;Eh? What can Tomi do for ya?&quot;</string>
<string name="86435">&quot;Something else ya need?&quot;</string>
<string name="86436">&quot;Oy! Either that&apos;s Sharwyn over there on the bloody floor or corpses in general are lookin&apos; a lot better n&apos; usual.&quot;</string>
<string name="86437">&quot;Don&apos;t look now but I think we gots a half-orc barbarian corpse on our hands.&quot;</string>
<string name="86438">&quot;Bloody hell!&quot;</string>
<string name="86439">&quot;Ya know, the bloody wizard who made this place just loves ta put puzzles like this in your way. I s&apos;pose we&apos;ll have to solve this thing now, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="86440">&quot;Right. Sleepin&apos; dragon ahead. Ya wants t&apos; wake it up nicely or rudely?&quot;</string>
<string name="86441">&quot;I always love a good teleport. Gets ya in places ya can&apos;t sneak to, ya know?&quot;</string>
<string name="86442">&quot;It&apos;s always best ta figure that a rat knows the way to treasure, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="86443">&quot;Oh, look. He&apos;s gone an&apos; given himself up now. Too bad fer him.&quot;</string>
<string name="86444">&quot;Mehh... might want t&apos; hold on, here. I gots a bad feelin&apos; about this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="86445">&quot;She surrendered? I say cut &apos;er wings off! Hah-ha ha ha!&quot;</string>
<string name="86446">&quot;Blasted bloody statues. What do ya want t&apos; bet that it&apos;s part of some puzzle? I hate these things.&quot;</string>
<string name="86447">&quot;Oh, it&apos;s these folks again. Still don&apos;t trust &apos;em.&quot;</string>
<string name="86448">&quot;Can ya smell that? That&apos;s goblin turds, that is. Bloody smart buggers, sometimes, though they&apos;re probably no match fer you.&quot;</string>
<string name="86449">&quot;Oy! She&apos;s back again, look sharp!&quot;</string>
<string name="86450">&quot;Damn, but she&apos;s good. I didn&apos;t even bloody well pick &apos;er out that time.&quot;</string>
<string name="86451">&quot;I wonder where me old friend Sammy has gotten off to. I sure do miss &apos;im.&quot;</string>
<string name="86452">&quot;You reminds me of someone I met in Neverwinter. I ever tells ya that?&quot;</string>
<string name="86453">&quot;Just another adventure to round out me fulfilling career, I always say.&quot;</string>
<string name="86454">&quot;Oy now! Don&apos;t get too far ahead! I can only run so bleedin&apos; fast, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="86455">&quot;So-oooo... hmmm... I wonder how much a map o&apos; this place would go for...&quot;</string>
<string name="86456">&quot;Brandobaris&apos;s bloody feet! Does it ever smell in here, phaugh!&quot;</string>
<string name="86457">&quot;Hmph. Every dungeon looks the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="86458">&quot;Where&apos;s me damn picks... oh, there. Why&apos;d I put &apos;em there?&quot;</string>
<string name="86459">&quot;Oh. lovely... what&apos;d I step in now?&quot;</string>
<string name="86460">&quot;Crimeny... where the bloody hell are we?&quot;</string>
<string name="86461">&quot;Alright. Update the map... this thing&apos;ll be worth a fortune...&quot;</string>
<string name="86462">&quot;Oy! I hate it when there&apos;s miles o&apos; rock over me bloody head, don&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="86463">&quot;Bloody traps everywhere. I&apos;d love ta throttle the crazy mage who made this place, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="86464">&quot;Ya ever wonder why they don&apos;t just get an army and invade this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="86465">&quot;An&apos; all this was underneath Waterdeep the whole bleedin&apos; time. I thought it&apos;d be a bit smaller, meself.&quot;</string>
<string name="86466">&quot;Oy! What&apos;s that? Oh... just another rat.&quot;</string>
<string name="86467">&quot;If I dies again, don&apos;t ya bloody leave me down here, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="86468">&quot;Monster blood. There ain&apos;t nothin&apos; that stinks quite like it.&quot;</string>
<string name="86469">&quot;Ya think we&apos;ll be going down t&apos; the Underdark? I been there before, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="86470">&quot;What in bleedin&apos; blazes is on me shoe? Gahhh! It&apos;s a right squishy one.&quot;</string>
<string name="86471">To battle!</string>
<string name="86472">Die!</string>
<string name="86473">You will fall!</string>
<string name="86474">I cannot lose!</string>
<string name="86475">I&apos;m hurt. Someone heal me.</string>
<string name="86476">Help me! Quickly!</string>
<string name="86477">Hello.</string>
<string name="86478">Right away.</string>
<string name="86479">I&apos;m sorry, no.</string>
<string name="86480">Farewell.</string>
<string name="86481">Yes!!</string>
<string name="86482">Listen to me now.</string>
<string name="86483">That was a mistake!</string>
<string name="86484">For all that is good, be ready to battle!</string>
<string name="86485">Sehanine&apos;s will be done!</string>
<string name="86486">By all that is good!</string>
<string name="86487">In the name of the Seldarine!</string>
<string name="86488">I will need healing quickly.</string>
<string name="86489">Please! Some assistance!</string>
<string name="86490">By the gods, here come some more.</string>
<string name="86491">We must fall back!</string>
<string name="86492">The will of one who is good and right shall stop you.</string>
<string name="86493">I need assistance over here! Cover me!</string>
<string name="86494">Hold!</string>
<string name="86495">(pained grunt) With my&#8230; last breath, I&#8230;</string>
<string name="86496">Why... is everything spinning?</string>
<string name="86497">My magic has failed!</string>
<string name="86498">It seems my weapon is of no use here!</string>
<string name="86499">This way, dear. </string>
<string name="86500">Now, what would that be?</string>
<string name="86501">We should work together.</string>
<string name="86502">I must get through. Please!</string>
<string name="86503">I&apos;ll see what I can do to get it open.</string>
<string name="86504">I&apos;ll keep my eyes open.</string>
<string name="86505">Let us move unseen, then.</string>
<string name="86506">Alright, dear.</string>
<string name="86507">I don&apos;t believe I can, dear, sorry.</string>
<string name="86508">I&apos;m done here.</string>
<string name="86509">This is too much to place on me, dear, I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="86510">Your will?</string>
<string name="86511">Blessed be.</string>
<string name="86512">By Sehanine, I should say so!</string>
<string name="86513">I don&apos;t think so.</string>
<string name="86514">Hold on a minute.</string>
<string name="86515">On a journey there must always be time to rest.</string>
<string name="86516">Well, this is certainly one way of not getting anywhere, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="86517">I&apos;ll miss you, dear one.</string>
<string name="86518">I thank you, truly.</string>
<string name="86519">Takasi! Oh, please do excuse my elven.</string>
<string name="86520">The gods would be pleased today!</string>
<string name="86521">If I might say something, dear?</string>
<string name="86522">That makes sense to me.</string>
<string name="86523">I&#8230; do not think that is such a good idea.</string>
<string name="86524">In the name of Sehanine Moonbow, I swear that you shall not survive the day!</string>
<string name="86525">By my command, fight!</string>
<string name="86526">Oloth plynn dos!</string>
<string name="86527">Ultrinnan!</string>
<string name="86528">Die by my hand!</string>
<string name="86529">I require healing! Now, fools!</string>
<string name="86530">To me! To me!</string>
<string name="86531">So we meet at last.</string>
<string name="86532">At once.</string>
<string name="86533">Nau!</string>
<string name="86534">Aluve&apos;.</string>
<string name="86535">My destiny is to conquer all!</string>
<string name="86536">I will speak with you now.</string>
<string name="86537">Vith&apos;os!</string>
<string name="86538">The time has come to battle, my friends!</string>
<string name="86539">We shall triumph!</string>
<string name="86540">The good shall prevail!</string>
<string name="86541">Evil is undone!</string>
<string name="86542">Dark Maiden! Your servant needs healing!</string>
<string name="86543">I am in need of your aid!</string>
<string name="86544">And so my time ends&#8230;</string>
<string name="86545">You are most welcome.</string>
<string name="86546">So shall it be.</string>
<string name="86547">No, that cannot be.</string>
<string name="86548">Long life and blessed be, my friend.</string>
<string name="86549">Well done!</string>
<string name="86550">A moment of your time.</string>
<string name="86551">The power of Eilistraee shall see you defeated!</string>
<string name="86552">We fight! For glory!</string>
<string name="86553">Down you go!</string>
<string name="86554">You&apos;re in for it now!</string>
<string name="86555">Damn! I need some healing!</string>
<string name="86556">I cannot keep up with this!</string>
<string name="86557">I hope you didn&apos;t invite them.</string>
<string name="86558">We&apos;ve got to get out of here!</string>
<string name="86559">Come on! Come on!</string>
<string name="86560">Watch my back!</string>
<string name="86561">Wait, wait.</string>
<string name="86562">Blast! Not now!</string>
<string name="86563">Not like this&#8230;</string>
<string name="86564">Bloody poison!</string>
<string name="86565">No good! My spell failed!</string>
<string name="86566">My attack does nothing!</string>
<string name="86567">Come with me.</string>
<string name="86568">What&apos;s that?</string>
<string name="86569">Let&apos;s stay together, now.</string>
<string name="86570">Let me by, please.</string>
<string name="86571">I&apos;ll see what I can do.</string>
<string name="86572">Let&apos;s look around a bit&#8230;</string>
<string name="86573">Time to fade into the background, hmm?</string>
<string name="86574">Fair enough.</string>
<string name="86575">Sorry.</string>
<string name="86576">Finished.</string>
<string name="86577">I am not a pack mule, you know. Notice the lack of long ears and hooves.</string>
<string name="86578">Something you need?</string>
<string name="86579">Well met.</string>
<string name="86580">Yes.</string>
<string name="86581">Afraid not.</string>
<string name="86582">Hold!</string>
<string name="86583">I need to sit down, just for a bit.</string>
<string name="86584">Some excitement would be welcome.</string>
<string name="86585">I wish you well.</string>
<string name="86586">You have my appreciation.</string>
<string name="86587">Oh bugger!</string>
<string name="86588">Well done!</string>
<string name="86589">Might we chat for a moment?</string>
<string name="86590">Sounds fine to me.</string>
<string name="86591">Hmm&#8230; I don&apos;t know&#8230;</string>
<string name="86592">You&apos;ll not be the first to regret crossing me!</string>
<string name="86593">Let&apos;s have a bit of fun, shall we?</string>
<string name="86594">Woo-hoo!</string>
<string name="86595">Here comes halfling death!</string>
<string name="86596">I love this part!</string>
<string name="86597">Hey! Bleeding over here&#8230;</string>
<string name="86598">Oops! Need a hand!</string>
<string name="86599">Uh-oh&#8230; uninvited guests.</string>
<string name="86600">This isn&apos;t working out like I thought!</string>
<string name="86601">Yer ugly and you smell like a rotting skunk!</string>
<string name="86602">Make sure I don&apos;t lose me head!</string>
<string name="86603">Wait a bloody second.</string>
<string name="86604">Aww, shoot, and we were doing so well!</string>
<string name="86605">Aw, not again!</string>
<string name="86606">Poison? Why didn&#8217;t I think of that?</string>
<string name="86607">I hate it when me bloody spells won&apos;t work!</string>
<string name="86608">I ain&apos;t doing much, &apos;ere&#8230;</string>
<string name="86609">Come on! Come on!</string>
<string name="86610">Eh? What&apos;s this?</string>
<string name="86611">Err&#8230; maybe we should organize ourselves a bit?</string>
<string name="86612">Need to get by ya, mate.</string>
<string name="86613">Just gimme a sec&apos;.</string>
<string name="86614">There&apos;s gotta be something here&#8230;</string>
<string name="86615">Time to slip into the shadows!</string>
<string name="86616">Hokey-dokey!</string>
<string name="86617">No can do.</string>
<string name="86618">Yep, all done.</string>
<string name="86619">What am I? A bloody mule?</string>
<string name="86620">Yep?</string>
<string name="86621">Hullo.</string>
<string name="86622">Aye!</string>
<string name="86623">Nope.</string>
<string name="86624">Hold up, there.</string>
<string name="86625">I am so bushed, you have no idea.</string>
<string name="86626">See ya &apos;round!</string>
<string name="86627">Thanks, mate!</string>
<string name="86628">Dammit!</string>
<string name="86629">Yeah! At&apos;s the way!</string>
<string name="86630">So-ooo&#8230;</string>
<string name="86631">Wish I&apos;d thought of that.</string>
<string name="86632">Ya might want to rethink that.</string>
<string name="86633">Okay. Now yer in for it.</string>
<string name="86634">Mother Seer, it is good to see you once more.</string>
<string name="86635">I believe I have come up with a better solution. Better for House Maeviir, at least.</string>
<string name="86636">The Valsharess is too strong. We either side with her or die.</string>
<string name="86637">House Maeviir no longer needs you, Seer. We serve the Valsharess now!</string>
<string name="86638"></string>
<string name="86639">&quot;You are within my fortress, of course, brought here by the power of the archdevil bound to my service. You are now my guest... and my prisoner.&quot;</string>
<string name="86640">&quot;But I already have. If you do not believe me, then come... approach me if you dare.&quot;</string>
<string name="86641">&quot;Such bluster! What a pathetic female you make. Like a lowly male you are not even aware of your true situation.&quot;</string>
<string name="86642">&quot;Such bluster! What a glorious male you are! You should have taken my offer when you had the chance. We would have been magnificent together!&quot;</string>
<string name="86643">&quot;By all means, then. Come... kill me if you dare.&quot;</string>
<string name="86644">&quot;I am afraid that it is. You are in no position to negotiate, here. If you do not believe me, then come... approach me if you dare.&quot;</string>
<string name="86645">&quot;What do I want? Ha-ha ha ha! I want you within my power. I want to make you suffer before Mephistopheles destroys the rebels. I want to see the Seer weep as she is the last to be crushed!&quot;</string>
<string name="86646">&quot;And you are indeed within my power, surfacer. If you do not believe me, then come... approach me if you dare.&quot;</string>
<string name="86647">&quot;Am I? Perhaps so, though you are certainly in no position to kill me or anyone for that matter. You are now my guest... and my prisoner.&quot;</string>
<string name="86648">&quot;Oh? I suppose it might seem that way, to you. Before I unleashed Mephistopheles upon those pitiful rebels I wanted to deal with you, first... my guest and my prisoner.&quot;</string>
<string name="86649">&quot;An alliance? Certainly not. You had your opportunity and you threw it away. No, fool, now you live only at my sufferance: my guest and my prisoner.&quot;</string>
<string name="86650">&quot;Ha-ha ha! You are wise to be suspicious of me, surfacer. This one time, however, I mean exactly what I say. I am in the mood to celebrate.&quot;</string>
<string name="86651">&quot;Impatient, are we? I see I will have to keep a close eye on you, indeed. This shall be an... interesting alliance.&quot;</string>
<string name="86652">&quot;That is my secret to keep, dear ally. Do you believe I would consider handing over the control of my pet to anyone, even to you? Certainly not!&quot;</string>
<string name="86653">&quot;Ha-ha ha ha! It would be a... challenge... to try to tame you, surfacer. I think not, however. I have tamed this fool devil, and that is enough for anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="86654">&quot;Now what kind of talk is that from my best ally, hmmm? I see I will have to keep a close eye on you, indeed. If you wish to know what keeps me safe, however, then I will tell you.&quot;</string>
<string name="86655">&quot;Indeed. We have all the time in the world to discuss such matters, ally. For the moment, I am in the mood to celebrate.&quot;</string>

<string name="86684">As you desire, great Valsharess.</string>
<string name="86685">And so she is dead. You have done well, mortal.</string>
<string name="86686">&quot;Indeed I was. But there are rules and even older rules that I must obey, all of which supercede the bindings the fool drow placed me under. Not that she knew of this.&quot;</string>
<string name="86687">&quot;She may have summoned me, but to command me to slay one who is an extension of myself... that was beyond her power. A pity.&quot;</string>
<string name="86688">&quot;That would be *you*, mortal. Ever since you found my relic within the Plane of Shadow, you have been bound to me as it has been bound to you. A most fortuitous event, in my eyes.&quot;</string>
<string name="86689">&quot;Is that what you call it? The relic is a piece of my own flesh, meant for the leader of my priesthood on this plane... but obviously it was destined to be found by you, instead.&quot;</string>
<string name="86690">&quot;Through it, I called you here, confident that your power could challenge even that of the Valsharess... and I was correct. I am always pleased when a gamble turns out well.&quot;</string>
<string name="86691">&quot;I am free. A great lord of the devils able to roam amongst the mortals and bring suffering to them as I wish, with not a one who possesses the power to stop me!&quot;</string>
<string name="86692">&quot;I would begin with you, dear mortal, but since we are bound so closely that would not be prudent. Instead I will send you someplace you may not interfere. And the relic... that I relieve you of now.&quot;</string>
<string name="86693">&quot;I wish you well in the Hells, mortal. You have proven... most useful.&quot;</string>
<string name="86694">&quot;Alas, I have other plans.&quot;</string>
<string name="86695">&quot;You think to battle me? My dear mortal, no... did you not listen to a thing I said? We are bound, you and I. You could no more slay me than I could you.&quot;</string>
<string name="86696">&quot;Planned to get summoned and bound by a lowly drow? No, of course not. Think of yourself as an unexpected resource I had available to me... and I used you to free myself from this wretched slavery.&quot;</string>
<string name="86697">I shall *not* do as you desire, great Valsharess. Instead... instead I shall slay your precious Red Sisters.</string>
<string name="86698">A moment, mortal. I would speak with you.</string>
<string name="86699">You are a foolish mortal, drow, like any other. You know not the powers you tamper with! Now pay the price!</string>
<string name="86700">&quot;Tell me, mortal... is this the true path you choose to follow?&quot;</string>
<string name="86701">&quot;You intend to stand by the Valsharess, do you? You believe a jealous drow will share all that she has with you, another female?&quot;</string>
<string name="86702">&quot;You intend to stand by the Valsharess, do you? You believe a jealous drow thinks herself an equal to a lowly surfacer male?&quot;</string>
<string name="86703">&quot;You may be useful to her for the moment, mortal, but when the time comes she will betray you. Surely you know this.&quot;</string>
<string name="86704">&quot;Ha ha-ha! I do like your thinking, mortal. A most delightful mind you possess. Surely the rest of what I have to say will not surprise you.&quot;</string>
<string name="86705">&quot;Indeed you are not. Look at what this drow has already reached for and tell me she would not still make the attempt, regardless of the risk.&quot;</string>
<string name="86706">&quot;And why not? You have already listened to hers, now listen to mine. Decide for yourself which of us makes the most sense and has the most to gain.&quot;</string>
<string name="86707">&quot;Why do that? Ask yourself honestly if the drow has given you any reason to believe her at all? Are you truly so gullible?&quot;</string>
<string name="86708">&quot;She fears you, mortal. She has seen the future and knows that you could destroy her. Do you think her pride would allow you to exist one moment longer than you needed to?&quot;</string>
<string name="86709">&quot;Yours is the destiny to possess true power. You need share nothing with the drow. Take it! Take it for yourself! I would gladly serve one who is truly worthy!&quot;</string>
<string name="86710">&quot;Ha ha-ha! The difference between what the drow knows and what she thinks she knows is vast, mortal. Do not make the same mistake as she. What do you say to my offer?&quot;</string>
<string name="86711">&quot;Then you are a fool, mortal, for what comes next is inevitable.&quot;</string>
<string name="86712">&quot;You are... most wise, mortal.&quot;</string>
<string name="86713">All is as I said it would be, Matron Mother.</string>
<string name="86714">Of course, great Valsharess. What is your desire?</string>
<string name="86715">The one you seek is beyond my sight, great Valsharess.</string>
<string name="86716">It is as I have already spoken, great Valsharess, I --</string>
<string name="86717">I cannot do what is beyond my power, great Valsharess.</string>
<string name="86718">I am, as you say, yours to command.</string>
<string name="86719">&quot;As you desire, great Valsharess. I greet you, mortal, at the behest of she who has bound me.&quot;</string>
<string name="86720">&quot;I shall *not* do as you desire, great Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="86721">&quot;Ah, the fool mortal returns. Imagine my surprise at meeting you here. Last I recall, had I not trapped you for all eternity in an icy little place called Cania?&quot;</string>
<string name="86722">&quot;Try what you might, you cannot stop me, mortal. I know you far too well.&quot;</string>
<string name="86723">&quot;My... My True Name! You&apos;ve commanded me!? Where did you learn it?! Rrraugh, but I must obey! ...What... What is it you wish of me, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;? How must I serve you?&quot;</string>
<string name="86724">&quot;Rrraaaaaugh!&quot;</string>
<string name="86725">&quot;Yes, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;! Of course! As you command, all evil will be purged from my soul...&quot;</string>
<string name="86726">&quot;Yes, thank you &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;! Thank you for your mercy! May frozen Cania be my home forevermore...&quot;</string>

<string name="86728">&quot;Now what were we discussing, mortal? Oh yes, I remember now... Friends... How quaint.&quot;</string>
<string name="86729">&quot;Yes, we&apos;ll rule together. As equals... Friends... Yes, we&apos;ll share it all... Nothing will stand in our way!&quot;</string>
<string name="86730">&quot;Your lackey. Yes, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;. I will bend and scrape... I will serve you and you will rule the Hells of Baator in my stead...&quot;</string>
<string name="86731">&quot;A... A chambermaid, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;? But I was meant for greater things! You would reduce me to turning down bed sheets and emptying the chamber pots of drunken mortals? ...It shall be as you wish...&quot;</string>
<string name="86732">&quot;I gave you all of Cania for your realm yet still you covet what I claim as mine? You ungrateful little toad... It is you who will be replaced, not I!&quot;</string>
<string name="86733">&quot;The Knowers? Damn you, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;, you leave me with nothing... Very well, Cania is theirs, and Baator&apos;s Hellish claim on it is hereby forfeit! It is as you command...&quot;</string>
<string name="86734">&quot;Ungh! I can fight you... no more...&quot;</string>
<string name="86735">&quot;Good evening, m&apos;lady. Do you come here often? ...Forgive me if I seem gauche but, last I recall, I had trapped you for all eternity in an icy little place called Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="86736">&quot;It appears you have been my downfall, mortal... I underestimated you. Next time I won&apos;t make the same mistake...&quot;</string>
<string name="86737">&quot;Repent of what? Everything I have done I would do again, if only I had the breath left in me to make it so... A curse upon your lineage, mortal, and every place you lay your head...&quot;</string>
<string name="86738">&quot;For good or ill, I surrender any claim upon this world to you. Do with it as you will, if you have the power... Now on your honor, I beg you to let me go...&quot;</string>
<string name="86739">&quot;Nor I yours, truth be told... Very well, you have fought me fair and spared my life. You will not see me again...&quot;</string>
<string name="86740">&quot;Banished to Cania, home and exile all at once... Very well, you have fought me fair and spared my life. I will abide by your decree... Farewell, mortal, you have seen your last of me...&quot;</string>

<string name="87002">The bottle begins to shake and tremble in your grasp. A cloud of smoke billows forth, the mists coalescing into the figure of a powerfully built man.</string>
<string name="87003">&quot;I am no slave! I am a descended from the Royal House Arsetis. The drow couldn&apos;t force me to serve them, and neither can you, mortal!&quot;</string>
<string name="87004">&quot;Allow me to introduce myself: I am Volkarion Arsetis, a powerful djinni of royal blood.&quot;</string>
<string name="87005">&quot;You mortals have some strange preconceptions about us. Every time I cross paths with one of your kind, you seem to think I&apos;m obligated to give you a wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="87006">&quot;Unfortunately for you, it doesn&apos;t work that way. But I am grateful for my release.&quot;</string>
<string name="87007">&quot;A reward? Well, I suppose something is in order. But first, allow me to introduce myself: I am Volkarion Arsetis, a powerful djinni of royal blood.&quot;</string>
<string name="87008">&quot;You mortals have some strange preconceptions about us. Everytime I cross paths with one of your kind, you seem to think I&apos;m obligated to give you a wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="87009">&quot;Unfortunately for you, it doesn&apos;t work that way. But I am grateful for my release. Allow me to introduce myself: I am Volkarion Arsetis, a powerful djinni of royal blood.&quot;</string>
<string name="87010">&quot;I do have something I can give you as a reward; a trinket Halaster recently gave to me for safekeeping. I suspect he didn&apos;t want the drow to get it, but I&apos;m sure he won&apos;t mind if I give it to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87011">&quot;This is an activation stone for a magic portal that will allow you to move between Undermountain and Waterdeep. I seem to remember Halaster saying it was in the eastern section of Undermountain&apos;s second level.&quot;</string>
<string name="87012">&quot;Well, aren&apos;t you a fiesty one. Most mortals aren&apos;t stupid enough to look for trouble with a djinni. But you did free me, so I guess I&apos;ll give you another chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="87013">&quot;There is something else I could do for you; an offer that could help us both. I was getting very tired of dealing with the drow. And now that Halaster is missing, business has been a bit slow.&quot;</string>
<string name="87014">&quot;I like you, mortal. There&apos;s something different about you, something unique. And business has been a bit slow for me since Halaster disappeared.&quot;</string>
<string name="87015">&quot;I&apos;m going to do you a favor, mortal. I&apos;m going to allow you to have access to my shop, a store virtually overflowing with magical merchandise.&quot;</string>
<string name="87016">&quot;Yes, of course. I imagine you&apos;re quite busy. Very well - I will return to my shop and we can conclude this business later on.&quot;</string>
<string name="87017">&quot;I don&apos;t think you appreciate what a rare opportunity you&apos;re being given.&quot;</string>
<string name="87018">&quot;I&apos;m a merchant dealing in rare and powerful magical items. I wander the planes collecting wondrous artifacts, then I sell them to a few very select clients.&quot;</string>
<string name="87019">&quot;Halaster himself was one of my best customers. That&apos;s why I agreed to let him create this summoning bottle. Whenever he needed to see my inventory I was only a quick rub away.&quot;</string>
<string name="87020">&quot;Of course, ever since the drow got their ashen fingers on the bottle I&apos;m being summoned twenty times a day. I would never have agreed to this if I knew Halaster was going to be so careless.&quot;</string>
<string name="87021">&quot;The power of the bottle compels me to respond to each summons, and keeps me from taking any hostile action against the owner. But it doesn&apos;t mean I have to do business with them.&quot;</string>
<string name="87022">&quot;The dark elves are beneath me. I won&apos;t do business with them. I keep my list of customers very exclusive. Since you&apos;ve liberated my bottle from the drow, I&apos;m going to add you to that list.&quot;</string>
<string name="87023">&quot;Then I shall return to my work. The planes are full of rare and wonderous items, and I am constantly looking to add to my inventory.&quot;</string>
<string name="87024">&quot;If you need me for anything, just use the summoning bottle. You can use it three times each day. No matter where I am in my planar explorations, I will answer its call in mere seconds.&quot;</string>
<string name="87025">&quot;I don&apos;t see how that would even be possible. If you attack me, I&apos;ll simply vanish from your little plane of existence. There&apos;s nothing you could really do to stop me.&quot;</string>
<string name="87026">&quot;If you really feel the need you can try and harm me, but you&apos;ll only be wasting your time. You&apos;ll find it much more profitable if we do business together. I&apos;ll leave you to think about that.&quot;</string>
<string name="87027">&quot;Ha-ha! Of course you do, mortal. We Djinn are an item of endless fascination for your kind, aren&apos;t we? Very well, ask what you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="87028">&quot;It&apos;s not the gold itself that I value, but what it represents. Gold is precious to a mortal. To part with it is a sacrifice. My items are expensive: purchasing them is a great sacrifice to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87029">&quot;By giving me the gold, the value of the sacrifice - its worth to you - is then transferred to me. It&apos;s all very complicated, I don&apos;t expect you to fully understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="87030">&quot;All that should matter to you is that I have established my prices for my items, and none of my prices are negotiable.&quot;</string>
<string name="87031">&quot;I have spent many centuries journeying through the planes, seeking my fortune. And in my travels I have come across many magical items... items that my kind have little use for.&quot; </string>
<string name="87032">&quot;But you mortals find such items to be quite useful indeed. Rather than letting these items go to waste, I decided to sell them to those who had need of them.&quot;</string>
<string name="87033">&quot;Of course, dealing with mortals is difficult. That is why I have chosen my customers with great care. A powerful arch-mage like Halaster is a worthy client, an apprentice conjurer is not.&quot;</string>
<string name="87034">&quot;That may have been misleading, mortal. All Djinn are of royal blood, in some fashion. And while it is true my family&apos;s house is well respected, I am far from the seat of power.&quot; </string>
<string name="87035">&quot;If you were to compare my place in the hierarchy of my kind to your own class system, I would be nothing more than a wealthy merchant.&quot;</string>
<string name="87036">&quot;The reasons behind the actions of you mortals are almost always the same: greed, the hunger for power, the desire to conquer. I imagine the drow are bent on personal gain at the expense of everyone else.&quot;</string>
<string name="87037">&quot;However, I don&apos;t know any specific details. Why the drow specifically chose this time and place, and what they have done or intend to do with Halaster are as much a mystery to me as you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87038">&quot;Not much. I know Halaster created it, and I know from personal experience that he was quite proud of his creation. But the work of mortals holds little interest for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="87039">&quot;I can only speculate, mortal. Halaster always kept the summoning bottle on his person, so I would surmise the drow somehow obtained the bottle directly from the wizard.&quot;</string>
<string name="87040">&quot;But I doubt Halaster would have willingly turned the summoning bottle over to them. The mage has the same dislike for the Dark Elves as I do.&quot; </string>
<string name="87041">&quot;I suspect the bottle was forcibly taken from him, which means Halaster must now be a prisoner of the drow... if he&apos;s still alive.&quot; </string>
<string name="87042">&quot;Try disappearing on me again and I&apos;ll destroy you!&quot;</string>
<string name="87043">&quot;You will obey me, djinni! I own you!&quot;</string>
<string name="87044">&quot;I&apos;m sorry we got off on the wrong foot.&quot;</string>
<string name="87045">&quot;This isn&apos;t a rescue - you&apos;re my slave now!&quot;</string>
<string name="87046">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="87047">&quot;A djinni? Does this mean you&apos;ll grant me a wish?&quot;</string>
<string name="87048">&quot;So is there some kind of reward for rescuing you?&quot;</string>
<string name="87049">&quot;A djinni? Then I order you to do my bidding!&quot;</string>
<string name="87050">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intelligence]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Are you a djinni? Does this mean I get a wish?&quot;</string>
<string name="87051">&quot;You better come up with something better than a lousy rock!&quot;</string>
<string name="87052">&quot;Is that it?&quot;</string>
<string name="87053">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87054">&quot;I don&apos;t have time for this.&quot;</string>
<string name="87055">&quot;That doesn&apos;t sound like much of a reward.&quot;</string>
<string name="87056">&quot;Your shop? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="87057">&quot;That&apos;s all for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87058">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="87059">&quot;Why didn&apos;t you just destroy the drow?&quot;</string>
<string name="87060">&quot;Why didn&apos;t you just stop answering the summons?&quot;</string>
<string name="87061">&quot;I&apos;d like to see your inventory now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87062">&quot;No, that&apos;s all for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87063">&quot;I think I&apos;ll just kill you and take your inventory!&quot;</string>
<string name="87064">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="87065">&quot;Tell me about your store.&quot;</string>
<string name="87066">&quot;I want to know more about you, Volkarion.&quot;</string>
<string name="87067">&quot;I want to ask you about something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="87068">&quot;Why run a store? What use does a djinni have for gold?&quot;</string>
<string name="87069">&quot;Why did you decide to become a merchant?&quot;</string>
<string name="87070">&quot;You said before you are of royal blood?&quot;</string>
<string name="87071">&quot;Do you know why the drow have come to Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="87072">&quot;What can you tell me about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="87073">&quot;Do you know what happened to Halaster?&quot;</string>
<string name="87074">&quot;Let me see what you have in stock.&quot;</string>
<string name="87075">The Reaper stands before you, cold as ice. Distant flames flicker in the mirror of his face. You shiver in spite of yourself.</string>
<string name="87076">&quot;You are barred from the Prime Material plane. If you are about to ask me to return you there, I&apos;m sorry but I cannot comply.&quot;</string>
<string name="87077">&quot;Your death took place in the Prime Material plane. I am sorry but you are barred from there and I cannot comply.&quot;</string>
<string name="87078">&quot;Of course, Sojourner. If it is one thing we have here, it is time.&quot;</string>
<string name="87079">&quot;The devil, Mephistopheles, has commanded me with my True Name. Commands thus given none can disobey.&quot;</string>
<string name="87080">&quot;These are the names given us by the gods themselves. They have great power in the Planes and, as you can imagine, they are guarded jealously by those who know them.&quot;</string>
<string name="87081">&quot;Alas, that is another wish with which I cannot comply for Mephistopheles has bid me to never share it. But yes, if you commanded me with my True Name to send you home, I would have no choice but to comply.&quot;</string>
<string name="87082">&quot;There is one Gate here that was always sealed to you before. It leads to the surface of Cania and the City of Lost Souls that gather there. It is open to you now. You had best go there and make yourself at home.&quot;</string>
<string name="87083">&quot;To my knowledge, none but myself and Mephistopheles who spoke it to me. One cannot tell and the other you cannot ask... I am sorry, Sojourner, but you must spend the rest of your days trapped here in Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="87084">&quot;Mephistopheles used you, as is a devil&apos;s nature. He formed a bond with both you and the Valsharess and drove you against each other. In the moment that you killed her, he took your place and you, his.&quot;</string>
<string name="87085">&quot;He traded your freedom for his chains. Once he was bound here as you are now but, through his trickery and deceit, he has escaped through the bond he formed with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87086">&quot;This bond. The bond of death, the bond of life, the bond of power, the bond that has brought you here to me so many times. It was a devil&apos;s bargain and one you never knew you made.&quot;</string>
<string name="87087">&quot;You are barred from the Prime Material by decree of the devil, Mephistopheles. This is Cania, the Eighth Hell of Baator and in this place he is Lord of all.&quot;</string>
<string name="87088">&quot;Of course, Sojourner. If it is one thing we have here, it is time.&quot;</string>
<string name="87089">&quot;Much though it pains me, I am my master&apos;s servant. What Mephistopheles commands, I must do.&quot;</string>
<string name="87090">&quot;No, I cannot, though not through fear of retribution: I am a child of this hell and know its torments well. Instead, he has commanded me with my True Name. Commands thus given none can disobey.&quot;</string>
<string name="87091">&quot;These are the names given us by the gods themselves. They have great power in the Planes and, as you can imagine, they are guarded jealously by those who know them.&quot;</string>
<string name="87092">&quot;Alas, that is another wish with which I cannot comply for Mephistopheles has bid me to never share it. But yes, if you commanded me with my True Name to send you home, I would have no choice but to comply.&quot;</string>
<string name="87093">&quot;There is one Gate here that was always sealed to you before. It leads to the surface of Cania and the City of Lost Souls that gather there. It is open to you now. You had best go there and make yourself at home.&quot;</string>
<string name="87094">&quot;To my knowledge, none but myself and Mephistopheles who spoke it to me. One cannot tell and the other you cannot ask... I am sorry, Sojourner, but you must spend the rest of your days trapped here in Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="87095">&quot;Yes, the Eighth Hell, the Frozen Wastes of Cania, the Dreaded Depths of Baator. Whatever name one gives it, it remains the same and, for you, it is a prison.&quot;</string>
<string name="87096">&quot;Mephistopheles used you, as is a devil&apos;s nature. He formed a bond with both you and the Valsharess and drove you against each other. After her death, he took your place and you, his.&quot;</string>
<string name="87097">&quot;He traded your freedom for his chains. Once he was bound here as you are now but, through his trickery and deceit, he has escaped through the bond he formed with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87098">&quot;This bond. The bond of death, the bond of life, the bond of power, the bond that has brought you here to me so many times. It was a devil&apos;s bargain and one you never knew you made.&quot;</string>
<string name="87099">&quot;To the contrary. There is no such thing as home for one such as you. You must forget what you knew of the Prime Material for you are never going back.&quot;</string>
<string name="87100">&quot;You are barred from there and I cannot send you... I am sorry, Sojourner. That in me which still has life now mourns for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87101">&quot;The Spirits of the Dead can end up in all sorts of places. The outer planes are infinite in their variety and who can say where a soul will go.&quot;</string>
<string name="87102">&quot;That said, I can use the gates to summon them here if you so desire. But they will come or not, each according to their desire. I cannot compel them to come here in the same way I have you. Who shall I summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="87103">&quot;Of course, Sojourner. If it is one thing we have here, it is time.&quot;</string>
<string name="87104">&quot;The spirit refuses... I sense anger and hatred directed at you, Sojourner. He feels wronged by you and will not answer my summons. Is there anyone else you wish me to summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="87105">&quot;Consent is given. His spirit travels the gates now, hurtling towards us, and flesh is now forming... your companion returns to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87106">Valen suddenly appears, as whole as the last time you saw him. He looks around, mildly bewildered. &quot;So I am summoned from beyond the veil once again. To stand at your side, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="87107">&quot;I am glad to be here with you, then.&quot; He turns and regards the Gatekeeper. &quot;And you, strange one... it was you I felt calling me, yes? You&apos;re the one who brought me to this... place?&quot;</string>
<string name="87108">&quot;Yes, fiendish one. &lt;FullName&gt; has requested your presence here in the hells... Now, Sojourner, is there anyone else you wish me to summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="87109">&quot;The spirit refuses... I sense anger and hatred directed at you, Sojourner. She feels wronged by you and will not answer my summons. Is there anyone else you wish me to summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="87110">&quot;Consent is given. Her spirit travels the gates now, hurtling towards us, and flesh is now forming... your companion returns to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87111">Nathyrra suddenly appears, looking startled. She draws one of her daggers almost without thinking. &quot;What... where am I?&quot; Her eyes focus on you. &quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;? So I am... alive once more.&quot;</string>
<string name="87112">Slowly she nods, comprehension coming to her. &quot;Thank you for bringing me back, then, my friend. To have died in battle was unsettling, to say the least.&quot; She looks around. &quot;And what is this place? Are we in the planes?&quot;</string>
<string name="87113">&quot;Yes, dark one. &lt;FullName&gt; has requested your presence here in the hells... Now, Sojourner, is there anyone else you wish me to summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="87114">&quot;Consent is given. His spirit travels the gates now, hurtling towards us, and flesh is now forming... your companion returns to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87115">Deekin suddenly appears. Strangely, he does not seem surprised nor disturbed by his situation. &quot;There you is, boss! Deekin keeps telling angels that he gots lots to do, that he not stayings up there, but they not believes him!&quot;</string>
<string name="87116">&lt;StartAction&gt;(sigh)&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Deekin be right all along, just like Deekin says. Stupid angels.&quot; He looks around a bit, taking in the chamber. &quot;Ummm... is we in hell, boss? Place needs good cleaning, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="87117">&quot;Yes, little one. &lt;FullName&gt; has requested your presence here in the hells... Now, Sojourner, is there anyone else you wish me to summon?&quot;</string>
<string name="87118">&quot;The Sleeping Man is wise and old. He passed through the Gates of Cania when they were first formed, long before the time of we Gatekeepers. Yet here he remains, asleep and waiting even now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87119">&quot;I watched him sleep when I was young and there, carved about the dais where he sleeps, were the words &apos;She will find you by the Gates of Cania.&apos; And thus he waits.&quot;</string>
<string name="87120">&quot;Death or a maiden fair, who can say. The words are there, in answer to a question he must have asked. That is all I know.&quot;</string>
<string name="87121">&quot;You have learned my True Name, I see... Very well, I have summoned a door that will return you to the one you know as Durnan, in Waterdeep. But, before you go, is there anything else you would have me do?&quot;</string>
<string name="87122">&quot;A word of warning before you go, Sojourner... By breaking Mephistopheles&apos; command and stepping through that door, you forfeit the gift he has given you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87123">&quot;You will not see me again nor lay your eyes upon the ice of Cania. When next you die, there will only be the blackness of the void. But have no fear, for the same will be true of Mephistopheles... Now go.&quot;</string>
<string name="87124">&quot;Consider the Devils of Cania unleashed, m&apos;&lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, but once set loose upon the mortal realm, they will not be easy to rein back in. Even so, I shall comply. Anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="87125">&quot;If that is your wish, I shall make it so. Even death itself will no longer hold the spirits here. Is there anything else you would ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="87126">&quot;As you command, Sojourner. I will return them safely to their home in Limbo. Is there anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="87127">A hooded figure stands before you, cold as ice. Distant flames flicker in the mirror of his face. You shiver in spite of yourself.</string>
<string name="87128">&quot;The Gates lead many places, each can be bound to a location you specify by using your relic. You may use all of them but the one that is wreathed in mists. That one is not yours to use.&quot;</string>
<string name="87129">&quot;I am not allowed to say.&quot;</string>
<string name="87130">&quot;Because it is the wish of your benefactor... I have given my word and it is sacrosanct.&quot;</string>
<string name="87131">&quot;This is the Gatehouse, an entry point into the Land of the Dead. You are welcome here but I do not recommend you linger. Your heart still beats and life still beckons to you from through the veil...&quot;</string>
<string name="87132">&quot;You need but ask, Sojourner, as I have been commanded to obey.&quot;</string>
<string name="87133">&quot;I am known as the Reaper, the Collector of Souls, the Gatherer of Dust, the Gatekeeper. You have left the Land of the Living.&quot;</string>
<string name="87134">&quot;You have a powerful friend who has requested that I return you to the Land of the Living before death can take its hold.&quot;</string>
<string name="87135">&quot;Your powerful friend has requested that I not name them and thus I obey. For the time being, at least, they wish to remain your anonymous benefactor.&quot;</string>
<string name="87136">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="87137">&quot;I need to ask you something.&quot;</string>
<string name="87138">&quot;I must go to the leader of my adventuring party.&quot;</string>
<string name="87139">&quot;I have died and wish to return to where I fell.&quot;</string>
<string name="87140">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="87141">&quot;Why can&apos;t you comply?&quot;</string>
<string name="87142">&quot;What&apos;s a True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="87143">&quot;What is your True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="87144">&quot;What do I do now, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="87145">&quot;Who knows your True Name, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="87146">&quot;Mephistopheles? But I was fighting the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="87147">&quot;What do you mean he took my place?&quot;</string>
<string name="87148">&quot;What bond?&quot;</string>
<string name="87149">&quot;Who says I&apos;m barred from there?&quot;</string>
<string name="87150">&quot;Back to my previous questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="87151">&quot;Why didn&apos;t you tell me any of this before?&quot;</string>
<string name="87152">&quot;Can&apos;t you disobey him?&quot;</string>
<string name="87153">&quot;What&apos;s a True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="87154">&quot;What is your True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="87155">&quot;What do I do now, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="87156">&quot;Who knows your True Name, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="87157">&quot;The Eighth Hell?&quot;</string>
<string name="87158">&quot;Mephistopheles? But I was fighting the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="87159">&quot;What do you mean he took my place?&quot;</string>
<string name="87160">&quot;What bond?&quot;</string>
<string name="87161">&quot;But the Prime Material is my home!&quot;</string>
<string name="87162">&quot;Why am I never going back?&quot;</string>
<string name="87163">&quot;What of my companions who died? Where are they?&quot;</string>
<string name="87164">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="87165">&quot;Summon forth Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="87166">&quot;Summon forth Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="87167">&quot;Summon forth Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="87168">&quot;I seek the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="87169">&quot;What is he waiting for?&quot;</string>
<string name="87170">&quot;Who is &apos;She&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="87171">&quot;Hecugoth the Abandoned, I command you to grant me passage home!&quot;</string>
<string name="87172">&quot;Thank you, Reaper. That will be all.&quot;</string>
<string name="87173">&quot;Allow the Devils to wreak their havoc on the planes.&quot;</string>
<string name="87174">&quot;Allow the Spirits of the Dead to haunt the Living.&quot;</string>
<string name="87175">&quot;Allow the Githzerai Pilgrims to return home.&quot;</string>
<string name="87176">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="87177">&quot;Look at all these doors! Where do they lead?&quot;</string>
<string name="87178">&quot;What lays beyond the door wreathed in mists?&quot;</string>
<string name="87179">&quot;Why can&apos;t you say?&quot;</string>
<string name="87180">&quot;Why can&apos;t I use the door wreathed in mists?&quot;</string>
<string name="87181">&quot;Who is this benefactor?&quot;</string>
<string name="87182">&quot;Where am I?&quot;</string>
<string name="87183">&quot;How do I return?&quot;</string>
<string name="87184">&quot;Who commanded you?&quot;</string>
<string name="87185">&quot;Who are you? How did I get here?&quot;</string>
<string name="87186">&quot;So... I died?&quot;</string>
<string name="87187">&quot;Who is this &apos;powerful friend&apos; of mine?&quot;</string>
<string name="87188">&quot;I must go to the leader of my adventuring party.&quot;</string>
<string name="87189">&quot;I have died and wish to return to where I fell.&quot;</string>
<string name="87190">&quot;As you wish. Now go find something to hit, I&apos;m thirsty.&quot;</string>
<string name="87191">&quot;You&apos;re asking a sword for advice? Here&apos;s some advice: don&apos;t do that.&quot;</string>
<string name="87192">&quot;How about going to a city, somewhere? I haven&apos;t seen a beautiful, scantily-clad woman in... hmmmmm... a long time...&quot;</string>
<string name="87193">&quot;Swing harder. And keep me sharp.&quot;</string>
<string name="87194">&quot;Don&apos;t get stabbed to death by soul-sucking weapons. And if you do, don&apos;t try dumb plans to get out of said weapons. So sayeth the sword.&quot;</string>
<string name="87195">&quot;Don&apos;t die. Simple advice, I know, but effective. I should have followed it myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="87196">&quot;Quit adventuring, have some children. I don&apos;t know... what do you want from me? I don&apos;t dispense advice, I kill things.&quot;</string>
<string name="87197">&quot;You could work on your grip, I think. I seem to constantly feel about two seconds away from being flung off to the right during combat.&quot;</string>
<string name="87198">&quot;I&apos;ve seen better days.&quot;</string>
<string name="87199">Enserric sighs heavily. &quot;If you must know, I&apos;ve spent the better part of the last day trying to remember the name of my daughter.&quot;</string>
<string name="87200">&quot;In life, I was a wizard, possessed of an intelligence that outshone anyone else I had ever met. I was a proud man, and it is... troubling... to lose even such a thing as a name.&quot;</string>
<string name="87201">&quot;I suggested to you before the thought of how I might simply be an echo within this weapon, did I not? Do you remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="87202">&quot;You have your own memory problems, I see. Or a short attention span. Regardless, it occurred to me that what you are speaking to is simply an &apos;imprint&apos; upon this weapon... and a fading one.&quot;</string>
<string name="87203">&quot;Well, part of me wonders if my old comrades didn&apos;t get out and have me properly raised. The real Enserric the Gray might still be out there, unaware I exist.&quot;</string>
<string name="87204">&quot;That is a... disconcerting feeling, the idea that I have no real existence.&quot;</string>
<string name="87205">&quot;I am a weapon now, I suppose, and shall remain one until my consciousness dissipates.&quot; He ponders that for a moment. &quot;In a way, that is a bit liberating: I am a sword and nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="87206">&quot;So go and use me, then, if you will... kill as many creatures as you can and with each death I&apos;ll have a little of my revenge. I am an implement of violence... and so violence I shall deal! Ha ha ha ha-ha!&quot;</string>
<string name="87207">&quot;You mean try to see if there really is another Enserric the Gray? Or if there was? No... no, I&apos;m not certain that is something I would like to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="87208">&quot;Hmph. Let&apos;s stuff you inside the next club we encounter and leave you alone for a half-century or so and see if your disposition improves. No? I didn&apos;t think so.&quot;</string>
<string name="87209">&quot;I never was much of one for weapons when I was alive. Indeed, I used my crossbow occasionally, but it was always a bother.&quot;</string>
<string name="87210">&quot;Have you not been listening to a thing I&apos;ve told you? My memory is fading, bit by bit in here, and there is nothing I can do about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87211">&quot;No. Not truly. She would not thank me for such a meeting, as I was neither a kind father nor even truly about. And she would be old, now, even were she alive.&quot;</string>
<string name="87212">&quot;Hmmm,&quot; he considers for a long moment, &quot;the real trouble would be the lack of my body. I suppose I could always be transferred into another body, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="87213">&quot;Ha ha ha-ha! And what shall I do, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;? Wrestle you for it? No, you&apos;re quite safe on that account, never fear.&quot;</string>
<string name="87214">&quot;The only thing I could think might be possible would be for my spirit to enter a construct of some kind... perhaps a golem or some such, preferably well-made.&quot;</string>
<string name="87215">&quot;How such a process could even be performed, however, is beyond my knowledge now. I&apos;ve forgotten much... which does bring up the possibility that I am not whole enough to leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="87216">&quot;Indeed. I have lost so many details of my memory over the long years I am almost certain that I am... dissipating from within this blade. One day I shall be gone entirely, or merely a wisp able to communicate only via empathy.&quot;</string>
<string name="87217">&quot;But it needn&apos;t concern you, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. I somewhat look forward to such a day. Either I will be finally and truly dead or... or senseless enough I will no longer care.&quot;</string>
<string name="87218">&quot;You&apos;re kind to say so, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;, but it&apos;s not so bad now that I&apos;m away from that skeleton. At least I&apos;m no longer bored. Go kill something exciting and I&apos;ll feel much better, I assure you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87219">&quot;Indeed. On the bright side, there are worse things than being a sword. I could be a... a cookpot! Or a pair of smelly boots. Bleh.&quot;</string>
<string name="87220">&quot;Do not trouble yourself, truly. If fortune smiles upon me and something drops in your lap... well, that would be fine, but otherwise I am not waiting for the gods to intervene.&quot;</string>
<string name="87221">&quot;That&apos;s very possible. And that means it&apos;s unlikely I could ever escape this sword, really... how many soulless bodies do you encounter, hmm? Not many.&quot;</string>
<string name="87222">&quot;Now, now, it may not be as bad as all that. Keep in mind that the effects are only temporary, yes?</string>
<string name="87223">&quot;How unhealthy are you?&quot; The sword snaps. &quot;Maybe you could... but I doubt the sword would ever make you *that* unhealthy. Mind you, I&apos;ve no way of being sure of that...&quot;</string>
<string name="87224">&quot;Hmmm,&quot; the blade considers, &quot;I&apos;m still drawing power from you overall, so yes... I&apos;d say that&apos;s likely. But at the same time I will also become a more powerful weapon. It&apos;s a trade-off, of sorts, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="87225">&quot;Now... let&apos;s not be so hasty! I could always try to reverse the process and give you back your life-force... but that means losing the stronger enchantment on my blade. Keep in mind as well that these effects are likely only temporary.&quot;</string>
<string name="87226">&quot;I... might be able to, yes. But that would mean losing the stronger enchantment on the blade, as well. Keep in mind that these effects are likely only temporary.&quot;</string>
<string name="87227">Enserric offers up no comment, but mumbles something about ungratitude in general.</string>
<string name="87228">&quot;As you wish,&quot; the sword sighs unhappily. &quot;Let me know if you want this to happen again. I&apos;ll try to restrain the sword&apos;s... enthusiasm... and other times.&quot;</string>
<string name="87229">&quot;Never mind?&quot; The sword whistles in appreciation. &quot;Well, this may be easier than I thought! Let&apos;s move on then, my new comrade-in-arms!&quot;</string>
<string name="87230">&quot;Oh?&quot; The sword sounds suspicious. &quot;What did you want to know, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="87231">&quot;It&apos;s dangerous.&quot;</string>
<string name="87232">&quot;The last time I explored any of it was fifty years ago. What do you expect? That I could still draw a map for you? I wish I could help.&quot;</string>
<string name="87233">&quot;No, not really. The blade I exist within is quite well-enchanted... and it draws the life force from creatures it attacks within to heal the wielder.&quot;</string>
<string name="87234">&quot;Beyond that, no surprises I&apos;d expect. Mind you... I&apos;ve never been wielded by anything except that skeleton so far. This is a new experience for us both.&quot;</string>
<string name="87235">&quot;Not really, no. You can see how far I made it into the dungeon, no? Whatever treasure we had was dragged off by my so-called comrades after I died.&quot;</string>
<string name="87236">&quot;Hmph. I swear, if I encounter any of those fools, I&apos;d be quite pleased if you used me to hack them up instantly, no matter how old and feeble they&apos;ve gotten!&quot;</string>
<string name="87237">&quot;Well,&quot; the sword hesitates for a moment, &quot;I am a bit... embarrassed... to admit it, but I seem to have forgotten most of the details.&quot;</string>
<string name="87238">&quot;I&apos;ve been in this sword for nigh on fifty years, at least! The details of my life have become... fuzzy at best. Oh, I know who I was, more or less, and that I was a wizard. No more.&quot;</string>
<string name="87239">&quot;I remember I *had* spells. And I know what they were called. But, like I said, the details are gone.&quot; He sighs heavily. &quot;Truly it&apos;s distressing.&quot;</string>
<string name="87240">&quot;Mmmm... would they be still alive, I wonder? Most of my comrades would be fifty years older. That&apos;s if they did not perish in this very dungeon after abandoning my body.&quot;</string>
<string name="87241">&quot;I have a daughter, but she... she would be as old as I was. No, older. No doubt she would not even remember Enserric the Gray, sadly. I... was not around much.&quot;</string>
<string name="87242">&quot;No, I&apos;m sorry to say my old life is done. I should be dead... in fact, I most likely am and I am but an echo of what once was. Fascinating thought, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="87243">&quot;No, I&apos;m sorry to say my old life is done. I should be dead... in fact, I most likely am and I am but an echo of what once was. Fascinating thought, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="87244">&quot;Naturally. That&apos;s what I&apos;m here for, now that I&apos;m a sword. Lovely existence really... living life on the edge! Ha ha. The puns are endless, let me tell you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87245">&quot;Well, there is *that*. I admit I&apos;m a bit sad that you&apos;re so eager to be rid of me, but at least it&apos;s better than measuring the layer of dust on my blade.&quot;</string>
<string name="87246">&quot;As you wish! Lead on, my good &lt;man/woman&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="87247">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="87248">&quot;Any advice you can offer?&quot;</string>
<string name="87249">&quot;You all right in there?&quot;</string>
<string name="87250">&quot;You don&apos;t sound very happy.&quot;</string>
<string name="87251">&quot;This must be difficult for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87252">&quot;Not really.&quot;</string>
<string name="87253">&quot;Yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="87254">&quot;I agree. I wish there was something I could do.&quot;</string>
<string name="87255">&quot;Maybe I could try to see if you&apos;re right.&quot;</string>
<string name="87256">&quot;That&apos;s all I need. A bellyaching weapon.&quot;</string>
<string name="87257">&quot;But you do exist. As a weapon.&quot;</string>
<string name="87258">&quot;Why is it difficult to remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="87259">&quot;Do you want to see her again?&quot;</string>
<string name="87260">&quot;Is there any way to get you out of this sword?&quot;</string>
<string name="87261">&quot;You&apos;re not getting mine!&quot;</string>
<string name="87262">&quot;Is that even possible?&quot;</string>
<string name="87263">&quot;Not whole enough?&quot;</string>
<string name="87264">&quot;That&apos;s horrible! I&apos;m so sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="87265">&quot;Fair enough. No need for me to bother thinking about it, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="87266">&quot;I&apos;ll try to free you if I can.&quot;</string>
<string name="87267">&quot;Such a body would need to be soulless, perhaps?&quot;</string>
<string name="87268">&quot;Tell me more about your mortal life.&quot;</string>
<string name="87269">&quot;I want you to boost the enchantment on the sword.&quot;</string>
<string name="87270">&quot;You appear to be affecting my health. Why is that, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="87271">&quot;What do you mean you&apos;re not sure?&quot;</string>
<string name="87272">&quot;I&apos;ll learn to live with it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87273">&quot;Could I die from this?&quot;</string>
<string name="87274">&quot;Will it get any worse?&quot;</string>
<string name="87275">&quot;I suppose I&apos;ll just have to sell you, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="87276">&quot;Can you do something about it?&quot;</string>
<string name="87277">&quot;Forget it. Maybe you&apos;re worth more this way.&quot;</string>
<string name="87278">&quot;Never mind, then. I&apos;ll keep the enchantment for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87279">&quot;Alright. Remove the effects for now, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="87280">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="87281">&quot;How about answering some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="87282">&quot;I don&apos;t need to know anything else.&quot;</string>
<string name="87283">&quot;What can you tell me about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="87284">&quot;No, really.&quot;</string>
<string name="87285">&quot;Do you have any secret powers I should know about?&quot;</string>
<string name="87286">&quot;Do you know where there&apos;s treasure around here?&quot;</string>
<string name="87287">&quot;Tell me more about your mortal life.&quot;</string>
<string name="87288">&quot;Forgotten?&quot;</string>
<string name="87289">&quot;Do you remember any spells?&quot;</string>
<string name="87290">&quot;Is there anyone who would miss you?&quot;</string>
<string name="87291">&quot;You can service me as a weapon, that&apos;s how.&quot;</string>
<string name="87292">&quot;You can bring a good price at the market.&quot;</string>
<string name="87293">&quot;Good. Let&apos;s go, then.&quot;</string>

<string name="87303">The raw materials are bolts of cloth, leather hides, elm planks, oak planks, large bones, iron, steel, and feathers. These components are generally obtained by slaying creatures or destroying objects.</string>

<string name="87323">You may not delete bind points at the moment because you have not placed any.</string>

<string name="87350">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Read description]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="87351">You recognize this drow as Rizolvir, the drow smith from the Seer&apos;s rebel camp. He gives you a grin and says, &quot;I didn&apos;t expect to see you down here, &lt;FullName&gt;. Welcome to the Hells.&quot;</string>
<string name="87352">&quot;I was killed during the siege of Lith My&apos;athar. Not sure why I ended up here, exactly... maybe the Eighth Hell just needed a good weapon smith.&quot;</string>
<string name="87353">&quot;It&apos;s not so bad. I&apos;ve been able to rebuild my forge, drawing heat from down here below the ice. I&apos;ve already crafted enough items to restock my inventory and, while business is slow, it&apos;s better than nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="87354">&quot;The clientele are a bit different: devils and githzerai instead of drow. But other than that, the more things change, the more they stay the same. At the heart of it, I&apos;m still selling and upgrading weapons.&quot;</string>
<string name="87355">&quot;Back again, &lt;FullName&gt;? You here to check out my inventory? Or do you want me to upgrade your weapon? Or is there something else?&quot;</string>
<string name="87356">This drow smith looks up from his forge, his face streaked with sweat and soot. &quot;You&apos;re that surfacer the Seer&apos;s been waiting for, aren&apos;t you? I wondered how long until you wandered over my way.&quot;</string>
<string name="87357">&quot;My name&apos;s Rizolvir, master craftsman and weapon smith extraordinare. And you&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, right? Pleased to meet you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87358">&quot;If there&apos;s anything you need, I&apos;m here to help. Feel free to look over my inventory. Or, if you want, I can upgrade your weapon for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87359">&quot;Goodbye, &lt;FullName&gt;. If you ever want to buy or upgrade any weapons, you know where to find me.&quot;</string>
<string name="87360">&quot;Goodbye and good luck, &lt;FullName&gt;. We&apos;re counting on you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87361">&quot;Armor and weapons, mostly... though weapons are my specialty. Plus, I can upgrade existing weapons. My prices are quite reasonable considering the circumstances.&quot;</string>
<string name="87362">&quot;I&apos;m not doing this out of greed. I need the gold to fuel my magical furnace. Gold makes the enchanted fires burn clean and hot. Without the gold I can&apos;t forge or upgrade weapons.&quot;</string>
<string name="87363">&quot;I haven&apos;t really been here long enough to learn anything. I&apos;ve been concentrating on restocking my inventory and upgrading weapons for those who need them.&quot;</string>
<string name="87364">&quot;Questions aren&apos;t really my strength, but I&apos;ll do my best to help you out.&quot;</string>
<string name="87365">&quot;Nothing more than what you&apos;ve already heard, I&apos;m sure. I hear she used to be one of the Matron Mothers from Menzoberranzan, but that might just be a rumor.&quot;</string>
<string name="87366">&quot;All I know is that her army will crush us all if we don&apos;t find a way to stay united against her. I just hope House Maeviir is smart enough to realize this.&quot;</string>
<string name="87367">&quot;Well, it used to be the ancestral home of House Maeviir. But since we moved in - I mean the Seer and her followers - it&apos;s more like a refugee camp.&quot;</string>
<string name="87368">&quot;As you can imagine, there&apos;s a lot of tension here. Most drow don&apos;t like the followers of Eilistraee, and House Maeviir is no exception. They don&apos;t have much choice, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="87369">&quot;If we don&apos;t band together, the Valsharess will sweep us all away. If we can stay united, then at least we&apos;ll have a chance. Or so the Seer says.&quot;</string>
<string name="87370">&quot;I came here with the Seer, but I&apos;m not a follower of Eilistraee. Not everyone who follows the Seer shares her religious convictions.&quot;</string>
<string name="87371">&quot;Some of us are just drow fleeing the Valsharess. Several of the powerful drow Houses have been all but wiped out by her army, leaving the handful of survivors to get by however they can.&quot;</string>
<string name="87372">&quot;My story&apos;s nothing special. I started learning my craft at a young age, and my skills quickly brought me to the attention of Matron Usala of House Zarosta in Ched Nasad.&quot;</string>
<string name="87373">&quot;But when the Valsharess first came to power, House Zarosta refused to join her... a big mistake. The Valsharess wiped out the entire house. For all I know, I&apos;m the only survivor.&quot;</string>
<string name="87374">&quot;During my flight from Ched Nasad, I encountered some followers of Eilistraee. They took pity on me and brought me to the Seer, and I&apos;ve been part of her entourage ever since.&quot;</string>
<string name="87375">&quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you I&apos;m a master craftsman? I can take any weapon and make it better, if you give me enough gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="87376">&quot;My work is somewhat different from the smiths who pound weapons with giant hammers. I&apos;m a craftsman, an artist. I use my skill and powerful magic instead of brute force.&quot;</string>
<string name="87377">&quot;Just bring me a weapon, and I can use the magic of my forge to improve it. I can add enchantments. I can imbue it with the powers of fire, ice or lightning. Whatever you need, I can do.&quot;</string>
<string name="87378">&quot;I see you don&apos;t have a weapon ready in your hand right now. If you want your weapon upgraded, you&apos;ll have to get it out.&quot;</string>
<string name="87379">&quot;I see you&apos;ve got a weapon right there in your hand. Would you like me to upgrade it?&quot;</string>
<string name="87380">&quot;Not a problem. What would like me to do to your &lt;CUSTOM9809&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="87381">&quot;Your &lt;CUSTOM9809&gt; already has that property. I&apos;d just be wasting your gold.&quot;</string>

<string name="87395">&quot;Sorry, but it looks like you don&apos;t have enough gold. I need the gold to fuel the fires of my magic furnace. Only gold burns hot and clean enough for me to work my magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="87396">&quot;Behold a master at work.&quot;</string>
<string name="87397">&quot;Your &lt;CUSTOM9809&gt; already has a damage upgrade. I&apos;d just be wasting your gold.&quot;</string>

<string name="87402">&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</string>
<string name="87403">&quot;I want to upgrade a weapon.&quot;</string>
<string name="87404">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="87405">&quot;What kind of things do you sell here?&quot;</string>
<string name="87406">&quot;Let me see your inventory.&quot;</string>
<string name="87407">&quot;I&apos;m trying to save you all! Can&apos;t you give me a deal?&quot;</string>
<string name="87408">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="87409">&quot;How do I get a weapon upgraded?&quot;</string>
<string name="87410">&quot;Do you know anything about the Valsharess?&quot;</string>
<string name="87411">&quot;What can you tell me about this camp?&quot;</string>
<string name="87412">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="87413">&quot;So you&apos;re a follower of Eilistraee?&quot;</string>
<string name="87414">&quot;Tell me more about yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="87415">&quot;You can upgrade weapons?&quot;</string>
<string name="87416">&quot;How does this work?&quot;</string>
<string name="87417">&quot;I want to upgrade my &lt;CUSTOM9809&gt;.&quot;</string>

<string name="87438">---------- Random Pop-Ups Start Here ------------</string>
<string name="87439">The barbarian reacts with surprise. &quot;I see. Are you certain this is wise? You may have need of my strength and skill in battle as you progress through Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="87440">&quot;You won&apos;t regret this decision, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I swear it on the Red Tiger blood in my veins.&quot;</string>
<string name="87441">Daelen frowns. &quot;I do not like this, but I will respect your decision, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will wait here for you to return.&quot;</string>
<string name="87442">&quot;As you wish, though I think you are making a mistake. Goodbye, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="87443">&quot;What tactics would you like to change?&quot;</string>
<string name="87444">&quot;I will leave the traps for those more suited to handling them.&quot;</string>
<string name="87445">&quot;My skills in disarming traps are somewhat lacking, but I will try my best.&quot;</string>
<string name="87446">&quot;An Uthgardt warrior was not meant to hide in the shadows, anyway. Such tactics are more suited to rogues and assassins.&quot;</string>
<string name="87447">&quot;I shall remain hidden until the battle begins, then I will burst forth to slaughter our foes.&quot;</string>
<string name="87448">&quot;It is not the way of my people, but I will strike from the shadows whenever I am able.&quot;</string>
<string name="87449">&quot;That is probably a good idea. I will leave the locks to those with more skill than I.&quot;</string>
<string name="87450">&quot;I will smash open any obstacle that stands in your way!&quot;</string>
<string name="87451">&quot;Very well. How far away would you like me to stay?&quot;</string>
<string name="87452">&quot;As you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="87453">&quot;This is the way of the Uthgardt people and the Red Tiger tribe. I will gladly charge your enemies on sight.&quot;</string>
<string name="87454">&quot;I will protect your life with my own, and I will take my lead in battle from you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87455">&quot;As you wish. Take a look at my pack and make whatever changes you feel are best.&quot;</string>
<string name="87456">The half-orc gives you a strange look. &quot;My rage is best used in battle. Are you certain you want me to unleash my fury now?&quot;</string>
<string name="87457">The half-orc shrugs. &quot;I am not one for words, but if you wish to talk we can talk.&quot;</string>
<string name="87458">&quot;As you wish. Is there anything else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="87459">&quot;As well as can be expected, given our current situation. I am healthy and whole, and ready for whatever Undermountain has in store for us.&quot;</string>
<string name="87460">&quot;Is there something else you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="87461">&quot;I&apos;m still suffering from a few minor injuries, but it&apos;s nothing serious. I can wait for healing if others are worse off than I.&quot;</string>
<string name="87462">&quot;My wounds are serious, but not life threatening. I&apos;d like to get them tended to before the next battle, if possible.&quot;</string>
<string name="87463">&quot;My wounds are bad. If I don&apos;t get some healing soon, I won&apos;t be of much use in the next battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="87464">&quot;My vision is still dark, the world is all shadows and night. I won&apos;t be of much use if we don&apos;t find a way to restore my sight.&quot;</string>
<string name="87465">&quot;This poison has left me weak. We need to find a way to neutralize it as soon as possible.&quot;</string>
<string name="87466">&quot;This illness that&apos;s afflicted me is growing worse. The sooner we find a way to cure the disease, the better.&quot;</string>
<string name="87467">&quot;I haven&apos;t given it a lot of thought, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But spending time in the darkness of Undermountain has given me a new appreciation for the open plains of my homeland.&quot;</string>
<string name="87468">&quot;I think... I think after this I will return to the Red Tiger tribe. Should the Elders still want me, I will accept their invitation to join the tribal council.&quot;</string>
<string name="87469">&quot;No, I don&apos;t think so. Not this time. Of course, all these plans assume we will survive what lies ahead - something we won&apos;t do if we spend all our time talking. Let&apos;s get back to our mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="87470">&quot;Yes, I believe I am. Of course, all these plans assume we will survive what lies ahead - something we won&apos;t do if we spend all our time talking. Let&apos;s get back to our mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="87471">The barbarian frowns. &quot;I suppose you have earned the right to hear this tale. After all, you did raise me from the dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="87472">&quot;I went back to my people: the Red Tiger tribe of the Uthgardt. When I left, I had been an outcast, a pariah among them because of my orcish blood. But I returned to a hero&apos;s welcome.&quot;</string>
<string name="87473">&quot;The Elders knew my part in Neverwinter&apos;s salvation. What&apos;s more, during my adventures I had found Uthgardt&apos;s Spear, a sacred artifact of my people that had been lost for centuries.&quot;</string>
<string name="87474">Daelen frowns. &quot;If you only intended to mock me, why did you ask about this in the first place?&quot; He shakes his head and stomps away.</string>
<string name="87475">&quot;For a brief time, I was happy among the sons and daughters of the Red Tiger. But then the tribal Elders came and asked me to join the tribal council. They wanted me to help lead the tribe.&quot;</string>
<string name="87476">&quot;I refused the honor. I was not ready for such responsibility, I knew some other purpose still lay ahead of me - though I didn&apos;t know what it was.&quot;</string>
<string name="87477">&quot;I could have continued to dwell with my tribe, I was still a respected hero. But something was missing in my life, I had no sense of purpose. And so I left the Uthgardt tribe once again.&quot;</string>
<string name="87478">&quot;I wander the north for a time, hiring out my skills as a mercenary or bodyguard. Eventually, I met up with Linu and Sharwyn, whom I had met in Neverwinter. I took it as a sign.&quot;</string>
<string name="87479">&quot;I convinced them our destinies were intertwined. Soon after, we ran across that rogue, Tomi. He was on the run - as usual - and he happily joined us, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="87480">&quot;Perhaps, though I see it differently. Soon after we were all together, we heard about the attacks on Waterdeep, and our new destination was clear.&quot;</string>
<string name="87481">&quot;I thought so as well. Soon after we were all together, we heard about the attacks on Waterdeep, and our new destination was clear.&quot; </string>
<string name="87482">&quot;We had all played a part in saving Neverwinter, now we have come together to save another city. Forces beyond our control have brought us here - and to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="87483">&quot;But Waterdeep will not be saved if we spend all our time talking. We can continue this discussion later, but for now we should get back to the task at hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="87484">He shrugs. &quot;Maybe I was. It would only be further proof that I was not ready to be a tribal Elder. But I don&apos;t see it as running away. I see it as a search for something I didn&apos;t have.&quot;</string>
<string name="87485">&quot;I am not originally from Neverwinter. But you are correct: I was there during the time of the Wailing Death, a deadly plague that swept the city.&quot;</string>
<string name="87486">&quot;I journeyed with the great Hero of Neverwinter, and I played a small part in ridding the city of the evil that plagued it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87487">&quot;I&apos;m not surprised. My own role in saving the city was a minor one. Hardly anyone in the city even knew who I was.&quot;</string>
<string name="87488">&quot;Really? That&apos;s surprising. The truth is, my own role in saving the city was a minor one. Hardly anyone in the city even knew who I was.&quot;</string>
<string name="87489">&quot;Actually, few in the city even knew who I was. My part in that tale was a minor one, at best.&quot;</string>
<string name="87490">&quot;However, I was given a substantial reward by Lord Nasher, the city&apos;s ruler, for my efforts. But even with my wealth, I could not find happiness in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="87491">&quot;No? That&apos;s strange, as it was you who started this conversation. Very well, let&apos;s return to our mission, and I won&apos;t speak of my time in Neverwinter again.&quot;</string>
<string name="87492">&quot;Maybe it was my heritage. Many of the Uthgardt tribes had joined in the attacks on Neverwinter. People looked on me with suspicion and hate. Being a half-orc only made it worse.&quot;</string>
<string name="87493">&quot;But I think it was something else, as well. There is something wrong with Neverwinter; it is a city that destroyed its own spirit, a city betrayed, a city that turned against itself.&quot;  </string>
<string name="87494">&quot;I&apos;m talking about Lady Aribeth, the champion of the city, and her lover Fenthick. Fenthick was executed to appease an angry mob: a cruel and unjust punishment.&quot;</string>
<string name="87495">&quot;Yes - her and her lover Fenthick. He was executed by Lord Nasher because the mob called out for blood, but his only crime was being blinded by his desperate need to help save the city.&quot;</string>
<string name="87496">&quot;Fenthick&apos;s death lead to Aribeth&apos;s betrayal: the city turned its back on one she loved, and she responded in kind.&quot;</string>
<string name="87497">&quot;Aribeth represented everything good about Neverwinter, and when she fell a part of the city&apos;s spirit died. The city still stands, but some wounds are slow to heal. Perhaps that is why I left.&quot;</string>
<string name="87498">&quot;I returned to my home, the lands of the Red Tiger tribe of the Uthgardt people.&quot;</string>
<string name="87499">&quot;Bleak, yes. But accurate. The city will rebuild, in time. But I wanted nothing more to do with it. I returned to my home, the lands of the Red Tiger tribe of the Uthgardt people.&quot;</string>
<string name="87500">The massive barbarian gives a forlorn sigh. &quot;Maybe it would be best if we continued this discussion at a later time. I&apos;d rather keep my mind focused on surviving Undermountain right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87501">&quot;As you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="87502">&quot;I shall serve you with fierce loyalty, as if you were one of the Red Tiger tribe itself.&quot;</string>
<string name="87503">&quot;Very well. Perhaps I can tell you later, if you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="87504">&quot;I was thinking about Undermountain, and about all those who have died here. Throughout Faerun Halaster&apos;s dungeon is well known as an adventurers&apos; graveyard.&quot;</string>
<string name="87505">&quot;Very well. I will keep my thoughts to myself, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="87506">&quot;I just can&apos;t understand why someone would want to come down here. Why risk your life in a dungeon designed specifically to kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87507">The half-orc nods. &quot;I suppose I can respect that. But it still seems there are other places besides Undermountain to test an adventurer&apos;s mettle.&quot;</string>
<string name="87508">&quot;There&apos;s treasure, yes... but not enough to justify the risk. There must be a dozen other places a person could find more riches than in Undermountain; places a lot less dangerous.&quot;</string>
<string name="87509">&quot;Heroes? The adventurers who came in here only came to help themselves - that&apos;s not very heroic. I&apos;m sure they could have found a more useful way to prove their worth.&quot;</string>
<string name="87510">&quot;This place has a strange hold on the minds of adventurers. It&apos;s legend has spread far and wide, and I can&apos;t help but wonder if there&apos;s something unnatural about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87511">&quot;I was thinking the same thing. Halaster spent decades designing this dungeon, he poured all of his time and energy into its creation. He probably wants his creation to be seen.&quot;</string>
<string name="87512">&quot;Wouldn&apos;t it make sense for Halaster to weave a spell into the very fabric of this dungeon? A spell that gives the very name of Undermountain itself the power to draw unsuspecting adventurers in?&quot;</string>
<string name="87513">&quot;Maybe. But maybe there&apos;s something more. Maybe the name of Undermountain is like some type of geas: adventurers who hear the name are compelled to visit it.&quot; </string>
<string name="87514">&quot;No? Halaster is an archmage. Who are we to say what his power is? Maybe the name of Undermountain is like some type of geas: adventurers who hear the name are compelled to visit it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87515">&quot;The compulsion is weak, it can be resisted... but it&apos;s there. The thought sits in the back of your mind, eating away at your thoughts until one day you give in and go to Undermountain itself.&quot;</string>
<string name="87516">The half-orc shrugs. &quot;I don&apos;t know. It just seems like Undermountain is inside my head, and I can&apos;t get it out. Maybe everything will be fine once we find Halaster. At least, I hope so.&quot;</string>
<string name="87517">&quot;Think about it. Halaster spent decades designing this dungeon, he poured all of his time and energy into its creation. He probably wants his creation to be seen.&quot;</string>
<string name="87518">&quot;That&apos;s different. We&apos;re serving a noble purpose, we&apos;re trying to save an entire city. But what about those who came here before the attacks on Waterdeep? What was their purpose?&quot;</string>
<string name="87519">&quot;I have something to confess, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Something that is... difficult. But this is something I feel you have a right to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="87520">&quot;As you wish. Let&apos;s just get back to the task at hand, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="87521">&quot;I don&apos;t like this place. I suppose nobody in their right mind enjoys traveling through Undermountain, what with all the traps and monsters. But for me it goes beyond that.&quot;</string>
<string name="87522">&quot;The air here is heavy and stale. The halls are too narrow. The ceilings are too low. And what if the mountain above us collapses, and buries us under an avalanche of rock and stone?&quot;</string>
<string name="87523">&quot;I will not abandon you! We of the Uthgardt believe we must face our fears. By doing so, we conquer them, and they have no more power over us.&quot;</string>
<string name="87524">&quot;I just thought you should know about my... condition, since you seem to be leading this expedition. But I swear I won&apos;t let it affect me during our mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="87525">&quot;I know it must seem irrational, but I have lived my life on the great plains of my tribe. I am used to the open sky and the sting of the cold wind against my face. This place feels wrong to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="87526">&quot;Yes, of course. I know that. And we of the Uthgardt believe we must face our fears. By doing so, we conquer them, and they have no more power over us.&quot;</string>
<string name="87527">&quot;No! Well... yes. Maybe a little. It isn&apos;t normally a problem, I&apos;ve been in dungeons beneath the earth before. But Undermountain is different. More intense.&quot;</string>
<string name="87528">--------- Random Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="87529">&quot;This door looks like some kind of fail safe, a way for Halaster to control the creatures of Undermountain and keep them confined to their respective levels.&quot;</string>
<string name="87530">&quot;This dungeon is filled with all manner of powerful and dangerous creatures. If they banded together they could prove troublesome, even for an archmage like Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="87531">&quot;What really concerns me is the fact that this door is sealed. If the emergency systems have been triggered, it likely means Halaster is no longer in control.&quot;</string>
<string name="87532">&quot;As you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="87533">The half-orc shakes his head. &quot;I couldn&apos;t even begin to guess. But I suspect we&apos;ll have to figure it out if we want to go any deeper into this maze.&quot;</string>
<string name="87534">There is a legend among we Uthgardt, a tale of a lost tribe. It says they vanished beneath the earth, and the bones of the chieftains now stand guard over the tribe&apos;s treasure.&quot;</string>
<string name="87535">&quot;I am only saying we should be careful here. Make of my warning what you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="87536">&quot;The legend holds that the skeletons remain still until their treasure is disturbed, then spring to life to slay the living.&quot;</string>
<string name="87537">&quot;I doubt we have found the remains of the lost tribe from the Uthgardt legend, but I imagine every culture has similar tales of undead guardians lying in wait.&quot;</string>
<string name="87538">&quot;No, probably not. But I imagine every culture has similar tales of undead guardians that sit silent and still until their treasure is disturbed.&quot;</string>
<string name="87539">&quot;As you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="87540">&quot;It wouldn&apos;t surprise me, given what we&apos;ve already seen in this dungeon.&quot;</string>
<string name="87541">&quot;As you wish. Would you like me to join with once more?&quot;</string>
<string name="87542">&quot;I can&apos;t deny the truth of what you say, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My failure brings dishonor to my tribe and my Uthgardt heritage. Yet I know I can do better!&quot;</string>
<string name="87543">The half-orc sighs. &quot;If my role as a front line fighter can best serve the group, then I suppose I will just have to find some way to accept that my death will always be close at hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="87544">Daelen nods. &quot;I know you speak the truth, but I have always prided myself on my strength. I do not take well to dying... though I suppose nobody does.&quot;</string>
<string name="87545">&quot;I will not make vain boasts or promises I may not be able to keep, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But if you will have me join you again, I swear I will serve you as best as I am able.&quot;</string>
<string name="87546">The half-orc looks as if his pride has been momentarily wounded, but he is quick to try and hide his disappointment. &quot;As you wish. I will be here if you change your mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="87547">The half-orc allows himself the hint of a smile. &quot;Then let us return to Undermountain... and this time I plan to fare far better than my last visit!&quot; </string>
<string name="87548">------- This line must be placed at the end of inter-party banter ---------</string>
<string name="87549">&quot;Yes, Daelen? Is there something you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="87550">&quot;What? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="87551">&quot;You&apos;ve been watching me quite closely. Not that I mind - I&apos;m used to men staring at me. But I just wanted to make sure there wasn&apos;t anything more to it than a simple ogling.&quot;</string>
<string name="87552">The half-orc clears his throat, clearly uncomfortable. &quot;I was not ogling you, Sharwyn.&quot;</string>
<string name="87553">The bard arches an eyebrow. &quot;You weren&apos;t? That&apos;s a shame, Daelen. So why weren&apos;t you ogling me? Don&apos;t you find me attractive?&quot;</string>
<string name="87554">&quot;Well... yes. You&apos;re attractive. But I wasn&apos;t... Okay, maybe I was. But that doesn&apos;t mean...&quot; The half-orc gives you a desperate look. &quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;, I could use a little help here.&quot;</string>
<string name="87555">&quot;Yes, Daelen. You made this bed, now you have to lie in it... if you&apos;re lucky.&quot; She gives the Daelen a knowing wink and a laugh, then walks off with a toss of her hair.</string>
<string name="87556">Sharwyn smiles. &quot;I&apos;m out of every man&apos;s league. But some men are closer than others.&quot; She gives Daelen a knowing wink, then walks off with a toss of her long, red hair.</string>
<string name="87557">The half-orc barks out a harsh laugh. &quot;A couple? I think you got hit on the head in the last battle, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Look at us. Sharwyn&apos;s way out of my league.&quot;</string>
<string name="87558">&quot;But it&apos;s so fun! Besides, deep down he loves it. Don&apos;t you Daelen?&quot; She gives the half-orc a knowing wink, then laughs and walks off with a toss of her long, red hair.</string>
<string name="87559">The half-orc gives you a sheepish grin. &quot;Maybe I was staring, but you have to admit she&apos;s a hard woman to ignore.&quot;</string>
<string name="87560">&quot;Sharwyn, may I speak to you for a moment? I was... I was wondering how you were feeling after... well, after being killed during the ambush.&quot;</string>
<string name="87561">&quot;I&apos;m doing quite well, considering. No ill affects, no lingering symptoms.&quot; She tilts her head to the side and gives Daelan a long stare. &quot;It&apos;s something we&apos;ve all been through before, Daelen.&quot;</string>
<string name="87562">The half-orc suddenly drops his eyes. &quot;Yes, of course. I just... I just feel like I let you down. I&apos;m the warrior of our group, I was supposed to protect you.  Uh... you and the others, of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="87563">Sharwyn&apos;s brow knots up in anger. &quot;Are you saying I need my own personal guardian? I may not be as strong as you, Daelen - few people are. But I have other talents that serve me well enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="87564">&quot;We don&apos;t all rely on brutish strength and a big axe! My spells and bard songs are all I need, so don&apos;t waste any extra effort watching out for poor Sharwyn. She can look after herself!&quot;</string>
<string name="87565">The half-orc is obviously taken aback by her harsh reaction. &quot;I... I didn&apos;t mean it like that, Sharwyn. I&apos;ve watched you in action; I know you can look after yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="87566">The bard gets a mischievous glint in her eye. &quot;You&apos;ve been watching me in action, have you? And do you like what you see?&quot;</string>
<string name="87567">The half-orc blushes. &quot;Yes... I mean no, not like that. That is... look, I&apos;m just glad you&apos;re okay.&quot; Sharwyn laughs and walks away, leaving the half-orc shaking his head in exasperation.</string>
<string name="87568">&quot;Deekin, could you please stop with that humming? It&apos;s beginning to get on my nerves.&quot;</string>
<string name="87569">&quot;You hear Deekin&apos;s humming? You gots good ears. Maybe you like if Deekin sing instead? Deekin sing real good. Just ask Boss. Boss likes when Deekin sings.&quot;</string>
<string name="87570">&quot;Please don&apos;t. No singing, no humming. How about we try moving with no sound at all? Just to see what it&apos;s like?&quot;</string>
<string name="87571">&quot;Okay, that give Deekin time to work on song about you, Daelen.&quot; </string>
<string name="87572">&quot;You&apos;re working on a song about me?&quot; The half-orc&apos;s voice betrays more fear than you&apos;ve ever heard from him in battle. &quot;What kind of song?&quot;</string>
<string name="87573">&quot;You big, strong orc-man! You need big, strong orc-man song! But it hard... not much rhyme with orc. Fork... uh... pork...&quot;</string>
<string name="87574">&quot;Fork and pork? Those are my options? They seem more suited to a cook than a barbarian. What about... uh... hmmm, I guess it is hard to find a good rhyme for orc.&quot;</string>
<string name="87575">&quot;Yeah, it be easier if you a cook. You ever think about changing jobs? Deekin knows lots of rhymes for cooking: fork and pork; pot and hot; eat and meat. See?&quot;</string>
<string name="87576">&quot;Tell you what, Deekin. If I ever become a cook, you can write all the songs you want about me. Until then, let&apos;s just leave me out of your music. Deal?&quot;</string>
<string name="87577">The kobold smiles. &quot;Sounds good to Deekin.&quot; The kobold walks off, humming once again. Daelen watches him go, then smiles and shakes his head.</string>
<string name="87578">&quot;Oh, Boss. You not mean that. You just in a bad mood. Deekin sing a song to cheer Boss up.&quot;</string>
<string name="87579">&quot;Tomi... what are you doing?&quot;</string>
<string name="87580">&quot;Huh? What? Doing? Eh... I ain&apos;t doing nothin&apos;! Relax, me burly mate. Let yer guard down a bit. Yer always so suspicious.&quot;</string>
<string name="87581">&quot;I&apos;ve learned to be suspicious when you&apos;re around, Tomi. You&apos;re watching me more than I like, halfling. I know what you&apos;re up to. You&apos;re *casing* me!&quot;</string>
<string name="87582">&quot;Casing you? Nah, you got it all wrong. I just... uh... I just like to watch you fight. You sure can smack folks around. I just like to see our enemies get what&apos;s coming to &apos;em, is all.&quot;</string>
<string name="87583">&quot;Keep playing me for a fool and I&apos;ll see you get what&apos;s coming to you, Tomi. I know exactly how many coins I&apos;ve got on me, and if even one goes missing...&quot;</string>
<string name="87584">&quot;Oi, that ain&apos;t fair! You got them fat ol&apos; fingers. What if yer digging something out of yer pack and you drop a coin in the dust? You can&apos;t blame Tomi if he picks it up. Finders keepers, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="87585">&quot;Finders keepers? Tell you what, Tomi: if I *find* you took anything from me and I&apos;ll *keep* smacking you upside the head until you give it back.&quot;</string>
<string name="87586">Tomi&apos;s eyes go wide with surprise. &quot;Okay, okay. I get it. Daelen doesn&apos;t like to share. Sheesh, you&apos;d think I was some kind of common criminal.&quot;</string>
<string name="87587">&quot;Linu, would you be so kind as to watch where you&apos;re walking? This is the third time you&apos;ve stomped on my heel this morning.&quot;</string>
<string name="87588">&quot;Oh, I&apos;m sorry, dear. I don&apos;t mean to do it, but I tend to stumble on this uneven ground. You know how clumsy I can be... it&apos;s a wonder I haven&apos;t broken my leg on this trip.&quot;</string>
<string name="87589">&quot;I wouldn&apos;t worry about that. Your accidents have a way of working out.</string>
<string name="87590">Linu shrugs. &quot;Yes, I do have a bit of luck when it comes to that sort of thing. Still, I wish I wasn&apos;t so clumsy. Sometimes I wish I could be graceful, like so many other women.&quot;</string>
<string name="87591">&quot;But maybe if you were more graceful, you wouldn&apos;t be so lucky. These things have a way of balancing out. A stumble or two is a small price to pay for long term good fortune.&quot;</string>
<string name="87592">&quot;Hmmm... I never thought of it that way before. Thank you, Daelen. It&apos;s time I realize these clumsy feet of mine are really a blessing!&quot;</string>
<string name="87593">&quot;I&apos;m glad you feel that way. But please, just try to keep your *blessings* from treading on my heels for the rest of the morning.&quot;</string>
<string name="87594">Linu smiles. &quot;Of course, dear. I&apos;ll just walk a little farther behind you from now on.&quot;</string>
<string name="87595">&quot;Join me.&quot;</string>
<string name="87596">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="87597">&quot;I think we need to part ways.&quot;</string>
<string name="87598">&quot;I&apos;ve changed my mind. Stay with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="87599">&quot;Wait here until I return.&quot;</string>
<string name="87600">&quot;I&apos;m sure. Go back to Durnan&apos;s inn.&quot;</string>
<string name="87601">&quot;I want to change your tactics.&quot;</string>
<string name="87602">&quot;I don&apos;t want to change anything else right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87603">&quot;I want you to leave any traps that you see alone for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87604">&quot;I want you to disarm any traps that you see.&quot;</string>
<string name="87605">&quot;Don&apos;t try to be stealthy anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="87606">&quot;Stay stealthy, but only until the next fight.&quot;</string>
<string name="87607">&quot;Try to remain stealthy all the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="87608">&quot;Don&apos;t help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.&quot;</string>
<string name="87609">&quot;Help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.&quot;</string>
<string name="87610">&quot;I want to change the distance you stay away from me.&quot;</string>
<string name="87611">Stay a long distance away.</string>
<string name="87612">Keep a medium distance.</string>
<string name="87613">Stay close.</string>
<string name="87614">&quot;Go ahead and attack as soon as you see enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="87615">&quot;Defend me and don&apos;t attack until I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="87616">&quot;I want to adjust your equipment.&quot;</string>
<string name="87617">&quot;I need you to use your barbarian rage.&quot;</string>
<string name="87618">&quot;On second thought, don&apos;t bother.&quot;</string>
<string name="87619">&quot;I&apos;m sure. Do it now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87620">&quot;What was it you wanted to say earlier?&quot;</string>
<string name="87621">&quot;Let&apos;s stop and talk for a moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="87622">&quot;That&apos;s enough chatting.&quot;</string>
<string name="87623">&quot;No, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="87624">&quot;I&apos;m just wondering how everything is going with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87625">&quot;What do you plan to do after all this is done?&quot;</string>
<string name="87626">&quot;A month after that you&apos;ll want to leave again.&quot;</string>
<string name="87627">&quot;Finally ready to settle down?&quot;</string>
<string name="87628">&quot;What did you do after you left Neverwinter?&quot;</string>
<string name="87629">&quot;Do I look like I care about this?&quot;</string>
<string name="87630">&quot;What happened next?&quot;</string>
<string name="87631">&quot;So you were finally accepted?&quot;</string>
<string name="87632">&quot;Where did you go?&quot;</string>
<string name="87633">&quot;Nothing more than a strange coincidence.&quot;</string>
<string name="87634">&quot;Sounds like fate to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="87635">&quot;Sounds like you were running away.&quot;</string>
<string name="87636">&quot;You said you came from Neverwinter?&quot;</string>
<string name="87637">&quot;That&apos;s funny. I don&apos;t remember hearing anything about you helping to save Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="87638">&quot;I remember hearing about you. You&apos;re quite famous.&quot;</string>
<string name="87639">&quot;You must have been very popular in Neverwinter after that.&quot;</string>
<string name="87640">&quot;I really don&apos;t care about this.&quot;</string>
<string name="87641">&quot;Why not?&quot;</string>
<string name="87642">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="87643">&quot;You&apos;re talking about Lady Aribeth, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="87644">&quot;Where did you go after that?&quot;</string>
<string name="87645">&quot;That&apos;s a pretty bleak account of what happened.&quot;</string>
<string name="87646">&quot;No, not yet. Stay here.&quot;</string>
<string name="87647">&quot;Yes, come along.&quot;</string>
<string name="87648">&quot;Not right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87649">&quot;What is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="87650">&quot;I don&apos;t have time for this.&quot;</string>
<string name="87651">&quot;Is there some point here?&quot;</string>
<string name="87652">&quot;Yes, it&apos;s a truly dangerous place.&quot;</string>
<string name="87653">&quot;It&apos;s about the challenge. Testing yourself, testing your limits.&quot;</string>
<string name="87654">&quot;Greed. There&apos;s a lot of treasure down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="87655">&quot;Fame. It&apos;s a place for heroes to prove themselves.&quot;</string>
<string name="87656">&quot;Maybe it has something to do with Halaster&apos;s magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="87657">&quot;This is crazy. Undermountain is famous on its own merits.&quot;</string>
<string name="87658">&quot;I hadn&apos;t thought of that before.&quot;</string>
<string name="87659">&quot;No spell is that powerful.&quot;</string>
<string name="87660">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="87661">&quot;We&apos;re down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="87662">&quot;We don&apos;t have time for this.&quot;</string>
<string name="87663">&quot;Fine - out with, half-orc.&quot;</string>
<string name="87664">&quot;What? Is something wrong?&quot;</string>
<string name="87665">&quot;Are you quitting on me, you big baby?&quot;</string>
<string name="87666">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, the mountain won&apos;t collapse on us.&quot;</string>
<string name="87667">&quot;Maybe you should go back to the surface.&quot;</string>
<string name="87668">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, Daelen. Everything will be fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="87669">&quot;You&apos;re claustrophobic!&quot;</string>
<string name="87670">&quot;That seems rather obvious, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="87671">&quot;Why would he need a fail safe?&quot;</string>
<string name="87672">&quot;Let&apos;s just move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="87673">&quot;Any idea how we get this door open?&quot;</string>
<string name="87674">&quot;I think I can handle this without your little tale.&quot;</string>
<string name="87675">&quot;Stand guard? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="87676">&quot;And you think these skeletons are from that tribe?&quot;</string>
<string name="87677">&quot;You didn&apos;t really tell me anything I didn&apos;t already know.&quot;</string>
<string name="87678">&quot;Thanks for the warning. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="87679">&quot;So you think these skeletons will come to life?&quot;</string>
<string name="87680">&quot;Never mind. I don&apos;t want to discuss it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87681">&quot;You keep dying. That&apos;s not very helpful.&quot;</string>
<string name="87682">&quot;You&apos;re in the front of every battle. What do you expect?&quot;</string>
<string name="87683">&quot;Undermountain is a dangerous place. Death isn&apos;t unexpected.&quot;</string>
<string name="87684">&quot;Just stay here, for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="87685">&quot;I want you to join me again.&quot;</string>
<string name="87686">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87687">&quot;You were the one staring. Get yourself out of this mess.&quot;</string>
<string name="87688">&quot;Forget about her, Daelen. She&apos;s out of your league.&quot;</string>
<string name="87689">&quot;What&apos;s the problem? I think you make a nice couple.&quot;</string>
<string name="87690">&quot;Sharwyn, stop picking on Daelen.&quot;</string>
<string name="87691">&quot;Maybe this isn&apos;t the best time for a song, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="87692">&quot;That&apos;s true. Why don&apos;t you sing for us now, Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="87693">&quot;I do not!&quot;</string>
<string name="87694">&quot;You takes Deekin with you now, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="87695">---------- Random Pop-Ups Start Here ------------</string>

<string name="87716">&quot;Oh. Okay, Deekin just opens up pack for you. Ummm... is not very clean, though. And ignore the socks...&quot;</string>
<string name="87717">&quot;Ummm... okay. Deekin looks through your pack and maybe he finds something you not already knows about. Hold on...&quot;</string>
<string name="87718">&quot;Ooo! You wants to hear Deekin sing! Deekin gladly sing for the boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="87719">&quot;You needs Deekin to buffs stuff up? What kinds of spells you needs Deekin to cast?&quot;</string>
<string name="87720">&quot;What you wants Deekin to cast?&quot;</string>
<string name="87721">&quot;You be sure?&quot;</string>
<string name="87722">&quot;Okay. Who shoulds Deekin cast it on?&quot;</string>
<string name="87723">&quot;What you calls place where big ghost is?&quot;</string>
<string name="87724">&quot;Deekin gots a bad feeling about fortress, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="87725">&quot;You wants to talk with Deekin? What you wants to talk about, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="87726">&quot;There be something else you wants to talk about, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="87727">&quot;Deekin tired. Feet is sore. Back is hurting. Little Deekin feel like bag of clamshells bashed on ground repeatedly. Overall is okays.&quot;</string>
<string name="87728">&quot;Ummm... there be something else you wants to talks about, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="87729">&quot;Deekin gots little indigestion, maybe.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Burp!]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Oh... there it goes.&quot;</string>
<string name="87730">&quot;Hmmm. Is good. Deekin just not remember where he leaves pot of ink. How you supposed to write if you not gots ink?&quot;</string>
<string name="87731">&quot;Is all okays. How about you, boss. Everything okays with you?&quot;</string>
<string name="87732">&quot;Deekin excited to be on great adventure with the boss! Ummm... that mean everything just hunky-dorey.&quot;</string>
<string name="87733">&quot;Ummm... Deekin be okay. Except Deekin not remembers how you spells &apos;superfluous&apos;.&quot;</string>
<string name="87734">&quot;Deekin busy writings latest chapter in epic story. Just you wait and sees, boss! It be betters than first one!&quot;</string>
<string name="87735">&quot;Ummm... is okay, Deekin guesses, except Deekin not sees much. Where you at, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="87736">&quot;Deekin gots some scratches and stuff, but it mostly okay. Deekin tougher than he looks.&quot;</string>
<string name="87737">&quot;Deekin hurts pretty bad. Is adventuring always likes this? Is hard to write epic story when blood be everywhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="87738">&quot;Ooo... Deekin not feels good. He hurts really bad. Maybe we rests now?&quot;</string>
<string name="87739">&quot;Deekin thinks he be poisoned. He burps lots and skin feels like it on fire. Old Master sometimes give Deekin poison for fun... Deekin not thinks it so fun.&quot;</string>
<string name="87740">&quot;Ummm... Deekin not feels so good. He gots bad rash, and just wants to curls up somewhere. Bleh.&quot;</string>
<string name="87741">&quot;You wants to discuss Deekin&apos;s training? Okay, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87742">&quot;Deekin focussing on becoming dragon disciple. It be really hard... but Deekin feels much stronger. Maybe old master be right. You wants that Deekin should do something different?&quot;</string>
<string name="87743">&quot;Ummm, currently Deekin is just trying to be bard. You wants that Deekin should do something different?&quot;</string>
<string name="87744">&quot;Okay, boss. Deekin works on being dragon disciple, maybe, but he not stops being bard.&quot;</string>
<string name="87745">&quot;Deekin is currently just workings on being both dragon disciple, like he tells you, and also bard, maybe. If you wants Deekin to do something different, boss, just says so.&quot;</string>
<string name="87746">&quot;If you says so, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87747">&quot;Okay, boss. Deekin tries his best.&quot;</string>
<string name="87748">&quot;Okay, boss. Deekin gots no problem with that. Deekin tries to be dragon disciple later, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="87749">&quot;You mean after Deekin finish second book?&quot;</string>
<string name="87750">&quot;And after Deekin get *much* better price for his second book?&quot;</string>
<string name="87751">&quot;Deekin walk into publisher office and if Deekin not gets paid good for second book then publisher be in lots of trouble! Deekin not goings to take any guff. Plus, Deekin want royalties.&quot;</string>
<string name="87752">&quot;After book, Deekin thinks he might go back to Nether Mountains, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="87753">&quot;Deekin thinkings maybe he takes kobold tribe and brings them out to lives with humans, maybe. Deekin thinks he makes tribe not be so mean and nasty, for once.&quot;</string>
<string name="87754">&quot;That tempts Deekin lots. But... Deekin gots to go on his own, again. Just because first time not goes well not means Deekin should not tries again.&quot;</string>
<string name="87755">&quot;Deekin maybe is first kobold that gets to come to civilized lands. Somehow Deekin not thinks he be only kobold that ever wants to. He certainly not want to be last kobold that try.&quot;</string>
<string name="87756">&quot;Deekin thinks it be hard, maybe. There be lots of kobold who fights Deekin, maybe. But Deekin going to try. Deekin gots to try.&quot;</string>
<string name="87757">&quot;Good idea, boss. On with the adventure!&quot;</string>
<string name="87758">&quot;Deekin not thinks so, but he be grateful you offers. Ummmm, it not be possible if not for you, boss. Deekin never forgets you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87759">&quot;Thank you, boss. None of that be even possible if it not be for you. Deekin never forgets you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87760">&quot;But... adventure not be over yet, boss. On with the adventure!&quot;</string>
<string name="87761">&quot;Deekin hopes so. Anyone can change, Deekin thinking. Maybe at first, they be not mean because Deekin tells them. Maybe laters they learn to be not mean because they wants to.&quot;</string>
<string name="87762">&quot;Ummm... Deekin not gots more stories. But Deekin entertains you, boss! Let Deekin thinks...&quot;</string>
<string name="87763">&quot;We is doomed! Doom doom doom-doom doom DOOM!! Doom doom doom-doom doom DOOM!! Doom doom doom-doom doom DOOM!!&quot;</string>
<string name="87764">&quot;DOOM!! Doom doom doom-doom doom DOOM!! DOOOOOM!!&quot;</string>
<string name="87765">&quot;Umm... mumble... mumble mumble... Deekin forgets the lyrics... la-te-da...&quot;</string>
<string name="87766">&quot;Oh-hhhh! Deekin&apos;s singing a song, yeah! Deekin&apos;s singing a song! He forgets how it goes, but nobody knows, &apos;cause Deekin&apos;s singing a so-ooong!!&quot;</string>
<string name="87767">&quot;&apos;Cause this is Never... Neverwinter Nights!
And no one&apos;s gonna save you from the beast about to strike!
You know it&apos;s Never... Neverwinter Nights!
You&apos;re fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller to-NIIIIGHHHHT!!&quot;</string>
<string name="87768">&quot;Sta-aaart spreadings the news! Deekin is leavings today! Deekin wants to BE a part of it! Waterdeep! Waterdeeeeep!&quot;</string>
<string name="87769">&quot;We&apos;s all doomed! Dum-dum-dum-de-dum! YEEAAAAHHHH, we&apos;s all dooomed! Dum-dum-de-dum... buhhhhhhh-buh! We is all DOOMED!&quot;</string>
<string name="87770">&quot;Doom-de-doom doom! DOOM DOOM DOOM! DID YOU HEARS ME?!!! DOOOOOMMMM!!&quot;</string>
<string name="87771">&quot;Underdark! Underdark! Friendly, neighbourhood Underdark! Full of webs, any size! If you gets caught, you will dies! Look out! Look outs for the Underdark!&quot;</string>
<string name="87772">&quot;Here we are! Dum-de-dum! Me and the boss, off to kill a drow la-dy! Dum-de-dum!!&quot;</string>
<string name="87773">&quot;Deekin sings you the doom song! Doom doom doom! DOOM! Doom! Doom doom doom! DOOM!!&quot;</string>
<string name="87774">Deekin scratches his head. &quot;Deekin gots hired to do actual adventure, once. All by himself.&quot;</string>
<string name="87775">&quot;It be after Deekin leaves you but before Deekin gets to Waterdeep. Deekin was travelings and he comes to small village at night. Deekin really hungry so he goes in, which he not normally does.&quot;</string>
<string name="87776">&quot;Village humans not sees kobolds much, Deekin thinks, except in bad ways. They usually chases Deekin out before Deekin gets chance to explain.&quot;</string>
<string name="87777">&quot;But big, giant bear had eaten all of Deekin&apos;s food the night before, so Deekin&apos;s little belly was rumbling. He had to try and begs for food or he would starves.&quot;</string>
<string name="87778">&quot;It be really strange. Deekin sticks head into tavern door and asks if it okay for him to comes in, and fat human lady says it be okay. She takes Deekin in and feeds him big meal and even lets him get room.&quot;</string>
<string name="87779">&quot;She never sees kobold before, and not thinks Deekin be so strange. When other peoples come into tavern later, they gets upset... but fat lady tells them to stop. She say Deekin be gentleman, so they get calm.&quot;</string>
<string name="87780">&quot;Yup. Deekin very lucky. Fat human lady runs inn all by herself, so Deekin stays for week to helps out with chores. Everybody in village calls her Mama, and so did Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="87781">&quot;Deekin even thinks of staying to helps Mama, but that not happens.&quot; Surprisingly, Deekin stops speaking for a moment. A tear creeps down his face and he wipes it away quickly. &quot;Wolves... they comes into village one night and they kills Mama when she be outside.&quot;</string>
<string name="87782">&quot;At first, village people thinks Deekin maybe kills Mama. But then they looks close and they sees wolves does it. Mayor of village offers money to anyone who goes and kills wolves.&quot;</string>
<string name="87783">&quot;Nobody in village volunteer. Wolves be big and dangerous, they says. So Deekin volunteers.&quot; Deekin&apos;s voice hardens with remembered anger. &quot;He be sad but also angry. Mama not deserves to die like that! So he goes and finds wolf cave and kills all them wolves.&quot;</string>
<string name="87784">&quot;Deekin almost dies, but he happy he kills them later. It feels good. Deekin avenges Mama and be true adventurer... mayor even pays Deekin as he promises.&quot;</string>
<string name="87785">&quot;Tavern goes to son of Mama who not likes Deekin... and nobody in village really trust Deekin, even if he kills wolves. Deekin go on to Waterdeep then.&quot;</string>
<string name="87786">Deekin wipes another tear from his face and is silent a moment. &quot;And besides... Mama not be there no more. She reminds Deekin of you. Deekin never misses the boss so much.&quot;</string>
<string name="87787">&quot;Deekin just find it hard to travel without the boss with him, is all. That not mean that Deekin not tries.&quot;</string>
<string name="87788">&quot;Deekin glad to be with the boss, now, yes? Let us return to the adventure!&quot;</string>
<string name="87789">&quot;Deekin was asleep. He not knows Mama be outside... and even if he knows, he be asleep and not hears it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87790">&quot;Deekin was very sad for Mama. She was nice to Deekin and even said Deekin reminds her of son.&quot;</string>
<string name="87791">&quot;She goings to outhouse. Bad timing, Deekin thinkings.&quot;</string>
<string name="87792">&quot;Deekin meets drow once, before this whole adventure start.&quot;</string>
<string name="87793">&quot;Nope. This drow actually speaks to Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="87794">Deekin thinks for a moment, remembering. &quot;It be back in Waterdeep market... Deekin runnings around like mad because he forgets lute somewheres but he not knows where. And that only lute Deekin had.&quot;</string>
<string name="87795">&quot;You not payings attention? That not important, boss. What be important is that Deekin be runnings and not lookings where he goings.&quot;</string>
<string name="87796">&quot;Deekin comes around corner and pow! He runs right into big person standings there. Only it not just be big person, it be drow elf.&quot;</string>
<string name="87797">&quot;There only be so many peoples with black skin and white hairs and pointy ears. What else you thinks it be, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="87798">&quot;Anyway, Deekin lies there, stunned, while drow spins around and pulls out two big swords. He thinks Deekin attacks him! He goings to kill Deekin, so Deekin screams at top of his lungs!&quot;</string>
<string name="87799">&quot;It makes drow stop, and Deekin takes chance to apologize lots. Drow says it be okay, and he makes comment that he assumes I be evil because I be kobold... and that it be strange to sees kobold in city like this.&quot;</string>
<string name="87800">&quot;He gots fat dwarf with him who laughs, then, and slaps him on back and says he of all peoples should knows better. Deekin not really knows what that means, but drow lets Deekin go.&quot;</string>
<string name="87801">&quot;Deekin was very surprised, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="87802">&quot;Ummm... dwarf mentions it. Was something like Fidget or Widget or... or Drippits, or somethings.&quot;</string>
<string name="87803">&quot;Deekin agrees. He was sort of weird for drow, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="87804">Deekin scrunches his face for a moment, thinking hard. &quot;Deekin meets another dragon, once.&quot;</string>
<string name="87805">&quot;It was nice, big dragon. Gold, Deekin thinkings. Deekin meets him inside Waterdeep, in fact.&quot;</string>
<string name="87806">&quot;Yup. He be disguised as human. You knows dragons do that? They turns into whatever they wants. Old Master turns into human all the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="87807">&quot;Old Master does that just to writes in book, he says. Old Master used to say that he not likes human form, but he says it gots advantages. Deekin knows that he not tells truth, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="87808">&quot;Old Master goes to Hilltop one time as human, and Deekin follows him. It was only third time Deekin be out of caves, so Deekin was very nervous.&quot;</string>
<string name="87809">&quot;All Deekin could wonders is why Old Master wants to comes to human town.&quot; Deekin shrugs, looking bewildered. &quot;So Deekin become invisible and watches Old Master go into inn.&quot;</string>
<string name="87810">&quot;When Deekin spy through window, he sees Old Master eatings a big pie. Old Master gots big smile on his face, he looks so happy! After that, Old Master leaves town and goes home.&quot;</string>
<string name="87811">&quot;Old Master likes pie lots, Deekin thinking. Deekin never finds out what kinds, though. At time Deekin think it so strange he never mentions it to Old Master.&quot;</string>
<string name="87812">&quot;Oh. He just wants to know if Deekin knows the time. He not even tells Deekin he be dragon, but Deekin knows. Deekin knows.&quot;</string>
<string name="87813">&quot;Yes, boss. And about Old Master likings pie.&quot;</string>
<string name="87814">&quot;Ummm... Deekin notice that, too. Deekin thinks they be very... red.&quot;</string>
<string name="87815">&quot;They not be very big. Maybe Deekin fly for short distance, but he not be sure. Deekin not really be concerned about that.&quot;</string>
<string name="87816">&quot;Yes... it be interesting. Deekin looks very different now. Still... Deekin not sure if he be happy.&quot;</string>
<string name="87817">&quot;Deekin was thinkings maybe he gets white wings. Like Old Master, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="87818">&quot;When Old Master says that Deekin gots dragon blood, he assume it be white dragon blood like Old Master. Deekin not be sure what to think.&quot;</string>
<string name="87819">&quot;No, Deekin likes being dragon disciple. Deekin feel powerful... maybe for first time since Deekin leave old master. Deekin feel like he able to do almost anything!&quot;</string>
<string name="87820">&quot;Deekin just, ummm... want to look like Old Master.&quot;</string>
<string name="87821">&quot;Heh heh. Deekin knows it be silly. Deekin get over it quick... he just, ummm, misses Old Master a little.&quot;</string>
<string name="87822">Deekin hangs his head in shame. &quot;You is right. Deekin should not be so picky. Sorry, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87823">&quot;You thinks so?&quot; Deekin looks on his wings with renewed appreciation. &quot;Maybe you is right. Thanks, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="87824">&quot;You means now that Deekin be dragon disciple? Yeah, it be lots different. Deekin feels really strange sometimes.&quot;</string>
<string name="87825">&quot;Ohhh, sometimes Deekin gets strange dreams. He flies around looking for cow to eat. Deekin feel really strong and angry and gots stinky breath, even.&quot;</string>
<string name="87826">&quot;When Deekin awake, sometimes his skin feel really hot. He looks at boss, even, and sometimes think &apos;Ha ha, puny &lt;race&gt; mortal!&apos; even though Deekin not means it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87827">&quot;You not gots to worries, boss. Deekin controls everything okays. Deekin likes it, actually... it make Deekin feel good.&quot;</string>
<string name="87828">&quot;Deekin just hopes he not burps and, ummm, breathe fire or something at wrong moment. Deekin wouldn&apos;t wants to, ummm, singe the boss or anything...&quot;</string>
<string name="87829">&quot;Maybe one day Deekin be strong and he can fly and do all sorts of things like old master? That make him Super Deekin! Hee hee!&quot;</string>
<string name="87830">&quot;Thanks, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="87831">&quot;Heh heh... right, boss. Deekin remembers that.&quot;</string>
<string name="87832">&quot;Ummm... Deekin been meaning to talks to you about that...&quot;</string>
<string name="87833">&quot;The old boss once tell Deekin that he gots dragon blood, that it be strong in him. Deekin never knows what that means... Deekin be small and weak and not breathes fire or anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="87834">&quot;But sometimes... sometimes when Deekin fights he feels heart beatings really fast and he feel... strong. Does that seem silly to you, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="87835">&quot;Well... Deekin thinking maybe he tries to, ummm, focus on being dragon disciple. Old master never tells Deekin about this, but... maybe it be good thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="87836">&quot;It be up to you, boss. Deekin do what you tells him to. If you wants Deekin to just be faithful bard, instead, Deekin do that and be happy.&quot;</string>
<string name="87837">&quot;Okay. Deekin concentrates on that. Thanks, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87838">&quot;Okay. Deekin not want to disappoint you, boss. Deekin become dragon disciple later, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="87839">&quot;Then Deekin work on being dragon disciple for now and, ummmm, maybe goes back to being bard later. Deekin hopes that okay. You tells him if it not, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87840">&quot;Deekin comes first to Waterdeep, and then he publishes book. That gives Deekin a little bit of coin so he can travel some more... though Deekin never gets too far, to be honest.&quot;</string>
<string name="87841">&quot;It... not works out for Deekin like he thinks it should. Deekin was happy to sells great, epic tale to publisher... though Deekin only paids two, maybe three thousand gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="87842">He nods his head slowly, looking abashed. &quot;Deekin knows that. Deekin just... want to make it on his own. Always Deekin gots boss who looks out for little Deekin, Deekin had to try. Even if it not works out.&quot;</string>
<string name="87843">&quot;Deekin thought he gots it made when publisher pays him for great, epic tale. Deekin think two, three thousand gold be everything.&quot;</string>
<string name="87844">Deekin looks up at you, his smile bright. &quot;You dids? That make Deekin very happy. All he wants is to be famous and to have lots of people reads epic tale and knows about the boss&apos; adventure.&quot;</string>
<string name="87845">&quot;Deekin certainly not does it for coin. Publisher not pays Deekin much... two or three thousand gold, maybe, Deekin not really remember.&quot;</string>
<string name="87846">&quot;Oh, it not be so much, maybe. Was two or three thousand gold Deekin get paid.&quot;</string>
<string name="87847">&quot;Deekin want to keep some gold aside for you, boss. Honest, Deekin did. It just... it just not lasts very long. There be lots of peoples who wants Deekin&apos;s money and Deekin not knows how to spend it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87848">&quot;Deekin not knows any better. It seem like lots of money to Deekin, more than he ever sees before.&quot;</string>
<string name="87849">&quot;It not lasts long in Waterdeep, anyway. There always be peoples who wants Deekin&apos;s money, and Deekin got hard time knowings how to spends it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87850">&quot;He pays too high prices for everything before he realizes that people cheats him. Deekin tries to complain, but nobody cares because he just be little kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="87851">&quot;Deekin try and stands up for himself, but he can&apos;t fights or casts spells to makes people nice. If Deekin do that, people thinks Deekin just be evil kobold and he gets attacked... maybe killed.&quot;</string>
<string name="87852">&quot;Even city guard not helps Deekin. Deekin try to talks to them, but they just chases Deekin and tries to kill him... Deekin gets away, but it be close thing. Kobolds not be popular.&quot;</string>
<string name="87853">&quot;Old master say bards is supposed to be charming and diplomatic. Deekin not very good bard. Deekin loses all money. Deekin play music in dirty taverns where nobody listens, and nobody think Deekin charming.&quot;</string>
<string name="87854">&quot;Deekin not knows much about civilization, but Deekin not be dumb. Deekin knows why peoples thinks like that about kobolds... and it be true. Kobolds be mean and nasty.&quot;</string>
<string name="87855">&quot;If Deekin be dumb, he thinks all people be mean and nasty just likes people thinks all kobolds be mean and nasty. If there be peoples like you, there be others, too. Deekin just gots to finds them.&quot;</string>
<string name="87856">&quot;Deekin proves to them that Deekin be true bard. One day everybody knows about Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="87857">Deekin grins, showing a full set of sharp teeth. &quot;I agree, boss. On to the adventure!&quot;</string>
<string name="87858">Deekin looks all choked up for a moment. &quot;Thanks, boss. That means very much to little Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="87859">Deekin grins, showing a full set of sharp teeth. &quot;Thanks, boss! You is the greatest!&quot;</string>
<string name="87860">&quot;You is nice to say that, boss. Deekin knows that there not be many people like you, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="87861">&quot;No. Deekin not going to gives up, boss. Deekin not be here if he gives up.&quot;</string>
<string name="87862">&quot;You not thinks little Deekin be weak?&quot;</string>
<string name="87863">&quot;That be different, boss. When Deekin adventures with you, he can fights and casts spells. When Deekin be in city, however, he can&apos;t do that.&quot;</string>
<string name="87864">&quot;That what Deekin hear. Publisher just pays Deekin when he buys book, though... Deekin not knows any better. Deekin think that be lots of money back then.&quot;</string>
<string name="87865">Deekin shrugs noncommittally. &quot;Publisher just pays Deekin when he buys book. Deekin not knows any better.&quot;</string>
<string name="87866">&quot;Mage who builds Undermountain? Deekin knows a little bits, from stories.&quot;</string>
<string name="87867">&quot;You mean, you goings to test Deekin? Oh! Deekin wishes he had time to studies, first!&quot;</string>
<string name="87868">&quot;Ummm... well, his full name be Halaster Blackcloak, Deekin remembers. And he be very old. Some peoples say he even be older than Elminster.&quot;</string>
<string name="87869">&quot;Deekin reads book once that say Halaster come to Waterdeep before city was here. He brings seven apprentices and then builds great tower... because that what great mages do.&quot;</string>
<string name="87870">&quot;Well, books say that Halaster was little bit crazy even then. Apprentices not see him much, as he hides even in own tower. He build tower deeper and deeper to hide and talks to demons.&quot;</string>
<string name="87871">&quot;Then one day Halaster make tower go too deep and he break into old dwarf mines. There be no dwarves anymore... just lots of monsters. So Halaster move into mines and he not be seen any more. That be Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="87872">&quot;Not much happen. Halaster stay crazy, Undermountain stay dangerous. Then this happen. Cue epic adventure, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87873">&quot;That all Deekin knows about Halaster, really. Deekin hopes that help.&quot;</string>
<string name="87874">&quot;Halaster not lets monsters leave, so Waterdeep never in danger. Deekin not think Waterdeep even knows about Undermountain and Halaster for long, long time.&quot;</string>
<string name="87875">&quot;Durnan be one of first adventurers to return from Undermountain alive. Book Deekin read be by partner of Durnan, in fact... but Deekin forgets his name.&quot;</string>
<string name="87876">&quot;Some, maybe. Halaster summons monsters all the time and sets up puzzles and traps and lairs. To guards him, maybe, or just to kills people? Deekin not knows.&quot;</string>
<string name="87877">&quot;You know, Elminster once say that Undermountain be biggest adventurer graveyard in all of Faerun. Deekin wonders if that be true?&quot;</string>
<string name="87878">&quot;Not any more. Over centuries, Halaster builds and builds and changes dungeon. They says he alters layout all the time, just to be safe, and he moves through the walls.&quot;</string>
<string name="87879">&quot;That be different story. If Deekin remember, they all gets killed by drow... so when Halaster comes, it already be all one big dungeon. Some stories say Halaster kills all drow he finds, first. Maybe they mad at him?&quot;</string>
<string name="87880">&quot;Deekin guesses he just too crazy. He goes all paranoid and thinks everybody out to gets him, maybe. Nobody really sure why Halaster is like he is.&quot;</string>
<string name="87881">&quot;More than one thousand years, maybe? This be legend, boss, it not great when it comes to dates, you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="87882">&quot;Not any more. Deekin believe that Yawning Portal Inn be on spot where tower once was. That why it gots entrance to Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="87883">&quot;Deekin not thinks so. Books say that Halaster kills most of apprentices. Some goes with him later into Undermountain, maybe, but nobody know what happens to them then.&quot;</string>
<string name="87884">&quot;AHHHHHHH!! Deekin... heart...&quot;</string>
<string name="87885">&quot;Deekin worships ground boss walks on! Honest! Please not be so angry at Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="87886">&quot;Deekin is so sorry, boss!! Can you not forgives little Deekin?&quot; He bats his eyes at you innocently.</string>
<string name="87887">&quot;Deekin is but little, little worm before the boss! Forgive little Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="87888">&quot;Deekin learns lesson good, he promises! Deekin do better, he will!&quot;</string>
<string name="87889">&quot;Yay! Deekin so happy! Deekin do his best from now on, Deekin promises!&quot;</string>
<string name="87890">&quot;Ahhh! No hurts Deekin! Deekin sorry, he tries to do better!&quot;</string>
<string name="87891">&quot;D&apos;oh! Deekin not wants to be in trouble, boss! Please forgives Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="87892">&quot;Deekin not worthy! Deekin not worthy!&quot;</string>
<string name="87893">&quot;Why you be so means to Deekin? Deekin is sorry! Really sorry!&quot;</string>
<string name="87894">&quot;Oh. Okay... Deekin talks to you later, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="87895">&quot;Deekin just... wants to say that you is best friend Deekin ever gots.&quot;</string>
<string name="87896">&quot;Boss denies it, maybe, but Deekin knows that the boss really cares. Otherwise why would Deekin be here?&quot;</string>
<string name="87897">&quot;Nobody gives Deekin chance like the boss did... and you gives it to Deekin twice! Deekin will always be grateful to boss for that.&quot;</string>
<string name="87898">&quot;Okay, boss. Deekin not embarasses you with mushy stuff no more.&quot;</string>
<string name="87899">&quot;Deekin has?&quot;</string>
<string name="87900">&quot;Oh, of course! Deekin has great, epic tale of the boss to finish! It will be great, boss, just you wait and see!&quot;</string>
<string name="87901">&quot;Heh heh... Deekin okay with that. If he amuses boss, that makes Deekin very happy.&quot;</string>
<string name="87902">&quot;Deekin not... think of that, but maybe boss is right. Deekin is a powerful kobold! Maybe soon Deekin have legend of his own! Thanks, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87903">&quot;Heh... you makes Deekin blush, boss. And that be hard to do, considering Deekin all scaley. Ha ha!&quot;</string>
<string name="87904">&quot;Ummm... nothing. Forget Deekin says something, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87905">&quot;Ummm... no, it okay. Deekin alright.&quot;</string>
<string name="87906">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;No, no... don&apos;t worry about Deekin. Deekin gots nothing to say.&quot;</string>
<string name="87907">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Well, maybe... no. No, no, Deekin be fine. Just continue adventure, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87908">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Aaaahhhh!! Okay, boss, okay! DEEKIN GOTS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM!! CAN WE STOPS FOR A MOMENT?!?!&quot;</string>
<string name="87909">&quot;What should Deekin calls new book when it done?&quot;</string>
<string name="87910">&quot;Mmmm... maybe Deekin gots ideas. But Deekin thought he maybe asks boss this time.&quot;</string>
<string name="87911">&quot;Book is all about the boss and the great, epic adventure! Does boss really not haves an opinion?&quot;</string>
<string name="87912">&quot;Hmm. Maybe Deekin calls it &apos;Adventures of the Boss&apos;? Now that gots nifty ring to it!&quot;</string>
<string name="87913">&quot;Hmph. Don&apos;t reminds Deekin. Deekin hates that guy! Deekin tracks him down one day and gives him swift kicks in buttocks! Grrr!&quot;</string>
<string name="87914">&quot;But the boss is probably right. Oh well.&quot;</string>
<string name="87915">&quot;That be what Deekin wants to calls it last time. Hmmm... maybe &apos;Adventures of &lt;FullName&gt;, the Sequel&apos;? Nobody ever tries that before.&quot;</string>
<string name="87916">&quot;Oh. Ummm... Deekin wasn&apos;t thinking of calling it anything so silly. Ha ha...&quot; he pulls out his notebook and begins quickly scratching out several notes.</string>
<string name="87917">&quot;Gosh. Deekin was thinkings exactly the same thing. Isn&apos;t it great that Deekin and boss thinks so much alike?&quot;</string>
<string name="87918">&quot;Ha ha. The boss is a comedian now, Deekin sees.&quot;</string>
<string name="87919">&quot;Deekin is writing in epic tale... and Deekin just wondering...&quot;</string>
<string name="87920">&quot;Deekin wonders how boss wants to, ummm... how you wants to be described?&quot;</string>
<string name="87921">&quot;O-oookay, boss. But don&apos;t you come cryings to Deekin later if people says you not looks like Deekin writes you looks.&quot;</string>
<string name="87922">&quot;Ummm... Deekin could, maybe, but he hears that &lt;race&gt; men be very vain...&quot;</string>
<string name="87923">&quot;Ummm... Deekin could, maybe, but he hears that &lt;race&gt; ladies be sensitives about that sort of thing...&quot;</string>
<string name="87924">&quot;But... that entire purpose of Deekin travelings with you, boss! Deekin is here to records your journey! To brings your greatness to all of the world! Does you not want say in how you is described?&quot;</string>
<string name="87925">&quot;Well... I says that you is a handsomes &lt;race&gt; man. I always calls you that, when I not calls you boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87926">&quot;Hmmm... now how Deekin describes you without gettings into trouble...&quot;</string>
<string name="87927">&quot;Okay, Deekin thinks he gets hint, boss. Thanks for helping.&quot;</string>
<string name="87928">&quot;Tells the truth? Peoples always gets mad when Deekin tells the truth. No, Deekin thinks he much safer when he lies kobold butt off. Thanks, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87929">&quot;Really? But nobody recognizes you from *that* description. Oh well, Deekin keeps on trying...&quot;</string>
<string name="87930">&quot;Well... I says that you is a beautiful &lt;race&gt; lady. I always calls you that, when I not calls you boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87931">&quot;Does you remembers old master at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="87932">&quot;Deekin remembers when you tells Deekin that he be free. He almost not believe it that old master lets him go. Deekin was very happy.&quot;</string>
<string name="87933">&quot;Deekin just wonders... when you talks to old master, did he talks about Deekin at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="87934">&quot;Oh. Sometimes Deekin misses old master, too, but that not what Deekin talks about.&quot;</string>
<string name="87935">&quot;Old master tell Deekin once that Deekin gots lots of dragon blood. Deekin not be sure about that... Deekin not be bigger or stronger, he not breathes fire or anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="87936">&quot;Maybe that be okay... unless Deekin breathes fire all the time. Then it be hard to eats.&quot;</string>
<string name="87937">&quot;No, old master not jokes often. Not with Deekin. Lots of times he not makes sense, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="87938">&quot;Maybe. Deekin not really thinks so, but sometimes he wonders.&quot;</string>
<string name="87939">&quot;Old master tell Deekin once that Deekin gots lots of dragon blood. But he never tells Deekin more... and now that Deekin go through changes...&quot;</string>
<string name="87940">&quot;So Deekin wonder if old master not say anything abouts Deekin? Nothing likes that?&quot;</string>
<string name="87941">&quot;Oh. Deekin hopes that... well, Deekin just gots to makes best of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87942">&quot;Oh. Deekin... Deekin try, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87943">&quot;So you not remembers if old master says anything? Anything at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="87944">&quot;Yes, Deekin remembers you tellings Deekin that. Deekin felt a bit sad... though Deekin know that old master would never let him go otherwise.&quot;</string>
<string name="87945">&quot;Oh. Deekin hope maybe you remembers. It not important.&quot;</string>
<string name="87946">&quot;Ummm... you thinks it be okay if Deekin writes in book that he not likes Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="87947">&quot;Deekin reads so much about Waterdeep when he was with old master... there be so many books, so many! Deekin read them all! He always wonder how so many peoples lives in one place!&quot;</string>
<string name="87948">&quot;So when Deekin leaves Hilltop, he heads first to Waterdeep. Deekin go to the big city! If Deekin makes it there, Deekin makes it anywhere!&quot;</string>
<string name="87949">Deekin shuffles his feet. &quot;Deekin not makes it there. Everybody in Waterdeep is very mean to little Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="87950">&quot;Sorry, boss. Deekin just... want to gets it all right in book.&quot;</string>
<string name="87951">&quot;They chases Deekin with pitchforks, sends guards to run Deekin down. Deekin gets thrown out of so many inns... he sleeps for three days in cold gutters before Deekin finally find half-orc who lets Deekin use stable.&quot;</string>
<string name="87952">&quot;Deekin just was hoping that... maybe Waterdeep gots people who treats him nice. Like you.&quot;</string>
<string name="87953">&quot;You free Deekin. That nicest thing anyone does for Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="87954">&quot;Heh heh... you talks like that, boss, but Deekin knows you not means it.&quot;</string>
<string name="87955">&quot;It not so bad, maybe. Eventually people stop chasings Deekin. Deekin publishes great epic tale of boss, just like he says he would.&quot;</string>
<string name="87956">&quot;But Deekin not gets great adventure he hopes for. World is so big and Deekin is so small. Maybe next time Deekin start with village and works up to Waterdeep from there?&quot;</string>
<string name="87957">&quot;Deekin not knows much about drow. Does boss knows about drow?&quot;</string>
<string name="87958">&quot;Uh, Deekin gots question about drow. Maybe boss knows answer?&quot;</string>
<string name="87959">&quot;Oh. Okay. It not so important, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="87960">&quot;Ummm... most surface creature that be underground for long time and not gets sunshine, they gets all pale and whites. Deekin&apos;s tribe sometimes take slaves and they all gets like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="87961">&quot;Deekin hear that drow be from surface once. How come they not be all whites and pale? How come they gots black skin?&quot;</string>
<string name="87962">&quot;And why they gots white hair? Somebody scares them real bad, once? It all very strange to little Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="87963">&quot;Maybe you is right boss. Deekin always think they shoulds be grey, then, like dwarves and gnomes... but Deekin not knows a lot about these things. It is strange.&quot;</string>
<string name="87964">&quot;Oooo... Deekin writes that down! Thanks, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="87965">&quot;But... some &lt;race&gt; folks is evil...&quot;</string>
<string name="87966">&quot;Oh. Deekin not realizes that be a rule, exactly... thanks, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87967">&quot;Deekin sees one once. But old master eats him really quickly. He says drow be extra, extra tasty.&quot;</string>
<string name="87968">&quot;Yup. Old boss says dark meat be best.&quot;</string>
<string name="87969">&quot;Oh? Deekin not realize that be important.&quot;</string>
<string name="87970">&quot;Ummm... yeah. Of course Deekin knows that! Gosh... what you thinks of Deekin, boss? Ha ha...&quot;</string>
<string name="87971">&quot;Do you thinks Deekin should change name, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="87972">&quot;Really? Not even if Deekin changes name to Deekin the Greatest Kobold Ever, maybe? Could boss calls Deekin that?&quot;</string>
<string name="87973">&quot;Oh. Okay. Sorry, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87974">&quot;Awww. Deekin would call you the Greatest Boss Ever. If you asks Deekin to.&quot;</string>
<string name="87975">&quot;Ha ha! Boss be so funny!&quot;</string>
<string name="87976">&quot;Deekin was thinking he need better name, maybe. To go on Deekin&apos;s book.&quot;</string>
<string name="87977">&quot;But what should Deekin change it to? Something macho, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="87978">&quot;Deekin likes the boss&apos; name... but it probably not be very appropriate for little Deekin. And you probably not thrilled if Deekin do that...&quot;</string>
<string name="87979">&quot;Ummm... it not exactly roll off tongue. Maybe Deekin names himself Donald?&quot;</string>
<string name="87980">&quot;Really? Deekin not so sure. &apos;Donald Scalesinger&apos;... hmmm. Deekin sleeps on it, maybe...&quot;</string>
<string name="87981">&quot;Okay. Deekin think on it some more, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87982">&quot;Deekin reads it on scroll somewhere. Hmmm. Maybe Deekin thinks on it a bit more...&quot;</string>
<string name="87983">&quot;You thinks so? Okay. Maybe Deekin just worries too much. Thanks boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="87984">&quot;Oh, it just sound so... so... Deekin. People who picks up book, they scrunches up nose and says Deekin&apos;s name out loud like they think chicken writes book, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="87985">&quot;Hmph. Ha ha. Boss is so very funny. Deekin ask you later when you not feels like giant comedian.&quot;</string>
<string name="87986">&quot;Deekin wonder sometimes... does you ever miss old dwarf? What his name? Master Drogan?&quot;</string>
<string name="87987">&quot;Oh. Deekin just wonders. Deekin misses old master sometimes.&quot;</string>
<string name="87988">&quot;Yes, that what Deekin want. Deekin got everything he want, in the end.&quot;</string>
<string name="87989">&quot;Not all the times. Some of the times old master treat Deekin nice, and he teaches Deekin everything Deekin knows. That why Deekin serve old master so long... Deekin owe him.&quot;</string>
<string name="87990">&quot;No. Deekin not want to go back to ice caves... there be nothing there for Deekin, anyway. And Deekin not want to risk becoming slave again.&quot;</string>
<string name="87991">&quot;Sometimes Deekin just wants to go and tells tale to someone who know Deekin then, so they sees Deekin as Deekin is now. So Deekin share what Deekin has become.&quot;</string>
<string name="87992">&quot;Deekin think old master would be happy for Deekin. Does... does boss think Master Drogan would be happy with boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="87993">&quot;Oh. Sorry, boss. Deekin be quiet, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="87994">&quot;Deekin thinks so. Yes, Deekin quite sure that Master Drogan woulds be happy with boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="87995">&quot;No? Oh. Deekin finds that very sad, somehow. Oh, well.&quot;</string>
<string name="87996">&quot;How we divides treasure we finds? You keeps it all? Deekin gets some, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="87997">&quot;So... you wants Deekin to call dibs?&quot;</string>
<string name="87998">&quot;Oh. So Deekin is now just hireling. Deekin understand.&quot; Deekin takes out his notebook and, hiding it from you, furiously scribbles several notes.</string>
<string name="87999">&quot;Well... Deekin hears that adventurers always works out who gets dibs. Deekin *could* just calls dibs whenever we finds treasure.&quot;</string>
<string name="88000">Deekin smiles broadly, showing rows of sharp teeth. &quot;You so good to little Deekin, boss! Dibs it is!&quot;</string>
<string name="88001">&quot;But... Deekin wants to be proper adventurer!&quot;</string>
<string name="88002">&quot;Mmmm. So says the boss who carries all the gold. Deekin gets it.&quot; He takes out his notebook and, hiding it from you, scribbles some notes furiously.</string>
<string name="88003">&quot;Deekin not thinks of it quite that way. You are so good to little Deekin, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="88004">&quot;So just because Deekin be kobold he not be proper adventurer? You hurt Deekin&apos;s feelings, boss. Deekin remembers that when it come time to right dedication on epic book!&quot;</string>
<string name="88005">--------- Random Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="88006">&quot;Ummm... Deekin guesses this all be over soon, right? We almost be out of here?&quot;</string>
<string name="88007">&quot;And then what? We fights the bad guy?&quot;</string>
<string name="88008">&quot;Well... Deekin just want to tells you, boss... Deekin gots full confidence that you goings to win. You is the greatest hero ever.&quot;</string>
<string name="88009">&quot;Oh, Deekin would never forgets that! Onto the end of the adventure! Woo hoo!&quot;</string>
<string name="88010">&quot;Heh... is nice of you to say, boss. Onto the end of the adventure! Woo hoo!&quot;</string>
<string name="88011">&quot;Onto the end of the adventure! Woo hoo!&quot;</string>
<string name="88012">&quot;What you calls this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="88013">&quot;And who is Reaper? Or maybe Deekin should ask *what* is Reaper?&quot;</string>
<string name="88014">&quot;Okays, Deekin just writes... ummm... &apos;strange, scary place with creepy ghost that boss knows&apos;. That work good.&quot;</string>
<string name="88015">&quot;Deekin need background for epic tale. Deekin never be here before, remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="88016">&quot;And you finds rock in Shadow Plane? And rock brings you here?&quot;</string>
<string name="88017">&quot;And Reaper sends you wherever you wants to go?&quot;</string>
<string name="88018">Deekin scratches his chin thoughtfully and then finally takes out his book and scribbles several notes in it. &quot;Okay, boss. Deekin just needs to check. You goes on, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="88019">&quot;Deekin wants to know what boss says, first, before he talks to something named Reaper.&quot;</string>
<string name="88020">&quot;Deekin be pretty sure we has up and gone to the Hells.&quot;</string>
<string name="88021">&quot;Oh. Ummm... sorry, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88022">&quot;Ummm... there not goings to be many nice people here, Deekin thinks.&quot;</string>
<string name="88023">&quot;You is thinking of the Abyss, maybe, boss. That be completely different place.&quot;</string>
<string name="88024">&quot;All the, ummm, dead people? And demons. Or is these devils? Deekin always gets that mixed up.&quot;</string>
<string name="88025">&quot;Deekin thinks he remember legend about lost city. He reads book with old master, once, long time ago.&quot;</string>
<string name="88026">&quot;Okay, then, boss. Deekin keeps it to himself.&quot;</string>
<string name="88027">&quot;Well... this be part of avariel city. Avariel be winged elves, or so book say. Deekin never sees any elf that gots wings since he leaves caves, so maybe book not tells truth.&quot;</string>
<string name="88028">&quot;Avariel city be high up in mountains, and everybody happy. Then one day - POOF! - everything disappear. Nobody know where, but legend say they go to darkest depths... which be here?&quot; </string>
<string name="88029">&quot;Aye-aye, boss! Let the adventure continue!&quot;</string>
<string name="88030">&quot;Deekin always love fact you is so ready to adventure, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="88031">&quot;It looks just like picture.&quot;</string>
<string name="88032">&quot;Umm... maybe there be a curse. Or a wizard. Or a queen. Or maybe that be a different story. Deekin can&apos;t quite remembers. Deekin just remember one day - POOF! - everything disappear.&quot;</string>
<string name="88033">&quot;Ummm... nope. Story not say. It just say one day - POOF!. It not say one day - POOF! because...&quot;</string>
<string name="88034">&quot;Deekin not knows. Legend not mention where city gets sent, exactly, just that it go from mountain heights to darkest depths. Deekin thought that story just be guessing.&quot;</string>
<string name="88035">&quot;You thinks tentacle-heads be able to read Deekin&apos;s thoughts, too?&quot;</string>
<string name="88036">&quot;You knows Deekin too well, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88037">&quot;That... makes Deekin feel oddly comforted, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88038">&quot;That is such a nice thing you says about Deekin, boss. You is so good to little Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="88039">&quot;Oo! You going to gives them heck, boss? Deekin looks at them and thinks they might go nice with tartar, maybe, but maybe you not thinks same thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="88040">&quot;Deekin gots a bad feeling about this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="88041">&quot;Okay, boss. Deekin just says it silently, though...&quot;</string>
<string name="88042">&quot;And who protects the boss? Like Deekin says: he gots ba-aaaad feeling about this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="88043">&quot;What is wrong? Look around, boss? We is going inside Evil Fortress of DOOM!! That is *never* good.&quot;</string>
<string name="88044">&quot;Well, Deekin means it. He gots ba-aaaaad feeling. Maybe it be the giant fortress of DOOM we is walking into, he not sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="88045">&quot;This village... these all be surface people. What they doing here in Underdark, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="88046">&quot;It is just... Deekin not sees anyone in village who not from surface. And who not dresses in ragsy clothes. Maybe they all be poor?&quot;</string>
<string name="88047">Deekin looks again carefully. &quot;All of them, boss? Deekin not sees any people who is not from surface. And not dressed in ragsy clothes.&quot;</string>
<string name="88048">&quot;If they be slaves, maybe, then who they be slaves to?&quot;</string>
<string name="88049">&quot;You are right, boss! Let the adventure continue!!&quot;</string>
<string name="88050">&quot;Okay, boss. Deekin just worried... he pictures Deekin in chains and ragsy clothes and not likes that picture so much.&quot;</string>
<string name="88051">&quot;How you thinks floating eyeballs makes tunnels? They blasts with eye-rays, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="88052">&quot;Oh. It just occurs to Deekin to wonder. Just ignore Deekin, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88053">&quot;Slaves? You thinks maybe they gots kobold slaves?&quot;</string>
<string name="88054">&quot;Ummm... okay. Point taken, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88055">&quot;That... not give good image to Deekin, boss. Bad boss! Bad, bad boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="88056">&quot;Hmm. Maybe they gots pretty female kobold slave that Deekin coulds rescue. That gives Deekin idea for good story...&quot;</string>
<string name="88057">&quot;Deekin wishes he gots eye-ray that makes stuff disappear. Monster come at boss: ZZAPP!! Deekin&apos;s room get dirty: ZZAPP!! Publisher smiles too much: ZZAPP!!&quot;</string>
<string name="88058">&quot;Oh. Deekin just... stand over here, then...&quot;</string>
<string name="88059">&quot;He changes title on Deekin and treats Deekin like silly kobold. ZZAPP!! Yeah, you takes that! You hears Deekin! ZZAPP!!&quot;</string>
<string name="88060">&quot;Deekin sees sarcastic boss: ZZAPP!!&quot;</string>
<string name="88061">&quot;Ruins be... strange place. Some different race lives in ruins before eyeballs, maybe, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="88062">&quot;No. Deekin not recognize ruins at all. Deekin think it look drow, maybe, but then again Deekin be no expert on drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="88063">&quot;Deekin just... feel strange. Magic feels dead here, boss. Deekin not likes this at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="88064">&quot;Deekin do his best, boss. Without magic, though... that not exactly inspires Deekin with confidence.&quot;</string>
<string name="88065">&quot;Deekin not know, really. It sound strange, but maybe there be artifact around that take magic away? That not natural thing, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="88066">&quot;Okay, boss. Without magic, though... Deekin feels queasy about that...&quot;</string>
<string name="88067">&quot;Deekin not knows much about golems. They be puts together by wizards, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="88068">&quot;So... is they alive, like Deekin? Do they gots to eats and sleeps and dreams and stuff? Do they wants things?&quot;</string>
<string name="88069">Deekin nods, considering your words. &quot;Deekin thinks you is right, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="88070">&quot;It just seem to Deekin that if golems can thinks and feels and stuff that it be really sad they be down here since maker go away. Maybe they be stuck. Maybe they is angry.&quot;</string>
<string name="88071">&quot;If Deekin was golem and dwarves keep coming down and taking golem parts, Deekin would be angry. Bored, mostly, but angry too.&quot;</string>
<string name="88072">&quot;You be turned to stone once, boss. That not be same thing, maybe? How you feel when you be stone?&quot;</string>
<string name="88073">&quot;Deekin think it not be pleasant. Not be anything, maybe, to be stone is to feels nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="88074">&quot;Maybe that what it like to be stone. Or maybe to be golem is to be shut off and on, to exists and not exists. Maybe stone golem think about same thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="88075">&quot;Oh. It just stuff Deekin thinks about. Just ignore little Deekin, boss. Let us get back to adventuring!&quot;</string>
<string name="88076">&quot;Ooo, coulds we? That be great idea, boss!&quot;</string>
<string name="88077">&quot;Aww, that nicest thing boss says to little Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88078">&quot;That true. Though maybe it be fun to be made of wood... or gold, maybe! Then Deekin be worth lots!&quot;</string>
<string name="88079">&quot;Happy? If maker be gone, how you gots purpose? Deekin not wants to be thing that is made but gots no purpose. That not sounds happy to Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88080">&quot;Deekin realizes that there be water underground... even deep, deep caves where old boss lived gots lots of water...&quot;</string>
<string name="88081">&quot;But if drow gots ships... you thinks that be ship, maybe? If drow gots ships, that means that there be whole *sea* here! Maybe whole *ocean*!&quot;</string>
<string name="88082">&quot;Okay, boss. If you thinks we going to be on ship, soon, all Deekin asks is you warns him first...&quot;</string>
<string name="88083">&quot;Deekin not travels on ship, yet. Ummmm... it not looks very safe...&quot;</string>
<string name="88084">&quot;They not gots whole ocean underground, does they? How big cave would you needs?&quot;</string>
<string name="88085">&quot;Ummm... how you fits whole ocean underground? How big cave would you needs?&quot;</string>
<string name="88086">&quot;How you knows that, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="88087">&quot;Oh. Deekin wishes he was as smart as the boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88088">&quot;Deekin remember reading in books that there whole races that lives underwater in Underdark. Fish mens with big lips and giant squids with brains that blows up your head!&quot;</string>
<string name="88089">&quot;And how they sails without stars and winds and stuff? Deekin not travels on any ship, yet, even back on surface. It not looks very safe...&quot;</string>
<string name="88090">&quot;Well that make Deekin feel better. Though Deekin&apos;s stomach still frightened. You just makes sure you tells Deekin first if we plans to go on ship, okay?&quot;</string>
<string name="88091">&quot;Hmmm. Maybe you is right, boss. Deekin not thinks about it that way. Deekin&apos;s stomach not so sure it agrees, though...&quot;</string>
<string name="88092">&quot;Ummm... okay, Deekin takes your word for it, boss. If Deekin gets his brain exploded by giant squid, though, he be very unhappy.&quot;</string>
<string name="88093">&quot;That not makes Deekin feel better, boss. If you goings to puts us on ship, just makes sure you warns Deekin first, okay?&quot;</string>
<string name="88094">&quot;Ummm... we is really in Underdark. We is really, *really* in Underdark!&quot;</string>
<string name="88095">Deekin stops and looks at you incredulously. &quot;You wants a way out, boss? But why?&quot;</string>
<string name="88096">&quot;You not be happy?&quot; Deekin&apos;s tone is incredulous, and he stares at you as if you have suddenly turned into a green ape. &quot;Why you be not happy?&quot;</string>
<string name="88097">&quot;This be wonderful!&quot; Deekin runs around on the spot, waving his hands in the air excitedly. &quot;Deekin read *so* much about Underdark, now Deekin actually be *here*!&quot;</string>
<string name="88098">&quot;This be so good for Deekin&apos;s book! &apos;Epic hero goes to the deadly Underdark&apos;! Sequel be greatest book ever!&quot;</string>
<string name="88099">&quot;Right, boss! Let the epic adventure continue!&quot;</string>
<string name="88100">&quot;Deekin travels all over when he leaves boss last time. What he really want to do, however, is go to Underdark! Even name is cool: Underdark! Gives Deekin little shiver. But Deekin too small to go, it too dangerous.&quot;</string>
<string name="88101">&quot;Is not just Deekin&apos;s book, it is book of great, epic hero, too! You wants book to be good, don&apos;t you, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="88102">&quot;You wants coin, boss? Deekin not earns much coin. Maybe publisher gots coin, Deekin not really know. All Deekin know is that lots of people read story. That make Deekin happy.&quot;</string>
<string name="88103">&quot;Scared? Deekin want so bad to travel to Underdark earlier, during journeys, except he knows he just ends up slave to tentacle-heads or fed to drow spider, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="88104">&quot;But now... now Deekin be in the Underdark with the great, epic hero! Deekin gets to travel Underdark while solving urgent mission of doo-oooom!&quot;</string>
<string name="88105">&quot;That be really, really cool, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88106">&quot;Oh... no no! Don&apos;t leave Deekin now! Not until he sees the Underdark! Please, please, great hero!! Have mercy!!&quot;</string>
<string name="88107">&quot;Oh, Deekin is right. You come around to Deekin&apos;s way of thinking soon, boss. This be greatest adventure! You see!&quot;</string>
<string name="88108">&quot;Exactly! Yaaay for the boss! This be so much fun, Deekin just knows it!&quot;</string>
<string name="88109">&quot;Well, maybe it because you not pays much attention, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88110">&quot;You sees that doorway? Deekin thinks we needs to get through that to go any further.&quot;</string>
<string name="88111">Deekin thinks about it for a moment and then points at the ground. &quot;Down.&quot;</string>
<string name="88112">&quot;It just is that Deekin remembers this doorway being mentioned in book Deekin reads. There be, ummm... four? Four chains? Four chains that bind the door to this plane.&quot;</string>
<string name="88113">&quot;Every time door be used, chains disappear to places they is held, and you needs to gets them again to open door. Door gots long name, but Deekin forgets it now.&quot;</string>
<string name="88114">&quot;Right-o, boss! Let the adventure continue!&quot;</string>
<string name="88115">&quot;Yeah, Deekin knows what you means, boss. Halaster must really gots puzzle fixation.&quot;</string>
<string name="88116">&quot;Books say it changes, but always Undermountain be very big, very deep. We could go for weeks and weeks and still not sees end of it. But you not gets any deeper unless you finds chains first, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88117">&quot;Deekin not knows. Book never says. Deekin thinks maybe it be different each time.&quot;</string>
<string name="88118">Deekin looks around the chamber with a wide-eyed expression of awe. &quot;Deekin... Deekin knows what this place be called. It be, ummm, Hall of Sleeping Kings.&quot;</string>
<string name="88119">&quot;Oh, sorry boss. Deekin just tries to help out.&quot;</string>
<string name="88120">&quot;Ummm... okay, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88121">&quot;Deekin thinks you gots to be careful not to upset nobody. Maybe if you pay good respect it be okay, Deekin not sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="88122">Deekin steals a wary glance at the skeletons about the room before continuing. &quot;Deekin read long time ago that bodies of ancient human kings rest in Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="88123">&quot;They be great kings and queens and sorcerers, all from northern lands that existed before other lands that have also been forgotten. That means they is very old, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88124">&quot;They wons great wars against enemies who not even exists any more. And here they is given place of honor by Halaster. Here they sleeps.&quot;</string>
<string name="88125">&quot;Right, boss! Let the adventure continue!&quot;</string>
<string name="88126">&quot;You is welcome, boss. Always glad to helps out.&quot;</string>
<string name="88127">&quot;It not be so different if there be lots of magic. You knows that, boss. Dead humans gets up and attacks just as quick as live humans. Sometimes quicker.&quot;</string>
<string name="88128">Deekin shrugs. &quot;Deekin not knows. Maybe. Deekin doubts it be so easy to takes from them. Maybe that just wakes them up.&quot;</string>
<string name="88129">&quot;Ummm... Deekin read about this place once. It be called the Hall of Mirrors, if Deekin remembers right... which he might nots...&quot;</string>
<string name="88130">Deekin cringes away. &quot;Oh. Sorry, boss... Deekin just tries to help...&quot;</string>
<string name="88131">Deekin nods, but seems quite fearful. &quot;Okay, boss...&quot;</string>
<string name="88132">Deekin scratches his head and thinks for a moment. &quot;When Deekin reads about it, Hall of Mirrors be nearer to entrance maybe. Some people who goes not far into Undermountain sees it before.&quot;</string>
<string name="88133">&quot;Big mage Halaster moves it, maybe? Deekin not knows. But you needs to be careful if you looks into mirrors... some of them does strange things, like they pulls you in or copies you. Bad stuff.&quot;</string>
<string name="88134">&quot;You is so good to little Deekin, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88135">&quot;Aye-aye, boss! The adventure continues!&quot;</string>
<string name="88136">&quot;Then Deekin thinks you should be okays. Though Deekin kind of thinks that be very boring...&quot;</string>
<string name="88137">Deekin shrugs. &quot;Deekin thinks so. There might be mirror here that not likes that much, though. It be lots of bad luck, anyway, no?&quot;</string>
<string name="88138">Deekin scratches his chin thoughtfully. &quot;There be magic mirror which makes copy of someone who looks inside. Evil copy, kind of, that attacks you. Deekin seems to remember that one of these mirrors is one of those.&quot;</string>
<string name="88139">&quot;You knows... like there be world on other sides of mirror which is all backwards? Or maybe that be another story Deekin reads...&quot;</string>
<string name="88140">Deekin cautiously looks around before continuing. &quot;You, ummm... you knows we is in Undermountain now, don&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="88141">The kobold cringes away from you a little, obviously uncertain. &quot;Well, ummm... you knows what that means, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="88142">Deekin dances from foot to foot, nervous. &quot;Once you gets into Undermountain it means you not able to gets back out easy. Magic not work to takes you anywhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="88143">&quot;Oh? Boss knows about that already? Deekin should have known. Sorry, boss... Deekin just be nervous. Deekin reads lots about Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="88144">&quot;Ummm... if you climbs rope, yup.&quot;</string>
<string name="88145">Deekin thinks for a moment and shrugs. &quot;Deekin not knows for sure. Maybe boss&apos; relic be more powerful. But stories all agree on same stuff, like teleports not works here.&quot;</string>
<string name="88146">&quot;Deekin reads lots of stories about Undermountain. They all says same stuff, like teleports not works here.&quot;</string>
<string name="88147">Deekin shuffles a bit in place, seeming to get agitated just from standing still. &quot;So, ummm... back to the adventure, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="88148">&quot;Sure thing, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88149">&quot;And so the saga continues!&quot;</string>
<string name="88150">Deekin nods enthusiastically. &quot;Deekin glad to hears it, boss! So, ummm... back to the adventure?&quot;</string>
<string name="88151">&quot;Back when Deekin work hard to amuse old boss, Deekin reads lots of books. Old boss likes to hear stories about Undermountain, so Deekin reads about those whenever Deekin finds them.&quot;</string>
<string name="88152">&quot;Lots of it be just stories, maybe, but Deekin think lots of it be truth, too. Old boss had books which nobody else gots, so maybe Deekin knows things that nobody else knows.&quot;</string>
<string name="88153">&quot;Some things Deekin knows, Deekin rather not knows. Like fact that wizard Halaster... human who builds all this... he be really crazy and wants to kill everybody who comes in. That makes Deekin nervous.&quot;</string>
<string name="88154">Deekin grins toothily. &quot;Oh, Deekin knows *that*. Deekin worried more about boss than about Deekin. So, ummm... back to the adventure, boss?&quot;</string>
<string name="88155">Deekin seems pleased by your response. &quot;That be very true, boss. You is really smart. So, ummm... back to the adventure?&quot;</string>
<string name="88156">Deekin seems unconvinced. &quot;Wizards gots ways of living long time. Especially crazy ones, Deekin thinks.&quot;</string>
<string name="88157">&quot;Ye-essss, but that not all it mean, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="88158">&quot;Oh. Boss really had no idea?&quot;</string>
<string name="88159">Deekin stares at you for a long moment, and then blinks several times. &quot;Deekin hears of Rashaman. Is that what peoples do there?&quot;</string>
<string name="88160">&quot;Oh.&quot; Disconcerted, Deekin takes out his tome and makes several notes in it, eyes wide. He then looks up at you again. &quot;Well... we is in Undermountain now, boss. You knows what that means?&quot;</string>
<string name="88161">&quot;Okay. Deekin just worried that boss gets mad at Deekin, that all.&quot;</string>
<string name="88162">&quot;Ummm... can Deekin expect to be raised lots, too, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="88163">Deekin sidles up next to you and looks up at you pitifully. &quot;So... you wants Deekin to comes along with you again, boss? That why you raises Deekin, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="88164">&quot;Yay! Onwards and forwards!&quot;</string>
<string name="88165">&quot;You wants Deekin... to stay here? Ummm... okay. Deekin do that. But Deekin gets lonely quick, you know...&quot;</string>
<string name="88166">&quot;Deekin just gets all excited! Deekin always think that boss be right behind him! Oh, well... Deekin tries to do better.&quot;</string>
<string name="88167">&quot;Deekin not knows. He thought maybe there be more &apos;Wheeee!&apos; and less &apos;Aiieeeee!&apos; on this adventure, is all.&quot;</string>
<string name="88168">Deekin nods thoughtfully. &quot;Ummm... okay. Deekin thinks hard about how to solves that.&quot;</string>
<string name="88169">&quot;Oh. That good to know. Deekin was beginning to get worried.&quot;</string>
<string name="88170">------- This line must be placed at the end of inter-party banter ---------</string>
<string name="88171">&quot;Ummm... is you really dead, elven lady? You not looks really dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="88172">&quot;I am really dead, yes. Is that truly what you wished to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="88173">&quot;Ummm... not really. Deekin wonders how you be so good all of the time? Is it really hard?&quot;</string>
<string name="88174">&quot;Whatever do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="88175">&quot;Deekin try to be like you. He try to think only nice thoughts and even be holy... but then Deekin thinks of something funny and he laughs lots and it be too hard.&quot;</string>
<string name="88176">&quot;To be pure of heart does not mean you must be humorless.&quot;</string>
<string name="88177">&quot;But... you not laughs ever. You is always sad.&quot;</string>
<string name="88178">&quot;I... but that does not mean anything, little one. That only means... that I am sad.&quot;</string>
<string name="88179">&quot;You is sad? Why you be so sad? There be something Deekin can do to make you not sad?&quot;</string>
<string name="88180">&quot;N-no... no, little one. There&apos;s nothing you can do for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88181">&quot;Ummm... not really. Deekin wonders how you be so evil? Is it really hard?&quot;</string>
<string name="88182">&quot;Whatever do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="88183">&quot;Deekin looks in mirror and tries to be like you. He bares teeth and growls and goes &apos;Grrr! Grrr! Deekin be evil!&apos; But he never be as scary as you.&quot;</string>
<string name="88184">&quot;I assume that is a compliment.&quot;</string>
<string name="88185">&quot;Just when Deekin thinks he be close to being evil, suddenly he think of something funny and he laughs lots and it be too hard.&quot;</string>
<string name="88186">&quot;To be evil does not mean you must be humorless, kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="88187">&quot;Valen... Deekin just want you to know that he thinks you is really good fighter.&quot;</string>
<string name="88188">&quot;I&apos;m so happy you noticed.&quot;</string>
<string name="88189">&quot;How you learns to fight like that?&quot;</string>
<string name="88190">&quot;The hard way. One death at a time.&quot;</string>
<string name="88191">&quot;Ohhhh. Deekin was thinkings of asking for pointers... but maybe that not such a good idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="88192">&quot;Why not? You perish much more, kobold, and I&apos;ll begin to suspect you&apos;re copying my methods.&quot;</string>
<string name="88193">&quot;Deekin knows sarcasm when he hears it, you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="88194">&quot;Perhaps you&apos;ll use that same keen sense to detect a proper musical note, sometime.&quot;</string>
<string name="88195">&quot;Deekin is going to stop talkings to you now.&quot;</string>
<string name="88196">&quot;Generous to a fault. You&apos;re a breed apart, kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="88197">&quot;Why is it you gots horns? Is you part goat?&quot;</string>
<string name="88198">&quot;In a manner of speaking. I am part demon... a tiefling, if you&apos;ve ever heard of such a thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="88199">&quot;Demons makes babies?&quot;</string>
<string name="88200">&quot;When they wish to. Are you always so blunt with your questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="88201">&quot;Deekin can be very innocent when he tries. That be part of his charm.&quot;</string>
<string name="88202">&quot;Well, I have a weapon that can crush a man&apos;s skull into pulp before he even realizes he is dead. I&apos;ve made corpses whose jaws still wag as they try to speak. That&apos;s part of *my* charm.&quot;</string>
<string name="88203">&quot;Deekin once have old master who eat bad mushrooms and passes gas so bad it kill entire cave full of kobolds. Deekin stick head in water bucket, only reason he alive today.&quot;</string>
<string name="88204">&quot;I&apos;ve cut my way through a hundred men, breathing in their own gore, and felt the slash of a hundred blades against my skin yet never died.&quot;</string>
<string name="88205">&quot;Old Master roll over on top of Deekin once while he sleeping. Old Master be real heavy.&quot;</string>
<string name="88206">&quot;Not much fazes you, does it?&quot;</string>
<string name="88207">&quot;Nope, not much.&quot;</string>
<string name="88208">&quot;So Deekin hears that you never sees sun before.&quot;</string>
<string name="88209">&quot;I have not yet been to the surface lands. That is correct.&quot;</string>
<string name="88210">&quot;Is you nervous at all? The sun be very bright. Deekin remember when he first sees it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88211">&quot;I... have tried to imagine it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88212">&quot;You never imagines it. It be so bright, it bores into your skull. And the sky be all open above you, you be sure you going to fall up and up and up into big blacknesss --&quot;</string>
<string name="88213">&quot;Silence!&quot;</string>
<string name="88214">&quot;You not looks so good.&quot;</string>
<string name="88215">&quot;It... is a passing thing. Perhaps you feel the need to bother &lt;FirstName&gt; a bit longer, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="88216">&quot;Nope. Deekin is fine here.&quot;</string>
<string name="88217">&quot;Joy.&quot;</string>
<string name="88218">&quot;Why is it that Deekin never hears you when you walks, drow lady?&quot;</string>
<string name="88219">&quot;It... is a skill that has been imprinted upon my heart. To make sounds when I walk was death when I was a Red Sister.&quot;</string>
<string name="88220">&quot;You had to learns to be real quiet?&quot;</string>
<string name="88221">&quot;Indeed. Or my tutor would have slain me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88222">&quot;He kills you if you not learns it properly?&quot;</string>
<string name="88223">&quot;No. *She* had no eyes. And if she ever heard something moving within her hearing she would lash out with poisoned darts. And she never missed. That made it imperative to move silently.&quot;</string>
<string name="88224">&quot;You coulds just move faster, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="88225">Nathyrra smirks. &quot;Aye. You could simply move faster, as well. But so could she.&quot;</string>
<string name="88226">&quot;You pays lots to go to this school?&quot;</string>
<string name="88227">&quot;It was not a school. The Red Sisters are an order of assassins that I trained with.&quot;</string>
<string name="88228">&quot;You gots lots of friends who becomes Red Sisters with you?&quot;</string>
<string name="88229">&quot;You mean of my class? No. After the training, it is the last survivor of a class who graduates and becomes a full Red Sister.&quot;</string>
<string name="88230">&quot;Ummm... Deekin not sure he think that kind of education is a good idea...&quot;</string>
<string name="88231">&quot;But it is... thorough.&quot;</string>
<string name="88232">&quot;Ummmmm... heh heh. Did Deekin ever tells Sharwyn lady that she is so very pretty?&quot;</string>
<string name="88233">&quot;No, Deekin never has. By the way you&apos;ve been staring at me, however, I kind of figured that&apos;s what you had in mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="88234">&quot;What you means?&quot;</string>
<string name="88235">&quot;You needn&apos;t be coy, my little lizard friend. Between one bard to another, I know what such glances mean.&quot;</string>
<string name="88236">&quot;Deekin was lookings at Sharwyn&apos;s hair.&quot;</string>
<string name="88237">&quot;Really, I&apos;m flattered, but you must know it just isn&apos;t... what?&quot;</string>
<string name="88238">&quot;Deekin was lookings at Sharwyn&apos;s hair. Is very pretty, but there be different color near Sharwyn&apos;s head. That be normal? Deekin not sees that before.&quot;</string>
<string name="88239">&quot;Of... of course it&apos;s normal! Look... I&apos;ll give you twenty gold not to mention that to anyone else.&quot;</string>
<string name="88240">&quot;Thirty.&quot;</string>
<string name="88241">&quot;Fine, thirty. Now stop talking.&quot;</string>
<string name="88242">&quot;Ummm... Deekin gots question for Sharwyn. Did you writes book called &apos;Neverwinter Nights&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="88243">&quot;I did, indeed, my little man. And I assume you were the scribe behind &apos;Shadows of Undrentide&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="88244">&quot;You reads Deekin&apos;s book? Deekin so excited! Did you likes it?&quot;</string>
<string name="88245">&quot;Well... it started out well enough. But the second chapter seemed a bit... rushed...&quot;</string>
<string name="88246">&quot;Deekin was running lots.&quot;</string>
<string name="88247">&quot;There were other problems, too. I&apos;d be happy to list them for you sometime, if you&apos;re of a mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="88248">&quot;Deekin would likes that! Deekin can tells you what was wrongs with &apos;Neverwinter Nights&apos;, then, too!&quot;</string>
<string name="88249">&quot;What are you talking about? There was nothing wrong with my book.&quot;</string>
<string name="88250">&quot;Is you joking?&quot;</string>
<string name="88251">&quot;Oh, shush, you.&quot; Sharwyn turns away. &quot;Critic.&quot;</string>
<string name="88252">&quot;So does they gots kobolds where you comes from, Daelan?&quot;</string>
<string name="88253">&quot;Near my tribe? Yes, they do. I have crushed many kobolds in my day, as have the other warriors of my tribe.&quot;</string>
<string name="88254">&quot;Ohhhh. That not be good.&quot;</string>
<string name="88255">&quot;Not at all, Deekin. You are nothing like those wicked fiends I battled as a youth. You have something they will never possess.&quot;</string>
<string name="88256">&quot;A good pair of shoes?&quot;</string>
<string name="88257">&quot;Honor. That is the true mark of difference that divides the beasts from the civilized men.&quot;</string>
<string name="88258">&quot;You thinks Deekin gots honor?&quot;</string>
<string name="88259">&quot;I think you strive for honor, little one, whether you know that is the path you are on or not. To strive for honor is to achieve it, and that makes you worthy of respect.&quot;</string>
<string name="88260">&quot;No kobold ever be worthy of respect before.&quot;</string>
<string name="88261">&quot;You need not be the last, Deekin. Maybe it is your destiny to be an emissary. Have you ever thought of that?&quot;</string>
<string name="88262">&quot;You makes Deekin thinks lots.&quot;</string>
<string name="88263">&quot;I certainly hope so.&quot;</string>
<string name="88264">&quot;So... Deekin is wonderings something. You is part orc?&quot;</string>
<string name="88265">&quot;Yes, that is true.&quot;</string>
<string name="88266">&quot;Deekin sees lots of orcs before. You looks a little likes them, maybe, but not whole lots.&quot;</string>
<string name="88267">&quot;I am also partly human. The product of violence against my tribe. Surely you have heard of such couplings, kobold... your kind raids as much as the orcs ever have.&quot;</string>
<string name="88268">&quot;Kobolds not do such things. Deekin not think kobolds able to do such things.&quot;</string>
<string name="88269">&quot;Perhaps your kind is simply too different from the other humanoid races.&quot;</string>
<string name="88270">&quot;Old Master says that kobolds gots dragon blood! Though, ummm, he not exactly says that in a happy way...&quot;</string>
<string name="88271">&quot;Dragon blood is strong. You should be proud of that. Draw strength and courage from it, little one.&quot;</string>
<string name="88272">&quot;You is kind of neat. Deekin likes you. Maybe he pencils you into the boss&apos; epic story as sidekick.&quot;</string>
<string name="88273">&quot;I would be honored.&quot;</string>
<string name="88274">&quot;Ahem! Ummm... Deekin writes a poem for you, nice elven lady...&quot;</string>
<string name="88275">&quot;Oh? Ha ha ha! You can call me Linu, Deekin. It&apos;s quite alright.&quot;</string>
<string name="88276">&quot;Oh, no... Deekin coulds never do that!&quot;</string>
<string name="88277">&quot;Suit yourself, dear. Do I get the honor of hearing your poem?&quot;</string>
<string name="88278">&quot;Okay! Holds on... how it goes again? Oh! Deekin remembers now!&quot;</string>
<string name="88279">&quot;There once be elf lady so pretty and sweet,
such pretty red hairs and two big left feet,
in combat she fumbles,
while walking she stumbles,
it be so cute you thinks she be neat!&quot;</string>
<string name="88280">&quot;Err... and this is complimentary?&quot;</string>
<string name="88281">&quot;Deekin thinks you is the greatest!&quot;</string>
<string name="88282">&quot;I see. Err... thank you. Perhaps I&apos;ll... walk closer to &lt;FirstName&gt;. Excuse me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88283">&quot;Can Deekin asks pretty elven lady somethings?&quot;</string>
<string name="88284">&quot;My, aren&apos;t you the sweetest thing? You can ask me whatever you like, dear.&quot;</string>
<string name="88285">&quot;Okay. Deekin wants to know why you is so clumsy? Deekin sees lots of elves and they not be so clumsy like you.&quot;</string>
<string name="88286">&quot;Well, I... I wouldn&apos;t say I was *clumsy*, exactly...&quot;</string>
<string name="88287">&quot;No, you is really clumsy. Deekin sees you getting stuff out of pack before, and you ends up almost knocking boss unconscious.&quot;</string>
<string name="88288">&quot;Yes, well... I did apologize for that...&quot;</string>
<string name="88289">Linu sighs, not entirely pleased. &quot;I... let&apos;s just say that everyone has their area of speciality, alright?&quot;</string>
<string name="88290">&quot;So you is especially clumsy?&quot;</string>
<string name="88291">&quot;How about you go back to singing that lovely doom song again, my little friend? That was so much more entertaining.&quot;</string>
<string name="88292">&quot;Okay. Deekin be glad you likes it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88293">&quot;But she say Deekin could asks! Deekin just be curious.&quot;</string>
<string name="88294">Linu glares at you with a mixture of mortification and exasperation. &quot;I *said* I was sorry! The pan was so wedged in there...&quot;</string>
<string name="88295">&quot;Deekin thinks it was funny. Boss gets really weird look. But, ummmm... you not answers question.&quot;</string>
<string name="88296">&quot;Boss! Deekin not likes how Tomi is lookings at him!&quot;</string>
<string name="88297">&quot;I wasn&apos;t looking at ya any which how, ya overgrown lizard!&quot;</string>
<string name="88298">&quot;Deekin says you is, you... you scale-less kobold!&quot;</string>
<string name="88299">&quot;Scale-less kobold? Are you joshing me? Is that the best you can do?&quot;</string>
<string name="88300">&quot;Deekin not wants to insults you lots. That not be very nice of Deekin...&quot;</string>
<string name="88301">&quot;That&apos;s sort of the whole bleedin&apos; point! You need to shake your fist and really threaten someone. Come on, now...&quot;</string>
<string name="88302">&quot;You mean like this? Grrr!!&quot;</string>
<string name="88303">&quot;There ya go! Now say &apos;You are a pink-skinned, smelly little sewer rodent!&apos;&quot;</string>
<string name="88304">&quot;You is a pink-skinned smelly little sewer rodent!&quot;</string>
<string name="88305">&quot;Not bad, not bad. You&apos;ve really got to work on that, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="88306">&quot;Deekin feel all funny. He wants to go slaps something, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="88307">&quot;Where did Deekin&apos;s money pouch go? Deekin hads money pouch, and now it be gone. It falls off, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="88308">&quot;Now there&apos;s no need ta look at me with them beady little eyes o&apos; yours, kobold! Just &apos;cause I&apos;m a thief doesn&apos;t mean I steal.&quot;</string>
<string name="88309">&quot;Ummm... Deekin not looks at you likes anything...&quot;</string>
<string name="88310">&quot;Oh, yes you did! I saw them accusing little eyes! Do you know who I am? Tomi Undergallows, that&apos;s who! And you... you&apos;re just a kobold!&quot;</string>
<string name="88311">&quot;But Deekin not *says* anything! There only be few coins in pouch, maybe...&quot;</string>
<string name="88312">&quot;Oh, I see. Now it&apos;s the guilt trip, is it? Alright. Fine. Here, take it. Take your bloody money pouch! Are you happy now?&quot;</string>
<string name="88313">&quot;You gots Deekin&apos;s money pouch! Yay! Tomi, you is the greatest!&quot;</string>

<string name="88450">&quot;We&apos;re done chatting.&quot;</string>
<string name="88451">&quot;No, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="88452">&quot;I&apos;m just wondering how everything is going with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="88453">&quot;I wish to discuss your training.&quot;</string>
<string name="88454">&quot;I want you to do whatever you like, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88455">&quot;Continue with what you&apos;re doing now.&quot;</string>
<string name="88456">&quot;Concentrate on becoming a dragon disciple.&quot;</string>
<string name="88457">&quot;I want you to focus on being a bard.&quot;</string>
<string name="88458">&quot;I&apos;m wondering... what do you plan to do once this adventure is done?&quot;</string>
<string name="88459">&quot;Yes, after that.&quot;</string>
<string name="88460">&quot;Yes, yes, after the book.&quot;</string>
<string name="88461">&quot;You damn well better get a better price.&quot;</string>
<string name="88462">&quot;You think you will?&quot;</string>
<string name="88463">&quot;Why would you go back there?&quot;</string>
<string name="88464">&quot;Don&apos;t you want to stay with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="88465">&quot;That seems like a very odd thing to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="88466">&quot;You want your tribe to live in civilized lands? Why?&quot;</string>
<string name="88467">&quot;Whatever works for you. Just keep the crazy to yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="88468">&quot;Well... let&apos;s concentrate on finishing this adventure, first.&quot;</string>
<string name="88469">&quot;If there&apos;s anything I can do to help...&quot;</string>
<string name="88470">&quot;I think that&apos;s a noble goal.&quot;</string>
<string name="88471">&quot;Do you think you can really make them change?&quot;</string>
<string name="88472">&quot;How about a good tale?&quot;</string>
<string name="88473">&quot;Are you saying we&apos;re doomed?&quot;</string>
<string name="88474">&quot;You did? When was this?&quot;</string>
<string name="88475">&quot;Why didn&apos;t you normally do that?&quot;</string>
<string name="88476">&quot;Sounds like you got lucky.&quot;</string>
<string name="88477">&quot;What happened next?&quot;</string>
<string name="88478">&quot;And you ended up leaving?&quot;</string>
<string name="88479">&quot;I&apos;m flattered, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88480">&quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="88481">&quot;You missed me? Awww, Deekin...&quot;</string>
<string name="88482">&quot;You couldn&apos;t protect her?&quot;</string>
<string name="88483">&quot;I&apos;m so sorry, Deekin. That&apos;s horrible.&quot;</string>
<string name="88484">&quot;What was she doing outside?&quot;</string>
<string name="88485">&quot;This isn&apos;t like the time you met a dragon, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="88486">&quot;Go ahead, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="88487">&quot;You forgot your lute?&quot;</string>
<string name="88488">&quot;A drow elf? In Waterdeep? Are you sure?&quot;</string>
<string name="88489">&quot;Sounds like a drow all right.&quot;</string>
<string name="88490">&quot;I&apos;ve heard that scream.&quot;</string>
<string name="88491">&quot;He let you go?&quot;</string>
<string name="88492">&quot;Did he tell you his name?&quot;</string>
<string name="88493">&quot;Drippits? That doesn&apos;t sound like much of a drow name.&quot;</string>
<string name="88494">&quot;Really? What kind of dragon?&quot;</string>
<string name="88495">&quot;Inside Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="88496">&quot;How do you know that?&quot;</string>
<string name="88497">&quot;He went to Hilltop to eat pie?&quot;</string>
<string name="88498">&quot;What about the Gold dragon? What did he want?&quot;</string>
<string name="88499">&quot;So that&apos;s your story about meeting another dragon?&quot;</string>
<string name="88500">&quot;Err... I can&apos;t help but notice that you&apos;ve grown wings...&quot;</string>
<string name="88501">&quot;Can you fly with them?&quot;</string>
<string name="88502">&quot;A kobold with wings. How interesting.&quot;</string>
<string name="88503">&quot;You were hoping for something different?&quot;</string>
<string name="88504">&quot;You don&apos;t like it?&quot;</string>
<string name="88505">&quot;*That&apos;s* your complaint?&quot;</string>
<string name="88506">&quot;Be thankful for what you have.&quot;</string>
<string name="88507">&quot;But red is much cooler than white.&quot;</string>
<string name="88508">&quot;You seem a bit different from when I first met you.&quot;</string>
<string name="88509">&quot;Strange how?&quot;</string>
<string name="88510">&quot;You damn well better not mean it, kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="88511">&quot;Just make sure you control these urges, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88512">&quot;Errr... yeah...&quot;</string>
<string name="88513">&quot;If it makes you stronger, I&apos;m all for it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88514">&quot;I&apos;m glad you&apos;re enjoying your progress.&quot;</string>
<string name="88515">&quot;The boss wouldn&apos;t want that, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="88516">&quot;Talk to me about what?&quot;</string>
<string name="88517">&quot;You could certainly afford to be stronger...&quot;</string>
<string name="88518">&quot;It does seem a *bit* strange.&quot;</string>
<string name="88519">&quot;Not really. Where do you think it could lead?&quot;</string>
<string name="88520">&quot;Go ahead and become a dragon disciple, if you can.&quot;</string>
<string name="88521">&quot;I could really use a bard, actually.&quot;</string>
<string name="88522">&quot;I can&apos;t tell you what to do, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88523">&quot;What happened to you after we parted ways last time?&quot;</string>
<string name="88524">&quot;Why didn&apos;t you get very far?&quot;</string>
<string name="88525">&quot;You could have come looking for me, you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="88526">&quot;I had a copy of your book, actually.&quot;</string>
<string name="88527">&quot;How much coin are we talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="88528">&quot;Some of that should have been mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="88529">&quot;You should have demanded more.&quot;</string>
<string name="88530">&quot;Hmph. If you weren&apos;t such an idiot, that wouldn&apos;t have happened.&quot;</string>
<string name="88531">&quot;You let them walk all over you?&quot;</string>
<string name="88532">&quot;What were you expecting? You&apos;re a kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="88533">&quot;I don&apos;t know what to say. That&apos;s horrible.&quot;</string>
<string name="88534">&quot;Alright, whatever. Let&apos;s just move on, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="88535">&quot;I have complete faith in you, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88536">&quot;Well, good luck with that.&quot;</string>
<string name="88537">&quot;I think you&apos;re charming enough, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88538">&quot;So you&apos;re going to give up?&quot;</string>
<string name="88539">&quot;So why didn&apos;t you kick some butt? You&apos;re no weakling.&quot;</string>
<string name="88540">&quot;Do *you* think you&apos;re weak?&quot;</string>
<string name="88541">&quot;&apos;Little Deekin&apos; fights by my side against powerful monsters.&quot;</string>
<string name="88542">&quot;You&apos;re a powerful bard by any standard, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88543">&quot;It sounds like you had a difficult time.&quot;</string>
<string name="88544">&quot;That&apos;s it? I remember the book being quite successful.&quot;</string>
<string name="88545">&quot;That&apos;s not so bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="88546">&quot;Do you know anything about Halaster?&quot;</string>
<string name="88547">&quot;I&apos;ll ask you about it later, perhaps.&quot;</string>
<string name="88548">&quot;Tell me what you know about him, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="88549">&quot;Go on.&quot;</string>
<string name="88550">&quot;What happened since then? Do you know?&quot;</string>
<string name="88551">&quot;How was Waterdeep able to grow over top of Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="88552">&quot;So all these monsters were originally in Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="88553">&quot;Undermountain doesn&apos;t look like a dwarven mine, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="88554">&quot;What had happened to all the dwarves?&quot;</string>
<string name="88555">&quot;Why did he disappear into the mines?&quot;</string>
<string name="88556">&quot;Just how long ago was this, anyway?&quot;</string>
<string name="88557">&quot;There&apos;s a tower? Is it still in Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="88558">&quot;Are his apprentices still alive?&quot;</string>
<string name="88559">&quot;Well, I hope you learned a lesson.&quot;</string>
<string name="88560">&quot;Good enough. You&apos;re forgiven... for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="88561">&quot;Forget it! I&apos;m through with you!&quot;</string>
<string name="88562">&quot;Not good enough!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Reprimand him some more.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="88563">&quot;No, not yet. Stay here.&quot;</string>
<string name="88564">&quot;Yes, come along.&quot;</string>
<string name="88565">&quot;Not right now, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88566">&quot;Yes, Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="88567">&quot;We&apos;re not friends, kobold. Keep it straight.&quot;</string>
<string name="88568">&quot;Really? I think of you as more of a henchman.&quot;</string>
<string name="88569">&quot;Awww... that&apos;s very sweet of you to say, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88570">&quot;Great. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="88571">&quot;You&apos;ve earned your place beside me, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88572">&quot;Who else is going to write my tale?&quot;</string>
<string name="88573">&quot;Of course. You&apos;ve been very amusing.&quot;</string>
<string name="88574">&quot;You do know how powerful you are now, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="88575">&quot;I think of you as a great friend, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="88576">&quot;No, go ahead... what did you want to say?&quot;</string>
<string name="88577">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;It&apos;s okay, Deekin. You can tell me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88578">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Come on, Deekin. Talk to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88579">&quot;Oh. Errr... sure, go ahead...&quot;</string>
<string name="88580">&quot;Alright then.&quot;</string>
<string name="88581">&quot;You must have some ideas of your own.&quot;</string>
<string name="88582">&quot;Why are you asking me?&quot;</string>
<string name="88583">&quot;No, I really don&apos;t care.&quot;</string>
<string name="88584">&quot;Won&apos;t your publisher just change the name on you again?&quot;</string>
<string name="88585">&quot;How about &apos;the Adventures of &lt;FullName&gt;&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="88586">&quot;Call it anything but &apos;Hordes of the Underdark&apos;.&quot;</string>
<string name="88587">&quot;Call it &apos;Hordes of the Underdark&apos;, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="88588">&quot;Finished.&quot;</string>
<string name="88589">&quot;Yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="88590">&quot;I really don&apos;t care about that.&quot;</string>
<string name="88591">&quot;You can&apos;t describe me yourself?&quot;</string>
<string name="88592">&quot;You think I&apos;m vain?&quot;</string>
<string name="88593">&quot;You think I&apos;m sensitive?&quot;</string>
<string name="88594">&quot;I really wish you wouldn&apos;t put me in your book.&quot;</string>
<string name="88595">&quot;Write what you want, and leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="88596">&quot;How are you describing me now?&quot;</string>
<string name="88597">&quot;Describe me however you think best, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88598">&quot;More along that vein would work, I think.&quot;</string>
<string name="88599">&quot;You don&apos;t need to compliment me. Just tell the truth.&quot;</string>
<string name="88600">&quot;That sounds fine to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88601">&quot;Of course I remember Tymofarrar. Last I heard he was still as blase as ever.&quot;</string>
<string name="88602">&quot;Not that I recall.&quot;</string>
<string name="88603">&quot;He talked about you with affection... sort of...&quot;</string>
<string name="88604">&quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="88605">&quot;No, but it would be nice if you did.&quot;</string>
<string name="88606">&quot;He said you have dragon blood? Was he joking?&quot;</string>
<string name="88607">&quot;Maybe the potential is there. You never know.&quot;</string>
<string name="88608">&quot;Yes, I&apos;ve noticed.&quot;</string>
<string name="88609">&quot;I really don&apos;t remember.&quot;</string>
<string name="88610">&quot;I&apos;m sorry Deekin. He never did.&quot;</string>
<string name="88611">&quot;No, he didn&apos;t, so get over it already.&quot;</string>
<string name="88612">&quot;That was a long time ago, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88613">&quot;Are you wondering about something specific?&quot;</string>
<string name="88614">&quot;Tymofarrar? Of course. I remember killing him, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="88615">&quot;Err... the white dragon? Not really... it&apos;s been a long time.&quot;</string>
<string name="88616">&quot;You don&apos;t like Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="88617">&quot;And?&quot;</string>
<string name="88618">&quot;Big deal. Keep the sob story to yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="88619">&quot;You&apos;re complaining because they were rude?&quot;</string>
<string name="88620">&quot;Life isn&apos;t like that, little fella.&quot;</string>
<string name="88621">&quot;I&apos;m sorry things didn&apos;t work out, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88622">&quot;I don&apos;t treat you nice.&quot;</string>
<string name="88623">&quot;And that&apos;s the saddest thing I&apos;ve heard all day.&quot;</string>
<string name="88624">&quot;You blackmailed me, you little creep.&quot;</string>
<string name="88625">&quot;I suppose I did.&quot;</string>
<string name="88626">&quot;Good idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="88627">&quot;I think that probably would have happened anywhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="88628">&quot;What were you expecting, Deekin? You&apos;re a kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="88629">&quot;No, not that much.&quot;</string>
<string name="88630">&quot;A fair amount, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="88631">&quot;Not now, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88632">&quot;Ask away.&quot;</string>
<string name="88633">&quot;I don&apos;t really know.&quot;</string>
<string name="88634">&quot;If they were surface creatures once, Deekin, they aren&apos;t anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="88635">&quot;Maybe because they&apos;re a lot like the shadows they live in.&quot;</string>
<string name="88636">&quot;Because they&apos;re evil. All black things are evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="88637">&quot;The evil &lt;race&gt; folk have to wear black. Black hat or robe, preferably.&quot;</string>
<string name="88638">&quot;You lived in caves and you never saw a drow?&quot;</string>
<string name="88639">&quot;Extra tasty? Really?&quot;</string>
<string name="88640">&quot;Ugh... I didn&apos;t need to know that...&quot;</string>
<string name="88641">&quot;Quite a bit. I am an elf, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="88642">&quot;You do know that a drow is a type of elf, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="88643">&quot;I really don&apos;t care.&quot;</string>
<string name="88644">&quot;Enough. This is a dumb topic.&quot;</string>
<string name="88645">&quot;Not on your life.&quot;</string>
<string name="88646">&quot;Yes. Change it to Deekin Diesalot.&quot;</string>
<string name="88647">&quot;You want to change your name?&quot;</string>
<string name="88648">&quot;That&apos;s the dumbest idea I&apos;ve ever heard.&quot;</string>
<string name="88649">&quot;That&apos;s a good idea. Change your name.&quot;</string>
<string name="88650">&quot;Think about it. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll come up with something.&quot;</string>
<string name="88651">&quot;Err... &lt;FirstName&gt; the kobold?&quot;</string>
<string name="88652">&quot;Donald? Sounds great.&quot;</string>
<string name="88653">&quot;No. Don&apos;t do that, Deekin. Please.&quot;</string>
<string name="88654">&quot;What kind of name is that?&quot;</string>
<string name="88655">&quot;Don&apos;t you have any favorite names, Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="88656">&quot;Maybe something a little less cute?&quot;</string>
<string name="88657">&quot;Yes, macho. Like &apos;the Deekinator&apos;.&quot;</string>
<string name="88658">&quot;I think Deekin is a fine name.&quot;</string>
<string name="88659">&quot;What&apos;s wrong with your current name?&quot;</string>
<string name="88660">&quot;A chicken did write the book.&quot;</string>
<string name="88661">&quot;Who? Oh... my mentor. No, not at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="88662">&quot;Are you joking? He was an old fool, no more.&quot;</string>
<string name="88663">&quot;Drogan sacrificed himself nobly. I will always cherish his memory.&quot;</string>
<string name="88664">&quot;My old mentor? Perhaps a little, sometimes.&quot;</string>
<string name="88665">&quot;That&apos;s nice. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="88666">&quot;But you have a whole life of adventure now. Isn&apos;t that what you wanted?&quot;</string>
<string name="88667">&quot;But Tymofarrar treated you terribly.&quot;</string>
<string name="88668">&quot;Have you never been back?&quot;</string>
<string name="88669">&quot;That&apos;s a stupid question.&quot;</string>
<string name="88670">&quot;Undoubtedly not.&quot;</string>
<string name="88671">&quot;I hope so.&quot;</string>
<string name="88672">&quot;I couldn&apos;t care less.&quot;</string>
<string name="88673">&quot;You want treasure, do you?&quot;</string>
<string name="88674">&quot;If you want something we find, let me know.&quot;</string>
<string name="88675">&quot;You&apos;ll get what I give you, no more.&quot;</string>
<string name="88676">&quot;What? You don&apos;t trust me to give you a fair share?&quot;</string>
<string name="88677">&quot;Fine, fine. Call dibs.&quot;</string>
<string name="88678">&quot;Dibs? No I don&apos;t think that would work.&quot;</string>
<string name="88679">&quot;You&apos;re my scribe and sometimes you&apos;re handy... at best.&quot;</string>
<string name="88680">&quot;You already are an adventurer, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88681">&quot;We are friends, Deekin. That&apos;s better than being an adventurer.&quot;</string>
<string name="88682">&quot;You are a *kobold*, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88683">&quot;Looks that way, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="88684">&quot;I guess there&apos;s no escaping that.&quot;</string>
<string name="88685">&quot;Right. Just remember to write it all down.&quot;</string>
<string name="88686">&quot;We&apos;re a team, Deekin, remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="88687">&quot;Thanks, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88688">&quot;The Reaper has always referred to it as his realm, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="88689">&quot;Keep your questions to yourself, kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="88690">&quot;Why are you so interested?&quot;</string>
<string name="88691">&quot;I don&apos;t know what the Reaper is, Deekin. A demon, perhaps? He just is.&quot;</string>
<string name="88692">&quot;That&apos;s right.&quot;</string>
<string name="88693">&quot;Enough questions, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88694">&quot;I have to pay his price, first, but basically yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="88695">&quot;Er... usually. There&apos;s some explanation to how this works, but I don&apos;t know much about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88696">&quot;This place is a nexus, or so the Reaper says. I&apos;m not sure I understand it all.&quot;</string>
<string name="88697">&quot;The Reaper says his realm is a nexus. It connects to many places, but not all.&quot;</string>
<string name="88698">&quot;Why don&apos;t you ask him yourself?&quot;</string>
<string name="88699">&quot;Silence, kobold. I&apos;m not in the mood.&quot;</string>
<string name="88700">&quot;Unless you can think of some way out of here, shut it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88701">&quot;Is there anything about this place you can tell me?&quot;</string>
<string name="88702">&quot;Seems a bit... cold to be one of the Hells, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="88703">&quot;What was your first clue?&quot;</string>
<string name="88704">&quot;I know all I need to.&quot;</string>
<string name="88705">&quot;Tell me what you know, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="88706">&quot;Alright, enough chatter about legends.&quot;</string>
<string name="88707">&quot;Well, let&apos;s keep going and see for ourselves, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="88708">&quot;There&apos;s no way to know this is the place you&apos;re talking about, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88709">&quot;Anything else interesting about the tale you recall?&quot;</string>
<string name="88710">&quot;Do you know why the city vanished?&quot;</string>
<string name="88711">&quot;Why send the city here?&quot;</string>
<string name="88712">&quot;Worried they&apos;ll steal your book, eh?&quot;</string>
<string name="88713">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s nothing in there for them to get excited about.&quot;</string>
<string name="88714">&quot;I think your thoughts may be a bit beyond their comprehension, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88715">&quot;Not if they&apos;re lucky.&quot;</string>
<string name="88716">&quot;Silence, kobold!&quot;</string>
<string name="88717">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, Deekin. I&apos;ll protect you.&quot;</string>
<string name="88718">&quot;Why? What&apos;s wrong?&quot;</string>
<string name="88719">&quot;You always say that, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88720">&quot;How should I know?&quot;</string>
<string name="88721">&quot;Why don&apos;t we ask them?&quot;</string>
<string name="88722">&quot;Or they&apos;re slaves of some kind.&quot;</string>
<string name="88723">&quot;They are probably slaves or servants, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88724">&quot;Let&apos;s find out.&quot;</string>
<string name="88725">&quot;Enough with all these questions! It&apos;s time to act.&quot;</string>
<string name="88726">&quot;Something we haven&apos;t seen yet, perhaps.&quot;</string>
<string name="88727">&quot;That&apos;s a stupid question.&quot;</string>
<string name="88728">&quot;They might keep slaves to work on it, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="88729">&quot;They could always have one more if you keep blathering.&quot;</string>
<string name="88730">&quot;No, I&apos;m sure they just eat the kobolds.&quot;</string>
<string name="88731">&quot;Why not? We&apos;ve seen plenty of surface races down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="88732">&quot;Sounds like a reasonable idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="88733">&quot;Keep up that silliness and *you&apos;ll* disappear.&quot;</string>
<string name="88734">&quot;Don&apos;t care for your publisher, I see?&quot;</string>
<string name="88735">&quot;I guess we can all be glad you don&apos;t actually have one, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="88736">&quot;Can you tell anything about them?&quot;</string>
<string name="88737">&quot;We may find evidence of them if we look around.&quot;</string>
<string name="88738">&quot;Just pull yourself together.&quot;</string>
<string name="88739">&quot;How would a dead magic zone come to be, you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="88740">&quot;It shouldn&apos;t be that much of a problem. We&apos;ll be fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="88741">&quot;That may very well be.&quot;</string>
<string name="88742">&quot;So I hear.&quot;</string>
<string name="88743">&quot;What makes you ask that?&quot;</string>
<string name="88744">&quot;Why not? Anything is possible.&quot;</string>
<string name="88745">&quot;I truly doubt it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88746">&quot;I don&apos;t know. Perhaps.&quot;</string>
<string name="88747">&quot;I agree. That would be a terrible existence.&quot;</string>
<string name="88748">&quot;I really doubt that&apos;s how it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="88749">&quot;You were stone, yourself. You tell me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88750">&quot;I don&apos;t want to talk about that.&quot;</string>
<string name="88751">&quot;I didn&apos;t feel anything when I was stone.&quot;</string>
<string name="88752">&quot;Don&apos;t be so stupid.&quot;</string>
<string name="88753">&quot;I truly doubt it, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88754">&quot;Maybe. If we meet one, maybe we can ask it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88755">&quot;If a golem thinks as much as you, we should be very frightened.&quot;</string>
<string name="88756">&quot;It&apos;s a good thing you&apos;re not a golem, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="88757">&quot;We don&apos;t know for sure, Deekin. They might be happy, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="88758">&quot;But...?&quot;</string>
<string name="88759">&quot;I really don&apos;t want to hear about it, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88760">&quot;You&apos;re not afraid of water, are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="88761">&quot;I suppose you&apos;re right. I hadn&apos;t thought of it like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="88762">&quot;And so? What&apos;s wrong with that?&quot;</string>
<string name="88763">&quot;Enough, Deekin. I don&apos;t need to hear more of this prattle.&quot;</string>
<string name="88764">&quot;There&apos;s just as much water below the ground as above it, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88765">&quot;I know lots of things, Deekin. I&apos;m smart.&quot;</string>
<string name="88766">&quot;I, uh, don&apos;t think it works quite like that...&quot;</string>
<string name="88767">&quot;I&apos;ve never been on a ship, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="88768">&quot;Since when is an adventure supposed to be safe?&quot;</string>
<string name="88769">&quot;Don&apos;t be such a coward. It&apos;s perfectly safe.&quot;</string>
<string name="88770">&quot;Well, it&apos;s not safe, really.&quot;</string>
<string name="88771">&quot;You got me. I haven&apos;t a clue.&quot;</string>
<string name="88772">&quot;You&apos;re not going to get all scared now, are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="88773">&quot;So we are. Do you know a way out of here that they didn&apos;t mention?&quot;</string>
<string name="88774">&quot;I know. I&apos;m not very happy about that, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="88775">&quot;Just figured that out, did you?&quot;</string>
<string name="88776">&quot;Great. Wonderful. Let&apos;s move on, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="88777">&quot;Well, I&apos;m glad to know someone&apos;s keeping things in perspective.&quot;</string>
<string name="88778">&quot;Is that all you&apos;re concerned about? Your book?&quot;</string>
<string name="88779">&quot;And maybe I&apos;ll see some actual coin from *this* book...?&quot;</string>
<string name="88780">&quot;You mean you&apos;re not scared to be in the Underdark at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="88781">&quot;I should kill you now, rodent.&quot;</string>
<string name="88782">&quot;I suppose you&apos;re right.&quot;</string>
<string name="88783">&quot;Cool? We&apos;re going to be in constant danger?&quot;</string>
<string name="88784">&quot;Sometimes I just don&apos;t understand you at all, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88785">&quot;And where does that doorway go? Do you know?&quot;</string>
<string name="88786">&quot;That seems rather obvious, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="88787">&quot;And what makes you say that?&quot;</string>
<string name="88788">&quot;Alright, let&apos;s get moving.&quot;</string>
<string name="88789">&quot;Typical. More puzzle-work.&quot;</string>
<string name="88790">&quot;How much deeper does this dungeon go, anyway?&quot;</string>
<string name="88791">&quot;And where are these chains held?&quot;</string>
<string name="88792">&quot;Quiet, Deekin. Stay on watch.&quot;</string>
<string name="88793">&quot;Thanks for the travelogue. Let&apos;s continue.&quot;</string>
<string name="88794">&quot;Is it very dangerous?&quot;</string>
<string name="88795">&quot;Sleeping Kings?&quot;</string>
<string name="88796">&quot;Let&apos;s move on, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="88797">&quot;Alright, Deekin, thanks for the tip.&quot;</string>
<string name="88798">&quot;They sleep? Or they&apos;re dead?&quot;</string>
<string name="88799">&quot;They could have great treasure, then, is what you&apos;re saying.&quot;</string>
<string name="88800">&quot;Be silent. I&apos;ve no need of your anecdotes.&quot;</string>
<string name="88801">&quot;Yes, well, I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll find out more soon enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="88802">&quot;What do you know about it?&quot;</string>
<string name="88803">&quot;Thanks for the help, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88804">&quot;Alright. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="88805">&quot;What if I don&apos;t look in the mirrors?&quot;</string>
<string name="88806">&quot;Can the mirrors be broken?&quot;</string>
<string name="88807">&quot;Copies you?&quot;</string>
<string name="88808">&quot;Pulls you in?&quot;</string>
<string name="88809">&quot;Yes, of course. And?&quot;</string>
<string name="88810">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Glare at him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="88811">&quot;So I&apos;ve heard, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88812">&quot;I can still get back up to the inn, can&apos;t I?&quot;</string>
<string name="88813">&quot;Then that&apos;s all I need to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="88814">&quot;Do you know a lot about Undermountain, Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="88815">&quot;You&apos;re saying the Relic of the Reaper won&apos;t work?&quot;</string>
<string name="88816">&quot;Why do you say that?&quot;</string>
<string name="88817">&quot;Thanks for the tip.&quot;</string>
<string name="88818">&quot;Whatever.&quot;</string>
<string name="88819">&quot;Just make sure you tell me if you see anything else you recognize.&quot;</string>
<string name="88820">&quot;Yes, back to the adventure.&quot;</string>
<string name="88821">&quot;Well, I&apos;ll be careful.&quot;</string>
<string name="88822">&quot;You know a lot about Undermountain, do you?&quot;</string>
<string name="88823">&quot;Be watchful, then, and stay on guard.&quot;</string>
<string name="88824">&quot;We&apos;ll be careful, Deekin, don&apos;t worry.&quot;</string>
<string name="88825">&quot;You&apos;ve nothing to fear while you&apos;re with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88826">&quot;Things have obviously changed in Undermountain since those books were written, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88827">&quot;Maybe this Halaster isn&apos;t here anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="88828">&quot;It means my patience with you is less than it normally is, kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="88829">&quot;It means we&apos;re in a very dangerous place.&quot;</string>
<string name="88830">&quot;No, what does that mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="88831">&quot;Of course I knew that, you stupid kobold!&quot;</string>
<string name="88832">&quot;You&apos;re kidding. I had no idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="88833">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Glare at him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="88834">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Yes, of course I knew where we were going, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="88835">&quot;None whatsoever. I thought we were going to Rashaman to run naked in the fields.&quot;</string>
<string name="88836">&quot;That and eat kobold stew as a delicacy.&quot;</string>
<string name="88837">&quot;Never mind. I don&apos;t want to discuss it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88838">&quot;You came with me. Expect to die.&quot;</string>
<string name="88839">&quot;Right. Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="88840">&quot;No. Just stay here, for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="88841">&quot;Maybe you shouldn&apos;t go running off all the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="88842">&quot;You&apos;re a tiny kobold and a bard. What were you expecting?&quot;</string>
<string name="88843">&quot;You keep dying. That&apos;s the real problem.&quot;</string>
<string name="88844">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it, Deekin. You&apos;re doing fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="88845">&quot;He did ask a question, Linu.&quot;</string>
<string name="88846">&quot;Don&apos;t be so hard on her, Deekin. She does her best.&quot;</string>
<string name="88847">&quot;That hurt like hell, you know. Vicious assault with a frying pan.&quot;</string>
<string name="88848">&quot;It is wonderful to see you again, dear. Have you a need of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="88849">---------- Random Pop-Ups Start Here ------------</string>
<string name="88850">&quot;Oh, my friend, is this true? Are you you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="88851">&quot;Very well. Just do not abandon me here, dear. I couldn&apos;t bear the thought of waiting here alone!&quot;</string>
<string name="88852">&quot;Ah, well. I&apos;m sure I can find my own way back. Do not worry about me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88853">&quot;What would you have me do, dear?&quot;</string>
<string name="88854">&quot;I rarely see them, but very well.&quot;</string>
<string name="88855">&quot;If I can, certainly.&quot;</string>
<string name="88856">&quot;Then I shall speed up for you, dear.&quot;</string>
<string name="88857">&quot;Stealth is not my forte, but I will do my best.&quot;</string>
<string name="88858">&quot;Just leave it alone? As you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="88859">&quot;I will do what I can to assist.&quot;</string>
<string name="88860">&quot;Where should I be, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="88861">&quot;As you wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="88862">&quot;I am no warrior, but I will do what I must.&quot;</string>
<string name="88863">&quot;I&apos;ll try.&quot;</string>
<string name="88864">&quot;Oh, good. Let me put my things down for a moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="88865">&quot;I am no specialist in item lore, but I am not without some knowledge. I shall look through your pack and tell you what I can.&quot;</string>
<string name="88866">&quot;And what sort of spells do you need me to use, dear?&quot;</string>
<string name="88867">&quot;What would you like me to cast, dear?&quot;</string>
<string name="88868">&quot;If you are certain...&quot;</string>
<string name="88869">&quot;And what is my target?&quot;</string>
<string name="88870">&quot;Talk? What about?&quot;</string>
<string name="88871">&quot;Fair enough, though I am a bit tired of traveling... not to complain, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="88872">&quot;Shall we talk about something else?&quot;</string>
<string name="88873">&quot;I am fine, dear. Don&apos;t worry about me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88874">&quot;As good as can be expected. I am up for the challenge, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="88875">&quot;Oh, I&apos;m quite fine, dear. Thank you for asking.&quot;</string>
<string name="88876">&quot;I normally wouldn&apos;t complain... but this blindness effect I am under is quite disconcerting.&quot;</string>
<string name="88877">&quot;My wounds are light, for the moment. Nothing a simple spell or two wouldn&apos;t cure.&quot;</string>
<string name="88878">&quot;I am wounded quite badly, but I can still move onwards.&quot;</string>
<string name="88879">&quot;Not well.&quot; She winces. &quot;These wounds of mine are... considerable. But I&apos;m not dead yet, naturally.&quot;</string>
<string name="88880">&quot;I am poisoned. I hope I have a spell to deal with this promptly.&quot;</string>
<string name="88881">&quot;I... do not feel well. I believe I might very well have been afflicted with some form of disease.&quot;</string>
<string name="88882">She ponders the question for a long moment. &quot;I am not sure. I have considered perhaps going to Evermeet, but part of me believes that is simply not my destiny.&quot;</string>
<string name="88883">&quot;Perhaps I might return to Neverwinter. Or build a temple to Sehanine Moonbow somewhere in these northern wildlands. The reward that Waterdeep offers is substantial, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="88884">&quot;What about you, dear? Do you have any plans once this adventure is done?&quot;</string>
<string name="88885">She smiles. &quot;I&apos;m sure that is true. I hope you include charity amongst the good uses you mention... there is gold enough in the reward to ease the life of many who suffer.&quot;</string>
<string name="88886">Linu ponders for a moment. &quot;I think my time adventuring is done, after this. After waking up in that sarcophagus,&quot; she shudders,&quot; no... I don&apos;t want to go through that again.&quot;</string>
<string name="88887">&quot;Perhaps Sehanine sent you to me before something worse could happen, to show me the path I must take. Regardless, I am thankful that you rescued me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="88888">She chuckles. &quot;I&apos;m sure you will be rewarded all you deserve, my friend, and more. But come... let us move on. Waterdeep remains in need of our aid.&quot;</string>
<string name="88889">She smiles softly. &quot;Let us move on, then, friend. There is much to be done and Waterdeep remains in need of our aid.&quot;</string>
<string name="88890">&quot;*I* think it was something. But let us move on... there is much to do and Waterdeep remains in need.&quot;</string>
<string name="88891">&quot;Truly? I must admit, my thoughts were much along a similar vein.&quot;</string>
<string name="88892">She nods, smiling. &quot;I&apos;m sure that is the case. There is always another adventure on the horizon for those such as us, isn&apos;t there?&quot;</string>
<string name="88893">She blushes, looking away and smiling bashfully. &quot;I see. I... can&apos;t say I wouldn&apos;t mind getting to know you better, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You seem a fine man.&quot;</string>
<string name="88894">&quot;I come from Evereska originally, dear, but I spent a great deal of time in Neverwinter after I helped fight the plague there. Lord Nasher was very generous.&quot;</string>
<string name="88895">&quot;There was so much to rebuild, and the city needed its heroes... Lord Nasher was generous to those of us who stayed, yes. It felt good, for a time.&quot;</string>
<string name="88896">&quot;I should have returned to Evereska, but I simply could not. And after a time, I felt the need to move on and seek adventure elsewhere... and many of the others felt the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="88897">&quot;Only for a short time, though it was truly a privilege. Never have I ever seen someone grow in power so quickly.&quot;</string>
<string name="88898">She smiles broadly. &quot;&lt;He/She&gt; may as well have, for all the credit we others get. I don&apos;t mind, however. The Hero of Neverwinter deserves all that praise and more.&quot;</string>
<string name="88899">&quot;I understand Sharwyn wrote a book about the whole affair.&quot; She rolls her eyes, grinning. &quot;Silly and romantic and completely blown out of proportion. But such are bard&apos;s tales, correct?&quot;</string>
<string name="88900">&quot;To tell the truth, I don&apos;t know. Once &lt;he/she&gt; had returned from slaying Morag, there was some disagreement with Lord Nasher that I was not privy to. &lt;He/She&gt; left the city.&quot;</string>
<string name="88901">&quot;It was unworthy of Lord Nasher to treat the true hero of the day so poorly... but perhaps I should not judge, as I do not know what transpired between them. I assume that &lt;he/she&gt; adventures still.&quot;</string>
<string name="88902">&quot;Not as you might think... I was not one of the clerics who tried to keep the people of the city healthy. I joined Lady Aribeth in hunting down those responsible for the plot.&quot;</string>
<string name="88903">&quot;Fortunately we proved successful and the city was saved.&quot; Her eyes grow sad. &quot;It did not come without cost, however. I still pray for the Lady Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="88904">&quot;Of course. Enough about me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88905">&quot;She was a paladin of Tyr, you see... and she fell, giving in to anger and hate.&quot; Linu shrugs, then, wiping her eyes. &quot;In the end she died, the poor dear.&quot;</string>
<string name="88906">&quot;Be careful when you say such a thing, my dear. All of us get what we deserve... in the end.&quot;</string>
<string name="88907">&quot;It is. She was a good person, as was Fenthick.&quot; Anger clouds Linu&apos;s features for a moment. &quot;I suppose some things are simply... difficult to forgive.&quot;</string>
<string name="88908">&quot;If that is the way you feel, my dear, I&apos;ll not question you. I will pray to Sehanine to watch over you on your vital quest.&quot;</string>
<string name="88909">&quot;Then I shall endeavor to keep you whole once again, my dear. Just try, occasionally, to keep out of harm&apos;s way. Sometimes I think you are as bad as I am for getting in trouble.&quot;</string>
<string name="88910">&quot;I did not mean to trouble you. Another time, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="88911">She looks at you curiously for a long moment. &quot;What do you know of the drow, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="88912">She nods. &quot;Then I needn&apos;t prattle on about them. Let&apos;s continue on, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="88913">Her face grows serious. &quot;There was a time when the dark elves lived on the surface. Before the time of Man, however, they had already been driven underground.&quot;</string>
<string name="88914">&quot;The Underdark is not their natural home. It is a place where they cheated, battled with and stole from the other races such as the dwarves to carve themselves an Empire.&quot;</string>
<string name="88915">&quot;Their threat could be much more, but it is ever the destiny of the drow to war amongst themselves and keep themselves weak. Such is how Lolth, their goddess of spiders, prefers it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88916">&quot;Let us move on, then. Speaking of the drow has made me... nervous.&quot;</string>
<string name="88917">&quot;Yes, but to be frank this is no amazing feat. The evil races of the Underdark constantly war with one another, the drow are not special in this regard.&quot;</string>
<string name="88918">&quot;I find it odd that they seem to be working together. The idea of the drow unifying is one thing, but the idea of drow working beside duergar and mind flayer and beholder... that is something else entirely.&quot;</string>
<string name="88919">&quot;No, there is something going on within the Underdark that is entirely different from anything we&apos;ve heard about before. Something very big.&quot;</string>
<string name="88920">&quot;It doesn&apos;t seem likely. The drow are split into clans that are constantly at war in an effort to please Lolth, who wouldn&apos;t want them unified either. There is no incentive for them to unify.&quot;</string>
<string name="88921">&quot;The only way I could see such a thing happening is if one drow clan was to perhaps grow strong enough to dominate the others through force. Such a thing seems unlikely so long as Lolth is their queen, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="88922">&quot;She is one of a small drow pantheon, but by far she is the most powerful. Lolth is the queen of spiders and a being who believes only in suffering and pain and cruelty. She *is* the drow and they are her perfect children.&quot;</string>
<string name="88923">&quot;She is no kinder to her own people, I understand. Those who displease her are either killed outright or turned into drider... half-spider abominations. Otherwise her altars run red with the blood of the sacrifices she demands.&quot;</string>
<string name="88924">&quot;It keeps them strong... survival of the fittest, so to speak. Even as children the drow are,&quot; here her face twists into disgust, &quot;encouraged to slay their siblings to prove they are the strongest.&quot;</string>
<string name="88925">&quot;This means that most drow spend their entire lives trying to survive being killed and being forced to keep their wits sharp. This makes them formidable opponents and merciless killers.&quot;</string>
<string name="88926">&quot;I am not certain that they even can return, for my understanding is that bright light causes them great pain now, but if they did want to return to the surface it would be as conquerors.&quot;</string>
<string name="88927">&quot;The tales say that there are *some* drow who have returned to the surface to live in peace, however. These are followers of the goddess Eilistraee and outcasts from their own society.&quot;</string>
<string name="88928">&quot;The hero Drizzt is not a follower of Eilistraee, I believe, but an individual drow exile who lives upon the surface.&quot; She shrugs. &quot;There are exceptions to every race in Faerun, even the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="88929">&quot;True, but not all who are born elven know very much about their heritage. Would you like me to speak of them?&quot;</string>
<string name="88930">&quot;My people possess tales about Halaster Greycloak, the mage who constructed,&quot; she motions about her, &quot;all of this.&quot;</string>
<string name="88931">Linu shrugs. &quot;As you wish, dear. I was simply offering what I thought to be relevant.&quot;</string>
<string name="88932">&quot;Well, you must remember the Yawning Portal Inn where we started. Back before Waterdeep had been established, Halaster&apos;s tower was built on that spot.&quot;</string>
<string name="88933">&quot;He dug deeper and deeper into the ground, expanding down rather than up, until he broke into an ancient cavern that had belonged to the dwarven folk.&quot;</string>
<string name="88934">&quot;According to our legends these dwarves had been murdered by the drow, who yet remained in the caverns. Halaster was quick to claim the area and either kill or enslave the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="88935">&quot;They were the original owners.&quot; She looks around. &quot;Halaster has altered it to suit his purposes, and even expanded it further. Perhaps he went too far and broke into the Underdark?&quot;</string>
<string name="88936">She nods in response. &quot;You&apos;re quite welcome.&quot;</string>
<string name="88937">&quot;He is an archmage with a long life of experience.&quot; She shrugs. &quot;But he is also mad, so how does one judge true power in that respect? Certainly he can be defeated, as can anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="88938">&quot;The drow are powerful, possessing both mages and clerics who easily match the best of the other races. They are simply divided. If something were to unify them against Undermountain,&quot; her voice trails off, leaving the thought unfinished.</string>
<string name="88939">&quot;I don&apos;t really know whether Undermountain extends into the Underdark itself. Some of the stories say yes, some say no... it seems obvious that some kind of conflict began here, no?&quot;</string>
<string name="88940">&quot;The tales say that Halaster was notoriously paranoid about losing his power. He created clones and traps and puzzles... all in an effort to keep his enemies away from his magic. His enemies being everyone, of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="88941">Linu giggles. &quot;A fair bit older than most mages but maybe not so old as the great Elminster the Sage. Certainly old enough to impress an elf... he predates the city of Waterdeep, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="88942">--------- Random Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="88943">&quot;I do not like the transition, and would wish it on no-one else. Especially you, my dear. I shall have to struggle even harder to keep you from such a fate. Shall I join you again?&quot;</string>
<string name="88944">She nods. &quot;I shall try to breathe life back into you and your quest.&quot;</string>
<string name="88945">She nods, rubbing her arms again. &quot;As you wish, dear. Just... do not leave me here too long. I do not want to be alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="88946">------- This line must be placed at the end of inter-party banter ---------</string>
<string name="88947">&quot;What is it, Tomi? You&apos;ve been staring at me for quite some time, now, you may as well speak.&quot;</string>
<string name="88948">&quot;All right, then. I just got t&apos; wonderin&apos;... what does you gots against us rogue types?&quot;</string>
<string name="88949">&quot;You mean besides the fact that you&apos;re all a bunch of thieves and scoundrels without the slightest regard for morals or the well-being of your fellow man?&quot;</string>
<string name="88950">&quot;Aye, besides all o&apos; that rot. You gots something personal against us, the way ya goes on about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88951">She turns away from him, lifting her chin up. &quot;And why shouldn&apos;t it be personal? You add nothing to the community. On the contrary, you take and take and take from it until they CAN&apos;T STAND YOU BASTARDS ANY LONGER!&quot;</string>
<string name="88952">&quot;Mmmm... sounds like ye&apos;re referrin&apos; ta something specific.&quot;</string>
<string name="88953">&quot;I am not! Just because my father was a rotten thief like yourself has *nothing* to do with --&quot;</string>
<string name="88954">&quot;Yer daddy, eh? Aye, that explains it. All ye lasses are so bloody wrapped up in what yer daddies did or didn&apos;t do... it&apos;s bloody pathetic.&quot;</string>
<string name="88955">&quot;Just you wait, you rotten little guttersnipe. Sehanine will one day let me place such a curse on you that it will leave you naked and yowling in the streets and praying to all the gods for mercy that will never come!&quot;</string>
<string name="88956">&quot;Aye? Sounds like me last night on th&apos; town, that does.&quot;</string>
<string name="88957">&quot;Ahhhhrrrggh!&quot; Linu screams in frustration and stalks off.</string>
<string name="88958">&quot;Will you get away from me, you miserable little thief! I will not have you picking my pocket!&quot;</string>
<string name="88959">&quot;Oy! That&apos;s not nice of ya at all, saying such things to poor Tomi. An&apos; besides, I was just thinkin&apos; about something I heard about ya.&quot;</string>
<string name="88960">&quot;*You* heard something about *me*? I can&apos;t imagine what that might be.&quot;</string>
<string name="88961">&quot;Somethin&apos; about you startin&apos; a riot in the Bridge district back in Neverwinter. Was that you or not?&quot;</string>
<string name="88962">Linu steps back, looking abashed. &quot;Oh. Well... yes that was me, if it&apos;s the riot I&apos;m thinking about. How did you know I started that?&quot;</string>
<string name="88963">&quot;So ye *did* start it?&quot; He laughs heartily, slapping his knees. &quot;I can&apos;t bloody well believe it! Miss Dainty Knees started a riot, she did!&quot;</string>
<string name="88964">&quot;There&apos;s no need to get all excited about it. It was an accident. Really I was only in the Bridge district at all to buy a chicken for some soup I was making Lord Nasher.&quot;</string>
<string name="88965">&quot;Then the chicken got away from me and I had to chase it, and it ran in front of some horses that belonged to the guard... and they, ah, spooked.&quot;</string>
<string name="88966">&quot;The chicken spooked the horses?&quot;</string>
<string name="88967">&quot;Well, not quite. I dove for the chicken and got it, but knocked over a cart... that, ah, had held a sleeping cat. Which became quite agitated as it was dumped into the nearby fountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="88968">&quot;And *it* spooked the horses?&quot;</string>
<string name="88969">&quot;The dogs that ended up chasing the wet cat underneath the horses did the trick, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="88970">&quot;So them bloody horses ran amok and caused a bunch o&apos; damage... an&apos; that caused the riot?&quot;</string>
<string name="88971">&quot;Not... right away. I chased after the horses to get them back, and I caused some... damage... along the way...&quot;</string>
<string name="88972">Tomi holds up his hands. &quot;Aye, say no more. I think I see it now. Bloody hell! Yer a nightmare, ain&apos;t ya?!&quot;</string>
<string name="88973">&quot;I notice that you have been watching me for some time now, Daelan. Have you something to say to me?&quot;</string>
<string name="88974">He nods, looking abashed. &quot;I do, good elf. If I might be so bold, could you tell me why you walk as you do?&quot;</string>
<string name="88975">Linu blushes. &quot;How... how do I walk, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="88976">&quot;The elven folk are renowned even amongst my own people for their grace and beauty. You have all of their beauty, good elf... but why do you not possess their grace?&quot;</string>
<string name="88977">She looks away from Daelan, her blush increasing. &quot;I... have never had the grace you speak of, dear. It made me a target of mockery amongst my kind.&quot;</string>
<string name="88978">He nods sagely. &quot;And so I have stumbled upon an unhappy topic. Please forgive me. I merely meant to observe that you have considerable grace in those moments you are not thinking about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="88979">Linu seems genuinely surprised. &quot;Whatever do you mean? That&apos;s not true, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="88980">&quot;I believe it is. When you are lost in reverie or when you pray to your goddess... in those moments you have all the grace of your kin. Could it be your awkwardness is not physical in its origin?&quot;</string>
<string name="88981">Her voice is quiet. &quot;I had not thought about it quite like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="88982">&quot;We all believe ourselves inadequate in many ways, for our own reasons. Your fears and sadnesses I would not dream of betraying... if you wished to discuss them with a simple man such as me.&quot;</string>
<string name="88983">&quot;Th-thank you for the offer, dear. I just might do that... sometime.&quot;</string>
<string name="88984">&quot;Daelan... if I might ask, what exactly do the Uthgardt tribes believe in?&quot;</string>
<string name="88985">&quot;Do you ask about the beliefs of my people, Linu, or my own beliefs? If you wish to know what I believe in, you need only ask.&quot;</string>
<string name="88986">&quot;I... would never want to offend you, Daelan. I am only curious.&quot;</string>
<string name="88987">&quot;I would happily satisfy your curiosity, good elf. Your kindness is without equal... never would I believe that any question that came from you had its origin in malice.&quot;</string>
<string name="88988">&quot;That&apos;s... very kind of you, Daelan. As a matter of fact, I am a bit curious. You&apos;ve never mentioned any god that I can remember.&quot;</string>
<string name="88989">He smiles gently, looking down at her. &quot;And perhaps that is because I believe in none. The Uthgardt have a pantheon of ancient gods, but I stopped believing in them long ago.&quot;</string>
<string name="88990">&quot;May I ask why?&quot;</string>
<string name="88991">Daelan does not respond for a long moment, his brow troubled. &quot;Sometimes, in the darkest hours of a man&apos;s life, his faith can be broken. Faith is one of those things not easily repaired.&quot;</string>
<string name="88992">Linu lays a hand on his forearm. &quot;But it is not impossible, Daelan. There are things to believe in in this world... good things, worthy things.&quot;</string>
<string name="88993">Daelan pats her hand, his eyes sad. &quot;I believe in many things, good elf. I believe in compassion and honor and nobility. I do not believe in gods.&quot;</string>
<string name="88994">&quot;Some gods are worth believing in, Daelan.&quot;</string>
<string name="88995">&quot;From you I could believe that, good elf.&quot; He nods at her, smiling, gently removing her hand from his arm. &quot;Someday.&quot;</string>
<string name="88996">&quot;Is there something you wish to ask me, Sharwyn dear? You keep looking my way...&quot;</string>
<string name="88997">&quot;I do, but... I don&apos;t know, you might be embarrassed...&quot;</string>
<string name="88998">&quot;Go ahead and ask. By all means.&quot;</string>
<string name="88999">&quot;Well... I remember hearing that there was some incident involving you and Lord Nasher, that he was angry with you over something involving Sembia?&quot;</string>
<string name="89000">Linu suddenly blushes. &quot;Oh. That. Yes, well... it was my fault that the Sembian ambassador returned home. It was a complete accident, however!&quot;</string>
<string name="89001">Sharwyn grins. &quot;What happened?&quot;</string>
<string name="89002">Linu shrugs helplessly. &quot;The ambassador and I were dancing at a court function. I tripped and fell into a waiter, who spilled soup all over the ambassador.&quot;</string>
<string name="89003">&quot;That doesn&apos;t sound so bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="89004">&quot;Except that the soup was boiling hot. The poor man flailed about in pain and caught on fire when he stumbled into one of the braziers.&quot;</string>
<string name="89005">&quot;Ah...&quot;</string>
<string name="89006">&quot;I tried to put him out... or I thought I was... by pouring a nearby bucket of water on him. I had no idea the bucket was full of oil for the brazier...&quot;</string>
<string name="89007">Sharwyn holds up her hands. &quot;Say no more. I get the picture. You poor girl.&quot;</string>
<string name="89008">&quot;A question, Sharwyn. Do you... your mother is a seamstress in Neverwinter, correct? A proud woman named Delilah?&quot;</string>
<string name="89009">Obviously Sharwyn was not expecting such a question. She stiffens and regards Linu suspiciously. &quot;Yes. How could you know such a thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="89010">Linu gestures helplessly. &quot;I... met your mother. She had a sickness during the time of the plague, correct?&quot;</string>
<string name="89011">&quot;She didn&apos;t have the plague, itself. She had bonerot... and I was able to procure a potion for her that healed it. At great difficulty, I might add.&quot;</string>
<string name="89012">Linu nods, her expression unreadable. &quot;So she said. Do you and she... speak much?&quot;</string>
<string name="89013">&quot;No.&quot; Sharwyn&apos;s expression is harsh and she turns away from Linu for a moment. &quot;Not that it&apos;s any of your business, but no... we don&apos;t. I haven&apos;t seen her since I gave her the potion.&quot;</string>
<string name="89014">For a long moment Linu says nothing. Then, with a tone of dread, she finally speaks. &quot;There were... complications from that sickness. Your mother died, Sharwyn. I did what I could, but I... couldn&apos;t do much.&quot;</string>
<string name="89015">Sharwyn&apos;s voice is quiet. &quot;I see.&quot;</string>
<string name="89016">&quot;I didn&apos;t think you had been told. You&apos;d left Neverwinter, after all.&quot; Linu is obviously anguished. &quot;I thought you... would want to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="89017">Sharwyn nods slowly. &quot;Thank you, Linu.&quot; She thinks for a moment and then asks, &quot;Did she...?&quot;</string>
<string name="89018">&quot;There was little pain in the end. She died peacefully.&quot;</string>
<string name="89019">Sharwyn is silent and wipes suddenly moist eyes. &quot;That&apos;s good.&quot; She says nothing further.</string>
<string name="89020">&quot;Deekin... you mentioned before that you&apos;ve become, what was it? Some kind of disciple?&quot;</string>
<string name="89021">&quot;Deekin be a dragon disciple,&quot; he states proudly. &quot;He gots heart of dragon, just like Old Boss says he gots.&quot;</string>
<string name="89022">&quot;That&apos;s wonderful, dear. I certainly hope that doesn&apos;t make you become evil like most dragons are.&quot;</string>
<string name="89023">&quot;Evil? Old Boss not be evil. Old Boss just be in bad mood lots.&quot;</string>
<string name="89024">&quot;Mmmm... not according to what I&apos;ve heard. We are speaking of the white Tymofarrar, yes? Were you not... aware of the extent of your patron&apos;s schemes, Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="89025">He thinks about it for a moment, shuffling from foot to foot. &quot;Maybe Deekin knows a little. Maybe that be part of reason why Deekin wants to leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="89026">Linu smiles gently at him and pats his head. &quot;Just because our heroes sometimes disappoint us doesn&apos;t mean they didn&apos;t have good qualities, too. I&apos;m sure your old master wasn&apos;t *all* bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="89027">&quot;He treats Deekin nice sometimes. Deekin not... feels like kobold when Old Master teaches him. Deekin feels like dragon.&quot;</string>
<string name="89028">&quot;A good dragon, I&apos;m sure.&quot; She beams a brilliant smile at Deekin, and he chuckles and smiles back in response.</string>
<string name="89029">&quot;Deekin, you don&apos;t look very well. Your scales are so gray! Whatever is wrong, dear?&quot;</string>
<string name="89030">&quot;Ummm... Deekin just be nervous. Deekin always be nervous when we walks around in dungeon. Deekin not be very courageous.&quot;</string>
<string name="89031">She smiles gently. &quot;That&apos;s not so unusual, dear. We all feel that way.&quot;</string>
<string name="89032">Deekin looks up at her with bright, wide eyes. &quot;Really?&quot;</string>
<string name="89033">&quot;Of course! I remember back when I left Evereska for the first time. I was supposed to search for Sehanine&apos;s holy chalice, but I had no idea where to start. I was so frightened!&quot;</string>
<string name="89034">&quot;I&apos;d never been away from home before. I didn&apos;t know the customs of humans and I was so shy they took advantage of me terribly.&quot;</string>
<string name="89035">&quot;Deekin knows what that be like.&quot;</string>
<string name="89036">&quot;But you get better at it, dear. Everything in life requires courage, even when you&apos;re not adventuring. The fact that you&apos;re here says a lot about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="89037">&quot;What does it say?&quot;</string>
<string name="89038">&quot;It means that you&apos;re far braver than all those people who need you to save their lives. It means that even if you fail, you&apos;re still a hero because you were willing to try.&quot;</string>
<string name="89039">He looks up at Linu and grins. &quot;Deekin likes how you says things, pretty elven lady. You is really nice, just like the boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="89040">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="89041">&quot;I think we need to part ways.&quot;</string>
<string name="89042">&quot;No, never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="89043">&quot;Wait here until I return.&quot;</string>
<string name="89044">&quot;I need to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="89045">&quot;I want to change your tactics.&quot;</string>
<string name="89046">&quot;I don&apos;t want to change anything else right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="89047">&quot;I want you to leave any traps that you see alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="89048">&quot;I want you to disarm any traps that you see.&quot;</string>
<string name="89049">&quot;I want to move faster and not bother with searching or stealth.&quot;</string>
<string name="89050">&quot;I need you to be stealthy right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="89051">&quot;Don&apos;t help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.&quot;</string>
<string name="89052">&quot;Help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.&quot;</string>
<string name="89053">&quot;I want to change the distance you stay away from me.&quot;</string>
<string name="89054">&quot;Stay a long distance away.&quot;</string>
<string name="89055">&quot;Keep a medium distance.&quot;</string>
<string name="89056">&quot;Stay close.&quot;</string>
<string name="89057">&quot;Go ahead and attack as soon as you see enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="89058">&quot;Defend me and don&apos;t attack until I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="89059">&quot;I want to adjust your equipment.&quot;</string>
<string name="89060">&quot;Can you identify my equipment?&quot;</string>
<string name="89061">&quot;I need you to cast a group of buffing spells.&quot;</string>
<string name="89062">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="89063">&quot;Cast all the buffing spells you have.&quot;</string>
<string name="89064">&quot;Cast all the buffing spells that last a long time.&quot;</string>

<string name="89164">&quot;What was it you wanted to say earlier?&quot;</string>
<string name="89165">&quot;Let&apos;s stop and talk a moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="89166">&quot;We&apos;re done talking.&quot;</string>
<string name="89167">&quot;No, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="89168">&quot;How is everything?&quot;</string>
<string name="89169">&quot;Do you have plans for what you&apos;re going to do after all this?&quot;</string>
<string name="89170">&quot;I&apos;m sure that reward could be put to good use.&quot;</string>
<string name="89171">&quot;I don&apos;t know. I haven&apos;t thought about it at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="89172">&quot;I still haven&apos;t been rewarded properly.&quot;</string>
<string name="89173">&quot;You&apos;re very welcome.&quot;</string>
<string name="89174">&quot;It was nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="89175">&quot;I was thinking of taking some time off.&quot;</string>
<string name="89176">&quot;I&apos;m sure another adventure will come along.&quot;</string>
<string name="89177">&quot;I was hoping I could spend more time with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="89178">&quot;You said you came from Neverwinter, correct?&quot;</string>
<string name="89179">&quot;Lord Nasher was generous? He paid well?&quot;</string>
<string name="89180">&quot;Did you know the Hero of Neverwinter?&quot;</string>
<string name="89181">&quot;Is it true the Hero saved Neverwinter single-handedly?&quot;</string>
<string name="89182">&quot;Where is the Hero now?&quot;</string>
<string name="89183">&quot;You helped fight the plague?&quot;</string>
<string name="89184">&quot;Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="89185">&quot;What happened to Lady Aribeth?&quot;</string>
<string name="89186">&quot;From what I hear, she deserved it.&quot;</string>
<string name="89187">&quot;That sounds very sad.&quot;</string>
<string name="89188">&quot;No, stay here for the moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="89189">&quot;Yes, come with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="89190">&quot;Not right now. I&apos;m busy.&quot;</string>
<string name="89191">&quot;What would you like, Linu?&quot;</string>
<string name="89192">&quot;I know everything I need to know about them.&quot;</string>
<string name="89193">&quot;I know they are evil and dark-skinned elves, but that&apos;s it.&quot;</string>
<string name="89194">&quot;That&apos;s all I wanted to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="89195">&quot;So the other races of the Underdark hate the drow?&quot;</string>
<string name="89196">&quot;Could the drow have unified somehow?&quot;</string>
<string name="89197">&quot;Tell me about this goddess, Lolth.&quot;</string>
<string name="89198">&quot;Why would their goddess want them to war with each other?&quot;</string>
<string name="89199">&quot;Do the drow wish to return to the surface?&quot;</string>
<string name="89200">&quot;Isn&apos;t there another famous drow outcast named Drizzt?&quot;</string>
<string name="89201">&quot;A fair amount. I am an elf, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="89202">&quot;Yes, please. My knowledge is limited.&quot;</string>
<string name="89203">&quot;No, I know plenty about them.&quot;</string>
<string name="89204">&quot;I don&apos;t need to hear about him.&quot;</string>
<string name="89205">&quot;Tell me what you know about him.&quot;</string>
<string name="89206">&quot;So Undermountain once belonged to the dwarves?&quot;</string>
<string name="89207">&quot;I&apos;ve heard enough, thanks.&quot;</string>
<string name="89208">&quot;So how powerful is Halaster?&quot;</string>
<string name="89209">&quot;How could the drow have taken over?&quot;</string>
<string name="89210">&quot;Broke into the Underdark? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="89211">&quot;Why put all the puzzles and monsters in here?&quot;</string>
<string name="89212">&quot;The elves have tales about him? How old is he?&quot;</string>
<string name="89213">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="89214">&quot;No, just stay here for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="89215">&quot;It is good to see you once more. Do you have need of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="89216">---------- Random Pop-Ups Start Here ------------</string>
<string name="89217">&quot;Is that so? Well, I&apos;ll not stay where I&apos;m not wanted. If you&apos;re sure...?&quot;</string>
<string name="89218">&quot;Well, off you go then. Just remember to come back for me before I die of old age.&quot;</string>
<string name="89219">&quot;Fair enough. I&apos;ll find my own way back.&quot;</string>
<string name="89220">&quot;There&apos;s something you&apos;d like me to do differently?&quot;</string>
<string name="89221">&quot;That&apos;d be my first instinct, yes. Ha ha!&quot;</string>
<string name="89222">&quot;If I can, certainly.&quot;</string>
<string name="89223">&quot;Very well. I shall try to keep up with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="89224">&quot;Let the shadows conceal me, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="89225">&quot;I doubt there&apos;s much I could do to help with that, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="89226">&quot;I&apos;m no rogue, but I&apos;ll certainly try.&quot;</string>
<string name="89227">&quot;Where do you want me, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="89228">&quot;Will do.&quot;</string>
<string name="89229">&quot;Truly? Fair enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="89230">&quot;I&apos;ll try.&quot;</string>
<string name="89231">&quot;Adjust away. Just mind the delicates.&quot;</string>
<string name="89232">&quot;I can certainly try. I&apos;ll look through what you have and let you know if there&apos;s anything I recognize.&quot;</string>
<string name="89233">&quot;As you wish. Let my music inspire you.&quot;</string>
<string name="89234">&quot;I see. What manner of buffing spells would you have me use?&quot;</string>
<string name="89235">&quot;What shall I cast, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="89236">&quot;I can do that. Are you certain?&quot;</string>
<string name="89237">&quot;And what is my target?&quot;</string>
<string name="89238">&quot;Talk? What about?&quot;</string>
<string name="89239">&quot;Couldn&apos;t be better. But I always feel good when something epic is underway!&quot;</string>
<string name="89240">&quot;Shall we talk about something else?&quot;</string>
<string name="89241">&quot;My feet ache and I could use a good bath. But, then, so could you.&quot;</string>
<string name="89242">&quot;I wouldn&apos;t mind stopping to rest soon, but I can wait.&quot;</string>
<string name="89243">&quot;Oh, well enough, I suppose.&quot;</string>
<string name="89244">&quot;Not too bad. Do you think we will get to the Underdark soon? I&apos;ve never seen it.&quot;</string>
<string name="89245">&quot;It&apos;s fine. Personally, I&apos;m waiting for something spectacular to happen.&quot;</string>
<string name="89246">&quot;Everything is as well as one would expect. Why? What are you planning?&quot;</string>
<string name="89247">&quot;I&apos;d feel better if I could actually see. Wait... where are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="89248">&quot;I am lightly wounded, nothing life-threatening.&quot;</string>
<string name="89249">&quot;I have several wounds, but it is nothing critical just yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="89250">&quot;I... am not that well.&quot; She winces in pain. &quot;I need healing, if it is possible.&quot;</string>
<string name="89251">&quot;I&apos;m poisoned. This is not good.&quot;</string>
<string name="89252">&quot;I would be far better were I not so ill, naturally. Is there not something we can do about this?&quot;</string>
<string name="89253">&quot;I am focusing on my fighting skills at the moment, as per your request. Should I do something differently?&quot;</string>
<string name="89254">&quot;I am focusing on my bardic skills at the moment, as per your request. Should I do something differently?&quot;</string>
<string name="89255">&quot;As you wish. I find that a more versatile arrangement, personally.&quot;</string>
<string name="89256">&quot;My training? Well... I currently split my time between training to fight and my bardic skills. If you prefer, I could focus on doing one or the other.&quot;</string>
<string name="89257">She grins. &quot;Easy enough to accomplish.&quot;</string>
<string name="89258">She nods affirmatively. &quot;Fighter it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="89259">She nods affirmatively. &quot;Bard it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="89260">&quot;That depends, really, on whether or not I feel as if I&apos;m done adventuring.&quot;</string>
<string name="89261">She ponders for a moment. &quot;There are many places in Faerun where adventure can be had. I was pondering the possibility of journeying to Calimshan, perhaps... or even Rashaman in the east.&quot;</string>
<string name="89262">&quot;I&apos;ve never been to a desert, either. Perhaps the Anauroch Desert would be agreeable? You&apos;ve been there, &lt;FirstName&gt;... what did you think of it?&quot;</string>
<string name="89263">&quot;You mean the Bedine? Yes, I would like to see more about them. And perhaps I could even search for ancient artifacts as you did?&quot;</string>
<string name="89264">&quot;Perhaps I could play as I traveled. I would play in front of the Witch-King of Vaasa, perhaps... or maybe even go to Shadowdale and track down Elminster, himself.&quot;</string>
<string name="89265">&quot;What about you, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Are you through with adventures? Why not come with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="89266">&quot;You needn&apos;t put it so bluntly. I wish you well, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="89267">She laughs lightly. &quot;I guess I understand. No hard feelings, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="89268">She grins. &quot;Good! Then let&apos;s get on with finishing this one, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="89269">&quot;Oh,&quot; she seems slightly disappointed. &quot;From the book it sounded like your adventure was so much more interesting. I guess actually being there can seem much less exciting.&quot;</string>
<string name="89270">&quot;Yes, I was originally born there, though I spent much of my career away. I only returned to help save the city from the plague, and afterwards I decided to stay.&quot; She frowns thoughtfully, obviously thinking back. &quot;For a little while,&quot; she amends.</string>
<string name="89271">&quot;True, I suppose. Let&apos;s move on, then, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="89272">Sharwyn sighs heavily. &quot;For a time I stayed, certainly. Lord Nasher was eager for all of us who had helped with the plague to stay and help rebuild the militia. We were heroes, and it felt good.&quot;</string>
<string name="89273">&quot;I had always wanted to be famous, so I was in my glory at the time. It just... didn&apos;t last very long.&quot;</string>
<string name="89274">&quot;A... man I fell in love with left the city. He did not come back. I know it does not sound very strong of me, but... Neverwinter just seemed so lonely after that. I wanted adventure again.&quot;</string>
<string name="89275">&quot;That&apos;s why I came to Waterdeep when I heard the call. And met you, of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="89276">&quot;I did. The revisionists like to play down &lt;his/her&gt; role in saving Neverwinter, but I was there... if it weren&apos;t for the Hero of Neverwinter, we would never have won the day.&quot;</string>
<string name="89277">Sharwyn shrugs, frowning as if this is an unpleasant topic. &quot;&lt;He/She&gt; left not long after the plague ended and Aribeth died. There were... differences with Lord Nasher, as I recall.&quot;</string>
<string name="89278">&quot;Same way I&apos;m helping you now, I suppose. Fighting and casting spells when I&apos;m not singing. I worked with Aribeth de Tylmarande, in fact.&quot; Her face grows somber. &quot;Have you ever heard of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="89279">&quot;I know why you call her that, but there was more to her story than what you&apos;ve heard. I think it was sad... especially what happened in the end.&quot;</string>
<string name="89280">&quot;She died,&quot; Sharwyn says simply. &quot;Isn&apos;t that how all these stories end?&quot;</string>
<string name="89281">She nods, sighing. &quot;I don&apos;t blame her for what she did. Not all of it. It&apos;s a sad tale, really... especially how it all ended.&quot;</string>
<string name="89282">&quot;Truly? I thought her story would be everywhere by now. Let&apos;s just say she was once a paladin pushed to betray her people. A sad story... especially how it ended.&quot;</string>
<string name="89283">&quot;As you wish, though I&apos;ll not stand about indefinitely.&quot;</string>
<string name="89284">&quot;Excellent. I look forward to the adventure!&quot;</string>
<string name="89285">&quot;I see. Perhaps later, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="89286">&quot;I have something of a... a confession to make.&quot;</string>
<string name="89287">She looks away for a moment, blushing. &quot;Well, let me make it more of a question. Could you... could you ever see anything between us?&quot;</string>
<string name="89288">Hurt to the quick, Sharwyn smiles wanly in an attempt to hide it. &quot;I see. Well... that&apos;s good to know. Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="89289">She laughs and then wags a finger at you. &quot;Now don&apos;t get all eager on me, it was just a simple question. We haven&apos;t known each other for very long, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="89290">&quot;At first I just thought of you as &lt;FirstName&gt; of Undrentide fame. Then, after you saved my life, I realized there was a reason you&apos;re considered such a hero.&quot;</string>
<string name="89291">&quot;At any rate, we&apos;ve a job to do, right? This is a discussion for later.&quot; She pauses for a moment and then, grinning, gives you a quick kiss before turning to continue.</string>
<string name="89292">She nods slowly, smiling. &quot;I suppose that&apos;s a fair answer. We haven&apos;t known each other for very long, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="89293">Sharwyn blushes more profusely, if that&apos;s possible. &quot;No, I&apos;m not joking.&quot;</string>
<string name="89294">She smiles a bit bashfully. &quot;A bit of hero worship, actually. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ve ever told you how glad I am to be adventuring with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="89295">&quot;I mean, at first I was excited because you were &lt;FirstName&gt; of Undrentide fame... but later, since you&apos;ve saved my life, I know why you&apos;re regarded as such a heroine. I&apos;m just... glad to be here.&quot;</string>
<string name="89296">Sharwyn nods. &quot;Of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="89297">She nods. &quot;I... just wanted you to know. That&apos;s all.&quot;</string>
<string name="89298">&quot;Have you ever been to the Underdark?&quot;</string>
<string name="89299">&quot;Hmph. That&apos;s quite rude. Maybe you should just keep yourself company in the future, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="89300">&quot;Well, the first thing you need to know is that it&apos;s likely the most dangerous place on Faerun... or in Faerun, if you prefer.&quot;</string>
<string name="89301">&quot;We won&apos;t be able to rest anywhere safely. The drow will especially be on patrol. And while you might resist a beholder&apos;s eye rays, I can&apos;t say the same for an illithid&apos;s psionic attacks.&quot;</string>
<string name="89302">She shrugs. &quot;At any rate, I just thought you might want a heads-up. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve heard plenty about the Underdark as it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="89303">&quot;It just seems that we&apos;re heading in that direction. With drow and illithids and beholders involved, I really can&apos;t see any other option.&quot;</string>
<string name="89304">&quot;I&apos;m curious... what are you going to do with all that reward money?&quot;</string>
<string name="89305">&quot;Fine. I was just asking.&quot;</string>
<string name="89306">&quot;No? Well, I know what I would do with that kind of coin.&quot; Her eyes take on a far-away look.</string>
<string name="89307">&quot;Oh come now, no need to play coy. Surely there must be *something* you&apos;d like that costs a lot of money.&quot;</string>
<string name="89308">&quot;Oh I know *that*. It&apos;s a lot of coin, however. Surely you must have given it some thought.&quot;</string>
<string name="89309">&quot;Aha! I knew it! What&apos;s the first thing you would buy?&quot;</string>
<string name="89310">Her eyes go wide as she grins. &quot;Now *that&apos;s* more like it!&quot; She ponders for a moment. &quot;Can I think of something better? I&apos;m not sure... hmmm...&quot;</string>
<string name="89311">&quot;I&apos;d buy the grandest instrument that coin could buy, built by the finest craftsman in Faerun! And then I would travel the land, playing only in the most quality houses!&quot; She laughs heartily.</string>
<string name="89312">&quot;But I suppose we&apos;d have to survive the current adventure first, right? Maybe let&apos;s do that.&quot;</string>
<string name="89313">She stares at you a moment longer to see if you&apos;re serious. &quot;Oh. Well, I... I suppose that&apos;s a worthy cause.&quot; She shrugs. &quot;Maybe it wouldn&apos;t be as benevolent of me, but I know exactly what I would do.&quot;</string>
<string name="89314">She whistles in appreciation. &quot;Now that would be quite something to see. You sure a hundred thousand gold is enough for you?&quot; She chuckles. &quot;I, for one, know exactly what I would do with that kind of coin.&quot;</string>
<string name="89315">She rolls her eyes and smirks. &quot;Now you&apos;re just playing with me. I, for one, know exactly what I would do with that kind of coin.&quot;</string>
<string name="89316">&quot;Tell me something... you were the pupil of a dwarf by the name of Drogan, is that right? A dwarf wizard?&quot;</string>
<string name="89317">She regards you archly. &quot;A bit testy, are we? It&apos;s a simple question.&quot;</string>
<string name="89318">She nods sadly. &quot;Yes, I know. I hadn&apos;t heard until I read it in the book, which came as something of a shock. He was a sweet dwarf. I&apos;m glad he got to run his school after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="89319">&quot;Very well. I apologize for asking, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="89320">&quot;Oh?&quot; She chuckles lightly. &quot;You&apos;re not &lt;FullName&gt;, hero of the &apos;Shadows of Undrentide&apos;? You&apos;re somebody else, I suppose?&quot;</string>
<string name="89321">&quot;So he did finally establish a school. That&apos;s good to know, as it was something he said he&apos;d always planned to do someday.&quot;</string>
<string name="89322">&quot;I did, though not for long. He tried to recruit me into the Harpers when I was younger. I always wondered what happened to him.&quot;</string>
<string name="89323">&quot;Yes, only for a short while. Drogan was pretty insistent on trying to get me to join, but once I gave him my final answer, he gave me my space. And then I never saw him again.&quot;</string>
<string name="89324">&quot;Sometimes I regret not joining the Harpers, however.&quot; She regards you with an arched brow. &quot;What about you? Would you ever consider joining the Harpers?&quot;</string>
<string name="89325">She nods. &quot;That&apos;s what I would have expected.&quot;</string>
<string name="89326">She stares at you with renewed wonder, grinning. &quot;I should have suspected as much, really.&quot;</string>
<string name="89327">&quot;Well, we&apos;d best be off. Talking about old friends always makes me sad. Let&apos;s do something exciting, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="89328">&quot;I&apos;m surprised the subject didn&apos;t come up. Drogan was part of a group that dedicates itself to fighting evil throughout the lands.&quot; She shrugs. &quot;Maybe by the time he met you he no longer took part.&quot;</string>
<string name="89329">&quot;Yes, Drogan is the one who invited me.&quot; She sighs sadly. &quot;In the end, I decided all that wandering and spying wasn&apos;t really for me. I&apos;d rather have my own adventures.&quot;</string>
<string name="89330">--------- Random Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="89331">&quot;I can&apos;t believe we&apos;re still running around down here. That... that relic you carry... can&apos;t it teleport you past all these obstacles?&quot;</string>
<string name="89332">&quot;I&apos;m just feeling a little on edge.&quot; She glances away, looking embarrassed. &quot;I guess we&apos;ve just been down here for quite a while, without really getting anywhere. Or that&apos;s how it feels.&quot;</string>
<string name="89333">She nods slowly. &quot;Fine. I don&apos;t really want to talk about it anymore, anyway. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="89334">She stares at you for a long moment before continuing. &quot;You say that, but how can you guarantee anything? It&apos;s not as if you and I have known each other for very long.&quot;</string>
<string name="89335">&quot;Not scared, no.&quot; She looks at you with very serious eyes. &quot;I haven&apos;t been scared of any adventure for a very long time now. I know the risks.&quot;</string>
<string name="89336">&quot;No, I don&apos;t want to go back to the inn. I don&apos;t want to stop, don&apos;t take it like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="89337">&quot;I just keep thinking of when you found me down here.&quot; Her expression becomes pensive. &quot;I was killed so quickly... and if you hadn&apos;t found me...&quot;</string>
<string name="89338">Sharwyn sighs heavily and then puts on a half-hearted smile. &quot;I guess what I&apos;m afraid of is a bad ending. To end so cheaply, to not even see the big climax... do you understand what I&apos;m taking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="89339">She looks at you with a sudden smile. &quot;So you do understand. Thank you, I appreciate that. But... now&apos;s not really the time. I shouldn&apos;t whine like this... my story&apos;s not what&apos;s important here. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="89340">&quot;I shouldn&apos;t talk like this. We&apos;ve still plenty of work to be done before this is over? My story can wait.&quot;</string>
<string name="89341">&quot;Well that&apos;s sort of useless.&quot;</string>
<string name="89342">She frowns thoughtfully. &quot;I suppose you&apos;re right. I really should be surprised that teleportation works at all in here. It&apos;s not supposed to.&quot;</string>
<string name="89343">&quot;I&apos;ve heard about it. You&apos;re somewhat famous, remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="89344">&quot;Well we could certainly use *something* because all we seem to be doing is getting deeper and deeper into Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="89345">&quot;I... you&apos;re right, you&apos;re right. Please forgive me.&quot;</string>
<string name="89346">&quot;Mind my own business?&quot; She glares at you. &quot;As if my own survival isn&apos;t my business? All we seem to be doing is getting deeper and deeper into Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="89347">&quot;Unless I&apos;m mistaken, this is the Hall of the Sleeping Kings!&quot; She looks around with awe. &quot;I... I didn&apos;t expect it to be so large.&quot;</string>
<string name="89348">She nods. &quot;All right. Just... just be careful not to touch anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="89349">She glances at you with a slight grin. &quot;You should know better than that. You don&apos;t prop up fully dead folk in a throne and put them on display. *Mostly* dead folk you do.&quot;</string>
<string name="89350">She takes a deep breath, staring for a long moment at one of the skeletal bodies before continuing. &quot;Mankind is an old race, older than we think even. Records of our true history have probably been lost in more ancient wars than we can count.&quot;</string>
<string name="89351">&quot;There were nations here in the north of Faerun whose names aren&apos;t even known anymore, ruled by Wizard-Kings and valiant Lords and Ladies whose deeds are long forgotten.&quot;</string>
<string name="89352">She gestures to the bodies in the room. &quot;The tales say that Halaster has collected the greatest of these ancient Kings and given them righteous burial. Here they sleep, in a place of honor.&quot;</string>
<string name="89353">&quot;I wouldn&apos;t touch them. Really, I wouldn&apos;t.&quot; She nods to the other side of the room. &quot;Let&apos;s just move on, okay?&quot;</string>
<string name="89354">&quot;Probably. This is Undermountain, after all. I... I would think these skeletons wouldn&apos;t bother you if you didn&apos;t bother them, but I&apos;ve no way of knowing that for sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="89355">She shrugs. &quot;I guess that depends on your point of view. They could be buried in some forgotten grave that someone built a whorehouse over. Me, I&apos;d pick here.&quot;</string>
<string name="89356">&quot;I think we may have stumbled onto the Hall of Mirrors. This is one of the few famous locales inside Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="89357">&quot;If you say so. It&apos;s not often that you stumble into something like this, that&apos;s all.&quot;</string>
<string name="89358">&quot;There are some folks who have entered Undermountain and not gotten very far in before they retreated back out... they&apos;re the only ones who have lived to tell their tale, and this room often gets mentioned.&quot;</string>
<string name="89359">&quot;It&apos;s configuration gets changed sometimes, but generally its at least two long rows of mirrors. Some of them are magical, some of them are not, and supposedly the magical ones are quite different... but usually deadly.&quot;</string>
<string name="89360">&quot;One mirror that often gets mentioned is referred to as the Mirror of Opposition. It creates a hostile copy of yourself that attacks you. Talk about your fair fight!&quot;</string>
<string name="89361">&quot;Personally I&apos;d just like to know where Halaster gets all these things. Do you think he makes them himself? How could he?&quot;</string>
<string name="89362">&quot;Not really, other than the fact that we should probably just move on through. But you&apos;ll want to look, won&apos;t you? Of course you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="89363">&quot;Possibly, to the right buyer. But look at these things. How are you going to cart it out of here? Not to mention that as soon as you approach it, it would perform its magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="89364">&quot;I don&apos;t know. The stories seem to be correct, as all the mirrors are identical.&quot;</string>
<string name="89365">&quot;Naturally. Undermountain is older than Waterdeep and has been visited by the most famous adventurers in the land throughout its existence. Word gets out.&quot;</string>
<string name="89366">&quot;This room is one that is normally nearer the entrance, if I remember the lore correctly. Apparently Halaster likes to rearrange his little maze on a regular basis. How I&apos;d love to meet that man!&quot;</string>
<string name="89367">&quot;Some. Really, there&apos;s not much to be known... he&apos;s a great archmage who went insane with paranoia a long time ago and so hid himself within a dungeon of his creation. He&apos;s not exactly known for his sociability.&quot;</string>
<string name="89368">She looks at your with incredulity. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t you? We&apos;re talking about one of Faerun&apos;s great archmages, here. I&apos;d love to talk to him, find out what made him mad, I don&apos;t know.&quot;</string>
<string name="89369">&quot;Yes, I suppose he does have lots of magic. People wanting to take it from him is likely what made him paranoid to begin with, wouldn&apos;t you say?&quot;</string>
<string name="89370">&quot;The good news, I guess, is that I just might get to meet him if I stick around with you. If something big is happening in Undermountain, Halaster has to be involved somehow.&quot;</string>
<string name="89371">&quot;Well, naturally he&apos;d never tell me such things, but we&apos;re talking hypothetical situations here anyway. Halaster doesn&apos;t meet anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="89372">&quot;Count on it. Halaster Blackcloak is deranged and paranoid. No doubt he just doesn&apos;t want maps to mean anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="89373">She grins ruefully. &quot;But I&apos;m sure you&apos;re not interested in my musings. We&apos;ve more important things to do, right? Shall I join up with you again?&quot;</string>
<string name="89374">She nods, pleased. &quot;Excellent. A grand adventure awaits.&quot;</string>
<string name="89375">Her brow furrows in confusion. &quot;You raised me back to life, but not to help you further? Well, then, you have my thanks still... should you need my help, I&apos;ll be right here.&quot;</string>
<string name="89376">------- This line must be placed at the end of inter-party banter ---------</string>
<string name="89377">&quot;You know, I seem to recall a certain tale in which you were mentioned, Tomi.&quot;</string>
<string name="89378">&quot;Aye? That&apos;s a new one. Did I come off lookin&apos; good in it?&quot;</string>
<string name="89379">&quot;Not really. But, then, when you know who I heard the tale from, maybe that won&apos;t be surprising.&quot;</string>
<string name="89380">&quot;Hmmm? Well, don&apos;t keep me in bloody suspense.&quot;</string>
<string name="89381">&quot;I believe you know him. An old cohort by the name of Sammy?&quot;</string>
<string name="89382">Tomi&apos;s reaction is explosive. His eyes go wide and he very nearly chokes on something. &quot;Sammy?! Ye&apos;ve seen him? Where?!&quot;</string>
<string name="89383">Sharwyn chuckles under her breath. &quot;Oh, more to the point, I told him where to find *you*.&quot;</string>
<string name="89384">&quot;Now why would you bloody well do that?!&quot;</string>
<string name="89385">&quot;I&apos;ve always been a bit of a believer in justice, my little friend.&quot; With that, Sharwyn merely smirks and continues on her way.</string>
<string name="89386">&quot;You know, Tomi... have I ever told you about the golden ring I wear?&quot;</string>
<string name="89387">&quot;Naw. Why would I want to hear about that?&quot;</string>
<string name="89388">&quot;There&apos;s a tale about it that involves you, actually.&quot;</string>
<string name="89389">&quot;Aye? Then gab yer story away. I always do like to hear about myself, heh.&quot;</string>
<string name="89390">&quot;There was a man I loved with all my heart, you see. He wished to marry me, and I was willing... but he was poor and thought himself unworthy. He said he would find me a ring worthy of our love and sailed away one day.&quot;</string>
<string name="89391">&quot;I never saw him for many months and sadly thought he had abandoned me. Much later, however, I received a small pouch with a letter written by a man who had sailed with my love on a vessel returning to Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="89392">&quot;The letter said the ship had sank, and though my love had survived it was only to die from fever scant days later. My love gave his ring to the man and asked him to send it to me, asking that I wear it out of love for him. And I have.&quot;</string>
<string name="89393">&quot;Pffft! And what&apos;s that got to do with Tomi?&quot;</string>
<string name="89394">&quot;You picked it off me not five minutes ago, you little runt. If you don&apos;t hand it over right now I&apos;ll cut off what passes for manhood amongst halflings and call it even.&quot;</string>
<string name="89395">&quot;Oh. Heh... why, look-ee here! Could this be the ring ye were talkin&apos; about?&quot; Gingerly, Tomi hands the ring back to her.</string>
<string name="89396">&quot;Much obliged.&quot;</string>
<string name="89397">&quot;Tell me, Daelan, is it true what I hear about the Uthgardt requiring one to jump into ice-cold water once a year?&quot;</string>
<string name="89398">&quot;It is not a requirement, Sharwyn, but a celebration of the year&apos;s passing. A hole is carved in the ice and those who wish dive into the black waters.&quot;</string>
<string name="89399">&quot;You can&apos;t be serious! Surely such a swim would kill a man! How could you not catch a deathly fever from such a foolhardy act?&quot;</string>
<string name="89400">Daelan arches an eyebrow at her curiously. &quot;You judge it as foolhardy but you have not even tried it?&quot;</string>
<string name="89401">&quot;I once attempted to walk across the river during the winter when I was young and fell through. It was a miracle I survived.&quot;</string>
<string name="89402">&quot;We are not weighed down by clothing. And after the dive we move immediately back into warm environs to dry off. It is invigorating and joyful and not harmful at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="89403">Sharwyn regards Daelan with a shocked expression. &quot;You dive into the icy water without clothing?!&quot;</string>
<string name="89404">&quot;Always without clothing, yes. The body heats itself quickly enough... it would be wet clothes that would leech our warmth. Hmmm... why do you stare at me so?&quot;</string>
<string name="89405">She grins at the muscular barbarian dreamily. &quot;Oh... just picturing you diving.&quot;</string>
<string name="89406">&quot;If you like, and if we still live in the new year, I would be honored to show you. But only if you dive with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="89407">&quot;Hmmm. Tempting. I&apos;ll have to think about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="89408">&quot;You know, Daelan, I&apos;ve met a great number of half-orcs in my day. Most of them were rude louts who reveled in their orcish blood.&quot;</string>
<string name="89409">&quot;To humans we are orcs, to orcs we are humans, meaning in the end we are accepted by few. So many of my kind revel in our difference.&quot;</string>
<string name="89410">&quot;And you understand that. You are far wiser than one would expect. Full of surprises, in fact.&quot;</string>
<string name="89411">&quot;I am no great surprise, bard. I am a simple man who tries to maintain a noble existence.&quot;</string>
<string name="89412">&quot;And that is not a surprise?&quot; She chuckles lightly. &quot;What about the fact that you bathe regularly? And that scent you wear...&quot;</string>
<string name="89413">&quot;I bathe because it is hygienic and an accepted practice in civilized lands. And what you smell is an ointment I prepare that repels flies which are unfortunately drawn to orcish sweat.&quot;</string>
<string name="89414">&quot;Mmmm. I didn&apos;t need to know that. It smells wonderful. Like cinnamon mixed with rose petals and honey.&quot;</string>
<string name="89415">&quot;I believe that is the rotaga root. Amongst the Uthgardt we also chew rotaga to prevent tooth rot.&quot;</string>
<string name="89416">&quot;Just full of romantic notions, aren&apos;t you? Sigh...&quot;</string>
<string name="89417">&quot;Linu, I&apos;m wondering... have you ever been to Evermeet?&quot;</string>
<string name="89418">&quot;Oh.&quot; Linu looks away, a bit sad. &quot;The island where the elven nations have moved to.&quot;</string>
<string name="89419">&quot;Is there another Evermeet?&quot;</string>
<string name="89420">&quot;No, of course not.&quot; Linu looks directly at Sharwyn and shakes her head. &quot;And no, I have never been there, much as I might have liked to.&quot;</string>
<string name="89421">Sharwyn looks puzzled. &quot;You wanted to go previously, but didn&apos;t? Why not?&quot;</string>
<string name="89422">For a long moment, Linu struggles to find the words to speak. Finally she sighs and shrugs. &quot;I sank the boat.&quot;</string>
<string name="89423">&quot;The boat? You mean you sank the boat that was supposed to take you to Evermeet?&quot;</string>
<string name="89424">Linu nods, not looking happy. &quot;It was all a terrible accident! How was I to know the ship was to be carrying lamp oil to the island?&quot;</string>
<string name="89425">&quot;Normally that doesn&apos;t make a difference. If I might ask...?&quot;</string>
<string name="89426">&quot;Oh,&quot; Linu waves her hand irritably, &quot;a cat had stolen my purse. Which had a mouse in it, I admit, but I was saving the poor creature. And then I tripped the steward, who had a torch... but only by accident, as the cat had scratched me and I&apos;d jumped back...&quot;</string>
<string name="89427">&quot;Now you&apos;re just laughing at me. I&apos;m not saying any more.&quot;</string>
<string name="89428">Sharwyn tries valiantly to hide her snickering. &quot;I... I&apos;m so sorry, Linu. That&apos;s so sad... (snort!)...&quot;</string>
<string name="89429">&quot;Linu, sometimes I think you&apos;re just too sweet for your own good. You really need to work on that.&quot;</string>
<string name="89430">Linu looks at Sharwyn suspiciously. &quot;What are you talking about? There is nothing wrong with treating others kindly.&quot;</string>
<string name="89431">&quot;There&apos;s plenty wrong with it. Remember that greasy fellow back at the Yawning Portal? The one you allowed to fawn all over you for three hours?&quot;</string>
<string name="89432">&quot;I asked him to stop and leave me alone. What else was I supposed to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="89433">&quot;I would have had him gone in thirty seconds.&quot; Sharwyn snaps her fingers. &quot;Either that or he&apos;d be a very sore man.&quot;</string>
<string name="89434">Linu chuckles, embarrassed. &quot;I can&apos;t even think of what I would say! No, I could never do that.&quot;</string>
<string name="89435">&quot;How about &apos;Listen, human, either back off or they&apos;ll be searching for your genitals somewhere in your rib cage.&apos; It works, trust me.&quot;</string>
<string name="89436">&quot;But... what if I like the gentleman and I don&apos;t want to drive him away?&quot;</string>
<string name="89437">Sharwyn grins. &quot;Now *that* is a completely different subject. We&apos;ll talk about that later... I&apos;ll need props.&quot;</string>
<string name="89438">&quot;Deekin, do you realize that because of you, there have been several other kobolds coming into the civilized lands?&quot;</string>
<string name="89439">&quot;Deekin not knows that. Is that be true?&quot;</string>
<string name="89440">&quot;It is, indeed, though admittedly most of these new fellows are of more nefarious intent than yourself, or so I&apos;ve heard.&quot;</string>
<string name="89441">&quot;Nefarious? Is that means they smells bad?&quot;</string>
<string name="89442">&quot;No, it just means... well, it means that they&apos;re not very nice, Deekin. They&apos;re thieves and the like, working with mercenaries. Not at all adorable like you.&quot;</string>
<string name="89443">&quot;You thinks Deekin is adorable?&quot;</string>
<string name="89444">&quot;How did we get onto this? We were discussing the other kobolds who have come out of the caves.&quot;</string>
<string name="89445">&quot;Deekin wants to discuss how adorable he is again.&quot;</string>
<string name="89446">&quot;Hmmm. Maybe we should just continue on with our journey, yes? That might be much better.&quot;</string>
<string name="89447">&quot;If I might ask, Deekin... where did you learn your bardic lore? I can&apos;t imagine the kobolds have a tradition of music and folklore?&quot;</string>
<string name="89448">&quot;Nope. Deekin not learns bard stuff from kobold tribe. Deekin learns it all from Old Master.&quot;</string>
<string name="89449">&quot;Hmmm. And this Old Master... he was someone amongst the humans? Some kindly stranger who took you in?&quot;</string>
<string name="89450">&quot;Nope. Old Master was big and gassy White Dragon named Tymofarrar. He keeps Deekin around so Deekin can entertains him.&quot;</string>
<string name="89451">&quot;A White Dragon? I&apos;ve never heard of any White Dragon who used magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="89452">&quot;Old Master did. Old Master was smart, and he gots lots of books. Deekin reads all the time, that be how Deekin learns so much.&quot;</string>
<string name="89453">&quot;And he taught you to play music as well?&quot;</string>
<string name="89454">&quot;No. Old Master not gots ear for music, not like Deekin. Deekin learns to play lyre on his own.&quot;</string>
<string name="89455">&quot;Fascinating. You are just a pile of contradictions, my little man.&quot;</string>
<string name="89456">&quot;Ummm... Deekin says thanks?&quot;</string>
<string name="89457">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="89458">&quot;I think we need to part ways.&quot;</string>
<string name="89459">&quot;No, never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="89460">&quot;Wait here until I return.&quot;</string>
<string name="89461">&quot;I need to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="89462">&quot;I want to change your tactics.&quot;</string>
<string name="89463">&quot;I don&apos;t want to change anything else right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="89464">&quot;I want you to leave any traps that you see alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="89465">&quot;I want you to disarm any traps that you see.&quot;</string>
<string name="89466">&quot;I want to move faster and not bother with searching or stealth.&quot;</string>
<string name="89467">&quot;I need you to be stealthy right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="89468">&quot;Don&apos;t help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.&quot;</string>
<string name="89469">&quot;Help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.&quot;</string>
<string name="89470">&quot;I want to change the distance you stay away from me.&quot;</string>
<string name="89471">&quot;Stay a long distance away.&quot;</string>
<string name="89472">&quot;Keep a medium distance.&quot;</string>
<string name="89473">&quot;Stay close.&quot;</string>
<string name="89474">&quot;Go ahead and attack as soon as you see enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="89475">&quot;Defend me and don&apos;t attack until I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="89476">&quot;I want to adjust your equipment.&quot;</string>
<string name="89477">&quot;Can you identify my equipment?&quot;</string>
<string name="89478">&quot;I want you to use your bard song now.&quot;</string>
<string name="89479">&quot;I need you to cast a group of buffing spells.&quot;</string>
<string name="89480">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="89481">&quot;Cast all the buffing spells you have.&quot;</string>
<string name="89482">&quot;Cast all the buffing spells that last a long time.&quot;</string>
<string name="89483">&quot;Cast all the short duration buffing spells.&quot;</string>
<string name="89484">&quot;I need you to cast a spell.&quot;</string>

<string name="89584">&quot;What was it you wanted to say earlier?&quot;</string>
<string name="89585">&quot;Let&apos;s stop and talk a moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="89586">&quot;We&apos;re done talking.&quot;</string>
<string name="89587">&quot;No, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="89588">&quot;How is everything?&quot;</string>
<string name="89589">&quot;I wish to discuss your training.&quot;</string>
<string name="89590">&quot;Go back to splitting your time up between fighter and bard.&quot;</string>
<string name="89591">&quot;Continue with what you&apos;re doing now.&quot;</string>
<string name="89592">&quot;Focus on being a fighter.&quot;</string>
<string name="89593">&quot;Focus on being a bard.&quot;</string>
<string name="89594">&quot;Do you have plans for what you&apos;re going to do after all this?&quot;</string>
<string name="89595">&quot;And if you&apos;re not?&quot;</string>
<string name="89596">&quot;It was beautiful, I thought, with an interesting people.&quot;</string>
<string name="89597">&quot;I&apos;m a loner, but thanks for the offer.&quot;</string>
<string name="89598">&quot;Not a chance in hell.&quot;</string>
<string name="89599">&quot;No. I have my own plans.&quot;</string>
<string name="89600">&quot;I might consider doing just that.&quot;</string>
<string name="89601">&quot;I hated it. All sand and trudging, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="89602">&quot;I didn&apos;t see much of it, to be honest.&quot;</string>
<string name="89603">&quot;It was nothing special.&quot;</string>
<string name="89604">&quot;You said you came from Neverwinter, correct?&quot;</string>
<string name="89605">&quot;We&apos;ve discussed this enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="89606">&quot;So you didn&apos;t stay in Neverwinter long?&quot;</string>
<string name="89607">&quot;Why? What happened?&quot;</string>
<string name="89608">&quot;Did you know the Hero of Neverwinter?&quot;</string>
<string name="89609">&quot;What happened to &lt;him/her&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="89610">&quot;How did you help save the city?&quot;</string>
<string name="89611">&quot;That evil traitor?&quot;</string>
<string name="89612">&quot;How did it end?&quot;</string>
<string name="89613">&quot;Yes, I have.&quot;</string>
<string name="89614">&quot;No, I haven&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="89615">&quot;No, stay here for the moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="89616">&quot;Yes, come with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="89617">&quot;Not right now. I&apos;m busy.&quot;</string>
<string name="89618">&quot;What is it, Sharwyn?&quot;</string>
<string name="89619">&quot;What kind of confession?&quot;</string>
<string name="89620">&quot;No. I really couldn&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="89621">&quot;Are you kidding! I was thinking you&apos;d never ask!&quot;</string>
<string name="89622">&quot;I don&apos;t know. I barely know you.&quot;</string>
<string name="89623">&quot;Maybe. Given enough time.&quot;</string>
<string name="89624">&quot;Are you joking?&quot;</string>
<string name="89625">&quot;I see. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="89626">&quot;Umm... yes, well... that was uncomfortable.&quot;</string>
<string name="89627">&quot;Thank you, Sharwyn.&quot;</string>
<string name="89628">&quot;Mind your own business.&quot;</string>
<string name="89629">&quot;No, I&apos;ve never been there before.&quot;</string>
<string name="89630">&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</string>
<string name="89631">&quot;It&apos;s none of your business, Sharwyn.&quot;</string>
<string name="89632">&quot;I haven&apos;t thought about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="89633">&quot;Wouldn&apos;t you like to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="89634">&quot;I don&apos;t have the reward money yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="89635">&quot;I suppose maybe there&apos;s a few things...&quot;</string>
<string name="89636">&quot;A great theater of the arts!&quot;</string>
<string name="89637">&quot;I would give as much as I could spare to those in need.&quot;</string>
<string name="89638">&quot;I might build a castle, I suppose.&quot;</string>
<string name="89639">&quot;I would build a church to honor my god.&quot;</string>
<string name="89640">&quot;A magical laboratory in a tower, perhaps.&quot;</string>
<string name="89641">&quot;I&apos;m not sure. A monastery somewhere quiet?&quot;</string>
<string name="89642">&quot;Maybe a huge mansion in Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="89643">&quot;Some new shoes, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="89644">&quot;I&apos;d rather not discuss it.&quot;</string>
<string name="89645">&quot;I suppose you&apos;re right. I was at Drogan&apos;s school in Hilltop.&quot;</string>
<string name="89646">&quot;Master Drogan is dead. I&apos;d rather not discuss him.&quot;</string>
<string name="89647">&quot;I said no and I meant it.&quot;</string>
<string name="89648">&quot;No, you&apos;ve mistaken me for someone else.&quot;</string>
<string name="89649">&quot;Leave it be. I mean it.&quot;</string>
<string name="89650">&quot;Yes, that&apos;s right. He ran a school in Hilltop.&quot;</string>
<string name="89651">&quot;You knew him?&quot;</string>
<string name="89652">&quot;So you knew him for just a short time....&quot;</string>
<string name="89653">&quot;No, never.&quot;</string>
<string name="89654">&quot;I had my chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="89655">&quot;Yes, I think I would.&quot;</string>
<string name="89656">&quot;I already am a Harper.&quot;</string>
<string name="89657">&quot;The Harpers? What&apos;s that?&quot;</string>
<string name="89658">&quot;Drogan tried to recruit you into the Harpers?&quot;</string>
<string name="89659">&quot;Being a little impatient, are we?&quot;</string>
<string name="89660">&quot;Pull yourself together! I don&apos;t need to listen to any whining.&quot;</string>
<string name="89661">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ll be fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="89662">&quot;You aren&apos;t scared of what&apos;s going to happen, are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="89663">&quot;You can go back to the inn, if you like.&quot;</string>
<string name="89664">&quot;I think you&apos;re whining.&quot;</string>
<string name="89665">&quot;Not really, no.&quot;</string>
<string name="89666">&quot;But I did find you. Your story isn&apos;t over yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="89667">&quot;I think so.&quot;</string>
<string name="89668">&quot;It can only take me to places I&apos;ve already been.&quot;</string>
<string name="89669">&quot;Maybe so. What&apos;s it to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="89670">&quot;Useless? Are you crazy?&quot;</string>
<string name="89671">&quot;Actually, it&apos;s quite useful if you think about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="89672">&quot;What do you know about my relic?&quot;</string>
<string name="89673">&quot;We don&apos;t need it to get past anything in our way.&quot;</string>
<string name="89674">&quot;You don&apos;t need to come with me. Go back to the inn.&quot;</string>
<string name="89675">&quot;Why are you getting upset?&quot;</string>
<string name="89676">&quot;At least we&apos;re making progress.&quot;</string>
<string name="89677">&quot;Well, mind your own business.&quot;</string>
<string name="89678">&quot;Enough. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="89679">&quot;Sleeping? They look pretty dead to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="89680">&quot;What do you know about this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="89681">&quot;Let&apos;s move on, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="89682">&quot;They look like they&apos;re pretty wealthy for being dead...&quot;</string>
<string name="89683">&quot;Is there any danger here?&quot;</string>
<string name="89684">&quot;There&apos;s nothing honorable about this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="89685">&quot;Fine. Talk about it later.&quot;</string>
<string name="89686">&quot;Is there any danger here?&quot;</string>
<string name="89687">&quot;What do you know about it?&quot;</string>
<string name="89688">&quot;All right, let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="89689">&quot;Anything else I should know?&quot;</string>
<string name="89690">&quot;Is this Mirror of Opposition very valuable?&quot;</string>
<string name="89691">&quot;How can you tell that one apart?&quot;</string>
<string name="89692">&quot;There are famous parts of Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="89693">&quot;Never mind that. Let&apos;s move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="89694">&quot;Tell me about this Hall of Mirrors.&quot;</string>
<string name="89695">&quot;Do you know much about Halaster?&quot;</string>
<string name="89696">&quot;You actually want to meet him?&quot;</string>
<string name="89697">&quot;I&apos;d just want some of his power.&quot;</string>
<string name="89698">&quot;Maybe that would be interesting, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="89699">&quot;You&apos;re crazy!&quot;</string>
<string name="89700">&quot;You think this dungeon gets re-arranged?&quot;</string>
<string name="89701">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="89702">&quot;No, just stay here for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="89703">&quot;And it shows, too, let me tell you.&quot;</string>

<string name="89923">&quot;Anything else special ye want t&apos; discuss?&quot;</string>

<string name="89925">&quot;Why&apos;re ye botherin&apos; yerself with me? Get on, you.&quot;</string>
<string name="89926">&quot;Fine, fine. Just composin&apos; me memoirs in me head, is all.&quot;</string>
<string name="89927">&quot;Not too bad. I&apos;m thinkin&apos; of joinin&apos; a circus, maybe, when I get back to civilized life. What do ya think of that?&quot;</string>
<string name="89928">&quot;I could use a larger share of the bloody loot, if you&apos;re offerin&apos;. Heh.&quot;</string>
<string name="89929">&quot;Think I got a boil on me arse, but otherwise than that, everything&apos;s dandy.&quot;</string>
<string name="89930">&quot;It&apos;d be fine an&apos; well enough. Could ya tell me if it&apos;s just real dark... or am I actually blinded? I&apos;m a bit concerned, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="89931">&quot;Pfeh, don&apos;t worry about me none. Just a few scratches, nothin&apos; more.&quot;</string>
<string name="89932">&quot;Just got a bit messed up back there, heh. Nothin&apos; ta see here.&quot;</string>

<string name="89934">&quot;Oy! It&apos;s all fine an&apos; dandy, except for the liquid fire I got runnin&apos; through me veins. I expect that&apos;ll... work itself out...&quot;</string>
<string name="89935">&quot;Not too bad, except for these weird splotches on me skin an&apos; such. Ya suppose that&apos;s a bad thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="89936">&quot;I&apos;m workin&apos; on just bein&apos; a Shadowdancer at the moment. Ya want me to change that?&quot;</string>
<string name="89937">&quot;I&apos;m workin&apos; on just bein&apos; a rogue, at the moment. Ya want me to change that?&quot;</string>
<string name="89938">&quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;d prefer anyway. Sure thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="89939">&quot;If ya like. I split my time between pickin&apos; up me roguish skills and workin&apos; at being a Shadowdancer. I can focus on one o&apos; those things exclusive-like, if ya prefer.&quot;</string>
<string name="89940">&quot;Don&apos;t change anything? I can do that.&quot;</string>
<string name="89941">&quot;Right. Shadowdancer it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="89942">&quot;Fair enough. I&apos;ll work on being just a rogue, fer now.&quot;</string>
<string name="89943">&quot;Hmmm... yeah, I guess they&apos;re not so common, aye? Just let me put it this way... there&apos;s folks who can hide and there&apos;s folks who become one with the shadows.&quot;</string>
<string name="89944">&quot;Us Shadowdancers, we&apos;re the ones who do the latter. Just don&apos;t ask me why we does it, &apos;cause I&apos;d have ta kill ya then. Ha ha ha!&quot;</string>
<string name="89945">Tomi thinks about it for a moment, his brows furrowing. &quot;Hmmm. With all the reward money, ya mean? I were thinkin&apos; of taking a vacation. Maybe goin&apos; up ta Icewind Dale.&quot;</string>
<string name="89946">&quot;I hears there&apos;s some goody-two-shoes drow elf up there who needs &apos;is arse kicked. Sounds like a fun enough vacation ta me.&quot;</string>
<string name="89947">&quot;See? Now we&apos;re gettin&apos; somewhere. Ye&apos;re alright.&quot;</string>
<string name="89948">&quot;Pffft. Never happen. I&apos;m Tomi Undergallows, or haven&apos;t ya heard?&quot;</string>
<string name="89949">&quot;Well, there ya go. An&apos; besides, how tough could he be? It&apos;s not like he&apos;s Elminster or some such, sheesh.&quot;</string>
<string name="89950">&quot;Yeah, I&apos;ve heard that before. What do ya want me ta do? Head to the Moonshaes an&apos; sit on some beach? What kind o&apos; fun is that?&quot;</string>
<string name="89951">&quot;Ya mean before the little misunderstandin&apos; between me an&apos; Lord Nasher?&quot;</string>
<string name="89952">He shrugs. &quot;Well, ya did ask.&quot; Whistling happily, he skips on ahead.</string>
<string name="89953">Tomi shrugs. &quot;Aw, it were nothing so big, if ya asks me. I&apos;d had a few investments go sour, ya see, an&apos; another opportunity came up. I didn&apos;t have the coin on hand, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="89954">&quot;Well, I was going to replace the money in the Treasury with the profits. With interest, even! Old Nasher didn&apos;t see it that way, o&apos; course.&quot;</string>
<string name="89955">&quot;Naw. I were just encouraged ta leave. Big difference with that, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="89956">&quot;Right after the plague ended, though, hmmm... well, back then Tomi opened up chain o&apos; businesses he did. Was right profitable, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="89957">&quot;Well, maybe it were more of a club. The members paid dues an&apos; in return I let *them* do their business.&quot;</string>
<string name="89958">&quot;Pfft. Now ye&apos;re soundin&apos; just like that Aarin Gend fella who served Nasher, all serious an&apos; such. So it were a guild, it didn&apos;t hurt no-one. Well... no-one we weren&apos;t paid to.&quot;</string>
<string name="89959">He throws his hands up in disgust. &quot;Fine, fine! Tomi Undergallows is the most terrible halfling ta ever grace Faerun! Are ya happy now? Sheesh.&quot;</string>
<string name="89960">He looks around. &quot;But what are we chattin&apos; for? We&apos;re down here to adventure, aren&apos;t we? Get yer butt in gear, already.&quot;</string>
<string name="89961">&quot;Not so good. There were the original thieves&apos; guild that sort o&apos; took exception ta mine. I guess they never heard o&apos; live an&apos; let live, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="89962">&quot;They sent eight assassins after me before they finally gave up. By that time I&apos;d decided it just weren&apos;t worth it. Aw, well.&quot;</string>
<string name="89963">&quot;The old fart who runs the bloody city, that&apos;s who. I tells ya... don&apos;t do anything to get the city riled up, &apos;cause he&apos;ll feed ya to the lions. Spineless old dog, that one.&quot;</string>
<string name="89964">&quot;Oh, aye. That&apos;s not where I came from originally, but it&apos;s been good enough fer now. I&apos;m somethin&apos; of a hero there, too... ya heard of the plague, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="89965">&quot;Aye, well, I was one o&apos; the folks that helped Lady Aribeth ta deal with that. Of course, nobody remembers the poor lass for that any more.&quot;</string>
<string name="89966">&quot;You&apos;d think that&apos;d be the case, but naw. Ever since the plague, there&apos;s been a couple of... misunderstandings. Tomi had to get on outta Neverwinter, he did. Kinda made coming ta Waterdeep an easy decision.&quot;</string>
<string name="89967">&quot;I don&apos;t know. Why ain&apos;t ya surprised? I&apos;ve never done anythin&apos; to make anyone upset in me whole life.&quot;</string>
<string name="89968">&quot;But enough about stinky ol&apos; Neverwinter. I&apos;m a Waterdeep halfling now. Let&apos;s get on with, errr... what were we doing? Are we saving the city or what?&quot;</string>
<string name="89969">&quot;Right! On to save the city!&quot;</string>
<string name="89970">&quot;Bah. Same old smelly place it was before. And is it my fault Lord Nasher doesn&apos;t understand the difference between borrowin&apos; some coin from the Treasury and stealin&apos; it? Nope, it ain&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="89971">&quot;Ya mean the Hero of Neverwinter? Aye, &lt;he/she&gt; was there, too. You remind me o&apos; &lt;him/her&gt; a little bit, ya do.&quot;</string>
<string name="89972">&quot;If ya asks me, they give that &lt;lad/lass&gt; a bit too much credit, an&apos; not enough to the little folks... an&apos; certainly not any at all fer Lady Aribeth after what she did. That&apos;s just the way things go, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="89973">Tomi thinks for a moment, scratching his chin. &quot;Ya know... I can&apos;t rightly say. Went on ta other adventures is my guess.&quot;</string>
<string name="89974">&quot;Oh. She were this pretty little filly, a paladin that served Lord Nasher... the bloke who runs Neverwinter. It was her duty ta fight the plague.&quot;</string>
<string name="89975">&quot;Aye, ye&apos;ve heard of her? She were this paladin that Lord Nasher told ta fight the plague. She&apos;s the one that found the Hero of Neverwinter... if ya heard about that one, too, I dunno.&quot;</string>
<string name="89976">&quot;Anyway, she eventually turned against the city. Fell from grace, painter &apos;er armor black... the whole bit. Sad, really. Though I hear her new armor was damned fetching.&quot;</string>
<string name="89977">For once, an expression of real sadness crosses the halfling&apos;s eyes and he looks away from you. &quot;Dead,&quot; he grudgingly says. &quot;It weren&apos;t right, but... I guess it had ta be.&quot;</string>
<string name="89978">&quot;I liked her well enough. Funny how nobody ever blames Lord Nasher for drivin&apos; her to it all. I&apos;d sure tell him so, if I ever saw him again.&quot;</string>
<string name="89979">&quot;I&apos;m not just going ta bloody well stand around forever... but alright. I&apos;ll stay here for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="89980">&quot;Right-o! Off we go!&quot;</string>
<string name="89981">&quot;Too busy ta chat with the fella who watches your back, hey? Fine, fine, Tomi&apos;ll remember that, he will.&quot;</string>
<string name="89982">&quot;Right, then. Please forgive the humble Tomi Undergallows for offending your divine personage with anything other than prayer. I should bloody well know better.&quot;</string>
<string name="89983">&quot;Right, then. I apologize for my base crassness and attitude. I am unworthy of addressing a respectable personage such as yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="89984">&quot;Right, then. &apos;Oh, yer magnificent Highness, m&apos;&lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Might this lowly mealworm have a word with ye?&quot;</string>
<string name="89985">Tomi frowns, rolling his eyes. &quot;Alright, then. Have it yer way, sheesh.&quot;</string>
<string name="89986">&quot;So ya figure I should poke ya with a dagger next time?&quot;</string>
<string name="89987">&quot;Right, then. Next time I&apos;ll just whip off me bloody shorts and flag ya down.&quot;</string>
<string name="89988">&quot;So what&apos;s rude about it? Did I say &apos;Listen up, cow!&apos;? No, I don&apos;t think so.&quot;</string>
<string name="89989">&quot;That&apos;s not rude. I could&apos;a just pinched yer arse if I needed yer attention.&quot;</string>
<string name="89990">&quot;How much coin do ya got, anyways?&quot;</string>
<string name="89991">&quot;It&apos;s just that I got this... investment opportunity I knows about, aye?&quot; He looks about, suspicious, and leans in closer. &quot;Lemons.&quot;</string>
<string name="89992">&quot;Shhhh! Not so loud! Aye, lemons! It&apos;s this little yellow fruit that comes from Maztica, the sourest thing ya ever did taste, they is.&quot;</string>
<string name="89993">His eyes grow distant as he becomes suddenly animated. &quot;Just think of it! It could become the fashionable new fruit, loved by nobles everywhere and served at buffets! And... and it can clean greasy messes, too!&quot;</string>
<string name="89994">&quot;Let&apos;s not get silly, aye? Anyway, what do ya think?&quot;</string>
<string name="89995">&quot;Importing bloody lemons from Maztica! We&apos;ll make millions, we will!&quot;</string>
<string name="89996">&quot;You like the idea?&quot; He seems surprised. &quot;My pitch must be getting better. Hmmm... now to just survive all this Undermountain business...&quot;</string>
<string name="89997">&quot;What? Ya can&apos;t ask about a friend&apos;s finances, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="89998">Tomi frowns thoughtfully. &quot;Fine, then. Suit yerself.&quot; He casts an eye at your belt pouch, but says no more.</string>
<string name="89999">&quot;You ever been to Calimshan? I&apos;ve been thinkin&apos; lately just how familiar you look.&quot;</string>
