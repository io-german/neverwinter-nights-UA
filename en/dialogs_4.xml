<string name="40007">My friend, it&apos;s vital that we talk.</string>
<string name="40008">You must be &lt;FirstName&gt;. Your are exactly as the assassin described you. I&apos;m an adventurer like you, looking for the cult. They&apos;ve got an assassin trying to kill us off. Of my entire party, I&apos;m the sole survivor.</string>
<string name="40009">He&apos;s all melee so if you can keep away from his sword, you&apos;ll stand a chance. I&apos;m an archer and that&apos;s the only reason I&apos;m alive today.</string>
<string name="40010">Just outside of Charwood but don&apos;t bother heading back there. You don&apos;t find him... he finds you.</string>
<string name="40011">Yeah: Vardoc... I didn&apos;t get his clan-name but he seems orc-raised. No human mother could raise a son to be that vicious.</string>
<string name="40012">He&apos;s a loner, it seems. Maybe that&apos;s a weakness to exploit, I don&apos;t know... He didn&apos;t seem to need any help against my party... </string>
<string name="40013">Spread the word. He&apos;s after every last one of us... </string>

<string name="40052">Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Blackguard level 4.
Specifics: Whenever the character makes a successful attack against an opponent who is flat-footed, cannot see them, or who is in combat with someone else, the character&apos;s blow delivers extra damage. This extra damage is +1d6 at 4th level and an additional +1d6 every three levels thereafter. This extra damage is not multiplied in the case of a critical hit.
Use: Automatic. Monsters of the construct and undead types are immune to sneak attacks, as are any creatures that are immune to critical hits.</string>
<string name="40053">Magical Electrifier - Charge</string>
<string name="40054">Magical Electrifier - Destroy</string>
<string name="40055">Item charged</string>
<string name="40056">There is no charge. You must use the destroy ability on other items to charge this item.</string>
<string name="40057">Item destroyed. The electrifier has been charged.</string>
<string name="40058">Spectorial was a sorcerer who grew tired of having to return to his tower and spend months recharging his favorite wand. The orb he constructed can be focused on an item to break it down into energy, destroying the targeted object. This works best with higher quality and enchanted items. Once the orb has enough power, it can then target the item needing to be recharged and infuse it with the stolen energy.</string>
<string name="40059">Though this orb glows with harnessed magical power, its use is not obvious.</string>
<string name="40060">Hosgali the Purified was a monk who believed in purification through fire. He would travel the lands, fighting for those he believed to be unjustly accused of crimes. With his hands flaming, he became a symbol of the defendant&apos;s champion. When he died, Hosgali&apos;s spirit entered the fighting gloves he always wore. Now his spirit will assume the flaming form of whoever wears these gloves.</string>
<string name="40061">These gloves are obviously magical, though what they do is beyond your knowledge.</string>
<string name="40062">Flame Twin</string>
<string name="40063">You are not able to use your bard song at the moment.</string>
<string name="40064">A quick glance at these pages of music reveals the most unearthly collection of notes ever composed. </string>
<string name="40065">Possibly one of the strangest stories in Thayvian history is that of Rachzin Pala, the lich who decided to become a bard. The music he composed was of such mournful effect that he became a success for playing at funerals for the rich and powerful. His masterpiece was a work that actually created a similar spell effect to Horrid Wilting and was known to actually kill the audience.</string>
<string name="40066">Lyrics of the Lich</string>
<string name="40067">While in Stealth mode, your character is nearly undetectable. Creatures will roll Listen and Spot checks versus your Move Silently and Hide skills. If you fail the skill check, you will be noticed by them. Your movement rate is halved while in Stealth mode.</string>
<string name="40068">While in Detect mode, your character will roll 1d20 + your appropriate check to either Listen, Spot, or Search. All three activities are activated while in Detect mode, making you move half your normal movement rate.</string>
<string name="40069">While in counterspell mode, if an enemy casts a spell for which you have an appropriate counter, you will counterspell his spell.</string>
<string name="40070">Defensive casting mode allows casting without triggering an attack of opportunity. However a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) must be made or else the spell is lost.</string>
<string name="40071">The power of nature seems to be focused in this branch, though what it should be used for is not obvious.</string>
<string name="40072">The creative forces of nature are focused in this branch, allowing the sapling to be transported without being planted. Once every day, the branch can grow two berries, harnessing the powers of fire and ice. The berries can then be fed to one&apos;s animal companion, granting them special abilities. Ice berries grant the animals the power of winter, while Flame berries grant the power of fire.</string>
<string name="40073">Iceberry</string>
<string name="40074">Flameberry</string>
<string name="40075">Robe of Energy</string>
<string name="40076">You may only feed the berry to your animal companion.</string>
<string name="40077">It was one of the members of the Arcane Brotherhood who discovered the ability to infuse her garment with the energy of a magic missile. With unexpectedly powerful results, her garment became a popular black market commodity on the streets of Luskan. When the Brotherhood discovered that their secrets were being sold to outsiders, they had the inventor roasted slowly over an open flame.</string>
<string name="40078">Skin of the Forest</string>
<string name="40079">Henna, a druid of the Neverwinter grove, was lost in the forest, hunted by trolls, and huddled up against a great oak to stave off the rain. As she heard the two monstrous creatures coming closer, she felt a sudden warm presence surrounding her. The trolls lumbered on by, without seeming to notice her. When she stood up, she found a bark-like cloak covered her shoulders.</string>
<string name="40080">Prayer to the Overgod</string>
<string name="40081">This immense book explains the history of Ao and the attempts at its priesthood to contact him. It is a long, dry and strange record, and since Ao has never responded, it is surprising how positive the scribes have remained. In the hope of getting Ao&apos;s attention, it has been enchanted to be able to cast several spells.</string>
<string name="40082">Boots of the Shifting Sands</string>
<string name="40083">The most infamous halfling bard in Faerun, Stompin&apos; Con Tommers, claimed that entire tribes of goblins would quiver in fear when they heard he was coming. Strangely enough, the boasts of this halfling might have had some basis in truth, as the magical boots he wore really could cause earthquakes. He claimed to have pilfered the boots from an extra-planar bard whose voice could destroy entire cities. Con&apos;s career was cut short when he miscalculated a leap over a gorge he created and the earth swallowed him.</string>
<string name="40084">Skin of the Manticore</string>
<string name="40085">A manticore is a fearsome beast whose claws and teeth are deadly. Despite these weapons, it is the spikes from the manticore&apos;s tail that give the beast a legendary status. When Daegasus, an elven ranger, slew one of these beasts, he took the skin to a mage and together they developed this cloak. The mage was able to give Daegasus partial control over the manticore&apos;s tail, which was still attached to the skin. When Daegasus died, his powerful cloak disappeared.</string>
<string name="40086">Flaming Gloves +2</string>
<string name="40087">Known more for his flamboyant personality than his fighting technique, Glassun Moss represented everything most monks hate. He was impulsive, driven to acts of charity, followed by acts of extreme cruelty. He was lustful, talkative and boastful. Why he became a monk, no one really knew, except that he liked to fight with his hands. One night, in a drunken brawl, Moss lit his hands on fire. Despite the pain, he was so pleased with the fear in his opponent&apos;s eyes; he sought these legendary gloves for the rest of his life.</string>
<string name="40088">The Nomad&apos;s Ring</string>
<string name="40089">Another Thayvian product for their highly successful enclaves to sell, when wizards or sorcerers are traveling, it is always useful to have more spells available. When the young and very talented Red Wizard, Johan Kist, created this item, his apprentice attempted to steal the original, to sell as his own invention. Kist caught the thief and instantly created a new spell that caused the victim&apos;s flesh to peel away from his body in small strips. Kist has yet to share the secrets of his new spell.</string>
<string name="40090">The Wanderer&apos;s Ring</string>
<string name="40091">Success will never be possible</string>
<string name="40092">The slavers from the jungles of Chult often rely on underhanded techniques to keep their slaves in line. When a particularly difficult slave is caught attempting to escape, he will sometimes be kept in line by poisoning him, just enough to make him sick. The slavers then show the slave the antidote and force his cooperation. Most of these slavers allow their guards to carry weapons coated in the vile substance, for quick punishment or weakening an attacker.</string>
<string name="40093">The Sandstorm</string>
<string name="40094">Along the edge of the Anauroch lived a tribe of nomads whose ferocity in battle became a legend that told of a giant whirlwind of sand that would destroy caravans, leaving nothing but corpses behind. The truth behind the legend was that the shaman of this tribe was more powerful than he knew and he created this weapon that sprays sand with every swipe, often blinding opponents. </string>
<string name="40095">The Nightthief&apos;s Nimbleknife</string>
<string name="40096">The Nightthief was a vicious assassin who specialized in fighting with two daggers. His Nimbleknife was the weaker of the two items, but it granted him greater abilities in combat. One merchant in Sembia discovered these abilities when he laid an ambush for the assassin. He found all twelve of his guards dead and the lure, a two pound diamond, gone.</string>
<string name="40097">Blade of Chult</string>
<string name="40098">The Singing Sword</string>
<string name="40099">This blade literally hums with power. The closer a person&apos;s hand comes to the pommel, the louder the hum. The blade is supposed to have belonged to the famous swordsman known as the &quot;Laughing Knight&quot;. He would ride his charger into battle, laughing loudly while holding the Singing Sword, striking fear into the hearts of his opponents and lifting the moral of his allies.</string>
<string name="40100">The Nightthief&apos;s Claw</string>
<string name="40101">The Nightthief was a vicious assassin who specialized in fighting with two weapons. His claw was an evil looking blade with the magical ability to send shocks into his victim, increasing the damage and the pain felt. The Nightthief disappeared recently, after he was accused of killing a relative of the new regent in Cormyr. The burns on the victims face and throat were consistent with the Nightthief&apos;s style.</string>
<string name="40102">Lesser Mace of Disruption</string>
<string name="40103">Possibly the singular most popular weapon amongst the ranks of Lathandar&apos;s clerics, the mace of disruption is the bane of the undead. It is rumored that the last cleric carrying such a weapon in Thay was caught by Szazz Tam and flayed alive, before being turned into a zombie servant.</string>

<string name="40115">Area effect spells will never harm commoners or other neutral creatures.</string>
<string name="40116">Scrolls of stone to flesh are invaluable as you travel through the lands of Shadows of Undrentide.</string>

<string name="40126">Many a foul dungeon is darker than despair. Be prepared! Many merchants sell magical rings of light to foil the darkness.</string>
<string name="40127">The prestige class, Arcane Archer, requires at least one level in an arcane spellcasting class. Combined with a ranger&apos;s skills, this makes a potent ranged adversary.</string>
<string name="40128">The prestige class, Harper Scout, greatly extends the usefulness of the bard class.</string>
<string name="40129">Evil and cunning rogues often find great benefit in becoming assassins.</string>

<string name="40146">This small bag throbs slightly in your hand, as if alive and waiting for something. Without a better understanding of the nature of this odd object, you cannot activate its power.</string>
<string name="40147">This living bag was created by either Chauntea or one of her high priestesses and is considered a minor artifact. Its powers can only be activated though by using the Transmogrifying Wand upon the bag. When certain pairs of items are placed within the warm folds of the bag and the Transmogrifying Wand is activated overtop the bag, a creature of undying loyalty to the creator is created. The exact creature summoned depends on the items placed within the bag. The following is a partial list of creatures that can be summoned:

  Meat and Holy Water = Lantern Archon
  Meat and Dragon&apos;s Blood = Steam Mephit
  Meat and Skeleton&apos;s Knuckles = Tyrantfog Zombie
  Bear hide and Holy Water = Celestial Avenger
  Bear hide and Dragon&apos;s Blood = Dire Bear

<string name="40427">The star of Cimbar was a magical jewel, guarded by 20 crossbowmen at all times, in the royal palace in Cimbar. A few years ago a thief snuck in and stole the jewel in a daring raid. Before he was executed, the head guard claimed that he saw a dark shadow moving near the jewel&apos;s case, but when he fired his crossbow, the bolt bounced off like it had hit a wall.  The ricochet never made a sound.   </string>
<string name="40428">This gem seems to emit a warm comforting aura.</string>
<string name="40429"> It is said that when the Battle of the Bridge was fought in the High Forest, a nymph fell in love with a warrior. When the warrior was wounded on the battlefield, the nymph came to him and drew her heart from her chest. She placed it in the soldier&apos;s hand and it turned into this gem. The nymph disappeared, but the soldier kept the gem as a treasure, passed down through generations of his family. </string>

<string name="40436">The origins of this axe are as deeply hidden in the past as the blade of the axe is hidden in frost. The only bit of lore still known is that this axe is known on the Elemental Plane of Fire as &quot;Clisirick&quot;, or &quot;Fire Eater&quot;.</string>
<string name="40437">This blade is warm to the touch.</string>
<string name="40438">More than one fiend has felt the scorching sting of righteousness by a crusader&apos;s blade. The paladin that draws this weapon calls upon all the great spirit&apos;s that have fought against evil since the creation of the sword.</string>

<string name="40440">Eliak, an elven ranger, was consumed with hatred for trolls. As a child he had witnessed the death of his parents at the hands of marauding trolls. The trolls killed, then ate his parents, while the young child cowered under a nearby bush. Eliak spent the rest of his life trying to hunt the creatures to extinction. Eventually his lifelong enemies caught him and tore him apart in the borderlands of the Silver Marches. His magical bow was all that could be recovered from his remains.</string>

<string name="40593">Asabis are desert-dwelling reptilian humanoids who are often found as mercenaries or slaves in the service of evil creatures.  The average asabi male stands nearly seven feet tall, and their thick, pebbly skin is brown or gray in hue.  They have yellow, egg-shaped eyes with horizontal slit pupils.</string>

They have yellow, egg-shaped eyes with horizontal slit pupils.</string>
<string name="40595">The basilisk is a reptilian monster that is justly feared for its ability to petrify living creatures with a mere glance.  Basilisks are omnivorous and able to consume their petrified victims.  A basilisk usually has a dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly.  A single row of bony spines lines its back, and some specimens sport a short, curved horn atop the nose.  The creature&apos;s most distinctive feature is its eyes, which glow with an eerie, pale green incandescence. </string>
<string name="40596">Cockatrice</string>
<string name="40597">The cockatrice is an eerie, repulsive hybrid of lizard, cockerel and bat.  It is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone with its bite.  A cockatrice is about the size of a large goose or turkey, with the head and body of a cockerel, bat wings and the long tail of a lizard. </string>
<string name="40598">A chaotic offshoot of the pseudodragon, the faerie dragon lives in peaceful, tangled forests and thrives on pranks, mischief and practical jokes.  Faerie dragons resemble miniature dragons with gossamer butterfly wings.  Although they are generally well-meaning, most adventurers are advised to be wary of their sense of humor.</string>
<string name="40599">Pseudodragons resemble miniature red dragons, but are red-brown in color rather than deep red.  They have fine scales and sharp horns and teeth.  Their barbed, venomous tails are their favored weapons.</string>
<string name="40600">Pseudodragons resemble miniature red dragons, but are red-brown in color rather than deep-red.  They have fine scales and sharp horns and teeth.  A pseudodragon&apos;s tail is about 2 feet long (twice as long as its body), barbed, and very flexible.</string>
<string name="40601">A formian resembles a strange, centaur-like creature with the body and head of a giant ant, but with humanoid forelimbs. Their bodies are encased in a brownish-red, black or white carapace. They are not cruel, but live in a strict, regimented society.  Formian myrmarchs are high-ranking members of their civilization.  They wear bronze helms to signify their position, with more elaborate designs signifying higher rank.</string>

Their bodies are encased in a brownish-red, black or white carapace. They are not cruel, but live in a strict, regimented society.  A formian queen rules over a single hive-city and never leaves the royal chamber at its heart, although her telepathic abilities enable her to communicate with and direct the activities of all the members of her hive. </string>
<string name="40603">Formian Taskmaster</string>
<string name="40604">A formian resembles a strange, centaur-like creature with the body and head of a giant ant, but with humanoid forelimbs. Their bodies are encased in a brownish-red, black or white carapace. They are not cruel, but live in a strict, regimented society.  Formian taskmasters oversee the activities of the ordinary workers and warriors of the hive, reporting to the myrmarchs in turn.</string>

Their bodies are encased in a brownish-red, black or white carapace. They are not cruel, but live in a strict, regimented society.  Formian warriors protect the hive from incursions ferociously, and their deadly claws are designed specifically for combat.</string>
<string name="40606">A formian resembles a strange, centaur-like creature with the body and head of a giant ant, but with humanoid forelimbs. Their bodies are encased in a brownish-red, black or white carapace. They are not cruel, but live in a strict, regimented society.   Formian workers are the lowest-ranking and most common formians.  They exist only to serve, performing all the necessary, lowly tasks that the hive needs.  Their clumsy claws are suitable only for manual labor.</string>
<string name="40607">Female fire giants are as savage and ruthless as their male kin, delighting in the heat of battle and the forge. Their skin ranges from deep red to black in tone, and their eyes are a hot yellow. They prize flaming weapons and brightly-jeweled armor that catches firelight.</string>
<string name="40608">Perhaps even more cold and cruel than their male counterparts, female frost giants similarly make their homes in the frozen wastes, leaving their icy strongholds only to raid and plunder. Their pale skin is the bluish-white hue of glacier ice. </string>
<string name="40609">Gorgons are bull-like creatures that guard their territory fiercely.  A typical gorgon stands over six feet tall at the shoulder and measures eight feet from snout to tail.  Although built like a bull, the gorgon is covered with metallic black scales and has silver horns.  Its eyes glow with an eerie green light, particularly when it grows angry. The gorgon&apos;s most dangerous weapon is its fearsome petrification breath attack.</string>
<string name="40610">Sphinxes are enigmatic creatures with great, feathery wings and leonine bodies.  Gynosphinxes are the female counterparts of androsphinxes.  They have the bodies of winged lions with female humanoid facial features.  They gladly bargain for treasure or service but constantly seek out challenges to their staggering intellects.  Riddles, puzzles and other such things delight them to no end.</string>
<string name="40611">Summoned Wyrmling Red Dragon</string>
<string name="40612">Red dragons are the most covetous of all dragons, even as wyrmlings, though their opportunities for gathering treasure are more limited, making them even more greedy when the chance presents itself.  The small scales of wymlings are a bright glossy scarlet, making them easily spotted by predators and hunters, so they generally stay underground and do not venture outside until they are more able to take care of themselves.  Toward the end of their young stage the scales turn a deeper red and the glossy texture is replaced by a smooth, dull finish. </string>
<string name="40613">Summoned Wyrmling Gold Dragon</string>
<string name="40614">Gold dragons are graceful and sinuous.  They hate injustice and foul play, and will do what they can to right wrongs even at a young age.  On hatching, a gold dragon&apos;s scales are dark yellow with golden metallic flecks.  They smell faintly of saffron and incense.</string>
<string name="40615">A manticore is a monster in every sense of the word.  It has the head of a vaguely humanoid beast, the body of a lion and the wings of a dragon.  The creature&apos;s back is set with curved barbs, and its long tail ends in a cluster of vicious spikes, which it can hurl to deadly effect. </string>
<string name="40616">The hideous face of a medusa is crowned with a mass of writhing, hissing snakes instead of hair, and its eyes glow a deep, feral red.  In contrast, its body is perfectly proportioned and exceptionally attractive, although scaly and earthen-colored.  A medusa will often wear garments that enhance its body while hiding its face behind a hood or veil. </string>
<string name="40617">Penguin</string>
<string name="40618">Androsphinx</string>
<string name="40619">Sphinxes are enigmatic creatures with great, feathery wings and leonine bodies.  Androsphinxes resemble winged lions with humanoid facial features.  They are always male.  Androsphinxes are clever and generally good-natured, but they can be savage opponents when provoked.</string>
<string name="40620">Stingers look like a bizarre variant of centaur with the lower bodies of scorpions.  Their human half is red-skinned, hairless, and almost inhumanly handsome.  Their faces are preternaturally calm.</string>
<string name="40621">Stingers look like a bizarre variant of centaur with the lower bodies of scorpions.  Their human half is red-skinned, hairless, and almost inhumanly handsome.  Their faces are preternaturally calm. The mages are extensively scarified and tattooed, and their eyes glow a strange, eerie gold.</string>
<string name="40622">Summoned Ancient Red Dragon</string>
<string name="40623">Summoned Ancient Gold Dragon</string>
<string name="40624">Wyrmling Black Dragon</string>
<string name="40625">Black dragons are evil-tempered, cunning and malevolent, characteristics that are reflected in their crafty, sinister faces.  Even at a young age, they are already dangerous.  The wyrmling&apos;s scales are thin, small, and glossy. </string>
<string name="40626">Wyrmling Blue Dragon</string>
<string name="40627">Wyrmling blue dragons have scales of iridescent azure and lack the large horn that grows on their snout as they age.  Their wings beat with quick energy and tend to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static electricity.</string>
<string name="40628">Wyrmling Brass Dragon</string>
<string name="40629">Brass dragons are talkative, although as wyrmlings they may have some initial shyness.  Like older brass dragons, they love presents and long chats when they can get them.  Their scales are a dull, mottled brown at birth, and grow more warm and burnished with age.  Brass dragons love intense, dry heat and spend most of their time basking in the desert sun.  They are accompanied by a tangy metallic or sandy odor.</string>
<string name="40630">Wyrmling Bronze Dragon</string>
<string name="40631">Bronze dragons are inquisitive even as wyrmlings, and will frequently spy on adventuring parties for fun.  A bronze wyrmling&apos;s scales are tinged with green, showing only a hint of bronze.  They are fascinated by warfare, although they are cautious enough to avoid getting too close to battlefields when young and vulnerable.</string>
<string name="40632">Wyrmling Copper Dragon</string>
<string name="40633">Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers and riddlers.  Most are good-natured but also have a covetous, miserly streak.  They are powerful jumpers and climbers, with strong thighs and shoulders.  At birth, a copper dragon&apos;s scales have a ruddy brown color with a metallic tint. </string>
<string name="40634">Wyrmling Gold Dragon</string>
<string name="40635">Wyrmling Green Dragon</string>
<string name="40636">Green dragons are belligerent and tend to attack without provocation, although as wyrmlings they are more cautious.  A wyrmling green dragon&apos;s scales are thin, very small and a deep shade of green. </string>
<string name="40637">Wyrmling Red Dragon</string>
<string name="40638">Wyrmling Silver Dragon</string>
<string name="40639">Silver dragons are cheerful and good-natured, and are inclined to help worthy mortals.  A silver wyrmling&apos;s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights.  As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color slowly brightens until the individual scales are scarcely visible.  From a distance, these dragons look as if they have been sculpted from pure metal.  A faint smell of rain always accompanies them.</string>
<string name="40640">Wyrmling White Dragon</string>
<string name="40641">Among the smallest and least intelligent of dragonkind, most white dragons are simply animalistic predators, the young in particular.  The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten like mirrors, and it is marked by a crisp, faintly chemical odor.</string>
<string name="40642">Summoned Air Elemental</string>
<string name="40643">Summoned Earth Elemental</string>
<string name="40644">Summoned Fire Elemental</string>
<string name="40645">Summoned Water Elemental</string>
<string name="40646">Minor Circlet of Blasting</string>
<string name="40647">Found occasionally among the Bedine, these helms bear an elaborate golden band circling the head, which looks like a sun disc when viewed from above.  On command, the band projects a blast of searing light once per day.  Zhentarim records of helms captured from the Bedine propose that they are lesser artifacts from the days of Netheril.

<string name="40648">Major Circlet of Blasting</string>
<string name="40649">Found occasionally among the Bedine, these helms bear an elaborate golden band circling the head, which looks like a sun disc when viewed from above.  On command, the band projects a blast of searing light three times per day.  Zhentarim records of helms captured from the Bedine suggest that they are lesser artifacts from the days of Netheril.
</string>
<string name="40650">Eyes of Charming</string>
<string name="40651">This helm mounts two crystal lenses over the wearer&apos;s eyes that to outside observers appear to sparkle and swirl with color.  The wearer is able to charm a person merely by meeting a target&apos;s gaze.  Those failing a Will saving throw are charmed as per the spell.

Through the power of one such helm, the Chessentan warlord Guivandar quickly gathered an army of loyal followers from the exiles and murderous criminals in the Threskel region.

With an army behind him, Guivandar turned his ambitions on conquering the nation&apos;s more established city-states.  However, before his army could even begin to march on Luthcheq, a reclusive wizard living in the Smoking Mountains dispelled the power of Guivandar&apos;s helm as punishment for trespassing the army through his territory.  Freed of the helm&apos;s charm, Guivandar&apos;s lieutenants murdered him in his sleep and the army quickly scattered throughout the region.</string>
<string name="40652">Eyes of Doom</string>
<string name="40653">This helm mounts two crystal lenses over the wearer&apos;s eyes that to outside observers appear as a swirling infinite void. The wearer is able to cast doom on those around him merely by meeting a target&apos;s gaze. Those failing a Will saving throw are doomed as per the spell. It is inscribed with the symbol of Bane.

At one time, helmets of this type were popular equipment among Zhentarim soldiers. Due to the enchantment&apos;s use of the symbol of Bane, the helms fell into disuse and many were abandoned during the Black Network&apos;s dedication to Cyric and Iyachtu Xvim. With Bane&apos;s recent rebirth, the Zhentarim are eager to reclaim those that were lost.</string>
<string name="40654">Eyes of the Eagle</string>
<string name="40655">This helm mounts two special crystal lenses over the wearer&apos;s eyes that grant a +5 bonus to Spot checks. 

Fiercely protective of their borders, the elves of the Moonwood often use these helms to better patrol their borders for marauding orcs and to better aim their bows in the wood&apos;s defense.</string>
<string name="40656">Eyes of Petrification</string>
<string name="40657">Hammered from a gorgon&apos;s armor plates, this helm mounts two crystal lenses over the wearer&apos;s eyes.  These special lenses, made from the calcified corneas of a medusa, allow the wearer to use the medusa&apos;s petrification gaze attack.

Rare indeed, the origin of the few known helms have been traced back to an abandoned temple the jungles of Chult containing some of the most elaborate human and animal statuary ever seen in the region.</string>
<string name="40658">Goggles of Minute Seeing</string>
<string name="40659">This metallurgist&apos;s helm bears the distinctive look of Lantanese make.  It has been specially constructed to allow an intricate series of lenses to swivel over the wearer&apos;s eyes. They enable much improved close-range vision and are very useful for locating or identifying features such as tiny seams, marks, cracks, or imperfections.  

Such helms are valued by Lantanese archeologists when manipulating experimental contraptions - both for their investigatory and protective properties.</string>
<string name="40660">Goggles of Night</string>
<string name="40661">This helm mounts two lenses of dark crystal over the wearer&apos;s eyes. Even though the lenses are opaque, when placed over the eyes of the wearer they enable normal sight and also grant darkvision.

Common equipment for adventurers in the Underdark, these helms are also hailed as &quot;the great equalizer&quot; by humans and are quite popular among human rogues.</string>
<string name="40662">Headband of Intellect +2</string>
<string name="40663">Woven round the brim of this helm is a light cord with a small gem set so that it rests upon the forehead of the wearer.  The magic of the headband has the power to dramatically sharpen the wearer&apos;s intellect.

Considered &apos;cheating&apos; by some wizards, these bands are highly sought after by many wizards, especially the Red Wizards of Thay.</string>
<string name="40664">Headband of Intellect +4</string>
<string name="40665">Headband of Intellect +6</string>
<string name="40666">Helm of Brilliance</string>
<string name="40667">This nondescript helm appears entirely ordinary.</string>
<string name="40668">This helm appears ordinary until its true nature is perceived. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, the Helm of Brilliance is set with diamonds, rubies, fire opals, and opals, each of large size and enchanted.  When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels allow the wearer to cast a variety of powerful spells, although each such use drains some power from the helm. 

In addition to these specific powers, the helm can absorb significant amounts of fire damage. The wearer may also focus the light from the helm at will to produce an effect similar to flame lash.

The few such helms reported to still exist have been traced back to a great cleric of Lathander from Baldur&apos;s Gate named Ergelion.  Ergelion equipped his companions with these helms to turn back a horde of undead swarming out of the Troll Hills to the north.  Though the horde never reached Baldur&apos;s Gate, none of that band of adventurers was seen or heard from again.</string>
<string name="40669">Mask of the Skull</string>
<string name="40670">This ivory mask has been fashioned into the likeness of a human skull.  Once per day, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer&apos;s face.  It charges and attacks a target assigned to it, affecting the target as per a finger of death spell.  After attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user.

Although the masks were originally made by sects of Myrkul-worshipers, several groups of Cyricists have begun claiming the masks as their own.</string>
<string name="40671">Beholder Crown</string>
<string name="40672">This bizarre helm mounts a crown of tarnished bronze with eight metal eyestalks sprouting upward, each eyestalk bearing a gem.</string>
<string name="40673">This bizarre helm mounts a crown of tarnished bronze with eight metal eyestalks sprouting upward, each eyestalk bearing a gem.  

These items are greatly valued by members of beholder cults, and some sages believe that powerful beholders have their servants construct such items to reward valuable servants and slaves. Of course, since all such servants are usually dead before they are ever free from the beholder&apos;s control, this is likely nothing more than a rumor.</string>
<string name="40674">Cowl of Warding</string>
<string name="40675">This headpiece of fine black cloth covers the wearer&apos;s face completely.  The wearer of the cowl is protected by a mind blank spell and acts as if wearing a ring of freedom of movement.

Originally designed by clerics of Mask, more recently these cowls have been commissioned from Amnish spellcasters by the local Shadow Thieves.</string>
<string name="40676">Headband of the Binder</string>
<string name="40677">This helm mounts a circlet of blue-green metal around the wearer&apos;s forehead.  The circlet is stamped with the blank-scroll symbol of Oghma and grants the wearer insight into the origins of magical creations and spells.</string>
<string name="40678">Helm of Darkness</string>
<string name="40679">This ordinary-looking helmet appears slightly worn and battered.</string>
<string name="40680">This helm only takes its true form when the user first perceives its true nature.  Made of blackened silver and steel, a newly created helm of darkness is set with thirty-six black opals along its lower edge and a great black sapphire in the front.

With a command word, the wearer can bring forth a darkness effect.  The power issues from the sapphire, which can generate fifty such effects before crumpling to useless dust.

The helm is also capable of absorbing significant amounts of cold damage. The wearer is also immune to death magic and fear effects and can see through any form of darkness as though it were daylight.

Such helms are rumored to slowly corrupt their wearers to bend to Shar&apos;s whim, so that ultimately the Dark Goddess gains a powerful follower by greatly warding the victim in what her clerics often refer to as the subject&apos;s &quot;infancy.&quot;</string>

<string name="40988">Necromancer&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="40989">This small, leather-bound journal is filled with notes written in a hurried and almost-indecipherable script. Most of them seem to relate to the complex creation of some kind of gargoyle statue that will bestow magical power upon the necromancer&apos;s ally... who, by the description, is undoubtedly Baram.

One of the last notes reads:
&quot;The latest statues have been fired and inscribed with all the proper runes. Our ally wishes to use them immediately, even though we have warned him that they will be very fragile until they have time to properly set! He is far too impatient!&quot;</string>
<string name="40990">Parchment</string>
<string name="40991">This lengthy sheet of aged and yellowed parchment contains several complex drawings annotated in a strange language. The impression one gets at a glance is that the contents involve some form of necromantic ritual.

On the reverse side is written the following:

&quot;Sisters of the night,

&quot;It falls on you to see the ritual through that will provide Baram with the army he requires. This akhamic ritual will infuse the bones of the long-buried with the spirits of the mourned and form a powerful mummy construct. Baram should be pleased with the results.

&quot;So long as you read the words of the ritual, you will be protected from harm. Allow nothing to distract you. Ensure that the skeletal priests continue their worship unhindered and that the tablets remain intact or your ritual will be worthless.

&quot;Success will bring you great status within the new order, so you are promised.&quot;

It is signed with one name: &quot;Maugrim.&quot;</string>
<string name="40992">Smooth Token</string>
<string name="40993">This small piece of metal appears to be a token or coin of some kind. It has absolutely no features embossed upon it, however, and its odd warmth and lightness suggest it is no ordinary metal.</string>
<string name="40994">Bottle of Sewage</string>
<string name="40995">Burke&apos;s Manual</string>
<string name="40996">This dusty tome is filled with tight script by a wizard who names himself &quot;Burke.&quot; By the writings within, it appears that this place was once his own home, and his experiments revolved around the creation of a permanent dimensional aperture through which he could summon and control planar creatures.

The wizard notes several times that High Captain Kurth wishes to use the aperture for his own purposes and has become quite demanding. This made the wizard nervous enough that he jotted down some thoughts on how to close the aperture, if necessary. He notes that he possesses a sphere filled with water from Celestia and a sample of abyssal metal elsewhere in his home. Placed together in the aperture, these would bring about the desired disruption.

His only concern about doing such a thing is that the magic that controlled the planar creatures summoned by the aperture would also be disrupted, resulting in chaos.</string>
<string name="40997">Yvette&apos;s Baby</string>
<string name="40998">Aarin&apos;s Amulet</string>
<string name="40999">The Spymaster Aarin Gend is said to have given this amulet to his lover during their search for the cultists of Neverwinter. Wrought from gold, its heavy base bears markings from far-off Chult. It is set with a single, polished moonstone that seems to glow as if from within.</string>
<string name="41000">Aribeth&apos;s Ring</string>
<string name="41001">Lady Aribeth, Paladin of Neverwinter, gave this ring to one of her city&apos;s heroes as a token of their friendship. The thick band of gold inlaid with elven figures has a look that is both striking and graceful.</string>
<string name="41002">Clothing: Commoner</string>
<string name="41003">Evaine&apos;s Ring</string>
<string name="41004">This ring belongs to Elynwyd, who gave it to you in case you should find Evaine.</string>
<string name="41005">Head of the Troll Chieftain</string>
<string name="41006">The eyes of the decapitated troll chieftain seem to follow you from within their sunken sockets. Even though you were sure to sear the neck stump over the campfire, the thought of it somehow regenerating within your pack still haunts you. You can&apos;t wait to find Lenton and leave the accursed thing on his doorstop in exchange for his promised reward.</string>
<string name="41007">This key feels warm to the touch. It was found in a chest owned by the escaped convict, Yesgar, deep in the mines of Port Llast. It probably opens further doors within those darkened depths.</string>
<string name="41008">Yesgar&apos;s Key</string>
<string name="41009">Dydd&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="41010">This the journal of one Dydd, another contestant of the Gauntlet. The last entry seems to make reference the riddle with the numbered doors in the room where his body lies:

Curse this riddle! As near as I can tell the grand daughters that the riddle mentions expand in a pattern. 4 to 5 to 7 to 11? What comes next? It isn&apos;t 16. That is all that I know.</string>
<string name="41011">Wanev&apos;s Wardstone</string>
<string name="41012">A tower, framed by forked lightning, has been engraved into this rough stone, as have a number of arcane symbols. On the back is the sigil of Wanev, a wizard of Port Llast. It appears to be a wardstone granting access to his tower south of town.</string>
<string name="41013">Mayor Kendrack made this key available upon learning that the escaped convict, Yesgar, had locked himself within the Port Llast mines. While the key will open the mine&apos;s main entrance, other keys will be still be required beyond that point.</string>
<string name="41014">Port Llast Mine Key</string>
<string name="41015">Imaskarran Tome of Death</string>
<string name="41016">This heavy and tattered tome is labeled with a large and ancient rune that translates simply to &apos;Death&apos;. Among its more interesting passages is the following:

&quot;The Ettercap Silk Gland is a substance known to augment and accentuate the capabilities of other reagents, and is therefore quite popular amongst the scholars of wizardry. The Skeleton Knuckle is a popular reagent to combine with the gland because the solidifying of the boundaries between life and death causes brief flickers in existence, allowing the wielder to temporarily become invisible. However, when further empowered with the spell Improved Invisibility, the end result is much more stable, and allows for the wielder to maintain more control over the boundaries of magic, life and death.&quot;</string>
<string name="41017">Imaskarran Tome of Fire</string>
<string name="41018">This heavy and tattered tome is labeled with a large and ancient rune that translates simply to &apos;Fire&apos;. Among its more interesting passages is the following:

&quot;The Fire Beetle Belly is an amazing organ that manages to retain its full heat, even after the beetle&apos;s death. When combined with the resilience of the Quartz Crystal, and then empowered with the spell Fireball, the end result is a device that can emit bursts of fire at will. The creation of most fire-based wands is based on this simple formula.&quot;</string>
<string name="41019">Imaskarran Tome of Ice</string>
<string name="41020">This heavy and tattered tome is labeled with a large and ancient rune that translates simply to &apos;Ice&apos;. Among its more interesting passages is the following:

&quot;Calling forth the icy grip of death within the constraints of a spell too often results in the death of the caster and target alike. Yet if the reagent of death, in this case the Skeleton Knuckle, is gripped within the strength of the Quartz Crystal and then the spell Mage Armor is cast, the tendrils of death are redirected. This potent magic effect has been placed on more than one amulet hung close to the wearer&apos;s heart, a ward to keep death at arm&apos;s length a while longer.&quot;</string>
<string name="41021">Imaskarran Tome of Life</string>
<string name="41022">This heavy and tattered tome is labeled with a large and ancient rune that translates simply to &apos;Life&apos;. Among its more interesting passages is the following:

&quot;By using an Endure Elements spell to protect their essences, a Fen Berry and a Quartz crystal can be combined. The powerful magical energy that results from their union can then be used to craft a magical ring.&quot;</string>
<string name="41023">Imaskarran Tome of Resonance</string>
<string name="41024">This heavy and tattered tome is labeled with a large and ancient rune that translates simply to &apos;Resonance&apos;. Among its more interesting passages is the following:

&quot;The Ettercap Silk Gland is a substance known to augment and accentuate the capabilities of other reagents, and is therefore quite popular amongst the scholars of wizardry. When combined with a Fen Berry and the spell Lightning Bolt, a magical mass is created that shimmers and glows while maintaining the electric charge of the spell. Those who have experimented with this mass find that the creation shows a resistance to many magical effects. It can only be guessed that the nature-bound regenerative focus of the Fen Berry discharges Faerun&apos;s often-magical effects, while the Silk maintains the power of the Lightning Bolt.&quot;</string>
<string name="41025">Wyvern&apos;s Ear</string>
<string name="41026">This ragged ear bears a tattoo of the Bastion, a well-known prison of Waterdeep. The number corresponds to that of an escaped convict named Wyvern. Kendrack, the Mayor of Port Llast, will be pleased to learn that its former owner has fallen upon misfortune.</string>
<string name="41027">Stirge&apos;s Ear</string>
<string name="41028">This ragged ear bears a tattoo of the Bastion, a well-known prison of Waterdeep. The number corresponds to that of an escaped convict named Stirge. Kendrack, the Mayor of Port Llast, will be pleased to learn that its former owner has fallen upon misfortune.</string>
<string name="41029">Delilah&apos;s Ear</string>
<string name="41030">This ragged ear bears a tattoo of the Bastion, a well-known prison of Waterdeep. The number corresponds to that of an escaped convict named Delilah. Kendrack, the Mayor of Port Llast, will be pleased to learn that its former owner has fallen upon misfortune.</string>
<string name="41031">Head of the Bugbear Chieftain</string>
<string name="41032">Caked with dirt and half-dried blood, this gruesome trophy should be sufficient evidience to prove the death of the bugbear chieftain waylaying travellers along the North Road.</string>
<string name="41033">Crystal Egg</string>
<string name="41034">Light shimmers within this finely engraved crystal egg. Dangling from a simple gold chain, it may be the prize required to complete Mutamin&apos;s Challenge in the basement of the Green Griffon Inn.</string>
<string name="41035">Crystal Frog</string>
<string name="41036">Fashioned from cut crystal, this frog seems so lifelike that you fear it might jump from your hand to shatter on the ground below. It may be the prize required to complete Mutamin&apos;s Challenge in the basement of the Green Griffon Inn.</string>
<string name="41037">Crystal Insect</string>
<string name="41038">Legs wide and crystalline wings spread, this beautiful insectoid statuette may be the prize required to complete Mutamin&apos;s challenge in the basement of the Green Griffon Inn.</string>
<string name="41039">Crystal Skull</string>
<string name="41040">Forboding and almost weightless, this faceted crystal skull may be the prize needed to complete Mutamin&apos;s Challenge in the basement of the Green Griffon Inn.</string>
<string name="41041">It is strange to work so hard for something so small. This key was found in the final puzzle room within Mutamin&apos;s Challenge Dungeon in the Green Griffon Inn. It offers the chance for escape.</string>
<string name="41042">Green Griffon Puzzle Door Key</string>
<string name="41043">The popular Green Griffon Inn, situated between Luskan and Port Llast, is a large establishment and full of secrets. This key grants its wielder access to the Inn&apos;s well-locked basement.</string>
<string name="41044">Green Griffon Basement Key</string>
<string name="41045">Cold as death itself, this key unlocks a mausoleum found in a graveyard along the road to Luskan. The mausoleum is said to house the bones of one of Luskan&apos;s feared Arcane Brothers. </string>
<string name="41046">Mausolem Key</string>
<string name="41047">Wedding Ring</string>
<string name="41048">An inscription around the outside of this simple wedding band reads &quot;To Leah, my love for all of my life. Your husband, Gerrol.&quot;</string>
<string name="41049">Head of the Orc Chieftain</string>
<string name="41050">The head of the Orc Chieftain from the network of caves beneath the North Road.</string>
<string name="41051">Portal Tome</string>
<string name="41052">In my life of travel and study, I have found three great places to which I wish to always return. They are places of wisdom and great consequence! For each I have crafted a portal and for each a stone. Ah, wardstones... They are simple things but they bear the weight of a world within them!

Into each wardstone I have painstakingly etched the name of the place to which their portal leads. All this craftsmanship, all this time... I admit, the task and puzzle of it all has left me quite obsessed! But you should see the pedestal! Ah, now that is the pinnacle of this entire labor of love and genius! So simple, so elegant. One need only place the proper stone (and no other, I have seen to that!) upon the pedestal and the proper portal shall be revealed.

Yes, I am old now and can die a happy man. I think I&apos;ll ask them to bury me here, inside this laboratory, so I can always revel in the glow of my accomplishments. Still, I have a few things to tinker with! Though I&apos;ve now set this task aside, I&apos;ll not while away my final years in idle musings...</string>
<string name="41053">Shadowdale Stone</string>
<string name="41054">This stone seems strangely heavy, as if it bears the weight of some distant world. Etched into its surface is a simple inscription: &quot;Shadowdale.&quot;</string>
<string name="41055">City of the Dead Stone</string>
<string name="41056">This stone seems strangely heavy, as if it bears the weight of some distant world. Etched into its surface is a simple inscription: &quot;The City of the Dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="41057">Dark Wyrm Stone</string>
<string name="41058">This stone seems strangely heavy, as if it bears the weight of some distant world. Etched into its surface is a simple inscription: &quot;Dark Wyrm.&quot;</string>
<string name="41059">The foul stench of the undead who once held it still permeates this half-rusted key. While it&apos;s hard to say for sure, it seems fair to assume that the key will open a further lock within the Arcane Brother&apos;s tomb where it was found.</string>
<string name="41060">Tomb Key</string>
<string name="41061">Yesgar&apos;s Ear</string>
<string name="41062">This ragged ear bears a tattoo of the Bastion, a well-known prison of Waterdeep. The number corresponds to that of an escaped convict named Yesgar. Kendrack, the Mayor of Port Llast, will be pleased to learn that its former owner has fallen upon misfortune.</string>
<string name="41063">Stout and heavy, this key has been designed to withstand frequent use. It bears the mark of the Green Griffon Inn and a room number on the second floor.</string>
<string name="41064">Zamithra&apos;s Room Key</string>
<string name="41065">Stout and heavy, this key has been designed to withstand frequent use. It bears the mark of the Green Griffon Inn and a room number on the second floor. Judging by the key&apos;s intricacy, however, it fits something more than just an inn-room door. It&apos;s likely for one of the strongboxes that come standard with all of the Green Griffon&apos;s rooms.</string>

<string name="41071">Letter to Neva</string>
<string name="41072">Neva,

Our efforts with the Orc Clans and Uthgardt tribes continue and we are close to a breakthrough. The resulting army, already strong, should be enough to bring about the New and Holy Empire. Not all is as smooth as hoped, however, as some meddlers are proving to be of small but growing concern to our cause, interrupting our search for the artifact in Charwood, the Neverwinter Wood, and the ogre caves north of Port Llast.

I have already sent Solomon against these interlopers but he has failed. If you should fail, I will have to take Vardoc from his current tasks and set him upon them.

In other words, do not fail...
Maugrim Korothir</string>
<string name="41073">Letter to Solomon</string>
<string name="41074">Solomon,

The Old Ones, may they live forever, seek an ancient artifact said to be in the vicinity of Port Llast. I have sent agents to retrieve it but, for you, I have a greater task: There are meddlers about, the very same who thwarted Desther&apos;s good work in Neverwinter. If you succeed, you shall have a place in the heavenly kingdom of our beloved Old Ones... If you fail, your soul be damned and I shall send others to do what you cannot.

Should you require the assistance of other agents, those seeking the artifact have been dispatched to the Neverwinter Wood, the cavern system north of Port Llast, and the remote village of Charwood. Their work is important, however, so do not disturb them without good cause.

Do not fail me,
Maugrim Korothir</string>

As the lycanthropic blood coursed through me, I lashed out at the poor boys and thereby spread this horror all the more. One, at least, escaped my maddened lunge. Ander, the smallest. I can only hope that he makes it back to town and tells his tale to Neurik. Surely the priest will send a hunting party after me.

<string name="41113">The letters swim before your eyes, shaping themselves into text that you can understand. This book seems to be a basic guide for priestly initiates who took care of the ancient tomb in which it was found. One passage catches your eye...

&quot;In the early years of the reign of the Thunder Queen, Lagosra, a call went out for the greatest architects and builders of the age. Kerik, hatched of Menron, came to the king and agreed to build a tomb that would house the rulers of our people for all time.

&quot;Kerik took ten years to complete the project, but when it was finished the citizens of the kingdom gaped in amazement at the wonder that had been wrought. Lagosra was pleased and bestowed upon Kerik the honor of being first sacrifice at the tomb&apos;s blessing.&quot;</string>
<string name="41114">Dread Queen Morag</string>
<string name="41115">The letters in this book swim before your eyes, finally shaping themselves into text that you can understand. It tells the history of a Queen named Morag. While the book is lengthy, one passage of interest tells of Morag&apos;s ascension to the throne.
 
&quot;At the dawning of her first red moon, Morag, the future queen, began her slow and bloody climb toward the seat of power, her sen-mother&apos;s throne. Her ascension to the heights of the Dragon Throne was as that of a slow poison: deadly, inevitable, and filled with fatal pleasures.
 
&quot;Morag&apos;s yolk-sister, Sedat, was the first victim of the rising queen&apos;s awesome cunning. On the day before her ring-stone ceremony, Sedat entered her hibernation chambers to meditate. Out of the fire&apos;s glowing embers crawled a venomous Zelfit. When the priestess arrived to escort Sedat to the ceremonial chambers the next morning, she found the limp, dead husk of the favored child.

&quot;So it was that Morag, our blessed Dreadqueen, made the first move in her Game of Maids. Many moons later it would lead to the Siege of Tykalat, where she would take the head of her sen-mother and display it in glorious triumph to her adoring throng. Thus began the rule of our all-magnificent Queen Morag.&quot;

<string name="41119">The letters in this book swim before your eyes, finally shaping themselves into text you are capable of understanding. The book speaks of many things and appears to prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that a creator race lived in these ruins. A certain passage catches your eye...

&quot;In 501 SD, a few thousand members of the enslaved race revolted. The uprising took several years to quell, the most successful uprising the slaves had experienced to date. Though far from posing a military threat, the slaves complicated the recapture process by hiding in caves along the Sentiege Range where they lived like savages. 

&quot;Further complications came in the form of the draconic presence in the Sentienge, as they refused to bow to our will. The dragons were defeated in the Second Great War of Hiromire, however, and our hunters were finally able to recover the missing slaves.

&quot;As is customary, the elderly were eliminated, the young males crippled and sent to work in the iron mines, and the virile females were returned to the pens for the purposes of breeding.&quot;</string>

<string name="41147">Spirit Poison</string>
<string name="41148">Relmar&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="41149">This is a journal, obviously written by the dwarf Relmar before he went insane. It details much of his journey to the Spirit&apos;s realm. There are several sections of particular note.

Entry # 32.
Word came down from Maugrim in the tower in Luskan today. I&apos;m being sent to Neverwinter Wood with some lackeys to attack some spirit creature. The bloody wizard&apos;s given me a vial of poison, supposed to be incurable, short of the single-shot antidote he gave me. I&apos;m not sure why he gave me the antidote though. Possibly I could use it for bartering for something, though Talos only knows what we&apos;re searching for. Some of his wizards are coming with us. They&apos;d better not get in my way or I&apos;ll...

Entry # 34.
... stupid wizards want to kill me. They say it&apos;s the only way to enter this other realm. I&apos;ll be damned if I let some bony-arsed ...

Entry # 39.
Idiot wizards let it slip that there be three other cult agents in the area. One be holed up in Luskan, (and let me just add that the finest of whorehouses be in that town), the second be exploring some caves to the north of Port Llast, while the other be in Charwood, a place I know precious little about. I&apos;m thinking that when me adventure here be done, there may be a wee bit of gold to be earned with such information.

Entry # 52
... and a damn-fine pickle me be in now. Hork and Tythit both are dead, killed by the Spirit while I poisoned the tree. Then those... wizards took off and left me here to die. I don&apos;t know how, but ya can count on Relmar to find his way back home and when I do...

Entry # 57.
What be wrong with this place? Every landmark disappears without a trace. It seems like there be no way out. It makes me want to shout... What the blazes am I rhyming for? I don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening, but I decided I had better hide the antidote to the poison, before I get jumped by the Spirit. All blasted night the thing wails. Last night I just about got up and took the antidote over to pour on its tree. Can&apos;t imagine what I was thinking...

The last entry is almost incomprehensible, as the ability to think or write coherently seems to have been stripped from the dwarf&apos;s mind. It does mention something about a pile of rocks to the northwest of the Spirit.</string>
<string name="41150">The only antidote for the poison that has weakened and crazed the Spirit of the Wood. Found in a pile of rubble in the Spirit&apos;s realm.</string>
<string name="41151">Spirit Poison Antidote</string>
<string name="41152">A putrid slime coats the grooves and etchings of this horrid key. It was found in the troll caves that emerge onto the plains east of Port Llast and no doubt unlocks some further horror there within.</string>
<string name="41153">Mirror of Vanity</string>
<string name="41154">The magic Mirror of Vanity offers the viewer an image of themselves that is incredibly attractive. In fact, the image is so perfect that many viewers become lost in the illusion, believing themselves to hold greater physical charms than they truly do.</string>
<string name="41155">This mirror seems to offer you an unusually flattering image of yourself. Something seems strange.</string>
<string name="41156">Troll Note</string>
<string name="41157">The handwriting in this letter is blotted out with numerous bloodstains. A part of it remains legible, however:
 
&quot;Dear Amatia, 

&quot;These caves are deep and dangerous. We&apos;ve found layers and layers of caves but there is construction down at the bottom, and prison cells right before the crypts we seek. 

&quot;We tried to get Darius out, but barely escaped ourselves. We&apos;re going back tomorrow, love, to try again. I hope I&apos;ll get a chance to send this to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="41158">Treatise on the Spirit of the Wood</string>
<string name="41159">This musty old tome appears to be the type of book that was written and never read. It is a long, boring text written by a druid, Jordius Caini Getafix III, several hundred years ago. It uses large, complicated and often seemingly meaningless words to discuss his observations on the Spirit of the Neverwinter Wood. One page in the text has been earmarked and there is a small comment beside an underlined passage in the margin.

&quot;This could mean that if one stood in the pool, below the waterfall, and somehow died, one could reappear, alive (presumably) in the realm of the Spirit.&quot;</string>
<string name="41160">Dead Animal</string>
<string name="41161">The carcass of this animal is beginning to stink.</string>
<string name="41162">Dead Body</string>
<string name="41163">This rigid corpse is curled into a fetal position, its stricken features indecipherable.</string>
<string name="41164">The home of the witchwoman, Setara, in the Neverwinter Wood holds many secrets. Perhaps this wrought-iron key will bring some of them to light...</string>
<string name="41165">Setara&apos;s Key</string>
<string name="41166">Heavy and dull, this iron key fits the barracks at the archeologists&apos; camp on the road east of Port Llast.</string>

<string name="41168">Peasant&apos;s Brooch</string>
<string name="41169">This simple brooch has a short engraving: &quot;To my dear son Erik. You will always be in my heart. Love, Ma.&quot;</string>
<string name="41170">Silverback&apos;s Head</string>
<string name="41171">This is the head of the dire wolf, Silverback. She preyed upon cattle from a cave near the Charwood.</string>
<string name="41172">Wolf Pelt</string>
<string name="41173">While a little nicked and scarred, this wolf pelt still looks like it could fetch a fair price.</string>
<string name="41174">Charwood Cultist&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="41175">I have killed them. Killed them all yet still they come, again and again! All of this and I have yet to find the Old One&apos;s precious artifact. I am at the edge of my sanity but I must press on. To return to Luskan&apos;s iron tower empty-handed is to tempt the wrath of our great leader, Maugrim.

True, it has been an honor to serve the Cult of the Eye. If only I could have seen Neverwinter as it suffered. Instead I am stuck here in the Charwood, too tired to carry on yet too driven to turn away...

Hush, here they come to be killed once more. The longer I stay here, the more I become like them, it seems. I doubt I&apos;ll ever see my home again.</string>

<string name="41180">This note was found in the eastern passage of Castle Jhareg&apos;s main floor. It chastises you in its graceful scrawl:

&quot;To be Judge is to be a ship upon a sea of great Regret. If you shift the ballast of your Compassion wholly to starboard or to port, you will capsize and be Lost beneath the waves. For even Compassion cannot bring the dead to life nor change the horror of the past. Remember this lesson when it comes time to Judge.&quot;</string>
<string name="41181">This note was found in the central passage of Castle Jhareg&apos;s main floor. It congratulates you in its graceful scrawl:

&quot;Straight is the path of True Justice and narrow are its ways. Though no choice is free of Consequence, you have chosen wisely and earned your due reward. Remember this lesson when it comes time to Judge.&quot;</string>
<string name="41182">Letter by a Strange Hand</string>
<string name="41183">Written in a strange but delicate hand, this note was found alongside a key in the foyer of Castle Jhareg. It appears to be a riddle of some sort and reads as follows:

&quot;The Three Paths of Justice

&quot;Wary must be the Judge and straight His course, for His one hand is burnt by the fire of treachery and His other chilled by the ghosts of vengeance. The True Path of Justice lies with the Heart and Head for only with Reason can He determine the Truth and only with Compassion can He know its Consequences.&quot;</string>

<string name="41188">Wanev&apos;s Bedroom Journal</string>
<string name="41189">This appears the be a journal of one Wanev, a mage. It reads: &quot;Curse the demon ale! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! I have no idea where I&apos;ve put the ingredients for the recipe. How drunk was I? What was the blonde&apos;s name? Curses! If I can&apos;t find the ingredients, I can&apos;t get into my den! I think I left my wardstone and journal in there. What was I supposed to tell the bugbears again?!&quot; There are numerous expletives here. Then: &quot;I intend to return to my tower and never return to this stupid overpriced cottage! Thank the gods that I&apos;ve nothing worse than trolls guarding the back way. Stupid wardstone...&quot;</string>
<string name="41190">Wanev&apos;s Cookbook</string>
<string name="41191">This appears to be a recipe for something revolting. It reads: &quot;Por. Stew - Slaad Tongues ground with fire beetle belly make the base. Place in brazier. Add 2 parts skeleton knuckles and stir. Note to self: Smells disgusting. Drink heavily before mixing.&quot;</string>
<string name="41192">A tag tied to this well-ornamented piece of tin identifies it as the key to a Port Llast cottage owned by Wanev, a local wizard.</string>

<string name="41194">Wanev&apos;s Lab Journal</string>
<string name="41195">This appears to be plans for tower construction written by one Wanev, a mage. A section catches your eye: &quot;At last my tower defences are complete! The gates require my wardstone and the caves are heavily guarded. Note to self: The bugbears are idiots. They simply must learn not to all rush to the alarm gong every time it&apos;s sounded. While they are all milling about the gong, someone could slip into the empty barracks and right to the portal. I&apos;d best take this journal back to the tower or I&apos;ll forget to tell the fools.&quot;</string>

These northern wastes are a brutal land but so full of magic! If only I could be undying, then my studies could go on unhindered by this call of mortal flesh.

I can hear Quint&apos;s voice cutting through the walls as he reads to the children in the Library. I can hear their laughter. Belial says they must die tonight.

Off to the village then, to spread the good news.</string>

Notes on the Crafting of Divine Potions:

The crafting of the more typical divine potions is generally very simple, requiring only a healer&apos;s kit, an empty and well-cleansed bottle into which you shall decant the potion, and the casting of the desired spell. Be careful, however, as not all spells will result in a potion and a wrongful casting can prove quite painful. It is best to start on potions with which you are already familiar...</string>

<string name="41218">Ganon&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="41219">I find I&apos;ve grown fond of the monsters in these caves. They are savage, violent, and easily whipped into a frenzy by my puppet ogre mage Dergiab. Not entirely unlike the rest of us who have turned following Maugrim into a religion... He the puppeteer, we his willing puppets. We chant his name through every hall of his Host Tower and dance down Luskan streets to do his bidding.

And to think he sent me here to search for some ancient artifact! It isn&apos;t in this place. It would have left some tell-tale sign. It would *want* to be found. It would call me to it. So, instead of being a puppet, I have become the puppeteer. Not so grand as Maugrim but, even so, look how Dergiab struts and schemes at my bidding... </string>

<string name="41232">This journal is written in a graceful hand by someone going by the name of Elminster the Sage. The journal details some of Elminster&apos;s experiments in his lab. One particular passage catches your eye:

&quot;A most wonderful staff can be summoned if one can simply find the right reagents. Indeed, I need only a Rakshasa&apos;s Eye, which I have right here, and some Ironwood. Now where did I put that... Regardless, once the reagents are placed in the brazier, a simple Blindness spell will complete the ritual.&quot;</string>
<string name="41233">Journal Fragment</string>
<string name="41234">This seems to be a fragment of someone&apos;s journal. The only words that can be made out are: &quot;I have hunted him for years and with a simple bite, he has turned me into the very thing I hate! I could not bear it if those boys remain werewolves! I shall go and try to discover what has happened to them. Until I find them, I will not return to this cave - this prison where I must pay for my mistake.&quot; The cave where this was found show signs of recent human activity though the writer seems to vacated it for the time being.</string>

<string name="41571">Encroachment into elven territory is generally not tolerated, though an exception is occasionally made for those who show proper reverence. Such is the case in the forest of Tethir, where a sect of druids have been welcomed and, on occasion, given special boons for their tireless work. Such gifts have typically taken the form of shared knowledge or the occasional feast. Occasionally, however, elven-crafted items such as this are given, ultimately to find their way to other parts of the Realms entirely.</string>

As the title suggests, this rather hefty tome deals with the lives of heroes and villains. It does not condone or condemn, but instead looks at how history defines the roles they played. A leather bookmark identifies the last passage read.

&quot;The ages have long since turned his enemies to dust, but it has done as much to his own people as well. There is no one left to curse or praise his name. What, therefore, is Maegel now? History cannot judge him hero or villain: he is simply dead. He suffers the same as many others; disinterest has allowed the location of his resting-place to fall into obscurity. The family Ortov has no living extensions, and even the long buried Mirialis Clan founded by his siblings has had its major works removed from the libraries of Candlekeep in favor of books more likely to be of interest to anyone.&quot;

<string name="41628">By Pragmatix the Sage

Excerpt:

&quot;Curses notwithstanding, the debate is ongoing as to whether a great many of these encounters are manifestations of the actual dead creature or merely phantoms of what they represented in life. Many philosophers maintain that such a fate does not bode well for a purposeful afterlife, especially if the first several hundred years of death are spent waiting for some apathetic adventurer to guess the names of your stepchildren, or figure out that a &quot;tooth in the ocean&quot; is an iceberg. Such a function would be far better performed by a simple triggered cantrip: a projection that assumes the tedium of delivering postmortem messages, hopefully allowing the deceased to get on with the business of resting in peace.&quot;</string>
<string name="41629">On Riddles and the Dead</string>
<string name="41630">This person appears to have died scrawling out their last words on the floor. The cold, dry air in this part of the caves has preserved much of his corpse. He looks to have been an adventurer of sorts, or at least a well-equipped spelunker. His foot is twisted at a most uncomfortable angle.</string>
<string name="41631">The seams of this once-fine backpack are barely holding together.</string>
<string name="41632">This sack was not placed here gently. Several potions have spilled together in a volatile combination that has dissolved away the bottom of the bag. Any movement could spill the contents across the floor.</string>
<string name="41633">Loot Bag</string>
<string name="41634">I was Glavius, that quested to fulfill the great destiny of Maegel. Tripped and broke my ankle. Lost my picks. Food running out.

<string name="41692">Though there are numerous examples of such rings, this one may have come from a set once owned by a master thief who worked Waterdhavian crowds in broad daylight, replacing purses with bags of sand.

<string name="41712">Dear Journal,

I met Yesgar, the escaped convict my father is hunting, and fell instantly in love. We have already laid plans to run away together and get away from this stupid town. But I won&apos;t go without a dowry and, seeing my father won&apos;t give it freely, I&apos;ll have to force it from him! Yesgar and I have planned to take some of the townsfolk hostage and demand a ransom as my dowry. We&apos;ll then fake our own deaths and be done with Port Llast and my father forever! I have already written a false journal to convince my father that I am dead by Yesgar&apos;s hand.</string>
<string name="41713">The Silk Gland of the spider-like Ettercap is a substance known to augment and accentuate the capabilities of other reagents. The Skeleton Knuckle is a popular reagent to combine with the gland because the solidifying of the boundaries between life and death causes brief flickers in existence, allowing the wielder to temporarily become invisible. However, when further empowered with the spell Improved Invisibility, the end result is much more stable, and allows for the wielder to maintain more control over the boundaries of magic, life and death.</string>
<string name="41714">This ragged ear bears a tattoo of the Bastion, a well-known prison of Waterdeep. The number corresponds to that of an escaped convict named The Stirge. Kendrack, the Mayor of Port Llast, will be pleased to learn that its former owner has fallen upon misfortune.</string>
<string name="41715">This ragged ear bears a tattoo of the Bastion, a well-known prison of Waterdeep. The number corresponds to that of an escaped convict named Zor. Kendrack, the Mayor of Port Llast, will be pleased to learn that its former owner has fallen upon misfortune.</string>

<string name="41717">These twisted rods emanate an aura of evil even while inactive, and fill all who gaze upon them with a sense of sharp unease. Capable of projecting a wave of unspeakable horror upon a single foe, filling even the hardiest soul with acute dread, these items were certainly intended for nefarious purposes.</string>
<string name="41718">Staffs of this kind provide much needed protection for spellcasters who prefer to forgo constraining armor. The level of protection varies with each, but all enhance some aspect of defense. Most bear no specific maker&apos;s mark, as they are created for utility rather than notoriety.</string>
<string name="41719">Of all the magic tools sold to adventurers and militias, Wands of Arcane Disjunction cause the most dissent and argument among wizards and sorcerers. While the market cannot be denied, some find it disturbing that one enterprising spellcaster would sell the very thing that may mean the death of another. Sellers don&apos;t mind the debate. Controversy means an increase in demand.</string>
<string name="41720">It was once believed that constructing a Wand of Fear required the arm of a lich, but artificers making them today have proven this to be mere superstition. While most examples do contain fragments of bone, it need not come from such a powerful undead creature. Skeletons serve just as well, and are far less resilient in their objections to the procedure.</string>
<string name="41721">Wands of Fire draw upon a discipline of magic that has been studied and venerated for centuries, one whose practitioners are so varied that there can be no determining where the concept originated. It can be said, however, that most modern refinements in the design of such items occurred in Thay, where worship of the Firelord Kossuth is widespread.</string>
<string name="41722">Wands of Lightning are actually very unstable, at least in the formative stages of their construction. Many an inexperienced mage has found his laboratory the site of a sudden squall or charged fog, having failed to speak the proper incantations in just the right manner. It is said that elder wizards have allowed tomes with faulty rituals to be circulated, hoping to indirectly teach some humility.</string>
<string name="41723">Those who create items of this type are not quick to let their names be known, as they are often accused of cruelty or treacherous behavior. As useful as Wands of Paralyzation are, they are forever linked to tales of otherwise strong people being rendered helpless and forced to endure gods know what, and that never sits well with a tavern crowd. </string>
<string name="41724">A Wand of Mists can be very volatile, and these items are said to have caused more accidental or self-inflicted adventuring deaths than almost any other magic tool associated with the trade. The vapors and similar emissions can overwhelm unexpectedly, and the areas affected are not always obvious, but the possible danger rarely stops buyers from buying. Dungeon delving is not a calling for the overly cautious.</string>
<string name="41725">The potency of a Wand of Summoning owes much to the ancient magics crafted by followers of forgotten beast totems, though the modern example can hardly be called a divinely-inspired item. Sorcerers and wizards take inspiration from many places, and the resulting mix of incantations often bear little resemblance to the rituals they might have once been a part of. </string>

It is not known if this particular example was created to aid in the good works of a saint or prolong the ills of an overlord, for such rods are indiscriminate in their choice of masters.</string>
<string name="41735">A Wand of the Heavens can be said to represent a focal point and reservoir for divine power flowing directly from the cosmos in a thematic rather than denominational fashion. It is a meandering description that some say is no more confusing than the wishes of the individual gods themselves. Of course, while some may indeed say that, they do not say so very loudly.</string>

The two goddesses fought over the girl and, in their folly, destroyed her. A single glance from Selune turned the girl into moonlight, all silver and transparent. As the struggle continued, a goblet of wine fell from Selune&apos;s feasting table, splashing onto Amethyst and granting her her purple hue.</string>
<string name="41744">Unlike its more common cousins, the Fire Opal is full of vibrant hues: hot yellows, oranges, and reds so bright they look as if they might cast a light all their own.

<string name="41842">What children? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="41843">Children? You mean Londa&apos;s children?</string>
<string name="41844">What children? What you talks &apos;bout?</string>
<string name="41845">Children? You means Londa&apos;s kids?</string>
<string name="41846">I... it is horrible, horrible! All the children... gone... </string>
<string name="41847">Londa... Miss Londa&apos;s children... I am their nanny... </string>
<string name="41848">Yes... yes, you know of them? I... I am their nanny... </string>
<string name="41849">It was horrible! He... the High Captain, he... took the children from Miss Londa&apos;s home. He... threw me to these spiders, and... and...</string>
<string name="41850">(sob!) He had the bigger children turned into... into creatures like himself. The... the smaller ones he gave to the other creature to... to... (sob!) All dead. All of them...</string>
<string name="41851">This... this is all I have left of them. Find... find Miss Londa and give it to her. Tell her I *tried* to save them... it was no use...</string>
<string name="41852">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Give him the pass]&lt;/Start&gt; Here you go.</string>
<string name="41853"></string>
<string name="41854"></string>
<string name="41855"></string>
<string name="41856"></string>
<string name="41857"></string>
<string name="41858"></string>
<string name="41859"></string>
<string name="41860">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Threaten]&lt;/Start&gt; You dare question me?!</string>
<string name="41861">Does the tower inform you of all their guests?</string>
<string name="41862">You will let me in before I grow... angry.</string>
<string name="41863">Fine, I&apos;ll just kill you now.</string>
<string name="41864">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Threaten]&lt;/Start&gt; You questions me?!</string>
<string name="41865">Wizards tell you &apos;bout all guests, huh?</string>
<string name="41866">You lets me in or me gets very mad!</string>
<string name="41867">Okays, me kills you now.</string>
<string name="41868">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I am the Mulhorandi ambassador, I assure you.</string>
<string name="41869">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Me Mulhorandi ambassador, me assures you, okays?</string>
<string name="41870">Are you refusing me entry?</string>
<string name="41871">You saying me cannot go in?</string>
<string name="41872">That&apos;s it. You&apos;re a dead man.</string>
<string name="41873">That it. You dead man, now.</string>
<string name="41874">Hail and well met, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I understand from your pass that you are part of a delegation from Mulhorand, yes?</string>
<string name="41875">What?! How did you get across the bridge?! Intruders in the tower!!</string>
<string name="41876"></string>
<string name="41877"></string>
<string name="41878">That seems... an excessively far distance to travel. I have been informed of no invitation made to the Mulhorandi. We certainly were not expecting you.</string>
<string name="41879">There&apos;s no need for you to get upset, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... it just strikes me as odd, is all.</string>
<string name="41880">Well... most of the time they do, aye. Since the chaos of the battles in the tower, things have grown lax, but still...</string>
<string name="41881">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Err... of course not, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Tempus knows the wizards have been getting enough visitors since the fighting stopped.</string>
<string name="41882">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Keeping the security of the tower is one of my duties, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I am only doing what I must.</string>
<string name="41883">Mulhorand... I have met several people from your land. They were dark-skinned and dressed rather extravagantly. You... look nothing like them.</string>
<string name="41884">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Fair enough. I am not about to question the pass, at any rate. Tempus knows the wizards have been getting enough visitors.</string>
<string name="41885">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The wizards have been getting plenty of visitors... representatives from throughout the north, in fact. None from such a far off place as Mulhorand, however. How conveniently difficult to verify.</string>
<string name="41886">Allow me to open the door for you, then.</string>
<string name="41887">I... suppose not, no. The mages have been notoriously difficult for me to contact since the fighting ceased, anyway, and your seal is legitimate. Tempus knows they&apos;ve received enough visitors as of late.</string>
<string name="41888">I suggest you take the empty suite just inside the door on the right, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. You will have to wait with the other ambassadors for someone to come and get you.</string>
<string name="41889">I warn you now that it may be awhile before anyone comes. A new Archmage Arcane was appointed after the fighting in the tower, but I understand things are still quite chaotic.</string>
<string name="41890">I would also suggest that you not venture past the main chamber. The fighting may be over, but the wizards would mistake you for an intruder if you went where you were not permitted. Right now they are in no mood to ask questions. I&apos;m sure you understand.</string>
<string name="41891">You are free to enter the tower, if you wish. Remember, do not venture beyond the ambassadorial quarters.</string>
<string name="41892">You will need to speak to our captain, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="41893">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="41894">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="41895">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="41896">Why are you here, exactly?</string>
<string name="41897">Why you here?</string>
<string name="41898">What do you know about the tower?</string>
<string name="41899">What you know &apos;bout wizard tower?</string>
<string name="41900">How do I get around this place?</string>
<string name="41901">How me gets around here?</string>
<string name="41902">Who are you?</string>
<string name="41903">Who you?</string>
<string name="41904">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="41905">What you mean?</string>
<string name="41906">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Of course, I knew you were important right away.</string>
<string name="41907">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Yeah, me knew you big and important whole time.</string>
<string name="41908">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; Of course you&apos;re important... you&apos;re so big and strong.</string>
<string name="41909">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; Of course you important. You is so big and strong... </string>
<string name="41910">You&apos;ll answer my questions now, orc!</string>
<string name="41911">You answer questions, orc, or you pay!</string>
<string name="41912">Forget I asked.</string>
<string name="41913">Forget me asks, then.</string>
<string name="41914">What did you say about the wizards?</string>
<string name="41915">What you say &apos;bout wizards?</string>
<string name="41916">Tell me about the Arcane Brotherhood.</string>

<string name="41920">Tell me about this Maugrim.</string>
<string name="41921">Tell me &apos;bout Maugrim.</string>
<string name="41922">The new Archmage Arcane? What happened to the old one?</string>
<string name="41923">New wizard leader? What happen to old one?</string>
<string name="41924">What does he want, do you know?</string>
<string name="41925">What he wants? You know?</string>
<string name="41926">New wizard?</string>
<string name="41927">Let me ask you something else.</string>
<string name="41928">Me ask something else.</string>
<string name="41929">What is this army for?</string>
<string name="41930">What army for?</string>
<string name="41931">You think the orcs will agree?</string>
<string name="41932">You thinks orcs say yes?</string>
<string name="41933">Aribeth?!</string>
<string name="41934">An orc?! Die, monster!!</string>
<string name="41935">Orc?! You die, monster!!</string>
<string name="41936">But what do the wizards need you for?</string>
<string name="41937">What wizards needs you for?</string>
<string name="41938">Okay, that&apos;s it. Now you die.</string>
<string name="41939">Well, me strong! You die!!</string>
<string name="41940">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, I doubt you know anything, then, being an underling... </string>
<string name="41941">Aaargh, now you dies!!</string>
<string name="41942">Huh? Wizards bring you to bargain with them? Me tells them King Obould is all they needs! They not need you or nobody else!</string>
<string name="41943">Hmph. Wizards no need you. They only needs me!</string>
<string name="41944">You go. You tells wizards how important me is!</string>
<string name="41945">You leaves me be.</string>
<string name="41946"></string>
<string name="41947">You ask me questions. Go, ask. Me shows you how important me is.</string>
<string name="41948">Why you come here? Me important orc, and not want be disturbed! All wizards need is King Obould, me says! They not need yous!</string>
<string name="41949">You go away! Me not want be distrurbed! Wizards need me, they do, only me! They not need yous or nobody elses!</string>
<string name="41950">Me warrior, great skill. Come to speak with wizards for King Obould Many-Arrows. Greatest chieftain in north, he is. Wizards not need others like you.</string>
<string name="41951">Huh. Orcs many, orcs powerful! Wizards no need others, only needs Obould Many-Arrows! Greatest chieftain, he is.</string>
<string name="41952">Me not says nothing. Me important orc, great warrior! Obould Many-Arrows send me to speak important stuff, me only.</string>
<string name="41953">Hmph. You not smart. Me smarter than you is.</string>
<string name="41954">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. You smart woman, even if you &lt;race&gt; kind. You know important orc warrior when you sees one. Maybe you not so bad.</string>
<string name="41955">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Me not need no &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt; drool over me. You go and leave me, now. Me is very important! Must think about lots!</string>
<string name="41956">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You pretty smart. King Obould Many-Arrows trust me, me is that important! Maybe you not so bad.</string>
<string name="41957">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Me important! More important that yous! You go, now! Me get little sick from greasy &lt;race&gt; smell... </string>
<string name="41958">Me not go far... wizards kill you dead if you try go inside. Me knows lots about wizards, though. Lots and lots.</string>
<string name="41959">Me come to represent Obould Many-Arrows, speak to Maugrim. He new big wizard of tower, me knows... new Archmage Arcane. He ask me to come. </string>
<string name="41960">Not know. Place be big tower, but no halls... no stairs. Not know how wizards get about. They not knows how to build stuff, me thinks.</string>
<string name="41961">Wizard once say they goes from tower to tower through big shiny lights. Magic, maybe. Me not trust magic, would never go into shiny light. Me not stupid.</string>
<string name="41962">Wizard say there be shiny light beyond doors in outer room. Me not see it yet. He say if me go there they kills me good. Me not like fight magic, so me not go. No reason to, anyway.</string>
<string name="41963">They all wizards, lots of wizards with more magic than shaman Brightfist! They very rich and they fights lots with each other, fight to rule all the lands, maybe.</string>
<string name="41964">Wizards kill each other for long time to see who biggest wizard. Big battles in tower, me told, lots of wizards run away and not come back.</string>
<string name="41965">New wizard take over now as biggest wizard... he tell wizards what to do. He invite orcs to come to tower and offers us many things. Wants our help, he does, he is very smart.</string>
<string name="41966">New wizard name is Maugrim. Big human, very strong... very fierce. Me not knows if he leads wizards forever, but he leads wizards for now.</string>
<string name="41967">Maugrim is one who call orcs to tower. He calls many others to tower, too, and is one who tells pirates in city to form armies and fight.</string>
<string name="41968">Eh? What you want?</string>
<string name="41969">Wizards be fighting, of course. Rest of city not know wizards have battle after battle here in tower... many wizards be dead. Fighting still not over.</string>
<string name="41970">Old big wizard run away, me told. Or maybe he be dead. Not know. New wizard now, he be Archmage Arcane... human by name of Maugrim.</string>
<string name="41971">He invite all ambassadors here... he know orcs be very important. Want us to help. He still very busy fighting in tower, though... not have much time to talk to me, which be bad.</string>
<string name="41972">Not know. Wizards fight each other for long time now, in secret. Dead wizards everywhere, and lots flee. Maugrim and followers control tower, now.</string>
<string name="41973">Old wizard come back soon, maybe. Maybe he take back tower. Not matter. Maugrim control tower now, and Maugrim have many plans.</string>
<string name="41974">Maugrim make great army. He make army out of humans in city, out of barbarians... out of orcs, too. Many, many orcs. Wizards have great magic and fight in army... it be very powerful.</string>
<string name="41975">Obould wait long time to make big army. Orcs face human alliance, always gets pushed back. We join with wizards and humans, though, and maybe we win... win big.</string>
<string name="41976">Obould come already, though. Join army even now, no can stop. Me just here to tells wizards so.</string>
<string name="41977">To conquer! We take north, we be promised. First we take human city of Neverwinter, though. Maugrim want Neverwinter very bad.</string>
<string name="41978">Maugrim say army be led by elf woman. Me not like that so much... elfs be dumb and tasty, not good leaders. Maugrim say elf woman Aribeth lead for sure, though.</string>
<string name="41979">Not know elf woman. Hear she very strong, very nasty. Maybe she not so bad. She not tells Obauld what to do, though, that for sure.</string>
<string name="41980">Maugrim very powerful, for human, very dangerous. Has much magic, he does... serve someone else, too, me knows. Me not know who he serves, but has greater power even than him. Many wizards now serve same one that Maugrim does.</string>
<string name="41981">With all power Maugrim has, orcs only do good by his side. If human lives up to bargain, that is.</string>
<string name="41982">No, you dies! Me kills you good!!</string>
<string name="41983">Me not tells! Me on important business, speaks only to wizards.</string>
<string name="41984">Me answers nothing! Me kill you because it fun! Hah!!</string>
<string name="41985">Wha-aat?! Me no underling! Me big and important warrior! Most trusted by Obould Many-Arrows!!</string>
<string name="41986">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="41987">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="41988">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="41989">Why are you here, exactly?</string>
<string name="41990">Why you here?</string>
<string name="41991">What do you know about the tower?</string>
<string name="41992">What you know &apos;bout wizard tower?</string>
<string name="41993">How do I get around this place?</string>
<string name="41994">How me gets around here?</string>
<string name="41995">Who are you?</string>
<string name="41996">Who you?</string>
<string name="41997">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="41998">What you mean?</string>
<string name="41999">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; There is no harm in talking, is there?</string>
<string name="42000">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; There no harms in just talk.</string>
<string name="42001">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m only interested because you&apos;re a beautiful woman... </string>
<string name="42002">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; Me only talks because you is so beautiful... </string>
<string name="42003">You&apos;ll answer my questions or you&apos;ll get hurt.</string>
<string name="42004">You answer questions or me hurt you, got it?</string>
<string name="42005">Forget I asked.</string>
<string name="42006">Forget me asks, then.</string>
<string name="42007">What did you mean about the wizards?</string>
<string name="42008">What you mean &apos;bout wizards?</string>
<string name="42009">I think you&apos;re gorgeous.</string>
<string name="42010">Me think you very beautiful.</string>
<string name="42011">I&apos;m just being friendly... </string>
<string name="42012">Me just be friendly... </string>
<string name="42013">Don&apos;t make me laugh. You smell like a rotting bear carcass.</string>
<string name="42014">Hah! You smells like bear dung. Looks likes it, too.</string>
<string name="42015">Forget I said anything.</string>
<string name="42016">Forget me says anything.</string>
<string name="42017">Tell me about the Arcane Brotherhood.</string>
<string name="42018">What has happened here, as of late?</string>
<string name="42019">Tell me &apos;bout the wizards.</string>
<string name="42020">What happen in tower? What wizards do?</string>
<string name="42021">Tell me about this Maugrim.</string>
<string name="42022">Tell me &apos;bout Maugrim.</string>
<string name="42023">The new Archmage Arcane? What happened to the old one?</string>
<string name="42024">New wizard leader? What happen to old one?</string>
<string name="42025">What does he want, do you know?</string>
<string name="42026">What he wants? You know?</string>
<string name="42027">New leader?</string>
<string name="42028">Let me ask you something else.</string>
<string name="42029">Me ask something else.</string>
<string name="42030">What is this army for?</string>
<string name="42031">What army for?</string>
<string name="42032">You think your people will agree?</string>
<string name="42033">You thinks you people say yes?</string>
<string name="42034">Aribeth?!</string>
<string name="42035">Are you another ambassador? Have these fool wizards invited everyone to their tower, then? They certainly take their time with their dealings, let me warn you.</string>
<string name="42036">You would do well to agree to the wizard&apos;s offer, &lt;man/woman&gt;. It shall be glory, indeed!</string>
<string name="42037">Aye, go. And tell the wizards, if you see them, that I grow impatient.</string>
<string name="42038">Aye, begone then.</string>
<string name="42039"></string>
<string name="42040">Go ahead and ask me your questions, then, if you must.</string>
<string name="42041">Who are you? One of the servants to these damnable wizards, I hope. I have waited longer than I like.</string>
<string name="42042">Yes, what is it? Have the wizards summoned me at last?</string>
<string name="42043">I am Yeanasha, of the Uthgardt Elk tribe. I have come to speak to these wizards at their own invitation, though they seem intent on keeping me waiting.</string>
<string name="42044">I mean that these fools wish to curry favor with the Elk tribe, and are doing a foul job of it. I despise waiting, yet it seems all I do here.</string>
<string name="42045">Questions, is it? Why should Yeanasha answer any of your questions, &lt;man/woman&gt;? The business of the Elk tribe is not your own.</string>
<string name="42046">I shall. Was there something else you wanted, &lt;man/woman&gt;?</string>
<string name="42047">Oh? A man of action, is it? I doubted I would find such amongst the mincing perfumed folk of this settlement.</string>
<string name="42048">I prefer directness, though were you a woman of my own tribe I would strike you down for speaking to me such.</string>
<string name="42049">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Is that so? Is this simply some frilly mincing of you civilized men, or do you actually find Yeanasha pleasing to your gaze?</string>
<string name="42050">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I need no fawning man such as you drooling over me. Begone, if you&apos;ve nothing better to offer.</string>
<string name="42051">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose there is not, at that. I have little else to do, since the fool wizards have left me to my own devices.</string>
<string name="42052">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps not, but I&apos;ve no desire to speak to some perfumed fool. Go question the orc in the next room and leave me be.</string>
<string name="42053">Hmph. Well, you&apos;ve a smooth tongue on you, that&apos;s for certain. Fair enough... you may stay.</string>
<string name="42054">Hmph. For a man with a thick tongue and a thicker head, you&apos;ve at least a little sense.</string>
<string name="42055">Oh, is that so? And you think a compliment or two will make the barbarian woman swoon, is that it? Pfeh.</string>
<string name="42056">Ha ha! Now you sound like the real men I am used to.</string>
<string name="42057">I know a little, though I have not traveled beyond these quarters. Why? What is it you wish to know?</string>
<string name="42058">I am here at the request of Maugrim, the new Archmage Arcane of the Brotherhood. He has been meeting with many ambassadors, I understand.</string>
<string name="42059">It is a large building... far larger than we care to build in the lands I come from. The wizards do not connect their rooms with such simple things as stairs and doors, either, from what I can see.</string>
<string name="42060">The wizards travel from area to area in the tower through shining columns of light. How they do this I do not even wish to know.</string>
<string name="42061">There be one of them columns just beyond the end of the hall... but do not go there. One dark-skinned ambassador became curious and was killed swiftly. The wizards do not tolerate intrusion.</string>
<string name="42062">Do you not know of them? They be a group of wizards who wish to rule as much of the north as they can grasp, as I understand it.</string>
<string name="42063">They have never ruled much more than Luskan, itself, but that be the way of things. Their plans be kept private, more than most.</string>
<string name="42064">They involve themselves with few outsiders. Or did, once, until this new leader of theirs came to the fore.</string>
<string name="42065">Aye. His name be Maugrim, a fierce man. He took power here amidst great fighting... many of the wizards lie dead in these walls, and the battles be not done.</string>
<string name="42066">This Maugrim claims victory, however, and it be he who has called so many ambassadors here to speak with them.</string>
<string name="42067">What now, then?</string>
<string name="42068">The wizards be no different then the rest of this perfumed, rotten city. They have been battling each other to see who shall rule the tower, of course.</string>
<string name="42069">As I hear it, the tower is littered with the bodies of the dead. This Maugrim fellow seems to have won, however, and declared himself the new Archmage Arcane.</string>
<string name="42070">It is he that invited all the ambassadors here... though he has done a poor job of speaking to us as he should.</string>
<string name="42071">I do not know. There have been many battles in these towers, I am told, that have brought this Maugrim to power. What do wizards do with their old leaders?</string>
<string name="42072">Perhaps he has fled. Perhaps he will return and remove this Maugrim, when he can. The fact is that Maugrim rules the wizards now, and has many plans indeed.</string>
<string name="42073">That I do know. He hopes to gather the forces of the north... the Elk tribe and the orcs and whoever else he can muster... and combine them with the might of the wizards to form a great army.</string>
<string name="42074">Most likely. Why not? To be part of such a powerful force would be glorious, indeed. We shall ravage the North with these wizards.</string>
<string name="42075">To tell it true, the Elk tribe already musters. The deal is done, as they say.</string>
<string name="42076">To ravage the north... but especially to pluck the ripe fruit that is the city of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="42077">As the wizard tells it, we shall be led by the woman Aribeth... a traitor to her own kind who knows the enemy well. Ah, their fall shall be swift!</string>
<string name="42078">Aye. I have met the elven woman but once... a terrible and fearsome foe, she seems. The army will follow her gladly, I think.</string>
<string name="42079">Ehhh... he does not seem a normal wizard, to me. Though that is saying little. He seems more a madman, a servant to some strange power.</string>
<string name="42080">What that power might be, I do not know. Nor does it matter, truly, if the wizard lives up to his word.</string>
<string name="42081">Who are you?</string>
<string name="42082">Who is this Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42083">Stand back! I&apos;ll have no tricks out of you!</string>
<string name="42084">Who you?</string>
<string name="42085">Who this Maugrim you talks of?</string>
<string name="42086">You stands back! No tricks from you!!</string>
<string name="42087">Are you sure of that?</string>
<string name="42088">You sure &apos;bout that?</string>
<string name="42089">I don&apos;t know if I like the way you&apos;re sizing me up... </string>
<string name="42090">Me not knows if me likes how you looking at me... </string>
<string name="42091">I am seeking a way to destroy the cult, and its leader.</string>
<string name="42092">Me wants to destroy cult... and leader, too.</string>
<string name="42093">I&apos;m the one asking the questions, here!</string>
<string name="42094">Me asks questions, not you!</string>
<string name="42095">How is it that you know all this?</string>
<string name="42096">How you knows all this stuff?</string>
<string name="42097">I am an adventurer... exploring.</string>
<string name="42098">Me adventurer... me exploring.</string>
<string name="42099">Tell me who you are.</string>
<string name="42100">Tell me who you is.</string>
<string name="42101">What do you know about Maugrim? Where is he?</string>
<string name="42102">What you knows &apos;bout Maugrim? Where he be?</string>
<string name="42103">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Why are you here? Something seems very... odd.</string>
<string name="42104">What do you know about the Tower?</string>
<string name="42105">What you knows about Tower?</string>
<string name="42106">Forget it, I&apos;m leaving.</string>
<string name="42107">Forget it, me going.</string>
<string name="42108">How do I know you&apos;re telling the truth?</string>
<string name="42109">How me know you tells the truth?</string>
<string name="42110">It&apos;s a trick, isn&apos;t it? The brazier will explode or something.</string>
<string name="42111">Is trick, huh? Brazier go boom when me breaks it?</string>
<string name="42112">Why would I want to help you?</string>
<string name="42113">Why me wants to help you?</string>
<string name="42114">All right, I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="42115">Okays, me do it.</string>
<string name="42116">Forget it... you can stay trapped here.</string>
<string name="42117">You forgets it... you stays here.</string>
<string name="42118">I want something now, in advance.</string>
<string name="42119">Me wants something now, before.</string>
<string name="42120">That does sound good... </string>
<string name="42121">That sounds good... </string>
<string name="42122">No, that&apos;s not enough.</string>
<string name="42123">No, is not enoughs.</string>
<string name="42124">I&apos;m not talking about a reward.</string>
<string name="42125">Me not talk &apos;bout reward.</string>
<string name="42126">Not unless you make me a better offer.</string>
<string name="42127">Only if you makes me really goods offer.</string>
<string name="42128">I am sure.</string>
<string name="42129">Me sure.</string>
<string name="42130">Don&apos;t like it, huh? What are you going to do about it?</string>
<string name="42131">Not likes it, huh? What you do &apos;bout it?</string>
<string name="42132">I might change my mind.</string>
<string name="42133">Maybe me changes mind.</string>
<string name="42134">Changed my mind again... ha ha!</string>
<string name="42135">Ooops, change mind again! You stays, ha ha!</string>
<string name="42136">Why don&apos;t you destroy the brazier yourself?</string>
<string name="42137">Why you not destroys brazier yourself?</string>
<string name="42138">Why were you imprisoned and not killed?</string>
<string name="42139">Why wizards not kills you?</string>
<string name="42140">Who are you? A wizard of the Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="42141">Who you be? Wizard of Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="42142">Prove you&apos;re not a cult follower. Tell me of their defenses.</string>
<string name="42143">Prove you no cult follower. Tells me &apos;bout defenses.</string>
<string name="42144">I don&apos;t have any more questions.</string>
<string name="42145">Me have no more questions.</string>
<string name="42146">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="42147">What you means?</string>
<string name="42148">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Why would Arklem have a non-wizard as an advisor?</string>
<string name="42149">Are you telling me everything?</string>
<string name="42150">You tells me everything?</string>
<string name="42151">So you are evil like the rest of the Brotherhood.</string>
<string name="42152">So you is evil like the other wizards.</string>
<string name="42153">Why didn&apos;t you flee with Arklem, then?</string>
<string name="42154">Why you not flees with Arklem?</string>
<string name="42155">His human wizards, you mean.</string>
<string name="42156">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Primordial evil...? Such as a demon?</string>
<string name="42157">Of course it disturbs me!</string>
<string name="42158">Of course it disturb me!</string>
<string name="42159">No, not really.</string>
<string name="42160">No, it not disturbs me.</string>
<string name="42161">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You are more than Arklem&apos;s advisor... you are not even human.</string>
<string name="42162">You don&apos;t sound like an advisor... </string>
<string name="42163">You not sound like advisor... </string>
<string name="42164">Such as?</string>
<string name="42165">Then you&apos;ll get no help from me.</string>
<string name="42166">Then me not helps you!</string>
<string name="42167">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Meaning you are not human at all, then.</string>
<string name="42168">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lore]&lt;/Start&gt; Meaning you would be sent back to your home plane? Inconvenient but not permanent.</string>
<string name="42169">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lore]&lt;/Start&gt; So you be sent back to planes? Is just inconvenient?</string>
<string name="42170">I don&apos;t understand... </string>
<string name="42171">Me not understand... </string>
<string name="42172">Very well... I&apos;ll destroy it.</string>
<string name="42173">Okay... me destroys it.</string>
<string name="42174">No.</string>
<string name="42175">I&apos;ve had enough... you die now!</string>
<string name="42176">Me had enough... now you dies!</string>
<string name="42177">I&apos;m not sure I should, actually.</string>
<string name="42178">Me not sure me should.</string>
<string name="42179">Forget it... I&apos;m not going to help you.</string>
<string name="42180">You forget it... me not helps you.</string>
<string name="42181">I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="42182">Me will do it.</string>
<string name="42183">Who are you? A better question, perhaps, is what are you doing in the Tower? You don&apos;t seem like one of Maugrim&apos;s toadies.</string>
<string name="42184">Mmmm... a rather delicious looking &lt;race&gt; creature, is it? What a treat. Please don&apos;t tell me you&apos;re one of the fools toadying after Maugrim.</string>
<string name="42185">Hmph. You can&apos;t be one of Maugrim&apos;s fools. You haven&apos;t the look of fanatic desperation to you.</string>
<string name="42186">Ohhhh, my... and it has the intellectual capacity of a footstool, as well. Like a boon from the sky, you are.</string>
<string name="42187">I don&apos;t know why you wouldn&apos;t enjoy my glances, male... certainly you must receive enough of them. I think I would remember one such as you... you are a stranger, here.</string>
<string name="42188">I would admit you&apos;ve a look to you, &lt;male/female&gt;. A smell that is similarly unflattering... but no, you&apos;re no fanatic.</string>
<string name="42189">You don&apos;t know who I am, &lt;male/female&gt;? Well... that certainly means that you aren&apos;t native to the Brotherhood. A stranger, then.</string>
<string name="42190">Hmmm. You don&apos;t know of Maugrim... or you feign ignorance, which no fanatic of his would even conceive of. A stranger, then.</string>
<string name="42191">Ahhh, it appears I have an intellect of staggering proportions to deal with, now. Do calm yourself, &lt;male/female&gt;, I&apos;m sure your brain could use the energy.</string>
<string name="42192">You certainly needn&apos;t worry about any tricks from me. If I had intended to harm you, don&apos;t you think I would have already done so?</string>
<string name="42193">So you aren&apos;t one of Maugrim&apos;s. I would know if you were one of Arklem&apos;s. The only question, then, how did you come to be this deep within the Host Tower?</string>
<string name="42194">By all means. Ask away, &lt;male/female&gt;.</string>
<string name="42195">An evasive answer... and far from the truth, no doubt. Or do you truly expect me to believe that you haplessly wandered past the Tower&apos;s wards?</string>
<string name="42196">Oh, I suppose it&apos;s possible that Maugrim was stupid enough that he removed the spells from the bridge... but I doubt it. Regardless, who am I to question your word?</string>
<string name="42197">A noble goal. I wouldn&apos;t put such a feat past you, either... you must have managed to bypass the wards on the bridge and the guards, after all.</string>
<string name="42198">Maugrim will be no simple task to overcome, but somehow I doubt that will deter you. Don&apos;t let me keep you from your task, by all means.</string>
<string name="42199">Well, there could be any one of a number of answers. Omniscience, divining spells galore, incredibly high intelligence... take your pick.</string>
<string name="42200">How do I know all these things? Omniscience, divinations, incredible intelligence... take your pick. Do let me know if I&apos;m talking too fast for you.</string>
<string name="42201">Normally I would object to someone answering a question with a question, but I imagine you do that a lot. It&apos;s all right... I&apos;ve no need to pry.</string>
<string name="42202">Technically that&apos;s not a question, it&apos;s a request. It is rather nice of you to ask, however... my name is Nyphithys. I am pleased to meet you, &lt;male/female&gt;.</string>
<string name="42203">Maugrim is the new Archmage Arcane of the Brotherhood, a position he took by force. Arklem, the former Archmage, fled while he could.</string>
<string name="42204">You know this, however, do you not? As for where Maugrim is... that I have no idea of. I am unaware of anything beyond the confines of this room.</string>
<string name="42205">You mean physically? Or do you simply wish to know what has happened to leave it strewn with religious fanatics and dead wizards?</string>
<string name="42206">If you want to know what is occurring in it now, well... that&apos;s the one thing I cannot help you with. I am aware of nothing beyond the confines of this room.</string>
<string name="42207">Not the curious type, I see. That&apos;s quite all right... I&apos;m more used to working with mages and their insatiable quest for power and knowledge, but I can adapt.</string>
<string name="42208">I would be more than willing to answer your questions in full or do whatever else you wish... but first, I would ask a boon of you.</string>
<string name="42209">Do you see that brazier on the other side of the room? It contains a spell that keeps me from leaving. Would you be so kind as to destroy it?</string>
<string name="42210">Before you run off, allow me to ask a boon of you, &lt;male/female&gt;. It is a very small thing, believe me.</string>
<string name="42211">Hmmm. There isn&apos;t much that you don&apos;t notice, is there? You are quite correct, &lt;male/female&gt;... all is not quite as it seems.</string>
<string name="42212">This is a prison, this room I am in. I am quite stuck... though perhaps your arrival is an opportunity for me to escape.</string>
<string name="42213">Do you believe I would stand here in this room for some other reason? Waiting for the odd chance that you might stumble upon me, perhaps?</string>
<string name="42214">There is no way to prove my words, I suppose. You are free to ask me whatever you like, of course.</string>
<string name="42215">Hmmm. I don&apos;t believe it is anything other than a regular brazier that Maugrim anchored his spell to. You are free to investigate it for yourself, however.</string>
<string name="42216">If it does explode, that would be incredibly inconvenient, seeing as I would be caught in the same explosion as you.</string>
<string name="42217">Well, let&apos;s see. I still have a magic item, if you would like it. Or would you prefer a reward more... personal?</string>
<string name="42218">Oh? Are you saying you would prefer to see me left here, trapped? I have a magic item, here, to offer as reward, if need be.</string>
<string name="42219">Well, let&apos;s see. I do have a magic item, still, that I would be more than willing to offer you. I can direct you to more, as well, if you like.</string>
<string name="42220">So I can watch you walk out the door and have nothing at all to offer the next &lt;male/female&gt; who stumbles in here? Not likely.</string>
<string name="42221">I can offer you plenty... more than you suspect, I imagine... if you simply help me to free myself from this prison. What do you say?</string>
<string name="42222">So it&apos;s greed, is it? Well... there&apos;s all kinds of things you would no doubt like to have right here in the Tower, with no one particularly guarding them.</string>
<string name="42223">So your concern would be what? What I intend to do after you free me? Whether I am a good person or not?</string>
<string name="42224">I intend to find Arklem once you free me, to be truthful. I doubt you and I will meet again. Beyond that, ask me whatever you wish.</string>
<string name="42225">I see. I do not appreciate being disregarded so, &lt;male/female&gt;. Are you sure you will not change your mind?</string>
<string name="42226">Then what keeps you from aiding me? Will you destroy the brazier or not? It is a simple enough act.</string>
<string name="42227">You are amusing yourself, I see. Perhaps I failed to mention that while I couldn&apos;t leave this room... it certainly doesn&apos;t prevent me from killing you!</string>
<string name="42228">What will I do about it? Well, let&apos;s see. Did I mention that the spell on the brazier doesn&apos;t prevent me from killing you? Perhaps not.</string>
<string name="42229">That is too bad. I would have enjoyed freedom. As it is, I shall have to be satisfied with a little carnage.</string>
<string name="42230">That is a relief. Please proceed... I am eager to be away from this cramped little room.</string>
<string name="42231">Then what shall it be? Will you destroy the brazier or not? It is a simple enough act.</string>
<string name="42232">I would be perfectly capable of doing so, I assure you... if I could reach it. Unfortunately the spell that restricts my movement falls just short of the brazier.</string>
<string name="42233">It would have been rather foolish of Maugrim to set up my prison otherwise, wouldn&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="42234">Their defenses? Well, I doubt Maugrim has had time to set most of the Tower&apos;s wards back up. With the right runestones, I suspect you could move throughout the halls at will.</string>
<string name="42235">Maugrim himself will have taken over Arklem&apos;s sanctum, I suspect. It would fit with that fool&apos;s bloated sense of pride.</string>
<string name="42236">If you found Valinda Shadowmantle, I would wager she has a runestone to reach the sanctum. I bet there is a stone to reach her on this very level.</string>
<string name="42237">Now... is that enough? I could tell you more once you free me, I assure you.</string>
<string name="42238">A wizard? Me? No... not quite. I am Nyphithys... advisor and assistant to Archmage Arklem, the deposed leader of the Brotherhood.</string>
<string name="42239">That is... difficult to explain. Killing me would not serve Maugrim&apos;s purposes.</string>
<string name="42240">About myself? No, not at all. As a matter of fact, I am beginning to grow weary of your questioning. Be quick about it.</string>
<string name="42241">Evil is a subjective term, &lt;male/female&gt;. Unless you mean it in a more primordial sense... in which case, yes, I am evil. Does that disturb you?</string>
<string name="42242">It was I who told Arklem to flee. I am not about to lose an investment of so many years to some fool and his overambitious cult.</string>
<string name="42243">(sigh) Because I bring him certain advantages, things his wizards could not provide for him.</string>
<string name="42244">Then why the questions? I am no psychotic killer. I said I would reward you for freeing me and I shall.</string>
<string name="42245">And if I am not? If I was the influence behind Arklem&apos;s rule, what difference would that make to you? I tire of your questions, &lt;male/female&gt;.</string>
<string name="42246">A clever &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt; you are, indeed. I shall not fill in the blanks, however. You know what you know.</string>
<string name="42247">It makes no difference, however. I&apos;ll have no more questions from you... tell me now: will you destroy the brazier or not?</string>
<string name="42248">You ask too many questions, &lt;male/female&gt;. I shall not fill in the blanks for you.</string>
<string name="42249">I mean that while it would be inconvenient to me, it would not prevent me from searching for Arklem... which Maugrim hopes to prevent.</string>
<string name="42250">Well, that&apos;s hardly unexpected now, is it?</string>
<string name="42251">I do not think it needs to be explained any further. Continue with your questions, if you wish.</string>
<string name="42252">What is the delay? Surely you cannot tell me you are having difficulty destroying the brazier.</string>
<string name="42253">I will not be questioned any further, &lt;male/female&gt;. I am sure you know more than enough... now destroy the brazier before I grow impatient.</string>
<string name="42254">And why is that? I am asking you to do nothing strenuous. Will you do it or not?</string>
<string name="42255">Then do so. I tire of waiting.</string>
<string name="42256">You have done well. Maugrim will be chagrined to know that some adventurer stumbled in to rescue me from his spell.</string>
<string name="42257">I am eager to be off in search of Arklem. It will be difficult to say where he might have hidden himself in his... condition. Regardless, the Tower will be ours again in time.</string>
<string name="42258">As for you, &lt;male/female&gt;... you did your part. You freed me, and the reward is yours by right. Take this item and go.</string>
<string name="42259">I suggest that you not still be present in the Host Tower when I return.</string>
<string name="42260">Grovelling won&apos;t save your worthless hide! Die!</string>
<string name="42261">Answer my questions, then.</string>
<string name="42262">Me still kill you! You die now!</string>
<string name="42263">You answer me question me let you live, maybe.</string>
<string name="42264">Where is Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42265">Where be Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42266">What does this cult want? Why are they doing all this?</string>
<string name="42267">What cult want? Why they do this?</string>
<string name="42268">Tell me what you know.</string>
<string name="42269">You talk, now.</string>
<string name="42270">Fine, I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="42271">Okay, me want ask other stuff.</string>
<string name="42272">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Your life is in my hands. You had best tell me all you know.</string>
<string name="42273">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You life in me hands. You no keep secret...</string>
<string name="42274">Either you start talking or I start removing your fingers!</string>
<string name="42275">You talk or me hack off you fingers!</string>
<string name="42276">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You needn&apos;t fear reprisal from Maugrim. I intend to kill him.</string>
<string name="42277"></string>
<string name="42278"></string>
<string name="42279"></string>
<string name="42280"></string>
<string name="42281">I want more information on the cult.</string>
<string name="42282"></string>
<string name="42283">Me wants to know more &apos;bout cult.</string>
<string name="42284"></string>
<string name="42285">Go on... run, and don&apos;t come back.</string>
<string name="42286">Go, wizard. You run and not comes back!</string>
<string name="42287">Give me everything of worth you have, wizard.</string>
<string name="42288">You gives me all good stuff you has, wizard.</string>
<string name="42289">I have questions I want answered, first.</string>
<string name="42290">Me has questions, first.</string>
<string name="42291">I do not trust you, wizard.</string>
<string name="42292">Me not trusts you, wizard.</string>
<string name="42293">You&apos;d lie and more to save your skin. Forget it!</string>
<string name="42294">You lies! No deal!!</string>
<string name="42295">Tell me who you are.</string>
<string name="42296">Tell me who you is.</string>
<string name="42297">I don&apos;t have any more questions.</string>
<string name="42298">Me has no more questions.</string>
<string name="42299">And what are you doing here now, then?</string>
<string name="42300">Who is this Arklem?</string>
<string name="42301">Who was Arklem overthrown by?</string>
<string name="42302">What you do here now?</string>
<string name="42303">Who Arklem?</string>
<string name="42304">Who Arklem overthrown by?</string>
<string name="42305">I want to know something else.</string>
<string name="42306">Me wants to know something else.</string>
<string name="42307">Tell me more about Maugrim.</string>
<string name="42308">Why would he need an army?</string>
<string name="42309">Tell me more &apos;bout Maugrim.</string>
<string name="42310">Why he needs army?</string>
<string name="42311">Just how did the cult manage to take over?</string>
<string name="42312">Just how cult takes tower over?</string>
<string name="42313">Who are his supporters?</string>
<string name="42314">Who he gots with him?</string>
<string name="42315">Why would he need an army?</string>
<string name="42316">Why he needs army?</string>
<string name="42317">Are you telling me everything you know?</string>
<string name="42318">You tells me all you knows?</string>
<string name="42319">You are lying. You know more than you&apos;re saying.</string>
<string name="42320">You lies. You knows more than you says.</string>
<string name="42321">I knew it! You are lying to me! Time to die!!</string>
<string name="42322">Me knows! You lies still!! You die now!!</string>
<string name="42323">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Are you sure you don&apos;t want to tell me more?</string>
<string name="42324">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You is sure you not wants to say more?</string>
<string name="42325">I despise people who lie to me. I would have to hurt them.</string>
<string name="42326">Me hates liars. Me hurts liars, you knows.</string>
<string name="42327">Fine. Then I guess I&apos;ll have to kill you.</string>
<string name="42328">Okay. Me just kills you, then.</string>
<string name="42329">Aribeth?</string>
<string name="42330">What are you doing within the Host Tower?! This will not be tolerated!</string>
<string name="42331">Please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... spare my life! I shall give you whatever you like... </string>
<string name="42332">No! It cannot end like this! Maugrim save me!!</string>
<string name="42333">What... do you wish to know?</string>
<string name="42334">I surrender! Let me live, I beg you!</string>
<string name="42335">Perhaps seek out Valindra... she has become one of Maugrim&apos;s followers. She may have a rune to enter his sanctum. There is a chest in my library with a runestone for her laboratory.</string>
<string name="42336">Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! You are a kind and merciful &lt;man/woman&gt;! I swear you shall never see me again!</string>
<string name="42337">N-no, please... ask me about something else... </string>
<string name="42338">Please... don&apos;t hurt me! Maugrim... he seeks something for his mistress! That... that&apos;s all I can tell you!</string>
<string name="42339">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No! I... I cannot! He will find me, he will!</string>

<string name="42344">Maugrim is behind it all, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. There is some other mistress that he serves... but I know nothing of it. Maugrim kept it a secret from all but his followers, and they are fanatics.</string>
<string name="42345">No! Maugrim has great power... he will hunt me! There are things he can do that... that are worse than death!</string>
<string name="42346">Take it, then. It is not much, perhaps, but it is all I have on me.</string>
<string name="42347">Will you allow me to flee the tower, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? I have done as you have asked... </string>
<string name="42348">Please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! I beg you! I do not serve Maugrim because I wish to! I have been forced to do his bidding, I swear!</string>
<string name="42349">I have no reason to help that zealot, none! Allow me to flee and I shall trouble you no more!</string>
<string name="42350">My name is Rimardo Domine, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Once I was... Overwizard of the East Tower. That was before Arklem was overthrown, however.</string>
<string name="42351">Maugrim has been... forcing me to create golems. War golems for use in his army.</string>
<string name="42352">Arklem Greeth was the Archmage Arcane of the Brotherhood... until the battles began. I think he fled before the fighting got very bad.</string>
<string name="42353">He is a powerful mage and will return to teach this... usurper... a thing or two, I know it. Why Arklem let the Brotherhood fall to the cult I do not know.</string>
<string name="42354">Maugrim and his cult, of course. Maugrim has been converting followers amongst the wizards ever since his arrival.</string>
<string name="42355">I do not know where he comes from, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. He claims to serve a greater mistress, but he told us next to nothing of her... only that she would bring us victory.</string>
<string name="42356">Instead she has brought us ruin. Most of the tower has fled, and the ones who remain are enslaved to Maugrim&apos;s charisma as part of his cult, working to build the army he desires.</string>
<string name="42357">Maugrim believes that there is some hidden power at Neverwinter&apos;s heart and he has rallied his forces to lay claim to it. His mistress needs what lies there... needs it badly.</string>
<string name="42358"></string>
<string name="42359">He has sent his agents throughout the North to search for... for more of this power. I... I do not know what it is, exactly, however...</string>
<string name="42360">Maugrim came to us more than a year ago, though I know not from where. He was charismatic and obviously possessed of strong magic.</string>
<string name="42361">He would tell us nothing of his mistress, but our greed overcame our better judgment. We allowed him to take our pupils under his wing to teach them his secrets.</string>
<string name="42362">Each became another fanatic in his following, working secretly to do his bidding. It was not long before Maugrim had followers throughout the towers, spreading like a plague in our midst.</string>
<string name="42363">When we finally discovered what was happening, it was too late. Arklem fled from our midst and Maugrim sought to take over. It... it was a long and bloody battle, but Maugrim has won.</string>
<string name="42364">He... he is building an army, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. The High Captains, the forces of the north, the brotherhood... he gathers them all to build a great army.</string>
<string name="42365">I... I am, of course... </string>
<string name="42366">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... I... </string>
<string name="42367">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I... I can tell you nothing more, I swear it!</string>
<string name="42368">I... I suppose you are right.</string>
<string name="42369">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I... I suppose you are right.</string>
<string name="42370">What Maugrim looks for so desperately... what he believes lies in Neverwinter and elsewhere in the north... he calls the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="42371"></string>
<string name="42372">The Brotherhood has never heard of these &apos;words,&apos; and I have no clue what they might be. Maugrim is desperate to locate them for his mistress, however.</string>
<string name="42373">He has sent his agents throughout the north to track them down. He... already has one, I believe... and he will take the rest by force or whatever other means he must.</string>
<string name="42374">That... that is all I know, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Please believe me.</string>
<string name="42375">I... I believe he is within his sanctum atop the North Tower, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. You would need the proper runestone to reach him, but I do not know where one might be.</string>
<string name="42376">Maugrim performs many secret rituals... he has few confidantes. The only one he keeps with him constantly is the elf woman, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="42377">Yes, he... he has seduced her soul, just like all of his other followers. I do not know how, but he has pushed her to betray her own people.</string>
<string name="42378">The elven woman will lead the army he gathers against Neverwinter, a foe she knows intimately. They shall surely fall before her.</string>
<string name="42379">Are you a prisoner here?</string>
<string name="42380">Stand back! I&apos;ll have no tricks out of you!</string>
<string name="42381">No, I&apos;m certainly not one of the cultists.</string>
<string name="42382">You kept in prison?</string>
<string name="42383">Stand back! No tricks!!</string>
<string name="42384">Me not cultist, no.</string>
<string name="42385">How do I know that this isn&apos;t some ruse?</string>
<string name="42386">I&apos;d appreciate some information, first.</string>
<string name="42387">What reward would I get for letting you go?</string>
<string name="42388">Would you be able to find your way out on your own?</string>
<string name="42389">I&apos;m not here to rescue you.</string>
<string name="42390">How I know you not lying?</string>
<string name="42391">Me have questions, first.</string>
<string name="42392">Is there reward for letting you go?</string>
<string name="42393">You find way out on own?</string>
<string name="42394">Me no rescuer.</string>
<string name="42395">I never said that. You could betray me... I&apos;ll have to kill you.</string>
<string name="42396">Yes, go on. I&apos;ve got better things to do, here.</string>
<string name="42397">I don&apos;t know. Is there anything in it for me for helping you?</string>
<string name="42398">Never say that. You coulds betray me... me has to kill you.</string>
<string name="42399">Yes, you go. Me has better things to do.</string>
<string name="42400">Don&apos;t know. What in it for me?</string>
<string name="42401">I don&apos;t trust you. Time to die!</string>
<string name="42402">No believe! Die! Die!!</string>
<string name="42403">Yes, I could use some information.</string>
<string name="42404">You&apos;re of no use to me, then.</string>
<string name="42405">Yes, tell me. That good.</string>
<string name="42406">You no use to me, then.</string>
<string name="42407">Then you&apos;re free to go.</string>
<string name="42408">Why don&apos;t you join me, then? I intend to stop Maugrim, myself.</string>
<string name="42409">Then you go now.</string>
<string name="42410">Maybe you joins me, then? Me go to stop Maugrim now.</string>
<string name="42411">What happened here in the tower?</string>
<string name="42412">How does one get around this place?</string>
<string name="42413">Tell me what you know about the cult.</string>
<string name="42414">All right. I&apos;m done with the questions.</string>
<string name="42415">What happen in tower?</string>
<string name="42416">How you gets around tower?</string>
<string name="42417">What you knows about cult?</string>
<string name="42418">Me done with questions.</string>
<string name="42419">I can&apos;t trust you not to betray me. Sorry, but you die.</string>
<string name="42420">Me not trusts you not to betray. You die, now.</string>
<string name="42421">You&apos;re free to go. Or you could help me fight Maugrim.</string>
<string name="42422">You free to go. Or you coulds help me fight Maugrim.</string>
<string name="42423">Why not join me and fight Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42424">Maybe you joins me and fight Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42425">How did Maugrim manage to take over?</string>
<string name="42426">What does he want the Tower for?</string>
<string name="42427">Who is this Arklem? Do you know where he is?</string>
<string name="42428">The fighting appears to be still ongoing.</string>
<string name="42429">I want to know something else.</string>
<string name="42430">How Maugrim take over tower?</string>
<string name="42431">What he wants wizard tower for?</string>
<string name="42432">Who Arklem? You knows where he be?</string>
<string name="42433">Fightings still goes on here, me thinks.</string>
<string name="42434">Me want to know something else.</string>
<string name="42435">What is this power that he worships?</string>
<string name="42436">What is he looking for?</string>
<string name="42437">What this power he worship?</string>
<string name="42438">What he looks for?</string>
<string name="42439">What do they want?</string>
<string name="42440">Tell me about Maugrim.</string>
<string name="42441">Who are Maugrim&apos;s supporters, here?</string>
<string name="42442">Where do I find Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42443">I want to know something else.</string>
<string name="42444">What they want?</string>
<string name="42445">Tells me &apos;bout Maugrim.</string>
<string name="42446">Who is Maugrim&apos;s supporters?</string>
<string name="42447">Where me finds Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42448">Me wants to know something else.</string>
<string name="42449">Why would you tell me that?</string>
<string name="42450">So you won&apos;t help me, then?</string>
<string name="42451"></string>
<string name="42452">Then forget it. Leave, while you can.</string>
<string name="42453">Why you tells me that?</string>
<string name="42454">So you not help me, then?</string>
<string name="42455"></string>
<string name="42456">Then forgets it. You leave quick.</string>
<string name="42457">Then I am forced to kill you, I guess.</string>
<string name="42458">Then me forced to kill you.</string>
<string name="42459"></string>
<string name="42460"></string>
<string name="42461"></string>
<string name="42462"></string>
<string name="42463"></string>
<string name="42464"></string>
<string name="42465">Oh, my! You don&apos;t strike me as the type of &lt;man/woman&gt; who would be one of Maugrim&apos;s followers. You&apos;re not, are you?</string>
<string name="42466">You haven&apos;t the look of one of Maugrim&apos;s fanatics, I&apos;ll give you that. Of course, one can never be too sure... </string>
<string name="42467">Ahh! Why have you come? Are you another one of Maugrim&apos;s fanatics, come to torment me again?!</string>
<string name="42468">Aye. Maugrim had me thrown in here for refusing to join his cause. My name is Deltagar Zhelhund... a former Overwizard of the brotherhood. Tell me... might you be able to free me from this cell?</string>
<string name="42469">Oh, I&apos;m quite harmless in this cell. We designed it especially to hold casters... though I never thought I would be held in one. My name is Deltagar Zhelhund, and Maugrim has imprisoned me for refusing to join him. Am I free, now?</string>
<string name="42470">That is quite a relief, then. My name is Deltagar Zhelhund, and Maugrim has kept me prisoner here for refusing to join his cause. Might I be free to go, now, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="42471">Then... you will let me leave?</string>
<string name="42472">I shall tell you whatever I can. I admit, however, that I know little of what has occurred since Maugrim put me in the cell.</string>
<string name="42473">A ruse? Do you believe Maugrim stocks his cells with his cultists on the off chance that someone might invade the Host Tower and free them? Please, &lt;sir/madam&gt;... all I want to do is get out of here.</string>
<string name="42474">I have nothing to reward you with. Maugrim has no doubt removed my blood link to the teleporters, so I can&apos;t even make you a runestone. I could tell you what I know, however, if you wish.</string>
<string name="42475">Yes... yes, one can teleport out of the towers. Just not into them. I can leave... and return to strike back at that fiend, Maugrim, as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="42476">No! No!! Someone help me!!</string>
<string name="42477">Thank you. Thankfully I can still teleport away from here... and return to fight Maugrim later. I wish you well, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="42478">I... I would help you, stranger, if I could. My first allegiance is to the Brotherhood, however. My obligation is to seek out those who remain, not to fight Maugrim by your side.</string>
<string name="42479">Isn&apos;t it obvious? Maugrim has taken over the Host Tower and forced Archmage Arklem to flee. It was not done without a great battle... but we have lost.</string>
<string name="42480">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="42481">Maugrim came to us many months ago, though I do not know from where. He claimed to have uncovered some mysterious power... power that he would share with us.</string>
<string name="42482">He was very secretive about the nature of this power, of course, but Arklem was too eager to care. Maugrim joined the Brotherhood and began training students.</string>
<string name="42483">We did not know it, but each of the students he taught surely fell under his sway. They joined him in worshipping this power of his, and his cult spread.</string>
<string name="42484">When Maugrim finally tipped his hand, it was too late for us to do anything but try to fight back. The Tower was his... and, along with it, Luskan.</string>
<string name="42485">Well, on the surface it would look like he wants to use the resources of the wizards in some great war he is concocting.</string>
<string name="42486">He intends to invade Neverwinter, of that I have little doubt even if I don&apos;t know what he&apos;s done in recent weeks. It&apos;s not power that he seeks specifically, however... something is in Neverwinter that he seeks.</string>
<string name="42487">I do not know, exactly. Some old god, perhaps? A demon? He did not reveal its nature to anyone but Arklem, and Arklem was very excited about the possibilities.</string>
<string name="42488">Words of power, belonging to some ancient tongue. Maugrim claims that these &apos;words&apos; are hidden in the oldest ruins of the North.</string>
<string name="42489">I have never heard of such things, myself... and why he would think one of them might be in Neverwinter eludes me.</string>
<string name="42490">If these words of power truly exist, one has to wonder what they might do. That, too, I don&apos;t know... but I believe it is the power he serves who wishes them and not Maugrim, himself.</string>
<string name="42491">Arklem was once the Archmage Arcane of the Brotherhood. He fled just as Maugrim began his campaign... none of us were even aware he had fled.</string>
<string name="42492">I haven&apos;t a clue as to where he might be. He is plotting, no doubt, to remove Maugrim from his usurped position... if that is even possible.</string>
<string name="42493">Is it? When I was imprisoned a week ago, it was obvious that we had lost. If there is still fighting, then it is out of desperation and nothing else.</string>
<string name="42494">Before I was captured, I made sure that the teleporter dweomer was disrupted... and I engineered the release of some of our more dangerous experiments.</string>
<string name="42495">That may have kept Maugrim busy, but make no mistake: he controls the Host Tower completely.</string>
<string name="42496">Surely you already know about the teleporters and the runestones... or you wouldn&apos;t have gotten this far into the Host Tower.</string>
<string name="42497">The runes are inscribed with our blood, and the dweomer of the teleporter determines whether we are allowed to go where the rune indicates.</string>
<string name="42498">I disrupted the dweomer before I was imprisoned. Maugrim has, it seems, restored it... but I imagine not fully, not yet. The teleporter would no longer recognize my own blood, however, I am sure.</string>
<string name="42499">Maugrim has not recruited his followers in a regular sense. He has some hold over them... not mind control, but certainly something that goes beyond mere worship.</string>
<string name="42500">They are all loyal to him and the strange power he serves in the most fanatic sense. What their end purpose might be I can&apos;t imagine.</string>
<string name="42501">Ultimately, Maugrim intends to tear apart the north in search of these &apos;words of power&apos; that his mistress wishes.</string>
<string name="42502">What the words of power are, exactly, or what their use might be... that I don&apos;t know. Maugrim is desperate to find them, however.</string>
<string name="42503">I believe he may already have one. There is another in Neverwinter... or so I surmise... and that is the reason he wishes to invade it.</string>
<string name="42504">Maugrim... has great power. I thought, at first, that surely he must be a sorcerer or wizard. I am not certain of that anymore.</string>
<string name="42505">He worships a powerful being that he doesn&apos;t like to talk about much... but it gives him much in return. Does this make him a cleric? Again I do not know.</string>
<string name="42506">He is an intense and proud man, though. He believes his course is right and will allow nothing to stop him. Beware of getting in his way... you see where that brought us.</string>
<string name="42507">From what I gathered, Maugrim has the support of over half of the wizards in the Host Tower. Mostly the young ones... but they have considerable numbers.</string>
<string name="42508">I suspect he has sent most of them out throughout the North to search for his precious words... but no doubt there are many left here.</string>
<string name="42509">I heard that Valinda Shadowmantle joined his side before I fell. If that&apos;s true, she will be of great use to him, she being an Overwizard herself.</string>
<string name="42510">In Arkleth&apos;s sanctum, no doubt, atop the North Tower. Getting there will be somewhat problematic, however.</string>
<string name="42511">If you can find Valinda Shadowmantle, I suspect that she would have a rune with access to the sanctum. It may be your only way there.</string>
<string name="42512">I do not know what sort of &lt;man/woman&gt; you are. I, myself, have done much in the name of the Brotherhood that many would consider evil.</string>
<string name="42513">Whether you agree or not is not my concern. I will not betray my oaths... not for Maugrim, and not for you. I am grateful for your help and will certainly not betray you... but I must go my own way and help my Brethren as I can.</string>
<string name="42514">I cannot. You obviously have considerable ability or you wouldn&apos;t have gotten this far... I wish you well and pray that Maugrim suffers at your hands.</string>
<string name="42515"></string>
<string name="42516"></string>
<string name="42517">You are welcome in my service, paladin. I have awaited your arrival with great anticipation.</string>
<string name="42518">Do you renounce your false god of justice, Aribeth de Tylmarande? Do you renounce your god, your lord and your people who have betrayed you?</string>
<string name="42519">I... I do.</string>
<string name="42520">Will you lead our glorious army in the name of your new mistress?</string>
<string name="42521">I will. I will lead them.</string>
<string name="42522">Then be the terrifying blackguard of our mistress Morag that you were meant to!</string>
<string name="42523">I shall! Neverwinter will fall before our might!</string>
<string name="42524">Remember, Maugrim, that it is of great importance that the other Words of Power be located. You must beware Haedraline, however, as she will ---</string>
<string name="42525">You have been lax, Maugrim. We have intruders.</string>
<string name="42526">The Word of Power cannot fall into the hands of the enemy. Take Aribeth and leave now. I shall summon my own servants to deal with these... fools.</string>

<string name="42554">The book is a small journal of sorts that does not appear to have been in use for long. The entries appear to have been made by Lady Aribeth. Of particular note is the last:

&quot;Maugrim has assigned me quarters with the other ambassadors, though I don&apos;t know for how long. He tells me only that he serves a greater power, and hints that I will come to revere this being far more than I ever did Tyr.

&quot;I do not know if that is true. I am not sure of anything anymore except that I have Fallen. Fallen out of love with my lord, my people and my God. I am alone in a world where there is no justice and no hope and I cannot... I cannot get these thoughts out of my mind.

&quot;They burn my every waking moment and whisper to me in my dreams. I shall go mad, I think, if I am not mad already. To do the wrong thing seems far better, however, than to do nothing at all. I am on this path now, and it goes only forward... perhaps at its end I shall find my own justice and the dreams will stop.

&quot;I can only hope.&quot;</string>
<string name="42555">Letter</string>
<string name="42556">This letter was found hidden away on the body of the cultist, carefully sealed. It is written in a fluid script and reads:

&quot;Support the High Captain as you see fit. Ensure that he believes he will be the one whom the cult supports to lead the coming war effort. Neverwinter is ripe for the plucking now that our plague has left them reeling... the High Captains should be delirious with greed just at the thought of it. With luck, we will soon have a host worthy enough to make the entire North tremble in fear.

&quot;Do this well and your place in the coming order will be assured.

<string name="42564">This scrap of paper was obviously written in a great hurry.

&quot;Maugrim&apos;s forces have completely taken over the North Tower. Archmage Arklem is nowhere to be found. How did Maugrim gain so many followers without being noticed?! It is beyond belief!

&quot;Deltagar has commanded us to turn loose the experiments... with luck, they will be more trouble for Valinda and her men than for us.

&quot;If you find this and have not succumbed to Maugrim&apos;s lies, flee the Tower immediately! Do not fall into his hands! The secrets of the Brotherhood will not be lost... we shall return!&quot;</string>
<string name="42565">Letter to Rimardo</string>
<string name="42566">This letter is written in a tight script, addressed to &apos;Rimardo.&apos; It reads as follows:

&quot;The last war golem of your creation went berserk and killed almost an entire battalion of orcs. Needless to say, King Obould was not impressed. Ensure that the next three war golems that you deliver for the army are more stable... or the consequences shall be unpleasant, to say the least.&quot;

It is signed by &quot;Maugrim, Archmage Arcane.&quot;</string>
<string name="42567">Maugrim&apos;s Journal</string>
<string name="42568">This small book is filled sparsely with notes in Maugrim&apos;s now-familiar scrawl. Several entries are of particular interest:

&quot;The tower is ours! That over-ambitious fool, Arklem, trusted me far too much. I would gladly have ended his undead existence had his demon witch not sent him away so quickly. Well, he&apos;ll not have use of her advice any longer, I&apos;ve seen to that.&quot;

&quot;Morag is displeased with me, however. So far the wizards I have sent forth from the tower have found only one of the Words of Power. She needs them all! We shall have the one in Neverwinter soon... and once the last three are located, all shall be as Morag wished. I remain confident of success.&quot;

&quot;The plague ravages Neverwinter, just as Morag foretold. With each death by Wailing she grows stronger. Already she is able to appear in corporeal form... and with the coming war, she shall become even stronger still!&quot;

&quot;I have received word that the old fool Nasher has been successful in stopping the plague, having acquired some help from adventurers. No matter...the deed is already done. Neverwinter is weakened and what strength it has lost, Morag has gained. Morag says that Nasher&apos;s execution of the fool Fenthick will only serve us... soon his greatest champion shall be ours, instead!&quot;

&quot;The High Captains decimate each other daily, just as I suspected. I care not whether any of the fools actually succeed... better is they all die, for none of them will lead the army as I promised them. Morag&apos;s nightly visits to Aribeth have had the desired effect: the former paladin has come and lain herself willingly at our feet. She shall lead the great host herself as Morag&apos;s champion! The Words will be ours and Morag shall triumph! Glorious shall be the day!&quot;</string>
<string name="42569">This letter is written in dark reddish ink and reads as follows:

&quot;Valinda,

Have the construction of the war golems hurried. The fool Deltagar left us little else to work with, they shall have to provide the brunt of our force in the coming battles.
Also ensure that my sanctum is not disturbed. The elf woman, Aribeth, has arrived and is being prepared for the ritual.

Please Morag and your place in the new order shall be certain.

Decades later, however, a student of his built upon those foundations and created a regenerative ring fueled by bits of troll ichor and brains. This external use caused far less nausea, and the invention met with much greater success than the potion that first spawned it.</string>

<string name="42683">Me go now.</string>
<string name="42684">Beorunna&apos;s Well?</string>
<string name="42685">You going up to the top of the plateau to see Beorunna&apos;s Well? If you are, just watch your step. I wouldn&apos;t trust those Uthgardt savages as far as I could throw them.</string>
<string name="42686">Yeah, you know: Beorunna&apos;s Well. It ain&apos;t much to look at, but I guess some people figure it&apos;s a big deal, what with the historical significance and all.</string>
<string name="42687">Beorunna was some Uthgardt hero, or so they say. The legendary Father of their people or some such nonsense. They say he built that well at the top of this plateau.</string>
<string name="42688">See you around then. Like I said, watch yourself among them Uthgardt. Allies or not, I don&apos;t trust those savages!</string>
<string name="42689">The Lords&apos; Alliance figured it might be a good idea to post a guard here at the base of the plateau to warn people. Past this point you&apos;re entering the heathen camps. </string>
<string name="42690">You can go on up if you want, but watch your step with those savages. We don&apos;t want any trouble with those Uthgardt camped around Beorunna&apos;s Well.</string>
<string name="42691">I don&apos;t believe in the legend myself, but the plateau is a holy site to them damn Uthgardt. Guess that&apos;s why they built their camp up there.</string>
<string name="42692">Yeah, one of the Uthgardt tribes has joined the Lords&apos; Alliance. The Black Lions, I think. I don&apos;t really trust them heathens, but I guess we need all the help we can get.</string>
<string name="42693">They&apos;ve gone and set up their camp on top of this plateau. Seems they figure they&apos;ve got a claim to the land around Beorunna&apos;s Well.</string>
<string name="42694">Well, there&apos;s a druid grove up there. I think it&apos;s run by a man named Yusam. You know them druids... Nature this and nature that.</string>
<string name="42695">I guess that&apos;s why he&apos;d rather stay up there beside Beorunna&apos;s Well with them primitive Uthgardt instead of down here with us civilized folk. </string>
<string name="42696">Come here and talk to me.</string>
<string name="42697">I am &lt;FullName&gt;. I work for Aarin Gend of Neverwinter!</string>

<string name="42700">Me name not you business!</string>
<string name="42701">Halt! Who goes there? In the name of the Lords&apos; Alliance I demand you identify yourself!</string>
<string name="42702">Now you just sit tight while we figure out who you are and what to do with you.</string>
<string name="42703">That&apos;s a mighty poor attitude to take!</string>
<string name="42704">So you say. But anybody can make that claim, can&apos;t they?</string>
<string name="42705">Thanks for your help. I don&apos;t know if we could have survived that attack without you! I guess you&apos;ve proved you&apos;re on our side. We&apos;ll continue our patrols now and leave you to your business.</string>

<string name="42776">Ummm... when did you cast this Word of Recall spell on me? </string>
<string name="42777">When you cast Recall spell on me?</string>
<string name="42778">Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Aribeth has instructed me to provide whatever assistance I can in your mission to recover the missing Waterdhavian creatures.</string>
<string name="42779">Ah. You have awakened. I need to speak with you. </string>
<string name="42780">You&apos;re lucky to be alive. We barely managed to bring you back; your soul had nearly departed to the afterlife. </string>
<string name="42781">Hmmm. I thought you would have been familiar with this process. No matter, I can explain it to you.</string>
<string name="42782">You are one of Aribeth&apos;s most important agents. After what happened at the Academy, she wants me to keep watch over you personally. </string>
<string name="42783">Before your mission started I cast a Word of Recall spell upon you, so that whenever you become mortally wounded I can immediately teleport you here to safety. </string>
<string name="42784">Just now, some enemy must have struck you a near fatal blow, and so the spell&apos;s contingency magics activated and whisked you away to safety. </string>
<string name="42785">As soon as your battered body appeared, the other clerics here called upon the healing power of Tyr to bring you back from the brink of death. </string>
<string name="42786">You are now as ready as you&apos;ll ever be to continue with your mission. The Recall spell will activate again if you are dealt another fatal blow. </string>
<string name="42787">I can&apos;t do that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are too important. Neverwinter has need of your skills if we&apos;re ever to find the missing creatures. We can&apos;t risk an untimely demise.</string>
<string name="42788">I can help you return to the site of your last battle, but are you sure you want to go back so soon? </string>
<string name="42789">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. May the grace of Tyr be with you. </string>
<string name="42790">Whatever you were fighting will still be there. It would be wiser to find a way to avoid this confrontation, or at least to arm yourself better with supplies from some of the shops in the City Core.</string>
<string name="42791">As you wish. I can use my magic to return you to the site you just came from. This will return you to your last battle. Are you ready? </string>
<string name="42792">As you wish. Prepare yourself, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="42793">I am Sergol, a priest of Tyr. It is my duty to aid and assist those in the service of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="42794">The spell doesn&apos;t require your presence. I simply needed to know your full name, which Aribeth provided.</string>
<string name="42795">Laeral&apos;s Spell Shield</string>
<string name="42796">Why is your husband at Fort Ilkard?</string>
<string name="42797">You can&apos;t stay here. The Uthgardt are too close.</string>
<string name="42798">Your husband sent me to escort you to the safety of Fort Ilkard. Look, here is Bret&apos;s wedding band.</string>
<string name="42799">Give me your money or I&apos;ll kill you and your baby both! </string>
<string name="42800">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="42801">You Bret wifey? Bret send me get you back to fort. Look, me got ring!</string>
<string name="42802">Why you hubby at Fort?</string>
<string name="42803">Uthgardt be close. Lady got leave now.</string>
<string name="42804">Give money or me kill you!</string>
<string name="42805">Me go now.</string>
<string name="42806">Greetings, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, and please forgive my shoddy appearance. It is rare for me to have guests since my husband Bret was conscripted into service at Fort Ilkard.</string>
<string name="42807">I can only wait here and hope my husband returns from Fort Ilkard soon. Bret could keep us safe. He could protect our home and our baby.</string>
<string name="42808">Commandar Damas conscripted all the male settlers into his army. They&apos;re stationed at Fort Ilkard, to defend it against the Luskan forces and their Uthgardt allies.</string>
<string name="42809">I cannot leave! Not with my baby! She is so young and frail, she would never survive the journey. We will have to wait here until Bret returns.</string>
<string name="42810">You would rob a defenseless mother with a newborn at her breast? What a horrible &lt;man/woman&gt; you are!</string>
<string name="42811">Not that it matters. I am but a poor farmer&apos;s wife. Search the home if you wish, you will find nothing worth stealing.</string>
<string name="42812">Yes, I suppose you must go to fight the Luskan army. Perhaps if the Lords&apos; Alliance can win this war Bret will return to me and we can be a family once again.</string>
<string name="42813">Ah, I see you are simple-minded. I will try to explain, though you may not understand. My husband was conscripted. Do you understand what con-script-ed means?</string>
<string name="42814">Your words are garbled by your clumsy tongue, yet I take their meaning. Alas, I cannot follow your well-intentioned advice. </string>
<string name="42815">Yes, each must do their part to defeat the evil Luskan army, even those of slow wit and dull mind. Perhaps when this war is over my Bret will return to me.</string>
<string name="42816">*Gasp* Bret&apos;s wedding band! I was afraid to risk the journey with our newborn daughter, but if you will escort us perhaps it will be okay.</string>
<string name="42817">I will carry my baby daughter and follow you to the safety of Fort Ilkard. Please don&apos;t abandon us! I cannot travel as quickly as you.</string>
<string name="42818">You have my eternal gratitude for escorting us through the Uthgardt. Now I can see the Fort in the distance. We can manage from here.</string>
<string name="42819">Now that I am here at Fort Ilkard I, my husband, and our newborn daughter will be together to face whatever fate may bring.</string>
<string name="42820">Thank you for bringing us here, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. My daughter and I owe you our lives.</string>
<string name="42821">I can&apos;t believe Aribeth betrayed Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="42822">Is there no one who comes to the defense of Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="42823">Have your spies learned anything of Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42824">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="42825">Me not believe Aribeth be traitor!</string>
<string name="42826">Neverwinter no have friends who help you?</string>
<string name="42827">Tell more &apos;bout reco-thingy reports. What &apos;bout Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42828">Me go now.</string>
<string name="42829">Any idea where I should be looking for the Words of Power?</string>
<string name="42830">And what should I do once I find these Words of Power?</string>
<string name="42831">Where me look for Power Words?</string>
<string name="42832">What me do with Power Words if me find one?</string>
<string name="42833">Anything else?</string>
<string name="42834">What&apos;s in this for me?</string>
<string name="42835">What me get from this?</string>
<string name="42836">Maybe you could recap the reconnaissance information for me.</string>
<string name="42837">Tell me stuff &apos;bout reco-thingies!</string>
<string name="42838">I have one of the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="42839">Me have Power Word.</string>
<string name="42840">You are most generous, Aarin. I thank you for this reward.</string>
<string name="42841">Listen, Gend, you&apos;d better dig a little deeper or the Lords&apos; Alliance might have to find themselves another spymaster!</string>
<string name="42842">You nice man. Money make me happy.</string>
<string name="42843">More! Give more or me kill you!</string>
<string name="42844">I think you should know about a female lizardman I ran into. She said her name was Haedraline, and she seemed to want to help.</string>
<string name="42845">Me need tell you sumpin. Me talk to lizard-girly. She name Haedraline. She say she help us.</string>
<string name="42846">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Recovering the Words of Power isn&apos;t easy, Aarin. Supplies and equipment don&apos;t come cheap.</string>
<string name="42847">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me work hard for Power Word. Real hard.</string>
<string name="42848">I have one of the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="42849">Have you learned anything more about Maugrim or his followers?</string>
<string name="42850">How goes the war effort?</string>
<string name="42851">Have you learned anything about the lizardwoman Haedraline?</string>
<string name="42852">Me have Power Word.</string>
<string name="42853">You learn stuff &apos;bout Maugrim?</string>
<string name="42854">How war go?</string>
<string name="42855">You learn lizard-girly stuff?</string>
<string name="42856">I ran into Haedraline again, Aarin.</string>
<string name="42857">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Not to seem ungrateful, Aarin, but gold doesn&apos;t provide much protection against the kind of enemies I&apos;ve been facing.</string>
<string name="42858">Gold shiny. Me happy. Me see lizard-girly again.</string>
<string name="42859">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me got lots of gold! Me want magic stuff! Give magic stuff!</string>
<string name="42860">She spoke of the ancient Creator Races. She claimed to be one of them. I think she&apos;s a friend.</string>
<string name="42861">She say she old. She say she &quot;Creator Race.&quot; She seem nice.</string>
<string name="42862">I have another of the Words of Power here.</string>
<string name="42863">Me got &apos;nother Power Word.</string>
<string name="42864">Of course, Aarin. As long as my body draws breath, I will fight to save Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="42865">I&apos;ll come with you, Gend, but only because I see a real potential for profit here.</string>
<string name="42866">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You wouldn&apos;t happen to have any spare magical equipment that might prove useful in the defense of Neverwinter, would you?</string>
<string name="42867">Me save Neverwinter! Me fight good!</string>
<string name="42868">Me go save Neverwinter &apos;cause me gonna get more gold!</string>
<string name="42869">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Gold not help me fight. Me need magic stuff!</string>
<string name="42870">Where could I get some supplies?</string>
<string name="42871">Me need get supplies.</string>
<string name="42872">I&apos;m ready.</string>
<string name="42873"></string>
<string name="42874">It is an honor to serve Neverwinter, Aarin.</string>
<string name="42875">There are worse ways to make a living. Neverwinter pays her servants well.</string>
<string name="42876">Time is short, Gend. Let&apos;s get down to business.</string>
<string name="42877">It be honor for me serve Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="42878">Me like serve Neverwinter. Me get lots gold for this!</string>
<string name="42879">Hurry and get to point. Me want start killing stuff.</string>
<string name="42880">A decoy?</string>
<string name="42881">Can we go over my mission one more time?</string>
<string name="42882">What you want me do again?</string>
<string name="42883">What is my mission?</string>
<string name="42884">What me mission be?</string>
<string name="42885">How could Aribeth do this to the city she once served?</string>
<string name="42886">Aribeth be bad lady for do this to Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="42887">How can we stop her?</string>
<string name="42888">How we stop Aribeth?</string>
<string name="42889">Me ready.</string>
<string name="42890"></string>
<string name="42891">So what do you need from me?</string>
<string name="42892">What you want me do &apos;bout this?</string>
<string name="42893">I suppose you are right, Aarin.</string>
<string name="42894">I can&apos;t believe you&apos;re defending her!</string>
<string name="42895">Fenthick&apos;s death is no excuse for betraying an entire city!</string>
<string name="42896">Me guess you maybe right.</string>
<string name="42897">Me not believe you defend Aribeth!</string>
<string name="42898">Fenthick be dead, but that not excuse for Aribeth make Neverwinter all dead!</string>
<string name="42899">Your words are light enough, Aarin, but I sense you are troubled.</string>
<string name="42900">What matter, Aarin? You talk like you happy, but me think you be sad underneath.</string>
<string name="42901">Maybe you just leave yourself vulnerable around me, Aarin.</string>
<string name="42902">Tell me what&apos;s going on, Aarin.</string>
<string name="42903">You don&apos;t need to hide your feelings from me, Aarin.</string>
<string name="42904">You not need hide feelings from me, Aarin.</string>
<string name="42905">Maybe you leave youself more open &apos;round me.</string>
<string name="42906">You tell me what wrong, Aarin.</string>
<string name="42907">Troubled?</string>
<string name="42908">I&apos;m sorry, Aarin. I don&apos;t think I share the same feelings you do. We&apos;re just friends.</string>
<string name="42909">Me sorry, Aarin. Me not think me share same feelings you do. We just friends.</string>
<string name="42910">We both serve Neverwinter, Aarin. You will not have to choose between love and duty.</string>
<string name="42911">What are you saying, Aarin? That you would choose Neverwinter over me?</string>
<string name="42912">You and me both got serve Neverwinter. You not have to choose love or duty.</string>
<string name="42913">What you say, Aarin? You choose Neverwinter &apos;stead of me.</string>
<string name="42914">I am not Calli, and you are not Aribeth. Do not judge us by what happened with them.</string>
<string name="42915">Not all love leads to death and betrayal, Aarin.</string>
<string name="42916">I don&apos;t know if I can trust a man who would not put our love ahead of everything else, Aarin.</string>
<string name="42917">Me not Calli and you not Aribeth. You not judge us by what happen with them.</string>
<string name="42918">Not all love lead to death and traitors.</string>
<string name="42919">Me not trust man who not put me love ahead of everything.</string>
<string name="42920">Then let me say them first, Aarin. I love you.</string>
<string name="42921">You have to decide, Aarin. Are you going to let your fear of what might happen ruin what we have right now?</string>
<string name="42922">Then you let me say words. Aarin, me love you.</string>
<string name="42923">You got decide, Aarin. You gonna let you fear of what maybe happen later ruin what we got right now?</string>
<string name="42924">I understand, Aarin. Together we will stop Aribeth and save Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="42925">Me understand, Aarin. Together we stop Aribeth and save Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="42926">I would like to talk to you, Aarin. About this amulet you gave me.</string>
<string name="42927">Me want talk at you, Aarin. &apos;Bout this amulet you give me.</string>
<string name="42928">Maybe I could do something to help the war effort.</string>
<string name="42929">Maybe me could do something for help war.</string>
<string name="42930">Did you think I would get rid of it?</string>
<string name="42931">Are you saying you want it back?</string>
<string name="42932">Since you gave me this amulet all you&apos;ve spoken about is business.</string>
<string name="42933">You think me gonna get rid of it?</string>
<string name="42934">Is you saying you want it back?</string>
<string name="42935">You give me amulet, then you talk to me &apos;bout nothing but business.</string>
<string name="42936">Unsure?</string>
<string name="42937">Why didn&apos;t you explain all this to me?</string>
<string name="42938">Are you saying you&apos;re too busy now to get involved with me?</string>
<string name="42939">Well, I&apos;ve taken the next step. Now what?</string>
<string name="42940">Why you not just tell me this?</string>
<string name="42941">Is you saying you too busy for get involved with me now?</string>
<string name="42942">Me take next step. Me here. Now what?</string>
<string name="42943">We can make this work, Aarin. It won&apos;t be easy, but what we have is worth fighting for.</string>
<string name="42944">No one should be alone in these dark times. Together we can help each other carry our burdens.</string>
<string name="42945">This can work. It not be easy, but good things is worth fighting for.</string>
<string name="42946">No one should be alone in hard times. You and me can help each other carry burdens.</string>
<string name="42947">You won&apos;t have to go through this alone, Aarin. I promise.</string>
<string name="42948">You not need go through this alone, Aarin. Me promise.</string>
<string name="42949">I can&apos;t promise that, Aarin. The future is uncertain.</string>
<string name="42950">Me cannot promise that. Me not know what maybe happen.</string>
<string name="42951">This has become something of a habit, has it not, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Once more Neverwinter is threatened, and once more you are called upon to save us all.</string>
<string name="42952">The Luskan armies are marching against Neverwinter with Aribeth at their head, ravaging the land as they pass and leaving only destruction in their wake.</string>
<string name="42953">Perhaps even more troubling are the reports of orcs and some of the Uthgardt tribes joining Aribeth and the Luskan army to pillage and plunder.</string>
<string name="42954">The few reports I have heard of Maugrim indicate he is not with the Luskan army. It seems he is content to leave the battles to Aribeth.</string>
<string name="42955">Perhaps had we been more observant Aribeth&apos;s betrayal would not have been such a surprise. She was never the same after Fenthick&apos;s execution.</string>
<string name="42956">Aribeth has vowed revenge against Neverwinter; the pain of her loss makes her blind to anything else. It is up to us to see she does not get the revenge she seeks.</string>
<string name="42957">The Lords&apos; Alliance has come to our aid. Without them, our plague-weakened city would already have come under siege.</string>
<string name="42958">Several of the Uthgardt also stand with us. The Black Lion tribe has made camp with us here at Beorunna&apos;s Well, an Uthgardt holy site.</string>
<string name="42959">But Aribeth and the Luskan army are best left to the generals in the field, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You have a much more important mission.</string>
<string name="42960">I believe Aribeth and the Luskan invaders are but a decoy, a distraction to draw our troops and resources away from the true threat.</string>
<string name="42961">Though we do not yet know what these Words are or why Maugrim desires them, we know there are at least three of these artifacts. We must not let them fall into the hands of the cult.</string>
<string name="42962">There are reports of Maugrim&apos;s followers searching throughout the land: the hills and mountains to the north, the forests to the west, even the sprawling farmlands to the south.</string>
<string name="42963">I wish I had more guidance for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps you can learn more from Lillian Cambridge, an expert on ancient artifacts who claims to have some knowledge of the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="42964">I know this may seem an impossible task, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I can think of no other &lt;man/woman&gt; I would rather have undertaking this mission than you.</string>
<string name="42965">I regret there is nothing more I can tell you. Even the little information I have already given you came at great cost - many of my best men and women gave their lives for it.</string>
<string name="42966">I wish you luck in your mission, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The very survival of Neverwinter may depend on it.</string>
<string name="42967">Rest assured, my mercenary friend, you will be greatly rewarded if you manage to recover any of the Words of Power. Neverwinter and the Lords&apos; Alliance will be most generous.</string>
<string name="42968">No doubt you are here to aid us in our mission. I have already given &lt;CUSTOM100&gt; all the information my reconnaissance operatives have acquired.</string>
<string name="42969">You are back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Have you something to report?</string>
<string name="42970">Hmmm... I assume you want me to recap the reconnaissance reports. Sometimes it&apos;s hard to tell with you, because of your... uh, let&apos;s just say limited vocabulary. Very well.</string>
<string name="42971">This is good news, and the gods know we have had precious little enough of that lately.</string>
<string name="42972">With Aribeth at their head, the Luskan forces are winning victory after victory over the Lords&apos; Alliance troops, and all the while Maugrim and his cult continue their search for the Words of Power. </string>
<string name="42973">At least there is one here they will not have. My loyal network of scouts will spirit the Word away to Castle Neverwinter for safekeeping until Lord Nasher&apos;s scribes can discover its use.</string>
<string name="42974">Neverwinter could use more people like you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am honored to offer you this reward of 3000 gold pieces in exchange for the Word of Power.</string>
<string name="42975">On behalf of the city of Neverwinter and Lord Nasher himself, please accept this reward of 2500 gold pieces as a token of our gratitude.</string>
<string name="42976">On behalf of the city of Neverwinter and Lord Nasher himself, please accept this reward of 2000 gold pieces as a token of our gratitude.</string>
<string name="42977">If my sources are correct, there are still several more Words of Power yet to be found. I hope your success at locating the Words continues, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="42978">Save your blustering - I don&apos;t respond well to empty threats. You&apos;ll get nothing more from me for this task. However, if you recover another one of the Words of Power I&apos;d be happy to arrange for further payment.</string>
<string name="42979">I&apos;ll keep this simple, my dim witted friend. If you attack me, you will die. Your threat means nothing to me. If you want more money, bring me another Word of Power.</string>
<string name="42980">Normally Neverwinter counts the lizardmen amongst her enemies, but your news is not completely unexpected. I have received reports of a lizard creature and her followers doing battle with Maugrim&apos;s cult.</string>
<string name="42981">This must be that Haedraline you mentioned. I will need to consider this new information carefully. But this is not your concern, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You must focus on finding the Words.</string>
<string name="42982">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I think I take the real meaning behind your words. The Lords&apos; Alliance has given me an emergency fund to be spent in the defense of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="42983">I suppose I could spare another 750 gold pieces from the Lords&apos; Alliance treasury to see that you are properly equipped for this mission.</string>
<string name="42984">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Times are difficult. I know this better than anyone. But the resources given me by the Lords&apos; Alliance cannot be squandered recklessly.</string>
<string name="42985">&lt;FirstName&gt;, the city of Neverwinter is forever in your debt for recovering the first Word of Power. We hope you will have continued success on your mission to thwart Maugrim and his followers.</string>
<string name="42986">But now is not the time to dwell on past successes - there are more Words yet to be found before Maugrim gets his claws on them.</string>
<string name="42987">The first Word of Power has been taken to the safety of Castle Never, thanks to the efforts of &lt;CUSTOM100&gt; - one of your fellow adventurers in the service of the Lords&apos; Alliance. I hope this small victory is the first of many such successes.</string>
<string name="42988">My operatives have gathered no new information on Maugrim&apos;s cult. We still have not learned why they started the plague, and we can&apos;t even guess at why they are seeking the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="42989">But I would wager my life on the fact that whatever they are up to will spell disaster for Neverwinter. We are counting on you to stop them, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="42990">I am as ignorant in this matter as you, my dullard friend. And you have no idea how much that admission pains a man who&apos;s very livelihood is the gathering of information.</string>
<string name="42991">The city itself still stands undaunted - for now. However, if you fail in your mission, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I fear our cause will be lost.</string>
<string name="42992">Aribeth seems to inspire her troops with her singleminded desire to destroy Neverwinter and all it stands for. It helps soldiers to have a cause to follow - even a cause steeped in hate.</string>
<string name="42993">There is no new information, though as I mentioned before my operatives had turned up evidence of clashes between the cultists and a mysterious group of lizardmen.</string>
<string name="42994">But just because this Haedraline is an enemy of Maugrim doesn&apos;t mean she&apos;s on our side, either. I&apos;d like to meet her in person before I decide if we can trust her or not.</string>
<string name="42995">I swear, sometimes it takes all my cryptography skills to unravel your pidgin pseudo-language. I can only assume you are referring to Haedraline.</string>
<string name="42996">Why didn&apos;t you say something earlier?</string>
<string name="42997">Why in Lord Nasher&apos;s name didn&apos;t you tell me this right away? Do you realize how utterly frustrating your dim nature can be for those of normal intellect? No... of course you don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="42998">Hopefully this will slow the armies advancing on Neverwinter. At the very least the loss of another Word of Power will strike a harsh blow to the plans of Maugrim&apos;s cult, whatever they may be!</string>
<string name="42999">The Lords&apos; Alliance is grateful to those who provide a shining example in these dark times, and Neverwinter is generous to her champions. &lt;FullName&gt;, I have been authorized to grant a reward of 3500 gold pieces to you for this task.</string>
<string name="43000">You have done well, &lt;FullName&gt;. The Lords&apos; Alliance and Neverwinter are grateful for your efforts, and on their behalf I would like to give you this reward of 3000 gold coins.</string>
<string name="43001">Despite my initial unfavorable impressions of you, &lt;FullName&gt;, you have proven yourself worthy of my respect. Allow me to express the gratitude of Neverwinter by giving you a reward of 2500 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="43002">Eloquent as ever. Why don&apos;t you give your face a good wipe - you&apos;ve still got a few flecks of frothing drool on your chin from that outburst.</string>
<string name="43003">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you have a point. If we expect you to succeed in recovering the remaining Words of Power it might be a good idea to equip you for the mission.</string>
<string name="43004">Take this ring - its power has often provided me protection when I needed it most. May it do the same for you.</string>
<string name="43005">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I wish I had something to spare, but the few magical items donated by the retired heroes of the Lords&apos; Alliance are required in the defense of Neverwinter. I have nothing to spare, I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="43006">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="43007">Haedraline? What did the lizardwoman have to say this time?</string>
<string name="43008">I&apos;m no history expert, but wouldn&apos;t that make her thousands of years old? I&apos;m not sure whether I believe her, and I don&apos;t know what this has to do with Maugrim. But I intend to try and find out.</string>
<string name="43009">Leave Haedraline to me. Maugrim and his crew are still skulking around the countryside, which means they must believe there&apos;s at least one more Word still undiscovered. Find it before they do.</string>
<string name="43010">Have you heard the bards practicing their snippets of song about the legend of how &lt;CUSTOM100&gt; recovered the second Word of Power? I only hope we all live long enough to hear the finished product.</string>
<string name="43011">&lt;FirstName&gt;, the bards among our camp are already composing tales about how you recovered the second Word of Power. I only hope we all live long enough to hear the finished product.</string>
<string name="43012">I have just received the latest reports from the battlefield and things are grim. The walls of Neverwinter have been breached, and the Lords&apos; Alliance has retreated to Castle Never under the onslaught.</string>
<string name="43013">Finally some good news, and not a moment too soon. Even now I am preparing to leave for Castle Neverwinter to help ensure the Words I sent there for safe keeping are not captured by Aribeth. </string>
<string name="43014">I might as well open my coffers to you before we go - the money was meant to fund the defense of the city, and you seem to have done more for that cause than anyone else. Better I give the funds to you than let the Luskan forces loot them.</string>
<string name="43015">Whatever awaits us, &lt;FullName&gt;, I just want to tell you that I have been proud to serve at your side. I have 5000 gold pieces here - take it. You have truly earned it.</string>
<string name="43016">Aribeth, with her intimate knowledge of our strategies, crushes our forces in every encounter. Half the city is under the control of her Luskan forces. And what of your mission - have you found the success our troops have not?</string>
<string name="43017">You have done well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Take this reward of 4500 gold coins. You have earned it.</string>
<string name="43018">I will admit, &lt;FirstName&gt;, that I never had much faith in you. But you have proved me wrong. Take these 4000 gold pieces as a reward. You have earned it.</string>
<string name="43019">And there is more where that came from, if you accompany me to Neverwinter to aid in defending the city. The Lords&apos; Alliance desperately needs a &lt;man/woman&gt; such as you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="43020">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; All our weapons and armor have been sent to the battle fronts, unfortunately. The only thing I have left are these potions.</string>
<string name="43021">I was going to give them to my most trusted operatives to use in their efforts to defend Neverwinter. Now that I think about it, however, you could probably make better use of them.</string>
<string name="43022">Time grows short. We must return to Castle Never to defend its walls and the Words of Power within from Aribeth and Maugrim!</string>
<string name="43023">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I wish I had something to give you, but all such items have been sent to the battle fronts to aid in the war effort.</string>
<string name="43024">This camp has been set up to serve as a base for both the war effort and those searching for the Words of Power. In the various buildings you will find whatever type of store you require.</string>
<string name="43025"></string>
<string name="43026">Yet this time you will be reporting directly to me. With Aribeth&apos;s defection, Lord Nasher has elevated me from the role of spymaster to that of his right hand.</string>
<string name="43027">To be honest, I much prefer to stay in the shadows. Yet Neverwinter has need of me so I will serve without complaint.</string>
<string name="43028">Neverwinter has need of all her allies now, &lt;FirstName&gt; - whether they serve for honor, duty or gold.</string>
<string name="43029">I have examined the reconnaissance reports of my operatives in the field, and the situation is grim indeed.</string>
<string name="43030">Of course, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I shall get right to the point.</string>
<string name="43031">She abandoned us, but part of me wonders if we did not first turn our backs on her suffering. But hindsight serves no purpose now.</string>
<string name="43032">It has not been easy to gather information on Maugrim&apos;s cult, &lt;FirstName&gt; - but we know they are frantically searching for the ancient artifacts known as the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="43033">You must find these ancient Words before Maugrim does, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you do not, then I fear any victory by the Lords&apos; Alliance will prove meaningless.</string>
<string name="43034">If you find one of the Words bring it back to me here. My underground network will transport it to the safety of Lord Nasher&apos;s castle.</string>
<string name="43035">(sigh) Sometimes I am amazed at all you have accomplished, given your intellectual limitations. Very well, I shall go over the mission again.</string>
<string name="43036">We will leave right now, if you are ready.</string>
<string name="43037">I only hope we are not too late.</string>
<string name="43038">Do not judge her too harshly, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Love and hate are two sides of the same coin; both are emotions we have little control over.</string>
<string name="43039">Aribeth loved Neverwinter, just as she loved Fenthick - and the city she loved turned its hatred and desire for vengeance on the man she loved.</string>
<string name="43040">I cannot be so quick to condemn Aribeth for a similar change in her own feelings.</string>
<string name="43041">I am not saying I agree with Aribeth&apos;s actions - only that perhaps I can understand them. However, my loyalty still lies with Neverwinter and I desire nothing more than to stop Aribeth from claiming her vengeance.</string>
<string name="43042">I know what it is to have someone you can not bear to lose. If Lord Nasher had executed you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, perhaps I would have fallen under the same madness as Aribeth.</string>
<string name="43043">I must admit, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I was glad when Lord Nasher informed me you would be coming on this mission as well. The thought of being apart from you was... unpleasant.</string>
<string name="43044">Neverwinter has need of me, &lt;FirstName&gt; - and of you. We must all do our part if this latest threat to the city is to be thwarted.</string>
<string name="43045">Is there some way I can be of further assistance to you?</string>
<string name="43046">Yet duty calls, and in this matter we must all serve our part. My role is here coordinating the Lords&apos; Alliance, but your mission calls for you to recover the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="43047">Is there anything I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Uh... to help you in your quest, I mean.</string>
<string name="43048">It is a pleasure to see you again, &lt;FirstName&gt; - as always. It is unfortunate we cannot spend more time together.</string>
<string name="43049">You are truly a remarkable woman, &lt;FirstName&gt; - though I knew this already. On behalf of Lord Nasher and Neverwinter, please accept this reward of 3000 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="43050">Good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt; - and be careful. I would hate to lose you.</string>
<string name="43051">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Your point is well taken - and you surely know I could never refuse a woman such as you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="43052">As a spymaster I normally pride myself on keeping my feelings well hidden, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Do you know me so well you can already see through my emotionless facade?</string>
<string name="43053">I... I suppose I could blame it on the failing war effort. However, I feel I must speak freely with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I owe you that much, at least.</string>
<string name="43054">What we have... the feelings we share... this is all new to me. It is exciting, but at the same time I am... troubled.</string>
<string name="43055">Just friends? Oh... I... forgive me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I just thought... I thought we were more.</string>
<string name="43056">Damn it, Aarin - you&apos;re a bloody fool! I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I won&apos;t embarass either of us by bringing this up again.</string>
<string name="43057">We are friends and allies in the cause of Neverwinter, nothing more. So, how may I help you in the service of our common cause.</string>
<string name="43058">I... I care for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I also have a sworn duty to Neverwinter, and in my experience you cannot mix love and duty.</string>
<string name="43059">I&apos;m... I&apos;m afraid to love you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am afraid to let myself love you, because of the consequences when I must choose between love and duty.</string>
<string name="43060">Aribeth must have thought the same thing, yet she was forced to choose between Neverwinter and Fenthick. The conflict destroyed her - look what she has become.</string>
<string name="43061">And even I had to make such a choice. With Calli. I could have let her live. We could have spent our lives together, if I had only betrayed Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="43062">Is this what awaits me, &lt;FirstName&gt;? The choice of murder in the name of duty, or betrayal in the name of love? I do not know if I can bear to make such a choice again.</string>
<string name="43063">I chose Neverwinter over Calli. I could have let her live, we could have spent our lives together, if I had been willing to betray Lord Nasher and Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="43064">And what of Aribeth? She chose duty over love, and it destroyed her. Look what she has become now, &lt;FirstName&gt; - a traitorous creature of hate.</string>
<string name="43065">I know you are right, &lt;FirstName&gt;... but I am still afraid. I don&apos;t know if I can bring myself to say the words I want to say to you.</string>
<string name="43066">I... I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can&apos;t promise you will always be first in my life. I wish I could, but... I just can&apos;t.</string>
<string name="43067">You want what I cannot give, and I am afraid to take what you offer. Perhaps... perhaps it would be best if we did not pursue this further, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="43068">I will not trouble you with by bringing this up again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We have a job to do. We must stay focused on saving Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="43069">You&apos;re right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Only a fool would refuse to build a house for fear it might burn down!</string>
<string name="43070">I love you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I love you with all my heart. I was afraid to admit it before, but you have given me the courage to open my heart.</string>
<string name="43071">Your words... you words give me strength, &lt;FirstName&gt;. They sound **right**. I was a fool to hide from my true feelings.</string>
<string name="43072">I would like nothing better than to run away with you, my love - to whisk you away to the secret tropical paradises I knew when I was a pirate maurading the coast.</string>
<string name="43073">But alas, such fantasies will have to wait. Perhaps, once Neverwinter is safe Lord Nasher will release me from my debt of service. But until then my place remains here.</string>
<string name="43074">Well spoken, my love. I must remain here, coordinating the efforts of the various factions in the Lords&apos; Alliance. And your duty lies out there, seeking the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="43075">Is there anything I can do to aid you in your mission, my love?</string>
<string name="43076">It is good to see you again, my love - though I am sorry if my face does not reflect it. The tides of battle seem to be turning against us.</string>
<string name="43077">The Luskan forces are winning many victories in the field, and I am afraid that if we do not find the final Words soon it may be too late.</string>
<string name="43078">I&apos;m afraid one person can make little difference on the battlefield, my love - even one as remarkable as you.</string>
<string name="43079">No, your talents are best utilized in seeking out the remaining Words of Power, just as my talents are best used here coordinating the flow of information between the members of the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="43080">My mother&apos;s amulet... the one I gave you. You still have it.</string>
<string name="43081">No... no, of course not! I&apos;m sorry if I gave you that impression.</string>
<string name="43082">I... I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I wanted you to have the amulet. It was special to me - as are you. But after I gave it to you, I didn&apos;t know what to do next.</string>
<string name="43083">We seemed... we seemed to have a connection. I felt a bond between us. But now I am... unsure.</string>
<string name="43084">Everything happened so quickly: the discovery of the cult, Aribeth&apos;s betrayal, the Luskan armies massing.</string>
<string name="43085">Suddenly I was Lord Nasher&apos;s right-hand and my duties and responsibilites increased tenfold. And you... once again, everyone is counting on you to be the hero. To save us when no one else can.</string>
<string name="43086">And I wasn&apos;t sure if you wanted to pursue this matter. Us, I mean. So I thought it best to leave the next step up to you.</string>
<string name="43087">I... I don&apos;t know. Forgive me if I made a mistake, but this is all very new to me. Except for Calli, I have not had much experience in relationships.</string>
<string name="43088">And even my relationship with Calli began as part of my service to Neverwinter. You are different, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I... I want to be with you.</string>
<string name="43089">But there is so much expected of us both right now. So many people depending on us. I don&apos;t know if I can set aside these burdens for you.</string>
<string name="43090">I suppose you are right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I do not want to throw away what we share.</string>
<string name="43091">Many times I have wanted a confidant, someone to turn to for advice and... and comfort. Now that I have found you I would be a fool to let you slip away.</string>
<string name="43092">You&apos;re right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I guess I am so used to being alone, to relying on myself, that I have forgotten how to ask for help.</string>
<string name="43093">Promise me, &lt;FirstName&gt;... promise me that we will be there for each other, no matter what happens. Promise me we will see this challenge through to the end.</string>
<string name="43094">Perhaps, when this is all over... but these are thoughts best left for later. We must concentrate on stopping Maugrim and Aribeth now - or there may be no future for us.</string>
<string name="43095">If it were possible, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I would go with you on your journeys. But my skills are in information and analyzing reconnaissance. I am needed here.</string>
<string name="43096">But even though I cannot go with you in your quest for the Words, &lt;FirstName&gt;, know that whatever trials you face my spirit is by your side.</string>
<string name="43097">I thought I knew you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I see now you are not the woman I thought you were. Very well.</string>
<string name="43098">It is my pleasure and my privelege to grant you these 3500 gold coins, my lady. You truly are a shining example in these dark times.</string>
<string name="43099">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; How can I say no to one as beautiful and talented as you, &lt;FirstName&gt;? And you do have a good point.</string>
<string name="43100">Take this reward of 5000 gold coins - along with my thanks. And know that whatever awaits us, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I am glad that we will face it together.</string>
<string name="43101">I wish you luck in your mission, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Return to me once you have another of the Words.</string>
<string name="43102">I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt; - I had no right to make such a demand of you. I suppose all we can do is wait and see what fate will bring us.</string>
<string name="43103">Lillian has promised to offer whatever help she can to any of my agents in this matter. You can probably find her in the tavern in the southeast corner of the camp.</string>
<string name="43104">Greetings.</string>
<string name="43105">You&apos;ve got a serious attitude problem.</string>
<string name="43106">I&apos;m here to talk about Rolgan&apos;s trial.</string>
<string name="43107">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43108">Me no like you talk!</string>
<string name="43109">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43110">I&apos;d rather mate with a dead ogre.</string>
<string name="43111">Forget it, you&apos;re not my type.</string>
<string name="43112">Sure. I&apos;m always ready for some good lovin&apos;!</string>
<string name="43113">I&apos;d better just go now.</string>
<string name="43114">You ugly. Me no like.</string>
<string name="43115">Me want sex now!</string>
<string name="43116">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43117">Very enlightened attitude you have there.</string>
<string name="43118">What are your feelings about this case?</string>
<string name="43119">Sounds like you figure he&apos;s already guilty.</string>
<string name="43120">You&apos;re a disgusting, vile man.</string>
<string name="43121">Is there anyway I can guarantee you find Rolgan not guilty?</string>
<string name="43122">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Here&apos;s 100 gold pieces to make sure Rolgan is acquitted.</string>
<string name="43123">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Here&apos;s 300 gold pieces to make sure Rolgan is acquitted.</string>
<string name="43124">Forget it, I don&apos;t trust you. I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43125">Wow, somebody smacked you with the ugly stick! Still, I&apos;ve never been that picky.</string>
<string name="43126">Smile, baby, this is your lucky day. I may be old and covered in open sores, but don&apos;t let that turn you off! I got a special today: a free ride on the wild Averik for every &lt;race&gt; female who comes along.</string>
<string name="43127">Shove off, buddy. These open sores on my face make it tough enough to attract the ladies without your ugly mug hanging around and cramping my style.</string>
<string name="43128">Hey, no hard feelings doll. We&apos;re both adults. Sometimes these things just don&apos;t work out.</string>
<string name="43129">Kind of a dumb chicken, ain&apos;t ya? Guess that drool on your chin should have tipped me off. Ah well, your loss.</string>
<string name="43130">Mate with a dead ogre, huh? You didn&apos;t use to do a stage show at this club back in Luskan a few years ago, did you? No? Nevermind.</string>
<string name="43131">Whoa, coming on kind of strong, ain&apos;t you? You&apos;re talking like a fella... wait a minute! I been burned by this before. Sorry, &apos;sister&apos; but I don&apos;t need any surprises under the skirt, you follow?</string>
<string name="43132">So what are you going to do about it? You try anything and every Lords&apos; Alliance soldier in this camp will be all over you!</string>
<string name="43133">Bye. Don&apos;t hurry back.</string>
<string name="43134">So take your prissy complaints about my attitude, stick &apos;em where the sun don&apos;t shine, and leave me alone.</string>
<string name="43135">Oh. That prissy priest, Neurik must have sent you. Can&apos;t figure out why that sawed off runt wanted me on the jury. Guess he figured I&apos;d be impartial since I hate all races, colors and creeds equally.</string>
<string name="43136">What can I say? You get down into the filthy gutters and everyone&apos;s crap stinks the same.</string>
<string name="43137">Griff was a rotten bastard, and the Uthgardt did us all a favor by offing him. But if we let him go, we might have drunken savages running through the streets sacrificing us to their goat gods, you know?</string>
<string name="43138">The only good thing about that Uthgardt is his wife. I can&apos;t wait to see her up testifying at the trial. She&apos;s one fine piece of meat, hoo-eee! I wouldn&apos;t mind having her pork chops on my plate at dinner tonight.</string>
<string name="43139">If you&apos;re offering a bribe, I&apos;m all ears.</string>
<string name="43140">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Pleasure doing business with you. Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll vote to let that Uthgardt go free. But the rest of the jurors are still your problem, not mine.</string>
<string name="43141">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I think you can afford more than that. Make it 300 or no deal.</string>
<string name="43142">Who are you?</string>
<string name="43143">I&apos;m representing Rolgan at his murder trial.</string>
<string name="43144">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43145">Who you be?</string>
<string name="43146">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43147">Sounds like you think Rolgan is innocent.</string>
<string name="43148">Is there any way I can guarantee you reach a verdict of not guilty?</string>
<string name="43149">On behalf of the Black Lion Uthgardt tribe, I welcome you to this camp.</string>
<string name="43150">I am Dalcia, a friend of the Uthgardt people. I would rather stay here in the camp of the Black Lion Tribe than subject myself to the stench of civilization hanging over the Lords&apos; Alliance barracks.</string>
<string name="43151">Surely as a fellow child of nature you can understand how I feel. If you explore the camp you will discover the Black Lion tribe shares our love of the unspoiled beauty of the natural world. The Uthgardt truly are a noble people.</string>
<string name="43152">I am Dalcia, a friend of the Uthgardt people. I would rather stay here in the camp of the Black Lion Tribe than subject myself to the stench of civilization hanging over the Lords&apos; Alliance barracks.</string>
<string name="43153">You are welcome to explore the tribal camp. I only ask that you respect the ways of the Black Lion Tribe and treat the Uthgardt with the honor they deserve.</string>
<string name="43154">I do not expect you to understand. Only those who count themselves among the children of nature, druids and rangers like myself, can truly appreciate the beauty to be found in this simple camp.</string>
<string name="43155">Ah, yes. Neurik mentioned he was seeking someone to defend Rolgan in this trial. I hope you truly appreciate the situation you have gotten yourself into.</string>
<string name="43156">The Uthgardt are a noble people, but their culture and beliefs seem strange to the Lords&apos; Alliance. Often, the Uthgardt are victims of prejudice and hatred simply because of who they are.</string>
<string name="43157">I will wait until the trial before I make that decison, of course. I only wanted you to be aware that the fact Rolgan is an Uthgardt might have something to do with him being on trial.</string>
<string name="43158">I hope you are not insinuating anything improper. Justice must run its proper course. Present a strong case on Rolgan&apos;s behalf. That is all you can do. Perhaps we should end this discussion now, before things are said that are best left unspoken. </string>
<string name="43159">Who are you?</string>
<string name="43160">I am here about Rolgan&apos;s trial.</string>
<string name="43161">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43162">How do you feel about this case?</string>
<string name="43163">How much would it cost to get you to bring back an innocent verdict at the trial?</string>
<string name="43164">Who you be?</string>
<string name="43165">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43166">It was just a joke, relax...</string>
<string name="43167">Welcome to the Temple of Tyr. Should you require the services of a priest, please speak to Neurik.</string>
<string name="43168">I am Edegar, a minor acolyte in the service of Tyr. Though I have little in the way of divine powers, I try to make myself useful by performing the day to day functions around the temple. </string>
<string name="43169">If you need the services of a true cleric you will have to speak to Neurik.</string>
<string name="43170">May the sword of Tyr&apos;s justice watch over you and keep you safe.</string>
<string name="43171">Of course, of course. Neurik has done me a great honor by selecting me for the jury in this case. I am looking forward to performing my duties in the administration of Tyr&apos;s justice.</string>
<string name="43172">Even though I disapprove of the Uthgardt&apos;s worship of a pagan god, I am not going to pre-judge him. The real culprit in this crime is the demon alcohol.</string>
<string name="43173">Of course the alcohol does not excuse the Uthgardt&apos;s behavior. Anyone who lets themself get drunk must bear the consequences of his actions. This is why I so strongly disapprove of consuming alcoholic beverages.</string>
<string name="43174">But I am keeping an open mind. I wish you well in this case, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. May the justice of Tyr be served.</string>
<string name="43175">You dare offer a bribe to me here in the Hall of Justice! I should report you to Neurik and have you barred from the case!</string>
<string name="43176">Yes, well, your jest was in very poor taste. I won&apos;t report you to Neurik, but I suggest in the future you approach this matter with the gravity it deserves.</string>
<string name="43177">I am &lt;FullName&gt;. I serve the Lords&apos; Alliance and the city of Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="43178">Who are you?</string>
<string name="43179">Die, lizardwoman scum!</string>
<string name="43180">I will not answer your questions!</string>
<string name="43181">Me &lt;FullName&gt;. Me serve Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="43182">Who you be?</string>
<string name="43183">Me kill you!</string>
<string name="43184">Me no talk you!</string>
<string name="43185">Maugrim is the enemy of Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="43186">Uh... yes. I serve Maugrim. Do you have a message for him?</string>
<string name="43187">I shall not rest until Maugrim is dead!</string>
<string name="43188">Me no serve Maugrim. He bad man.</string>
<string name="43189">Me want kill Maugrim!</string>
<string name="43190">I have answered your questions. Now tell me who you are!</string>
<string name="43191">Tell me something I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="43192">Me tell you me name. Now who you be?</string>
<string name="43193">Who are you?</string>
<string name="43194">I don&apos;t have time for this!</string>
<string name="43195">Who you be?</string>
<string name="43196">What lizard girly need tell?</string>
<string name="43197">Me no got time for story!</string>
<string name="43198">Maugrim will never succeed! I will stop him!</string>
<string name="43199">Wow, thanks Haedraline. I would have never figured Maugrim was seeking world domination without that little history of your people.</string>
<string name="43200">No worry, lizard girly. Me stop Maugrim!</string>
<string name="43201">Maugrim want be Master? Even dumb old me figure that out. You *BIG* help, lizard girly.</string>
<string name="43202">What? What&apos;s wrong?</string>
<string name="43203">You hurt, lizard girly?</string>
<string name="43204">Wait, you were going to say something more about the Words! </string>
<string name="43205">Morag? Who&apos;s Morag? Tell me before it&apos;s too late!</string>
<string name="43206">No go yet! What you say about Words, lizard girly?</string>
<string name="43207">Morag? Who that? No go, lizard girly. Tell who Morag be!</string>
<string name="43208">Good. With your spell gone maybe I can leave this stupid room!</string>
<string name="43209">You go bye-bye, girly lizard. Maybe me make door open now.</string>
<string name="43210">Morag?</string>
<string name="43211">Source Stone? What&apos;s the Source Stone?</string>
<string name="43212">Morag... You mentioned her once before.</string>
<string name="43213">Who are you?</string>
<string name="43214">What be Source Stone?</string>
<string name="43215">Who be Morag?</string>
<string name="43216">Who you be?</string>
<string name="43217">So you think if Morag awakes she&apos;ll turn the North into a tropical jungle?</string>
<string name="43218">Morag make winter go away? She got big magic!</string>
<string name="43219">Morag was foolish to trust her fate to a group of slaves.</string>
<string name="43220">Morag big stupid, hoping slaves wake her up!</string>
<string name="43221">How did Maugrim become involved in all this?</string>
<string name="43222">How Maugrim get mixed up in this stuff?</string>
<string name="43223">What do you have to tell me?</string>
<string name="43224">Word Slaves?</string>
<string name="43225">Old Ones?</string>
<string name="43226">When the world was hot? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="43227">What does this have to do with me?</string>
<string name="43228">Why you tell me this?</string>
<string name="43229">Can you tell me about the extinction of the Old Ones?</string>
<string name="43230">If your people were wiped out, how did you survive?</string>
<string name="43231">Why &quot;Creator Race&quot; go bye-bye?</string>
<string name="43232">If lizard girly friends all dead, why lizard girly still here?</string>
<string name="43233">There better be a point to all this.</string>
<string name="43234">You story boring. Hurry finish, lizard girly.</string>
<string name="43235">What happened to the Words of Power when the Old Ones died?</string>
<string name="43236">What does this have to do with Maugrim?</string>
<string name="43237">What you mean, world be hot? World not hot! World be cold!</string>
<string name="43238">What happened to this tropical paradise?</string>
<string name="43239">Why jungle go bye-bye?</string>
<string name="43240">What Maugrim got do with all this?</string>
<string name="43241">When Oldies die, where go Power Words?</string>
<string name="43242">Tell me about the coming of this endless winter.</string>
<string name="43243">Where come big winter?</string>
<string name="43244">Why would she imprison herself inside this Source Stone?</string>
<string name="43245">Why Morag go inside stone?</string>
<string name="43246">Somehow I will stop Maugrim!</string>
<string name="43247">Complete and utter devastation. Sounds serious.</string>
<string name="43248">Me stop Maugrim!</string>
<string name="43249">Morag want make big bad boom. Me not like.</string>
<string name="43250">Die, lizard scum!</string>
<string name="43251">Me kill lizard girlie!</string>
<string name="43252">Why have you seized this Word of Power? **hiss** Who do you serve?</string>
<string name="43253">My magic has sealed the door, the Word of Power shall not leave until you have answered my questions. **hiss** Who do you serve!</string>
<string name="43254">First you must answer me!</string>
<string name="43255"> **hiss** You cannot slay a projection, &lt;race&gt; fool!!</string>
<string name="43256">These names mean nothing to me. **hiss** Your cities are young, your history but a single page in the accounts of the world.</string>
<string name="43257">There is only one name that mattersss to me among your kind - Maugrim. **hiss** Tell me &lt;race&gt; one - do you serve Maugrim?</string>
<string name="43258">Your lies are known to me, &lt;race&gt; one! **hiss** I sense that you seek Maugrim&apos;s defeat! This is good.</string>
<string name="43259">I see you speak the truth, &lt;race&gt; one. This is good.</string>
<string name="43260">Your enemies are mine as well. Maugrim must be stopped. He must not get the Words of Power!</string>
<string name="43261">My name is Haedraline, leader of the Word Slaves. **hiss** This is but a projection of my true form - I am yet too far to aid you in this task.</string>
<string name="43262">There is more I would tell you, but my spell is fading. **hiss** Find the Words before Maugrim, or the world you know will not survive.</string>
<string name="43263">The third Word is yours - but time is short and Morag stirs. **hiss** The city you call Neverwinter is under siege. Soon it will fall to Maugrim and he will possess the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="43264">I am Haedraline, leader of the Word Slaves. **hiss** Your enemy is also mine - I must warn you of Maugrim and his followers.</string>
<string name="43265">Time? What is time? A second, a day, a year, a thousand years - how long have I waited and watched and guarded while the Old Ones sleep. **hiss** You will listen - or my spell shall not release the door!</string>
<string name="43266">Maugrim seeks to unlock the dormant power of the Words so that he may enslave again. Word Slaves, humans, dwarves, elves - Maugrim would have all bow to him as Master. </string>
<string name="43267">Spare me your sarcasm, &lt;race&gt; one! **hiss** You are as big a fool as Maugrim!</string>
<string name="43268">Maugrim is already doomed. **hiss** The Words were meant to release ancient evil upon the land to devastate those who survived the change the Old Ones could not.</string>
<string name="43269">The plague was only the first of the evils the Words will unleash. **hiss** The world as you know it shall be no more if Maugrim succeeds! This is the legacy of the Creators.</string>
<string name="43270">The Words will... UNH!!! No - it cannot be! UNH - Morag!</string>
<string name="43271">Morag - she strikes at me! This cannot be - UNH! She attacks me through the Words - UNH! She disrupts my spell of projection - UNH!</string>
<string name="43272">Noooooo!!!!</string>
<string name="43273">I am Haedraline, Word Slave and handmaiden to Morag before she was entombed in the Source Stone. **hiss** My spell seals the door - you must speak to me or you shall not leave.</string>
<string name="43274">Morag was the Queen of my people - the Old Ones, the Creator Race. **hiss** It was she who created the Source Stone when the world became cold and the snow covered the land.</string>
<string name="43275">Morag used the Words to put her people into a deep hibernation when the cold winter came, imprisoning the heat of the steam fissures in the magical Source Stone - and her and all her people with it.</string>
<string name="43276">Within the Source Stone Morag would gather her strength year after year, century after century. **hiss** When her power waxed full, we Word Slaves would awaken the Queen to banish the never ending winter.</string>
<string name="43277">The Source Stone is buried beneath the streets of Neverwinter, and even in its dormant state the magical heat radiating from within keeps the city habitable during the coldest blizzards.</string>
<string name="43278">Imagine what will happen when the power is awakened fully and released. Those who survive the global warming will become slaves to the Creators, and I will be bound to the Words of Power once more. **hiss** I will not allow this to happen!</string>
<string name="43279">You do not comprehend the magic that once bound the Word Slaves to the Words! **hiss** We were compelled to obey, even though our Masters slept. But Morag underestimated us.</string>
<string name="43280">Abandoned in the frozen waste, we grew strong enough to free ourselves from our wretched servitude. **hiss** We scattered the Words that their power might never enslave us again, and our Masters might never awake.</string>
<string name="43281">Something has awakened Morag&apos;s spirit - though her body and true power remain trapped in the Source Stone for now. She speaks to Maugrim through projections as I am speaking to you.</string>
<string name="43282">Maugrim serves her, a pawn blinded by her promises of rewards and power. **hiss** The plague was the first step in Morag&apos;s return. Each death fed the Queen&apos;s power, bringing her closer to a true awakening.</string>
<string name="43283">Now Maugrim seeks to claim the Words of Power the Lords&apos; Alliance has hidden in Castle Never to complete the awakening. If he succeeds Morag will bring complete and utter devastation to the North.</string>
<string name="43284">You have done well, to find the second Word. **hiss** Its power draws my spell so that my projection may speak to you in this vision. There is much you must know.</string>
<string name="43285"> **hiss** Maugrim is nothing but a fool. He does not truly understand what he seeeks. The Words are ancient beyond imagination, they contain power he cannot fathom.</string>
<string name="43286">I, Haedraline of the Word Slaves, was there at the beginning when the world was hot and this land was jungle where the Old Ones ruled.</string>
<string name="43287">The humans and elves and dwarves were but slaves to my people, the Creator Race. Just as I was a slave bound with the power of the Words, **hiss** until the extinction of my people and the coming of the endless winter.</string>
<string name="43288">The world grew cold, the jungles died. Frost and snow covered the land. For all their power, the Masters could not stop the change. **hiss** They vanished from the world, consumed by the earth that had turned against them.</string>
<string name="43289">When the Old Ones vanished, the power of their Words remained. As did we, the Word Slaves bound to that power, forced to walk the now frozen and desolate earth. Forced to preserve the Words and legacy of our Masters. </string>
<string name="43290"> **hiss** Many Word Slaves died when the endless winter came. But some learned to survive in the frozen waste; hiding from the lesser races who now hunted us. To survive what the Masters could not endure. </string>
<string name="43291">Over the centuries the magic of the Words became dormant, their power faded. And as we who were left behind grew strong the bonds enslaving us were broken. </string>
<string name="43292">We who had once been Slaves scattered and hid the Words so that we would be forever free of their legacy. **hiss** Now thousands of years have passed and even we who hid the Words no longer know where to find them.</string>
<string name="43293">Once this winter land was a lush jungle. Vents from the earth blasted scorching steam into the sky and the world was warm and fruitful. The Old Ones lived in this paradise, as did we Word Slaves.</string>
<string name="43294">The Old Ones are my people, an ancient race of lizard folk who ruled the North before the dawn of time. We were old when even the elves were young, we were the first, we were the Creator Race.</string>
<string name="43295">But we were also a race of unbridled cruelty. **hiss** The strong ruled and the weak suffered - and we Word Slaves suffered most of all. Such was the way when the world was young and hot.</string>
<string name="43296">The living power of the Words Maugrim seeks had to be bound in the flesh of the Word Slaves. **hiss** We were unwilling guardians, our souls tied to the ancient magic of the Old Ones.</string>
<string name="43297">When the world was hot we Word Slaves suffered for the empire of the Old Ones, **hiss** the Words ripping their power from our tortured spirits and our living flesh.</string>
<string name="43298">The Old Ones could not survive the coming of the winter storm. **hiss** Morag sought a shelter where she could escape the death of ice and cold.</string>
<string name="43299"> **hiss** You must return to Neverwinter before the city falls. Speak to the one you call Aarin Gend - - I will try to meet you there.</string>
<string name="43300">You cannot slay me - this is but a projection of my true form!</string>
<string name="43301">Speak with me **hiss*. We have much to learn from each other.</string>
<string name="43302">Did you see who actually started the fight?</string>
<string name="43303">Was the Uthgardt in his right mind, or did he seem intoxicated to you?</string>
<string name="43304">Isn&apos;t it true that Griff spiked Rolgan&apos;s drink earlier that evening?</string>
<string name="43305">Can you tell me how Griff felt toward the Uthgardt?</string>
<string name="43306">I have no more questions for this witness.</string>
<string name="43307">You never actually witnessed the start of the fight, did you?</string>
<string name="43308">Don&apos;t you think Rolgan&apos;s judgment was impaired by all the alcohol he had consumed?</string>
<string name="43309">Griff had spiked Rolgan&apos;s drink that night, right Zed?</string>
<string name="43310">Rolgan lost a lot of money that night, didn&apos;t he Zed? Can you explain that?</string>
<string name="43311">I have no further questions for this witness.</string>
<string name="43312">So drunk he didn&apos;t know what he was doing?</string>
<string name="43313">So maybe Griff started the fight and Rolgan was just defending himself.</string>
<string name="43314">So Griff is partly to blame for his own death?</string>
<string name="43315">So this fight could have been started by Griff?</string>
<string name="43316">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe Griff thought that since Rolgan was drugged the Uthgardt would be an easy target in a fight.</string>
<string name="43317">Don&apos;t you think that that&apos;s a mitigating circumstance in what happened?</string>
<string name="43318">Don&apos;t you think that might have been a factor in Griff&apos;s death?</string>
<string name="43319">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe Griff attacked Rolgan because he thought his cheating had been discovered.</string>
<string name="43320">Tell me why you sent your husband to see Griff.</string>
<string name="43321">Tell me about the significance of the heirlooms your husband had gambled away.</string>
<string name="43322">Do you think your husband is on trial here simply because he is an Uthgardt?</string>
<string name="43323">I have no more questions for Vanda.</string>
<string name="43324">I would like to question Rolgan.</string>
<string name="43325">I am ready for closing arguments.</string>
<string name="43326">Tell us what happened that night, Rolgan.</string>
<string name="43327">What was your state of mind that night, Rolgan? Were you thinking clearly?</string>
<string name="43328">Do you think the only reason you are here is because you are an Uthgardt?</string>
<string name="43329">I have no further questions for this witness.</string>
<string name="43330">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; The jury may think this is merely an excuse to justify what you have done, Rolgan.</string>
<string name="43331">The prosecution witnesses never saw who started the fight, so we must accept Rolgan&apos;s claim of self defense as truth.</string>
<string name="43332">We know Griff was a violent man who hated the Uthgardt. He probably started the fight himself.</string>
<string name="43333">Because he was drunk, Rolgan is clearly not responsible for his actions.</string>
<string name="43334">Griff spiked Rolgan&apos;s drink, making Rolgan more prone to act irrationally.</string>
<string name="43335">The heirlooms Griff had taken were valuable religious artifacts of great value to the Black Lion tribe.</string>
<string name="43336">Rolgan is here because he is an Uthgardt, an outsider. Don&apos;t let your racist prejudices judge him.</string>
<string name="43337">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; The inherent racism of the courts has been mentioned often at this trial, but that is not the real issue. </string>
<string name="43338">Forget about accusations of racism. Griff attacked Rolgan, Rolgan defended himself. That is the only issue here.</string>
<string name="43339">The defense rests its case.</string>
<string name="43340">Griff cheated at cards, and when he saw Rolgan he attacked him out of fear Rolgan had found out.</string>
<string name="43341">My name is Igland of the Swift Sword. I am the special prosecutor in the investigation of the death of the Lords&apos; Alliance mercenary known as Griff, and I would like to remind the jury that I have never lost a case. **Never**.</string>
<string name="43342">The witnesses have been sworn in, and may the light of Tyr&apos;s justice shine down on this trial and expose any lies in their testimony. To begin my case I would like to question Lodar, an eye-witness to the events. </string>
<string name="43343">I&apos;m here, yer honor.</string>
<string name="43344">I&apos;m not the judge, Lodar, just the prosecutor. You don&apos;t have to be so formal. Just call me sir. Please tell us what happened in your own words.</string>
<string name="43345">Well, sir, it was night and Griff was outside the barracks. All of a sudden we heard this shout, and we run out and Griff and that Uthgardt there are going at each other with weapons drawn.</string>
<string name="43346">Before we could step in, that savage stabs Griff right in the gut and runs off. We ran to get the cleric, but by then it were too late. Griff was gone. That savage killed him!</string>
<string name="43347">I&apos;m ready for your questions, &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="43348">If defense council has finished trying to obscure the truth, I will call Zed, my next witness. Zed, tell the court what you witnessed on that night.</string>
<string name="43349">Right, sir. Well, it&apos;s like Lodar said. Griff was outside, we heard him shout, we run out and the Uthgardt sticks a blade in Griff&apos;s belly. Then that savage runs off to the Temple for sanctuary like some kind of coward!</string>
<string name="43350">Well spoken, Zed. He ran off like a murderous coward. Obviously he&apos;s guilty. They always run when they&apos;re guilty. This case might be my easiest win yet. Your witness, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="43351">No, they were already going at it by the time we got there.</string>
<string name="43352">He was pretty drunk. </string>
<string name="43353">I guess so. Maybe. Don&apos;t know if that&apos;s a good excuse, though.</string>
<string name="43354">Yeah, I guess. Could be Griff started it. I don&apos;t know, I wasn&apos;t there.</string>
<string name="43355">Yeah. He wanted to mess that Uthgardt up so he could beat him at cards, you know? Make him not think straight.</string>
<string name="43356">Well, it was his fault the Uthgardt was doped up. Maybe if Rolgan was in his right mind he wouldn&apos;t have killed Griff.</string>
<string name="43357">He didn&apos;t like them much. He was always complaining about them as &apos;damn savages&apos; and &apos;filthy Uthgardt.&apos; Always picking fights with them, looking for trouble.</string>
<string name="43358">Wouldn&apos;t be the first time he let his temper get the better of him. Always was a bit of a hot-head, especially when it came to those Uthgardt. He hated them something fierce.</string>
<string name="43359">I guess he could have thought that. He didn&apos;t like the Uthgardt much. He would have jumped at a chance to kill one of them off if he thought he could get away with it.</string>
<string name="43360">No, I didn&apos;t see who started the fight. So, yeah, it could have been Griff, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re getting at.</string>
<string name="43361">Sure, he was drunk. But that don&apos;t mean you get to go kill people. You have to know how to hold your drinks, right? Know your limits.</string>
<string name="43362">Yeah, he put something in Rolgan&apos;s drink. Made his mind fuzzy, so he didn&apos;t really understand what he was doing.</string>
<string name="43363">I don&apos;t know what &quot;mitigating&quot; means, but Griff shouldn&apos;t have spiked that Uthgardt&apos;s drink. That&apos;s wrong... Griff was always doing stupid stuff like that.</string>
<string name="43364">Griff cheated. He wanted to win so he could humilate that Uthgardt; embarass and ruin him. So he cheated during the card game.</string>
<string name="43365">I warned Griff that that Uthgardt would be mad after losing everything he owned. I said it would lead to trouble, but Griff didn&apos;t care. He said he welcomed trouble with the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="43366">If Griff thought someone was coming to settle a score, he wouldn&apos;t wait. Griff would make sure he made the first move. He preferred to start fights himself, you know?</string>
<string name="43367">If the defense has finished with their blathering, the prosecution has only one witness left. I call on Vanda, the wife of the accused.</string>
<string name="43368">I am here. Ask your questions.</string>
<string name="43369">I sense some hostility on your part, young lady. Please remember, I am only doing my job. It&apos;s not my fault your husband had to go on a killing spree. </string>
<string name="43370">Neither my husband nor I would ever commit vile murder. We Uthgardt are an honorable people!</string>
<string name="43371">Yes, you Uthgardt take honor very seriously. Wasn&apos;t Rolgan ashamed at having gambled away everything he owned? Didn&apos;t he want to do anything to wipe away that shame?</string>
<string name="43372">Yes, but he wouldn&apos;t have killed that man!</string>
<string name="43373">So you say. But we know how strong Uthgardt honor is, and Rolgan is a proud warrior. Surely a jury as intelligent and attractive as this one must realize that his pride would have driven Rolgan to kill Griff in a desperate attempt to salvage his wounded honor. </string>
<string name="43374">Defense may cross-examine now. I have no further questions for this witness, since she all but admitted her husband is a rampaging serial killer.</string>
<string name="43375">I told Rolgan to go speak with Griff... To beg him to return the heirlooms he had taken from us. To appeal to Griff&apos;s sense of decency. My husband is no killer. He only went back because I sent him there to talk with Griff.</string>
<string name="43376">These are more than just heirlooms. They are artifacts of great religious significance to the Black Lion tribe. Their value is greater than mere money. Why, they mean more than life itself to the worshippers of Uthgar!</string>
<string name="43377">More than life itself? So what was Griff, a human sacrifice to Uthgar in one of your savage pagan rituals?</string>
<string name="43378">Igland! Such comments are not appropriate! The Uthgardt beliefs may differ from our own, but they are not on trial here! Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, continue with your questions.</string>
<string name="43379">You people hate the Uthgardt! For generations the Lords&apos; Alliance has persecuted us because we were different! You are nothing but a bunch of racists! </string>
<string name="43380">The court does not take kindly to your accusations, young lady. Your husband is here because a man is dead! Don&apos;t forget it was this Temple of Tyr that gave Rolgan sanctuary!</string>
<string name="43381">&lt;FirstName&gt;, in the future you might want to advise your client against calling the jurors racists during the trial. It doesn&apos;t go over well. Please, continue with the questions.</string>
<string name="43382">If it pleases the court, the prosecution rests its case. Can&apos;t we just start the execution now? No? Okay, defense may call their witnesses if they wish, though I hardly see the point. </string>
<string name="43383">Yes, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. What do you wish to know?</string>
<string name="43384">I shall move on to my closing arguments. This will be short, since the Uthgardt is so obviously guilty. Rolgan owed Griff money. Two witnesses saw Rolgan kill Griff. What could be more simple?</string>
<string name="43385">We have heard how much the Uthgardt valued the heirlooms Rolgan gambled away. A proud Uthgardt warrior would do anything to get those religious artifacts back... even kill the man who had taken them.</string>
<string name="43386">The defense has raised the issue of Rolgan&apos;s Uthgardt heritage, trying to claim this trial is a racist sham. But this is simply an argument to obscure the true facts. Being an Uthgardt does not give you a license to commit murder! </string>
<string name="43387">Do your duty, members of the jury. Find Rolgan guilty of murder, and let justice be done. Such is the will of Tyr. If it pleases the court, the prosecution rests.</string>
<string name="43388">&lt;FirstName&gt;, you may make your closing arguments now.</string>
<string name="43389">My wife convinced me to go speak with Griff, to beg him to return the heirlooms to me. But when I approached Griff, he attacked as soon as he saw me. I had no choice but to defend myself.</string>
<string name="43390">No, my mind was hazy with the fog from the many cups I had consumed. It was as if I was in a dream, nothing seemed real. I hardly even realized what was happening until it was too late and Griff was dead. </string>
<string name="43391">That is not my intent. I know I must be responsible for my own actions, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. But that night I was not thinking rationally. When Griff attacked, my instincts took over and I defended myself. I am no murderer, and I hope the court can understand that.</string>
<string name="43392">I believe the Lords&apos; Alliance must appease their own soldiers. If an innocent Uthgardt must be sacrificed for that end, they would not hesitate to do so. </string>
<string name="43393">Since the defense called the accused to the stand, I claim my right to cross-examine this killer. I will keep this brief, much like poor Griff&apos;s life. Rolgan, you are an Uthgardt warrior?</string>
<string name="43394">I am a true Uthgardt warrior of the Black Lion tribe! I have earned the honor and respect of all my people!</string>
<string name="43395">And you earned this honor and respect on the battlefield, with the edge of your blade. What would happen to your precious honor if people found out you had gambled away everything you owned?</string>
<string name="43396">I would be shamed by my actions. I *am* shamed by my actions.</string>
<string name="43397">But you thought if Griff were to die, you could recover those heirlooms before anyone found out. Too bad his friends caught you in the act, killer! Wait, nevermind, don&apos;t answer. I withdraw the question. I wouldn&apos;t want to prejudice the jury.</string>
<string name="43398">Hmph. Hardly a convincing argument...</string>
<string name="43399">An excuse, not a defense.</string>
<string name="43400">Luckily there are no witnesses to disprove this claim!</string>
<string name="43401">Sure, blame the victim!</string>
<string name="43402">That gave Rolgan the motive for the killing but it hardly justifies murder!</string>
<string name="43403">Oh, sure, no one but an Uthgardt has ever been accused of a crime by these courts! I guess the execution of Fenthick was all a dream, because we don&apos;t arrest anyone but the Uthgardt!</string>
<string name="43404">No? Then why do you keep bringing it up?</string>
<string name="43405">Or so you would have us all believe!</string>
<string name="43406">Then as Tyr&apos;s representative overseeing this trial, I proclaim judgment in this case. By the light of Tyr&apos;s truth, may justice be done!</string>
<string name="43407">Igland! Be quiet.</string>
<string name="43408">Igland, your time to speak is over!</string>
<string name="43409">I&apos;m warning you, Igland!</string>
<string name="43410">This is not the time for such comments, Igland!</string>
<string name="43411">Spare us your sarcasm, Igland. &lt;FirstName&gt; must be allowed to present closing arguments without your snide comments!</string>
<string name="43412">Enough, Igland!</string>
<string name="43413">I do not see three torches in the jury, the verdict is clear: guilty as charged. Rolgan shall be taken away for immediate execution. The rest of you are dismissed. The court thanks you for time.</string>
<string name="43414">Yes! In this corner, still undefeated, the greatest prosecutor of all time... Me! Ha-ha-ha-ha!</string>
<string name="43415">Igland, your work here is done. I suggest you leave before I write you up for your loutish behavior during these proceedings. You are a disgrace to the hallowed halls of this Temple!</string>
<string name="43416">&lt;FirstName&gt;, come speak to me when you wish to receive your just reward for your service here.</string>
<string name="43417">Igland, I have given you a lot of leeway in this case. But you are coming very close to crossing the line of what is acceptable!</string>
<string name="43418">Sorry, your honor. But this woman is looking at me like she wants to kill me. Must run in her family.</string>
<string name="43419">Igland, don&apos;t push me.</string>
<string name="43420">I am ready for your questions, &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="43421">A preposterous conspiracy theory! Next you&apos;ll blame the Night Masks for Griff&apos;s murder!</string>
<string name="43422">I&apos;m getting sick of all these uncalled for remarks, Igland.</string>
<string name="43423">The verdict is clear, a three to two decision to acquit. Rolgan, you are free go, as are the rest of you. The court thanks you for time.</string>
<string name="43424">The verdict is clear, a four to one decision to acquit. Rolgan, you are free to go, as are the rest of you. The court thanks you for time.</string>
<string name="43425">The verdict is clear, a unanimous five to zero decision to acquit. Rolgan, you are free go, as are the rest of you. The court thanks you for time.</string>
<string name="43426">But... this is impossible! I never lose! I&apos;m Igland the Swift Sword! I&apos;m the greatest prosecutor who ever lived! The jury must have been bribed! I demand an appeal! This is an outrage!</string>
<string name="43427">This trial is about my culture and beliefs, not about my actions. </string>
<string name="43428">That is all I require from this witness. Were it up to me we could end the trial right now and declare Rolgan guilty. But custom dictates I allow the defense to question the witness if they wish.</string>
<string name="43429">I&apos;m ready to answer this &lt;man/woman&gt;&apos;s questions.</string>
<string name="43430">Sorry, judge. I won&apos;t say another word while the honorable &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt; tries to defend these crimes.</string>
<string name="43431">Defense loses by forfeit! Rolgan is guilty by default! I win again!</string>
<string name="43432">Trial? What trial?</string>
<string name="43433">Neurik sent me. I&apos;m representing Rolgan.</string>
<string name="43434">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43435">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43436">I&apos;m preparing my case. What do you think about this trial?</string>
<string name="43437">Sounds like you&apos;re trying to keep an open mind.</string>
<string name="43438">Is there any way I could guarantee you find Rolgan innocent?</string>
<string name="43439">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; He&apos;ll never know. Here&apos;s 100 gold. Just make sure you find Rolgan innocent.</string>
<string name="43440">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; He&apos;ll never know. Here&apos;s 300 gold. Just make sure you find Rolgan innocent.</string>
<string name="43441">Hey, I was just testing you. You passed. Well done.</string>
<string name="43442">What do you want? You here about the trial?</string>
<string name="43443">See ya.</string>
<string name="43444">Come on, everybody&apos;s heard about it! Some Uthgardt is up for the murder of a Lords&apos; Alliance soldier. Go speak to Neurik in the Temple of Tyr; he can fill you in.</string>
<string name="43445">I figured as much. I ain&apos;t never been on a jury before. I seen my share of trials, but usually from the prisoner&apos;s box. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="43446">Looks to me like a bar fight gone out of hand. A few too many drinks in you and you act stupid. I&apos;ve been there myself, though I ain&apos;t never killed no one.</string>
<string name="43447">But you know what makes me mad about this case? Them people who run around saying the only reason this guy is on trial is cause he&apos;s an Uthgardt! I ain&apos;t no Uthgardt, and I&apos;ve been on trial a bunch of times!</string>
<string name="43448">I know what it&apos;s like. Sometimes you&apos;re just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Could be that&apos;s what happened to this Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="43449">I kind of hope you get him off. I&apos;d hate to have to sentence the poor guy to execution. But I&apos;ve got to give an honest verdict. Neurik says it&apos;s my duty.</string>
<string name="43450">Not much more I can tell you. Hope you got what you were looking for. Good luck in the trial.</string>
<string name="43451">You mean like a bribe? Geez, I don&apos;t know. I could use the money, but what if Neurik found out?</string>
<string name="43452">Whew! I almost took that money, you know? I hate to think what Neurik would have done. You tell him I did the right thing, okay?</string>
<string name="43453">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Okay, you got a deal. I&apos;ll make sure Rolgan gets a not guilty vote from me but I can&apos;t make the rest of the jury change their mind. I&apos;ll do my part, but the others are up to you.</string>
<string name="43454">No, I better not. What if Neurik found out? He&apos;d have me flogged! Or worse! He said it&apos;s my duty to deliver an honest verdict.</string>
<string name="43455">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m not looking to jam anyone up. I won&apos;t mention this to anyone but, if you want my vote, you&apos;ll just have to earn it in the court.</string>
<string name="43456">I&apos;m sure glad Rolgan&apos;s trial is over. I ain&apos;t never been on a jury before. It&apos;s almost as hard as being in the prisoner box!</string>
<string name="43457">Too bad he ended up getting executed. Makes me sick to see his remains stuck out there on that stake in front of the Temple. But Neurik said it ain&apos;t my fault. We jurors were just doing our duty.</string>
<string name="43458">I&apos;m glad the Uthgardt got off. At least now I don&apos;t have to walk past his head on a spike every time I go by the Temple of Tyr. I don&apos;t know if I could have handled that.</string>
<string name="43459">Trial? What trial?</string>
<string name="43460">I know about the trial. I&apos;m defending Rolgan.</string>
<string name="43461">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43462">Tell me what happened.</string>
<string name="43463">Don&apos;t get so worked up about this trial. Barkeep, a drink for my friend Lodar, please. I&apos;m buying.</string>
<string name="43464">Tell me what you know about the crime, or you might not live long enough to testify!</string>
<string name="43465">Anything else?</string>
<string name="43466">So you never saw who started the fight?</string>
<string name="43467">Maybe it was Griff who started the fight in the first place.</string>
<string name="43468">How about a refill? Bartender, bring me another drink for Lodar.</string>
<string name="43469">Anything else you can tell me about the trial?</string>
<string name="43470">Maybe Griff&apos;s to blame for the fight with that Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="43471">Secrets? What kind of secrets?</string>
<string name="43472">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; If there&apos;s something I should know for the trial you should tell me.</string>
<string name="43473">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; We&apos;re friends, aren&apos;t we? Have another drink on me and tell me what you know.</string>
<string name="43474"></string>
<string name="43475">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43476">Look, don&apos;t bother me right now. I got a lot on my mind, what with this trial and all.</string>
<string name="43477">One of them Uthgardt killed Griff. Stabbed him right in the gut. I saw the whole thing, so now I got to testify. Neurik over at the Temple is setting the whole thing up.</string>
<string name="43478">I don&apos;t want to be rude, but this trial has got me kind of worked up. I don&apos;t much feel like talking right now. Go talk to Neurik if you want to know more.</string>
<string name="43479">Funny, you don&apos;t look like a lawyer. But that ain&apos;t my business, I guess. You want to ask me some questions, go ahead.</string>
<string name="43480">Griff and that Uthgardt were playing cards. Gambling. Griff won a lot of money. So much that the Uthgardt had to give him some of his jewelry to cover the debt. Real fancy looking stuff. </string>
<string name="43481">Later that night Griff went outside. I heard him shout, and I rushed out to see him and that Uthgardt smashing swords. Guess the Uthgardt was better at it than Griff. I can&apos;t believe I have to testify about this. I&apos;ve never been to a trial before.</string>
<string name="43482">No, they was already fighting when I got there. I never thought it would end up with Griff dead and me having to go to that Uthgardt&apos;s trial!</string>
<string name="43483">That&apos;s all I know. I don&apos;t even understand why they need me at the trial. I wish I didn&apos;t have to go.</string>
<string name="43484">What kind of lawyer are you! I don&apos;t want no trouble! I told you everythin&apos; I know! Geez, you&apos;re as bad as Griff. He was always picking fights!</string>
<string name="43485">Maybe. He was a real son of a bitch sometimes. And he hated the Uthgardt. Figured they were nothing but drunken savages. He was always looking for an excuse to make trouble for them. </string>
<string name="43486">If you need anything else I&apos;ll be right here. Until the trial is over they&apos;ve got me off active duty, so I plan on spending my time here in the drinking house. </string>
<string name="43487">Hey, you&apos;re all right &lt;brother/sister&gt;. Good luck in that trial... and thanks for the drink.</string>
<string name="43488">Hey, I remember you! You&apos;re that lawyer. Mighty kind of you to buy me that drink.</string>
<string name="43489">Nah, I told you pretty much everything I know already.</string>
<string name="43490">Thanks, I needed that. Too bad you&apos;re trying to get Griff&apos;s killer off... I kind of like you. You&apos;re a nice &lt;man/woman&gt;. Not like Griff.</string>
<string name="43491">He was always getting into trouble. Picking fights, that kind of thing. Kind of a racist, too. Always going on about the Uthgardt being drunks and thieves and such.</string>
<string name="43492">Maybe, but I shouldn&apos;t be speaking ill of the dead. Griff had some ugly secrets, but now&apos;s not the time to drag it all out.</string>
<string name="43493">But it ain&apos;t my job to find out who&apos;s to blame, is it? That&apos;s your job. So instead of threatening me, why don&apos;t you leave me alone and go do your job?</string>
<string name="43494">I really shouldn&apos;t tell you. Griff was a friend, after all.</string>
<string name="43495">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; If I don&apos;t tell you, someone else probably will. And I don&apos;t want to get in no trouble.</string>
<string name="43496">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I think I&apos;ve had too much to drink and I don&apos;t want to say anything stupid. Forget what I said about Griff&apos;s secrets. It was nothing. Good luck with the trial. </string>
<string name="43497">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Sure, why not? Bartender, another round! </string>
<string name="43498">Griff&apos;s gone now anyway, so who cares if anyone finds out, right? Griff had a nasty habit of spiking the drinks of people he was gambling against.</string>
<string name="43499">He figured it would give him an edge over them, make their mind all hazy. Not really sporting, but that&apos;s the kind of guy Griff was.</string>
<string name="43500">I heard the Uthgardt aren&apos;t real happy about Neurik executing Rolgan. I even heard they got the body out there on a stake over near Tyr&apos;s Temple. That&apos;s a pretty harsh sentence.</string>
<string name="43501">Some of the mercenaries are complaining about Neurik over at the Temple of Tyr. They&apos;re mad because that Uthgardt was found innocent of murder. I guess they aren&apos;t too happy with the verdict.</string>
<string name="43502">I heard the trial over at Tyr&apos;s Temple ended with an acquittal. It&apos;s pretty hard to argue with such an overwhelming verdict, though a few mercenaries are complaining.</string>
<string name="43503">But like Neurik said, the trial is done and justice was served.</string>
<string name="43504">I have need of healing.</string>
<string name="43505">I would like to purchase some supplies.</string>
<string name="43506">Maybe I could help you with this problem.</string>
<string name="43507">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43508">Me need heal.</string>
<string name="43509">Me want buy stuff.</string>
<string name="43510">Maybe me can help you problem.</string>
<string name="43511">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43512">Maybe I could defend the Uthgardt warrior.</string>
<string name="43513">I could represent the Uthgardt... for a price.</string>
<string name="43514">Me want help. Me do trial.</string>
<string name="43515">Give money and me do trial.</string>
<string name="43516">I&apos;ve completed my investigations and I&apos;m ready to begin Rolgan&apos;s trial.</string>
<string name="43517">I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="43518">And what about the witnesses?</string>
<string name="43519">I&apos;ll begin my investigations right away.</string>
<string name="43520">Sounds simple: sword for guilty, torch for innocent.</string>
<string name="43521">I understand. Three jurors or more must be holding a torch to get Rolgan acquitted. And if I end the conversation before we&apos;re done, Rolgan suffers.</string>
<string name="43522">Can we go over the rules one more time?</string>
<string name="43523">I&apos;m ready. Let&apos;s begin.</string>
<string name="43524">Actually, I need some more time to prepare.</string>
<string name="43525">I remember, Neurik. Good to see you again.</string>
<string name="43526">Me remember. Good for see you again, Neurik.</string>
<string name="43527">Me not remember you, Neurik.</string>
<string name="43528">Sorry, Neurik. I don&apos;t remember you.</string>
<string name="43529">Who are you again?</string>
<string name="43530">Who you be, again?</string>
<string name="43531">Trial?</string>
<string name="43532">What do you mean about the outcome of Rolgan&apos;s trial?</string>
<string name="43533">What you mean &apos;bout outcome of trial?</string>
<string name="43534">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Your reward seems a little light, after all the work I did.</string>
<string name="43535">Listen, Neurik, I spent a lot of time on that trial! You better come up with some more cash if you know what&apos;s good for you!</string>
<string name="43536">Tell you what: you hand over those funds and I won&apos;t start hacking off your fingers.</string>
<string name="43537">I&apos;m sorry, Neurik. I just lost my head for a moment. I didn&apos;t mean that. Forgive me.</string>
<string name="43538">You tell anyone and I guarantee you&apos;ll end up a corpse! Now give me the money!</string>
<string name="43539">Oh! Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s me, Neurik. Remember? I was serving in Tyr&apos;s church in Port Llast until Aarin Gend asked me to come and oversee this temple here at Beorunna&apos;s Well.</string>
<string name="43540">Oh... hello, again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Welcome back to the temple of the just god.</string>
<string name="43541">I don&apos;t know. This is a very delicate matter. Recently an Uthgardt tribesman named Rolgan killed one of the Lords&apos; Alliance soldiers. He claims it was self-defense, and I have given him sanctuary here to save him from the vengeance of the soldier&apos;s friends.</string>
<string name="43542">But Rolgan cannot stay in the Temple forever. I am trying to arrange a fair trial for the young man, but his Uthgardt friends are unfamiliar with our justice system... and none of the Lords&apos; Alliance mercenaries wants to defend him during the trial.</string>
<string name="43543">Yes... well, I don&apos;t want to be rude but you are a little, well, slow, aren&apos;t you? I don&apos;t think you would do a very good job and it would hardly be fair to the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="43544">I appreciate your offer, but with you on his side we might as well start sharpening the spike to stick Rolgan&apos;s head on right now. I&apos;ll find someone else. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="43545">Those who serve the cause of Justice will be well rewarded. If not by Tyr himself, then at least by the Just God&apos;s priests. If you present a proper defense, I will see you are compensated accordingly.</string>
<string name="43546">Your offer is a generous one. And, as Tyr&apos;s priest, I will ensure you are properly compensated according to the defense you present.</string>
<string name="43547">After careful consideration I have selected the jury. There will be two who represent the interests of the Uthgardt, two who represent the mercenaries, and my own acolyte Edegar. I felt this was the only way to be fair.</string>
<string name="43548">Go with Tyr&apos;s blessing.</string>
<string name="43549">The Temple of Tyr shall never refuse the pleas of supplicants in need. Feel his divine mercy and go with his blessing.</string>
<string name="43550">You are welcome to see what I have on hand.</string>
<string name="43551">If you agree to undertake this case, I can give you the details. Or is there something else you need.</string>
<string name="43552">Take this notebook. It contains information on the jurors and witnesses, as well as the details of the case and the trial itself. As an officer of Tyr, you must keep this notebook to record the progress of the case.</string>
<string name="43553">I can summarize the notebook for you. First, the jurors: a mercenary named Averik, a ranger named Dalcia, a soldier named Jevon, an Uthgardt wise-woman called Palla, and, of course, my own acolyte Edegar.</string>
<string name="43554">Feel free to speak to any of the jurors before the trial. It is a common practice to do so in these matters. The ranger and Palla can be found in the Uthgardt camp. The others are here in the buildings housing the Lords&apos; Alliance members.</string>
<string name="43555">The prosecutor has advised me that he will be calling two mercenaries who witnessed the event, Zed and Lodar. He also will question Vanda, the wife of the accused. I suggest you speak to these people before the trial to gather what evidence you can.</string>
<string name="43556">And of course there&apos;s the Uthgardt himself, Rolgan. He doesn&apos;t have to testify, but if you call him up to defend his actions, then the prosecutor will also be able to question him. He is here in the back of the Temple here, if you wish to speak with him.</string>
<string name="43557">Rolgan is counting on you to bring forth the truth at his trial. Once you have all the evidence, come speak to me and we can begin the proceedings.</string>
<string name="43558">Are you quite certain, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;? Once the trial begins it cannot be ended prematurely, or Rolgan&apos;s life will be forfeit.</string>
<string name="43559">The rules of these proceedings are simple. The jurors will listen to the evidence and testimony, and as the trial progresses they will use the swords and torches I have given them to indicate either guilt or innocence.</string>
<string name="43560">Whenever a juror feels the accused is guilty they will hold forth the sword in their right hand to symbolize the swift strike of justice. If they feel the accused is innocent they will hold up the torch to symbolize the burning light of truth shining down on this trial.</string>
<string name="43561">As the jurors&apos; views are swayed, so shall the implement they hold forth change. A juror who is still undecided will hold forth neither sword nor torch. Three jurors must be convinced of the accused&apos;s innocence for Rolgan to go free.</string>
<string name="43562">What we have now begun cannot end until Justice is served. If the trial is interrupted or broken off before its proper completion, the accused shall be found guilty, regardless of the status of the Jurors. Is this clear?</string>
<string name="43563">Now that we are all here the trial can begin. Remember, if you quit the trial before its rightful end, Rolgan&apos;s life is forfeit. </string>
<string name="43564">Excellent. I know all parties involved are anxious to settle this matter. I will send word to the prosecutor and everyone else involved. </string>
<string name="43565">Rolgan&apos;s trial has been postponed because of the death of one of the participants. However, Tyr&apos;s justice must still be served in this matter so I have advised everyone that the case will proceed... though it may be months before I am ready to resume the trial.</string>
<string name="43566">You can continue your investigations if you wish, but I doubt you will still be here when this matter is finally resolved. I can always find a new advocate for the defense when I am finally ready to resume this case. Your time would probably be better served helping Aarin Gend locate the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="43567">You were called upon to do your duty in administering the justice of Tyr&apos;s Court, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The church is grateful you answered the call.</string>
<string name="43568">However, you failed in your defense of Rolgan. His life is forfeit, and his head now sits upon a stake at the temple door. The justice of Tyr is indeed swift.</string>
<string name="43569">I am afraid this will increase tension between the Lords&apos; Alliance and the Uthgardt, though this is not your fault. Here is a nominal fee for your services. </string>
<string name="43570">You managed to achieve an acquital for Rolgan, though it would have been better if the verdict had been more conclusive. However, you performed your duties admirably.</string>
<string name="43571">Please accept this token as a reward for your service to the Church.</string>
<string name="43572">You performed your duties with grace and excellence. A 4 to 1 verdict in the trial is truly impressive and leaves little doubt as to Rolgan&apos;s true innocence.</string>
<string name="43573">Tyr&apos;s justice is swift, as is his rewarding of those in his service. Please accept this token on behalf of our temple as a reward for your service.</string>
<string name="43574">Your performance at the trial was truly amazing, &lt;FirstName&gt;. A unanimous verdict! Such an overwhelming result will do much to quell any rumblings among the Lords&apos; Alliance soldiers over the outcome of the trial.</string>
<string name="43575">For your exemplary service, you have earned the undying gratitude of this Temple of Tyr. Please accept this token as a sign of my own appreciation of the spectacular job you have done in the service of Tyr.</string>
<string name="43576">I guess I shouldn&apos;t be surprised. You&apos;ve had a lot on your mind, &lt;FirstName&gt;, what with the cult in Luskan and Aribeth&apos;s betrayal and everything else.</string>
<string name="43577">To be honest I almost didn&apos;t recognize you, the great hero of Neverwinter. I&apos;m struggling with a problem that&apos;s had me a little out of sorts lately.</string>
<string name="43578">I&apos;m surprised you remember me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, what with everything on your mind. The Luskan cult, Aribeth&apos;s betrayal... Why, that&apos;s enough to make someone forget their own name!</string>
<string name="43579">So, how can Tyr&apos;s Temple be of service to you today?</string>
<string name="43580">Forgive me if I seem somewhat... distracted. Rolgan&apos;s impending trial has me a little out of sorts.</string>
<string name="43581">Is there something else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="43582">It&apos;s me, Neurik. I was serving at Tyr&apos;s church in Port Llast until Aarin Gend asked me to come and establish a temple to the just god here at Beorunna&apos;s Well.</string>
<string name="43583">I had no idea when I came that I would end up getting a murder trial dumped into my lap.</string>
<string name="43584">Don&apos;t tell me you have forgotten, &lt;FirstName&gt;! You promised to defend Rolgan during his murder trial.</string>
<string name="43585">I realize you have a lot on your mind, but a man&apos;s life is at stake here. The information is all there in the trial notebook you carry with you.</string>
<string name="43586">Now, is there anything else you need?</string>
<string name="43587">This is no ordinary trial. In fact, this is a very delicate matter. It presents a... problem.</string>
<string name="43588">Forgive me if I seem... distracted. The outcome of Rolgan&apos;s trial has created as many problems as it seems to have solved.</string>
<string name="43589">I never expected I&apos;d end up presiding over a murder trial. Or that the outcome would create as many problems as it solved.</string>
<string name="43590">I am grateful for your assistance during Rolgan&apos;s trial, &lt;FirstName&gt;. This is not a problem you can readily fix.</string>
<string name="43591">&lt;CUSTOM3333&gt; agreed to serve as defense council in the murder trial of Rolgan, the Uthgardt warrior.</string>
<string name="43592">Even though Rolgan was acquitted there are still those among the Lords&apos; Alliance soldiers who feel he is guilty of murder and deserving of death.</string>
<string name="43593">Even though Rolgan was justly tried and convicted there are those among the Uthgardt who feel he was unfairly executed.</string>
<string name="43594">Tensions between the soldiers and the Uthgardt have only increased since the verdict was issued. I only hope things doesn&apos;t escalate further.</string>
<string name="43595">But there is little anyone can do about such things. Now, is there something else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="43596">Now, is there anything else I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="43597">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, I suppose it can be difficult serving Tyr&apos;s cause, particularly in light of all the recent events concerning Fenthick and now Aribeth.</string>
<string name="43598">Very well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have another 100 gold pieces I can spare you. Any more than that and I would have to give you funds marked for temple&apos;s poor box.</string>
<string name="43599">I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have any more coin to spare, &lt;FirstName&gt;, unless you would have me hand over the funds marked for the temple poor box!</string>
<string name="43600">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have any more coin to spare, &lt;FirstName&gt;, unless you would have me give you funds marked for the temple poor box!</string>
<string name="43601">You dare threaten a servant of Tyr in Tyr&apos;s own house? I should ban you from this temple and have the soldiers arrest you right now!</string>
<string name="43602">Very well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know these times are difficult; we are all under a great deal of strain. I suppose I can forgive you for one brief indiscretion.</string>
<string name="43603">Is there anything else I can do for you now, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="43604">Take it, then. I will tell no one of what happened here, but know that you are no longer welcome in this Temple, &lt;FirstName&gt;!</string>
<string name="43605">You are an evil wretch who does not deserve the services of Tyr! Get out of my sight!</string>
<string name="43606">I have not forgotten how you threatened me, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I have told no one, but you shall receive no services from me!</string>
<string name="43607">You are an evil &lt;man/woman&gt; and you are not welcome here! Get out of my sight!</string>
<string name="43608">Who are you?</string>
<string name="43609">Neurik sent me. I am representing Rolgan in the upcoming trial.</string>
<string name="43610">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="43611">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43612">Who you be?</string>
<string name="43613">Me wanna ask you questions.</string>
<string name="43614">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43615">What do you think of the case?</string>
<string name="43616">Sounds like you already think he&apos;s guilty.</string>
<string name="43617">Is there some way I can guarantee you will return a verdict of not guilty?</string>
<string name="43618">Why have you come to seek the council of this old woman?</string>
<string name="43619">Go with the blessing of the Black Lion tribe.</string>
<string name="43620">I am Palla of the Black Lion tribe. I offer the wisdom of age to the Uthgardt who seek it.</string>
<string name="43621">From your dull speech I sense you are in desperate need of guidance from one who is wiser than yourself.</string>
<string name="43622">Unfortunately, the council of elders is reserved for those of the Black Lion tribe. My wisdom is only in the Uthgardt way of life and you... are not Uthgardt. </string>
<string name="43623">I know nothing of your kind. I cannot give you guidance. Depart with the blessing of the Black Lion tribe. This alone I can give you.</string>
<string name="43624">The life of one of my people is in your hands. I will aid you as best I can, though there is little I can do. The ways of justice among the Lords&apos; Alliance are unknown to me.</string>
<string name="43625">I am very disappointed in Rolgan. Our tribe constantly struggles against the stereotype of the drunken savage, yet Rolgan allowed himself to fall under the influence of alcohol. This is the result.</string>
<string name="43626">That remains to be seen. Rolgan is a symbol of our people, I pray he is not guilty of what they claim. But my duty in this trial is clear: Neurik has explained the vow I have taken as juror.</string>
<string name="43627">If the evidence shows Rolgan let alcohol cloud his mind so that he killed that man without reason, I must return a verdict of guilty. This trial is not the way of our tribe, but I must follow Neurik&apos;s rules in this matter.</string>
<string name="43628">We Uthgardt cannot risk the wrath of the Lords&apos; Alliance by defying the High Priest of Tyr. I pray Rolgan is not a sacrifice for the good of the entire tribe, but if it must be it must be.</string>
<string name="43629">Trial? What trial?</string>
<string name="43630">Yes, I am to defend you. Tell me what happened.</string>
<string name="43631">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43632">Go on.</string>
<string name="43633">You should never wager something you cannot afford to lose.</string>
<string name="43634">Can you tell me anything else?</string>
<string name="43635">I will do my best.</string>
<string name="43636"></string>
<string name="43637">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43638">You are here because Neurik sent you? You are here because of the trial?</string>
<string name="43639">Go if you wish. I must stay here, though my heart aches to return to my tribe. When the trial is over, Uthgar willing, I will be allowed to return to my home.</string>
<string name="43640">I am called a murderer and now I await judgment. Neurik can explain it better. I am unfamiliar with the ways of justice among your kind.</string>
<string name="43641">Griff invited me to play a game of chance. Not wanting to spurn this gesture of friendship, I accepted his invitation and the drinks he readily offered me.</string>
<string name="43642">I began to feel strange, my mind was clouded by more than just ale. I gambled foolishly, and lost several personal heirlooms of great religious significance to my tribe. </string>
<string name="43643">I know this, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I was not in my right mind. Something strange had taken hold of my thoughts.</string>
<string name="43644">I returned to my tribe in shame. Vanda, my wife, told me to go back and speak to Griff, to humble myself and beg him to return our religious heirlooms in exchange for the promise of much gold later on.</string>
<string name="43645">But Griff attacked me before I could speak my offer. I killed him to save my own life. There was no other choice! I fled to this temple, barely escaping a mob of soldiers seeking my blood to avenge Griff.</string>
<string name="43646">Neurik gave me sanctuary but only if I vowed to submit to a trial to determine my fate.</string>
<string name="43647">We Uthgardt are different than you. Our ways and customs may seem strange. They call us savages and pagans and drunks and thieves. This is how the Lords&apos; Alliance sees us, and that is why I am called a murderer for defending myself.</string>
<string name="43648">We of the Black Lion Tribe are a noble people. I am no heathen savage, no vile killer. I pray to Uthgar that you can see this and help me.</string>
<string name="43649">It is good to taste the open air once more. Freedom is sweet upon my tongue. I thank Uthgar for the verdict that cleansed the word murderer from my name.</string>
<string name="43650">And I thank you, &lt;Lord/Lady&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt;. You are a true friend of the Uthgardt people, and the Black Lion Tribe speaks your name with reverence.</string>
<string name="43651">Who are you?</string>
<string name="43652">Who be you?</string>
<string name="43653">I&apos;d like to see your inventory.</string>
<string name="43654">Me need buy stuff.</string>
<string name="43655">I have Guzud&apos;s head.</string>
<string name="43656">Me got Guzud head.</string>
<string name="43657">I have Vaath&apos;s head.</string>
<string name="43658">Me got Vaath head.</string>
<string name="43659">I have the head of King Obould Many-Arrows.</string>
<string name="43660">Me got orc kingy head.</string>
<string name="43661">Maybe I could help with the supply lines.</string>
<string name="43662">Me help! Me go fix problem!</string>
<string name="43663">King Obould Many-Arrows? Who&apos;s that?</string>
<string name="43664">Obould Many-Arrows? Who that?</string>
<string name="43665">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="43666">Me want ask stuff.</string>
<string name="43667">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43668">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43669">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You know, it wasn&apos;t easy to track that bandit down. 500 gold seems a little low for all the trouble I went to.</string>
<string name="43670">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me work hard. Me want more gold!</string>
<string name="43671">500 gold? You better up your offer or it&apos;ll be your head on that pike out there!</string>
<string name="43672">More gold or me rip your guts out!</string>
<string name="43673">I&apos;m always interested in a chance to make some more gold!</string>
<string name="43674">I will gladly do whatever I can to aid the cause of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="43675">Me like gold! Me do job!</string>
<string name="43676">Me want help! Me do job!</string>
<string name="43677">Sorry, not interested.</string>
<string name="43678">Me no want &apos;nother job.</string>
<string name="43679">I&apos;ll be back to collect those bounties!</string>
<string name="43680">Me come back when me got bandit head.</string>
<string name="43681">Any idea where I could start looking for those bandits?</string>
<string name="43682">Tell where bandits be! Me go kill!</string>
<string name="43683">So what do you want me to do?</string>
<string name="43684">What you want me do?</string>
<string name="43685">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You know, it isn&apos;t easy getting rid of an Orc King. I put my life on the line for you.</string>
<string name="43686">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me do good. Orc King big tough. Me do real good.</string>
<string name="43687">No supplies? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="43688">No supplies? What you mean?</string>
<string name="43689">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. I work for Aarin Gend.</string>
<string name="43690">Me name be &lt;FullName&gt;. Me work for Aarin Gend.</string>
<string name="43691">My name is none of your business!</string>
<string name="43692">Me name not be you business!</string>
<string name="43693">I&apos;m sorry, we got off on the wrong foot. My name is &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="43694">Me sorry. We not start out good. Me name be &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="43695">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Any chance of getting an advance on this assignment?</string>
<string name="43696">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me help if you give me money up front for job.</string>
<string name="43697">I guess I shouldn&apos;t complain. Everyone has to do their part. But you didn&apos;t come to listen to me grumble. Do you need some supplies, or was there something else?</string>
<string name="43698">Normally I wouldn&apos;t complain, but this isn&apos;t exactly what I signed on for. We can&apos;t fight a war with no supplies!</string>
<string name="43699">It was bad enough when those bloody Orc bandits were cutting off our supply lines, but now that they&apos;re gone my job isn&apos;t getting any easier. </string>
<string name="43700">You&apos;re kidding, right? Everybody knows me! I&apos;m Rolkid of the Mighty Lance! I&apos;m probably the most famous gnome knight of Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="43701">Aarin Gend&apos;s put me in charge of training and equiping the troops battling the Luskan forces. Seems he&apos;s too busy searching for those Words of Power to bother with a little thing like a war!</string>
<string name="43702">Well, that&apos;s what I&apos;m here for: armor and weapons for sale at reasonable prices. Take a look and see if there&apos;s anything you like.</string>
<string name="43703">Good thing nobody said you have to be smart to swing a sword. Even a drooling idiot has the right to defend themselves, right?</string>
<string name="43704">Feel free to come on back if you ever need anything in the way of martial supplies. The more armed soldiers we get into the field, the better our chances of defeating those Luskan dogs!</string>
<string name="43705">Good luck to you, my thick-skulled friend. May your bony cranium keep that undernourished brain of yours well-protected in your next battle!</string>
<string name="43706">Truth is, I don&apos;t have time to play information clerk. I&apos;m too busy trying to run a war here. </string>
<string name="43707">Gods you&apos;re one gloriously stupid &lt;race&gt; &lt;lad/lass&gt;!! If I had another fifty like you to blindly follow my orders, we might actually win this war! Good wizard fodder is so hard to find.</string>
<string name="43708">Well, I guess Vaath won&apos;t be cutting off our supply lines anymore! I think I&apos;m going to mount his head on a stake right outside the barracks... it&apos;s good for morale and all.</string>
<string name="43709">So you brought me a present, did you? And it isn&apos;t even my birthday! My soldiers could use a little pick-me-up. I&apos;m going to mount Guzud&apos;s head on a stake right outside the barracks!</string>
<string name="43710">Here&apos;s the posted bounty for this blasted bandit&apos;s head: 500 gold pieces! Take it, I consider the money well spent. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="43711">Here&apos;s the bounty for that bandit: 500 gold pieces, just like I promised. It&apos;s going to be a relief knowing our supply lines are safe with Vaath and Guzud out of the way.</string>
<string name="43712">You seem to have a real knack for hunting down orcs. I&apos;ve got another job you might be interested in, one that pays pretty good. More than these other bounties, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
<string name="43713">Suit yourself but you&apos;re passing up a great opportunity. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="43714">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hey, I&apos;m sorry if you think you were underpaid. But the bounty was clearly posted at 500 gold pieces. I can&apos;t afford to start giving everyone extra coin just because they ask. I&apos;m trying to finance a war here! </string>
<string name="43715">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="43716">Hah, that&apos;s a good one! An entire army of soldiers in this camp and you start threatening the man who trained them! You may crack me up but I&apos;m still not going to give you anything extra. I&apos;m trying to finance a war here!</string>
<string name="43717">Let me put this in terms a dullard like you might understand... There be lots of fighting mans in camp. Me am their boss. You fight me, they all kill you. Understand? (sigh) Not too bright but I gotta admire your courage...</string>
<string name="43718">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You know, I really shouldn&apos;t do this. The bounty was clearly posted. But I like you. Here&apos;s another 100 gold. Just don&apos;t tell anyone: I can&apos;t afford to have all my soldiers suddenly demanding pay raises.</string>
<string name="43719">Hey, I&apos;ll welcome any help I can get. I&apos;ve already put out a bounty on the heads of the two most famous Orc bandits in the region: Vaath and Guzud.</string>
<string name="43720">I figure if they both get taken out, the rest of the thieving scum will get the message and back off. I&apos;m offering 500 gold pieces for each of them, payable upon delivery of their decapitated head. </string>
<string name="43721">Good luck. It won&apos;t be easy to find those bandit hideouts. Vaath and Guzud have both been in business for years and no one&apos;s tracked them down yet. Take this writ, though. It identifies you as a bounty hunter under my authority.</string>
<string name="43722">I love the eagerness of the simple-minded!</string>
<string name="43723">Other than that I couldn&apos;t say. Finding them&apos;s the hard part. Well, that and killing them.</string>
<string name="43724">You may be dumb, but you sure are eager. I wish more of those recruits I&apos;m training were like you! </string>
<string name="43725">King Obould Many-Arrows is probably the most powerful Orc Chieftain in the entire North. According to a couple of those spies Aarin Gend lent me Obould has arranged a parlay with the Luskan commanders.</string>
<string name="43726">Dealing with Orcish bandits is one thing, but Obould&apos;s tribe is a massive, highly efficient army. If he forms an alliance with Luskan, Neverwinter could be in real trouble.</string>
<string name="43727">Glad to hear it, because we&apos;ve got a real problem brewing here.</string>
<string name="43728">Whoa, settle down there, &lt;boy/girl&gt;! Don&apos;t get all excited and rush off before I tell you where you&apos;re going.</string>
<string name="43729">I want you to bring me Obould&apos;s head on a platter! That should trigger a brutal power struggle as Obould&apos;s generals try to take the place of their fallen king. It&apos;ll keep them orcs busy for a few years, and out of our hair.</string>
<string name="43730">Only problem is, no one knows where or when this meeting is supposed to happen. King Obould must be somewhere in the area, probably hiding out with his honor guard in some stink-ridden cave.</string>
<string name="43731">Find Obould&apos;s lair and kill him. Bring me his head and I&apos;ll give you 1000 gold pieces. Let&apos;s see those Luskan dogs try to form an alliance with him then!</string>
<string name="43732">Wow, Obould&apos;s even uglier than I imagined. The flies eating out his eyes probably don&apos;t help. No matter, I&apos;ve got a stake all sharpened up and waiting for this one.</string>
<string name="43733">For someone so stupid, you sure manage to get the job done!</string>
<string name="43734">Here&apos;s the 1000 gold pieces I promised. With Obould and his followers out of the picture, maybe we can actually start winning this war.</string>
<string name="43735">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Okay, I can take a hint. And I guess this was kind of a tough assignment. I&apos;d hate to think how the war effort would have gone if you hadn&apos;t come through for us.</string>
<string name="43736">I don&apos;t have any gold to spare, but I do have something. It&apos;s been in my family for generations, handed down from soldier to soldier. But I&apos;m retired and I don&apos;t have any children so it might as well be yours. You&apos;ve certainly proved yourself worthy.</string>
<string name="43737">I know it&apos;s not much, but I hope it serves you as well as it served me. Now, anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="43738">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; And I appreciate everything you&apos;ve done. But the 1000 gold is all I can spare. I&apos;ve got to finance a war here, you know, and that ain&apos;t cheap. These soldiers don&apos;t fight for free.</string>
<string name="43739">Maybe I underestimated you. You ain&apos;t so dumb after all. You obviously know how much killing Obould is worth to the war effort, at any rate. Well, I guess you&apos;ve earned a little bonus.</string>
<string name="43740">Hmmm... I don&apos;t recognize you, and I thought I knew all the new recruits who&apos;ve joined the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="43741">So, what can I interest you in? A good sword? A stout shield, perhaps? Or was there something else? </string>
<string name="43742">It&apos;s those blasted Orcish raiders. Every time we get a new supply line set up to the battle front, those damn bandits cut it off! </string>
<string name="43743">An army&apos;s no good if they don&apos;t have a steady stream of supplies replenishing their stores. I tell you, if this keeps up we might as well surrender to Luskan right now!</string>
<string name="43744">Rumor is King Obould Many-Arrows is forming an alliance with Luskan. If they combine forces we won&apos;t stand a chance, no matter how many soldiers and swords I send to the front lines.</string>
<string name="43745">My orders are to make sure everyone has the supplies they need, even a jerk like you...</string>
<string name="43746">&lt;FullName&gt;? The same &lt;FullName&gt; who saved Neverwinter from the plague? We could use a good &lt;man/woman&gt; like you up on the battle front.</string>
<string name="43747">It&apos;s too bad Gend has you working on something else. You must have come in here to purchase some equipment, right?</string>
<string name="43748">So that&apos;s the attitude you want to take, is it? Your name doesn&apos;t really matter to me anyway. I was just trying to be friendly...</string>
<string name="43749">Back again, &lt;FirstName&gt;? You need to buy some equipment, or is there something else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="43750">Well, if it isn&apos;t &lt;Mister/Missus&gt; Too Damn Stuck Up To Give Me &lt;His/Her&gt; Name! What do you need this time?</string>
<string name="43751">Well, I&apos;m not one to hold a grudge. Pleased to meet you, &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="43752">You could try looking in the Coldwood to the northeast; that place has always had its share of bandits. And there were some reports of bandits around Fort Ilkard to the south.</string>
<string name="43753">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Yeah, right. We can barely afford to finance this war as it is. I start shelling out for work that isn&apos;t even done and I won&apos;t be able to pay my soldiers their wages!</string>
<string name="43754">The bounty for each head is 500 gold pieces, plain and simple. If you don&apos;t like the offer, don&apos;t do the job.</string>
<string name="43755">Trial? What trial?</string>
<string name="43756">I am representing your husband in his trial.</string>
<string name="43757">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43758">A friend. I must ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="43759">Tell me what happened the night Griff was killed.</string>
<string name="43760">Gambling and alcohol are a dangerous combination.</string>
<string name="43761">Please go on.</string>
<string name="43762">Anything else?</string>
<string name="43763">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43764"></string>
<string name="43765">I am sorry, were you speaking to me? Forgive my distraction, I am worried about my husband&apos;s upcoming trial.</string>
<string name="43766">My husband Rolgan is accused of murdering one of the Lords&apos; Alliance soldiers. He faces execution if not saved. Forgive me, but this is difficult to talk about. </string>
<string name="43767">As you wish. Should you need to speak to me again I shall be here in the village, awaiting the trial summons from Neurik at the temple.</string>
<string name="43768">Representing my husband? I am sorry, but the ways of your justice system are unfamiliar to we people of the Black Lion Tribe. Are you a friend or foe?</string>
<string name="43769">The priest Neurik said I would have to answer the questions put to me with complete honesty... it was as if he *expected* me to lie! He knows nothing about the honor of our tribe. Ask away, I have nothing to hide.</string>
<string name="43770">My husband returned home late. He had been drinking, but there was something else. He seemed... different. As if more than alcohol were at work in his mind.</string>
<string name="43771">When he told me he had gambled away the heirlooms of our family, precious stones sanctified by the priests of Uthgar, I knew something was very wrong. He was not in his right mind, or he would never have wagered these sacred stones on a game of chance.</string>
<string name="43772">I know my husband, and he is no irresponsible drunkard! Something happened to him, something more sinister than mere alcohol! Of course I have no proof but I know it&apos;s true all the same.</string>
<string name="43773">I sent him to ask this man Griff to return the heirlooms. We offered to pay him gold in exchange. It would have been far more than he could ever sell the heirlooms for. Their religious significance to the Black Lion tribe far exceeds their material worth.</string>
<string name="43774">But the soldier attacked my husband, and Rolgan was forced to kill Griff to preserve his own life. He fled to the Temple seeking sanctuary, a mob of Griff&apos;s enraged friends close on his heels. </string>
<string name="43775">Please, help my husband. They are portraying him as a drunken, pagan savage. This is how they view all the Uthgardt. We are a noble people, but if Rolgan is convicted the hurtful stereotype will only get stronger.</string>
<string name="43776">I wish I could be of more help, but all I can do is pray Uthgar grants you wisdom in this matter.</string>
<string name="43777">My husband is dead, the sun in my sky has fallen and my spirit is swallowed by the dark night. I grieve and pray to Uthgar to lift up his soul, but in my mouth the words are hollow.</string>
<string name="43778">The servants of Tyr defiled his body, mounting him on a stake outside their temple in a perverse act they call justice. And they dare to call us savages? Leave me to my mourning... I only want to be left alone.</string>
<string name="43779">The justice of the Lord&apos;s Alliance is true justice. My husband&apos;s trial is over and he is no longer accused of his crime! We are together once more.</string>
<string name="43780">I am grateful to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, for you have have returned the sun to my sky. Forever you shall be counted as a friend of the Black Lion tribe of the Uthgardt people.</string>
<string name="43781">What is a druid doing up here on this plateau?</string>
<string name="43782">What you be doing here, tree man?</string>
<string name="43783">I&apos;d like to purchase some supplies.</string>
<string name="43784">Me need buy stuff.</string>
<string name="43785">Plight of the Uthgardt? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="43786">What wrong with Uthgardts?</string>
<string name="43787">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43788">Me go now, tree man.</string>
<string name="43789">Me tree-&lt;man/woman&gt; like you. Me want help with this!</string>
<string name="43790">As a servant of nature I am honored to investigate this matter for you, Yusam of the Grove!</string>
<string name="43791">I could help you with this... for a price.</string>
<string name="43792">Me could help you, if you pay me stuff.</string>
<string name="43793">Perhaps I could investigate this for you, Yusam.</string>
<string name="43794">Me could go look into this for you, Yusam.</string>
<string name="43795">The Elk tribe are no more. I have slain their Chieftain.</string>
<string name="43796">Commander Damas has infected the Elk tribe with the plague.</string>
<string name="43797">Zokan, leader of the Elk tribe, asked me to show this dreamcatcher to you.</string>
<string name="43798">Elk dead. Chief dead. Me kill.</string>
<string name="43799">Damas make Elk be sick. Elk got plague.</string>
<string name="43800">Elk boss man say show you this.</string>
<string name="43801">Thank you, Yusam. You are most generous.</string>
<string name="43802">Me like ring. Me happy.</string>
<string name="43803">That&apos;s it? A ring? Unless you want me to fertilize this grove with bloody chunks of your anatomy you better fork over something else!</string>
<string name="43804">Give more or me chop tree boy to bitty chunks! Hack! Hack! Hack!</string>
<string name="43805">You&apos;re a druid. Can&apos;t you make them stop?</string>
<string name="43806">Uthgardt listen to tree-man. You stop Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="43807">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. I work for Aarin Gend.</string>
<string name="43808">Me name be &lt;FullName&gt;. Me work for Aarin Gend.</string>
<string name="43809">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="43810">Me want ask you stuff.</string>
<string name="43811">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Any chance of getting an advance on this job? As a sign of good faith?</string>
<string name="43812">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe you give some gold up front, to show you trust me.</string>
<string name="43813">I&apos;ll be back when I learn more of the Elk tribe.</string>
<string name="43814">Me be back when me learn more of Elk tribe.</string>
<string name="43815">Who are you again?</string>
<string name="43816">Who you be again?</string>
<string name="43817">I&apos;ll go speak to Damas at once!</string>
<string name="43818">Me go speak at Damas right now!</string>
<string name="43819">I looked into this like you asked. This your problem now, Yusam.</string>
<string name="43820">Me look into this like you ask. This be your problem now.</string>
<string name="43821">Forget it.</string>
<string name="43822">Forget it.</string>
<string name="43823">Welcome, friend. I am Yusam, Druid of the North, liaison between the Lords&apos; Alliance and the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="43824">You are free to take solace in the tranquility of my grove, if you wish. Or is there some other reason you have sought me out?</string>
<string name="43825">You are welcome to see my stock, where you will find not only those treasures gathered from the glorious bounty of nature, but also those items oft-used by nature&apos;s servants.</string>
<string name="43826">Your speech is rough as the bark of the gnarlwood tree, yet I clearly take your meaning, friend.</string>
<string name="43827">This land and its people are under my protection and care. That is why the plight of the Uthgardt troubles me so. Their suffering is like a thorn in my heart.</string>
<string name="43828">Go, child, and may a gentle breeze carry you safely to your destination, like the summer winds that bring seeds to replenish the eternal forest.</string>
<string name="43829">Yes, my precious child, go and be brave. Though cruelly burdened with a heavy and dull wit, you must find your place in nature&apos;s order even as the frog finds its place in muck of the marshy swamp.</string>
<string name="43830">Look at you. You are so simple, yet still you feel compassion toward others. Truly you are proof that intelligence is not linked to kindness.</string>
<string name="43831">My child, this war takes a terrible toll on the Uthgardt. The armies of Luskan lay waste to their lands and the Black Lion tribe has lost many warriors battling alongside the Lords&apos; Alliance soldiers.</string>
<string name="43832">But it is for the Uthgardt Elk tribe that I worry most of all. They have aligned themselves with the Luskan destroyers to slaughter the defenseless settlers around Fort Ilkard in the south.</string>
<string name="43833">Once, the Elk tribe welcomed my counsel, but they have since turned their back on the way of nature. The emissaries I have sent to investigate have all been ruthlessly slain. </string>
<string name="43834">As a fellow servant of the forest and a true child of nature you can no doubt understand my distress.</string>
<string name="43835">You are not a child of nature, so perhaps you cannot understand the pain I feel over what has happened with the Elk tribe.</string>
<string name="43836">Welcome, my child. Do you bring me news of the Uthgardt Elk tribe? Or is there some other purpose to your visit?</string>
<string name="43837">I pray this conflict will end soon or I fear the cost on the Uthgardt people will be too great for them to bear.</string>
<string name="43838">In the natural cycle good deeds bring good deeds in return. Should you find a way to bring the Elk tribe back into the fold you will be showered with an abundant bounty of rewards.</string>
<string name="43839">(Sigh) Even one as simple as you has learned greed, I see. Perhaps it is in the base nature of all beings.</string>
<string name="43840">Such a task would be dangerous, my child. The Elk tribe have slain all who have tried to parlay with them. But if you could discover why the Elk tribe have turned their back on us I would be most grateful.</string>
<string name="43841">Commander Damas is well known for his cruelty, but I did not suspect even he of such a vile act! Alas, there is little I can do as I have none of the plague cure with me.</string>
<string name="43842">But Damas is no fool. If he were to infect the Elk tribe, he would want to have the cure handy in case his own people contracted the plague.</string>
<string name="43843">Alas, it is as I feared. Zokan was not to be reasoned with, his tribe had fallen in with the evil of Luskan forces. I thank you for this news, though it brings me great pain to hear.</string>
<string name="43844">You have done as I asked, my child, and investigated this matter for me. As such, you have earned your reward.</string>
<string name="43845">I do not have much to give, but please accept this ring for your efforts.</string>
<string name="43846">I recognize this Elk tribe token. It is a symbol of truce and contrition. It must mean that Zokan is apologizing for what his tribe has done. I will send my emissaries at once to reestablish relations with the Elk people.</string>
<string name="43847">I do not have much to give, but please accept this ring for your efforts.</string>
<string name="43848">I do not have much to give, but please accept this ring for your efforts.</string>
<string name="43849">Is there anything else I might do for you, child?</string>
<string name="43850">Please, my child, there is no need for violence! Take these 300 gold pieces. It is all I can give you. I am but a humble servant of nature who has little worth killing for.</string>
<string name="43851">Take the coins, I have no use for them. I hope the next time you come to the grove, my child, you will not let your lust for gold make you act as you have today.</string>
<string name="43852">It always pleases me when a fellow child of nature chooses to partake of the beauty of my grove.</string>
<string name="43853">When the Lords&apos; Alliance set up camp here Aarin told me he was recruiting agents to search for lost artifacts of ancient magic.</string>
<string name="43854">I wish you success in your quest, though as I told Aarin I am more concerned with the plight of the Uthgardt people.</string>
<string name="43855">I see you are of simple mind, my child. Never fear, those not blessed with great intelligence are still precious in nature&apos;s eyes.</string>
<string name="43856">I know the ways of the living forest and the mysteries of the turning of the season, but as to worldy affairs I admit my knowledge is quite limited.</string>
<string name="43857">I try not to let such affairs intrude upon the tranquility of my grove. I would ask that you also leave your problems behind when you come here, my child.</string>
<string name="43858">This place is a refuge from the outside world. The Uthgardt come so they might escape the plight of their people. They do not need you to remind them of such things.</string>
<string name="43859">The Elk tribe have fortified themselves inside their keep to the west of Fort Ilkard, although they continue to make raids on the fort. Perhaps if you go there you can find them and speak to Zokan Thunderer, their chief.</string>
<string name="43860">Your offer is generous, child. I cannot leave this grove, and there is nowhere else I may turn for aid. I fear, however, that you do not truly understand what you are about to undertake.</string>
<string name="43861">Well met once again, my child. Have you come to enjoy the peace and solitude of my grove?</string>
<string name="43862">Or is there some other purpose for which you have come to seek me out once more?</string>
<string name="43863">I am Yusam, Druid of the North. I am the liaison between the Lords&apos; Alliance and the Uthgardt tribes.</string>
<string name="43864">I suppose one of simple mind cannot be expected to remember every person they meet.</string>
<string name="43865">Welcome, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will always be grateful to you for your aid in the difficult matter of the Elk.</string>
<string name="43866">Have you come here seeking a tranquil refuge from the outside world? Or is there perhaps some other reason for your visit?</string>
<string name="43867">Perhaps you could speak to Damas and convince him give you the cure. I fear there is no other way to save the Elk tribe.</string>
<string name="43868">May the blessings of my sacred grove be with you on this mission.</string>
<string name="43869">You offered your aid in this matter, my child, and the job is but half done. A seed can be planted, but that alone will not cause the tree to take root and grow.</string>
<string name="43870">There is no one else I may turn to in this matter, my child. If you can help the Elk tribe I promise your reward will be worth your efforts.</string>
<string name="43871">I cannot force you to aid me in this matter, my child, though I hope in time the flower of charity will bloom in your heart and change your mind.</string>
<string name="43872">In the meantime is there anything else I can do for you, child?</string>
<string name="43873">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose it would not be unseemly for me to grant you some form of payment as a show of faith.</string>
<string name="43874">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The cycle of nature teaches us everything must follow in its own time. It would be unnatural of me to pay you for a task not yet completed.</string>
<string name="43875">Rest assured you will receive your reward when the proper time has come and the task is finished. Will you help me with this task, my child?</string>
<string name="43876">I cannot force you to do this task, my child. I only pray that the charity blossoms in your heart and you change your mind.</string>
<string name="43877">In the meantime is there anything else I can do for you, my child?</string>
<string name="43878">Here, my child. Take these 100 gold pieces and the blessings of my grove. I pray your mission is a success.</string>
<string name="43879">And as I have already told you, the Elk tribe has aligned itself with the Luskan forces for reasons I cannot fathom.</string>
<string name="43880">I thank you for your aid in the difficult matter of the Elk tribe, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I fear you cannot save all the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="43881">Trial? What trial?</string>
<string name="43882">I&apos;m the defense counsel for Rolgan.</string>
<string name="43883">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="43884">Do you know why they were fighting?</string>
<string name="43885">What happened to your leg?</string>
<string name="43886">Anything else you can tell me?</string>
<string name="43887">You don&apos;t seem very impartial.</string>
<string name="43888">I get the feeling you&apos;re holding back on me.</string>
<string name="43889">What&apos;s wrong with your leg?</string>
<string name="43890">If I find out you&apos;re holding anything back, the pain won&apos;t only be in your leg!</string>
<string name="43891">I&apos;ve got a few healing spells of my own. Maybe I can help.</string>
<string name="43892">I think you know something about Griff&apos;s death you aren&apos;t telling me.</string>
<string name="43893">Here you go, good as new. &lt;StartCheck&gt;[Use Minor Healing Spell]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="43894">I changed my mind. I think I&apos;ll let you suffer.</string>
<string name="43895">Why you leg got ouchie?</string>
<string name="43896">Me go now.</string>
<string name="43897">This better be important as I don&apos;t feel like chatting. It&apos;s bad enough my leg is killing me, but now I gotta be a witness at this murder trial too!</string>
<string name="43898">Huh, so you&apos;re the sucker Neurik roped into defending that savage? Tough break. I hear the case is open and shut.</string>
<string name="43899">I saw that Uthgardt stab Griff with my own two eyes. Ran him right through. Griff was dead before he even hit the ground.</string>
<string name="43900">I&apos;m just a witness in the case. Go talk to Neurik at the Temple of Tyr if you want the details.</string>
<string name="43901">Gambling debt. Griff had won a bunch of money off that Uthgardt and I guess the savage didn&apos;t like it. He&apos;d been drinking, so I guess it&apos;s no surprise he lost his temper.</string>
<string name="43902">Go find someone else to bother. Leave me alone.</string>
<string name="43903">My leg is none of your business!</string>
<string name="43904">Hey, all I know is what I saw. Griff is dead, and that Uthgardt killed him. I&apos;m as sure of that as I am of this pain eating away at my leg!</string>
<string name="43905">Arthritis in my knee. There&apos;s nothing anyone can do about that. But that ain&apos;t the problem right now. Some damn fool stuck me in the thigh with a knife during a bar fight and the wound&apos;s infected. Feels like a hot spear shooting up through my whole leg with every step I take.</string>
<string name="43906">And I can&apos;t even go to the temple to get it looked at, or they&apos;ll know I was in a fight. My unit commander&apos;s already warned me about brawling, and I don&apos;t need to get stuck on latrine duty again.</string>
<string name="43907">Blah, blah, blah. Blowhards who toss threats around don&apos;t scare me.</string>
<string name="43908">You want to heal my leg? What&apos;s in it for you?</string>
<string name="43909">You think I&apos;m going to betray the memory of my friend just because of a little pain in my - OW! Damn! I barely bumped it that time and its burning like the fires of the Nine Hells! </string>
<string name="43910">Okay, you got a deal. Heal my leg and I&apos;ll tell you something about Griff. Something you can use at the trial.</string>
<string name="43911">You miserable little bastard! Well I hope you lose your damn case!</string>
<string name="43912">Huh, I still got the arthritis in my knee, but I can cope with that. It was that bloody infection I couldn&apos;t handle. Okay, I guess you delivered on your end of the deal, so here&apos;s what I know...</string>
<string name="43913">First, Griff spiked that Uthgardt&apos;s drink. Griff was always doing stuff like that to try and get an edge at cards. Could be the stuff in the drink made that Uthgardt act like he did.</string>
<string name="43914">I also happen to know for a fact that Griff was cheating that night. He wanted to take everything that Uthgardt owned. He told me he wanted to rob that savage blind. </string>
<string name="43915">That&apos;s all I know. If it&apos;s enough to get your client off, so be it. At least now I can walk without clenching my teeth in agony. It seems like a fair trade to me...</string>
<string name="43916">Hey, thanks for curing that wound in my leg. I still got the occasional ache from my arthritis, but I can handle that.</string>
<string name="43917">I already spilled my guts about the case to you. Talk to Lodar if you want to learn anything else. He&apos;s the other witness. Probably getting drunk at the tavern if I know him.</string>
<string name="43918">Tough break on that trial, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know it&apos;s a little late now, but I can&apos;t help wondering if Griff didn&apos;t have it coming to him. Guess we&apos;ll never know, since Rolgan&apos;s collecting flies on a post out by the church.</string>
<string name="43919">You just managed to squeak that trial out, didn&apos;t you? A lot of the Lords&apos; Alliance soldiers are complaining about the verdict, and I gotta say I agree with them. A 3 to 2 verdict isn&apos;t what you&apos;d call a ringing endorsement of your client&apos;s innocence.</string>
<string name="43920">I heard that Uthgardt was acquitted. Pretty impressive 4 to 1 verdict. If I ever kill someone over money, you&apos;ll be the first &lt;man/woman&gt; I turn to.</string>
<string name="43921">Wow, &lt;FirstName&gt;, a unanimous verdict. Hell, you even had me half-convinced that Uthgardt was innocent.</string>
<string name="43922">Testifying at the trial of that Uthgardt took a lot out of me. I don&apos;t want to talk to anyone right now, especially you!</string>

<string name="44002">Welcome, noble &lt;sir/madam&gt;, to Barun&apos;s Smithy. I, of course, am Barun, master dwarven smith and creator of fine magical items. How may I be of service to you today?</string>
<string name="44003">Okay, I see there&apos;s some stuff on my anvil. Let me take a look and see what I can construct for you.</string>
<string name="44004">Nope, this won&apos;t do. Listen closely: there can only be two items on the forge. One must be the component item and the other must be a specific magical weapon or suit of magic armor that goes with it. </string>
<string name="44005">Let&apos;s see... you have a diamond and a suit of magical armor. I could build you the Chromatic Breastplate. It&apos;s a fine suit of armor if I do say so myself. </string>
<string name="44006">But this job isn&apos;t cheap. It will cost &lt;CUSTOM777&gt; gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.</string>
<string name="44007">Always a pleasure doing business with a fine &lt;man/woman&gt; such as yourself. Stand back, you don&apos;t want to catch a hammer in the head.</string>
<string name="44008">What is that? Some special holy water? Powerful stuff. I could combine it with your suit of magical armor and make the Scales of Truth for you. </string>
<string name="44009">If you want I can look through your inventory and backpack to see if you have anything I can combine into a powerful weapon or suit of armor. Is there anything in particular you want me to look for?</string>
<string name="44010">So, axes and armor is it? Let me just take a look at what you&apos;ve got in that pack of yours and I&apos;ll give you a list of what I can make from your inventory.</string>
<string name="44011">Of course. Not everybody&apos;s into axes, swords and maces now, are they? Let me give you a list of the exotic weapons I can make with the items in your pack.</string>
<string name="44012">Hmmm... I could combine that gargoyle skull and your magical armor into a top of the line suit of Whitebone Armor. </string>
<string name="44013">That adamantite could be worked into your magic battleaxe to make the Sentinel. Fine weapon. Mighty fine weapon, indeed...</string>
<string name="44014">Ironwood. You know, I could combine the ironwood with that magic club of yours and make you the Gladiator&apos;s Club.</string>
<string name="44015">Clubs, maces and hammers for you, eh? I&apos;ll just take a look at your stuff and see what we&apos;ve got to work with, then I&apos;ll give you a list of the items I can make for you.</string>
<string name="44016">There you go, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Quick as you please and the job is done. You can pick the item up from my forge.</string>
<string name="44017">Fair enough but this isn&apos;t a charity I&apos;m running. If you don&apos;t have the gold, you don&apos;t get the item. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44018">Fair enough. A customer always has the right to change &lt;his/her&gt; mind. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44019">Okay, I know you aren&apos;t too bright so I&apos;ll speak nice and slow. It will cost &lt;CUSTOM777&gt; gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course. Do you understand?</string>
<string name="44020">Just place one component item and one magical weapon or one suit of magic armor on the forge and I&apos;ll help you out. But if the forge be empty, like it is right now, I can&apos;t really do my thing, can I?</string>
<string name="44021">Interesting. Ironwood would graft quite nicely to that magical mace to make a solid Ironwood Mace.</string>
<string name="44022">Hmmm... I could bond the adamantite to that magic double axe and make you the Double Axe of the Tall Kin.</string>
<string name="44023">This will work. I can combine your adamantite with your magic great axe to make the Stonefire Great Axe.</string>
<string name="44024">Ah... there&apos;s real potential here. Your adamantite and your magic greatsword will make the Harbinger Kin Greatsword.</string>
<string name="44025">Huh. Dragon blood. Not going to ask where you got that, but I can use it to turn that magic halberd into a Ravager Halberd.</string>
<string name="44026">Dragon blood is powerful stuff. If I remember right I could combine it with that magic hand axe and make the Ice Reaver Hand Axe.</string>
<string name="44027">That dragon blood will go nicely with your magic heavy flail to make a Reaver Heavy Flail.</string>
<string name="44028">Okay, here&apos;s something. I can use your adamantite and your magic katana to make the Sword Saint Katana.</string>
<string name="44029">This is interesting. By adding your diamond to your magic longsword I can make the Astral Blade Longsword.</string>
<string name="44030">You know, that diamond could be added to your magic light hammer to make the Storm Light Hammer.</string>
<string name="44031">I could work that ironwood into your magic light flail to make a Foundation Light Flail.</string>
<string name="44032">Aha, jackpot! I can use your special holy water and your magic mace to create a Mace of Disruption!</string>
<string name="44033">Look at all that fairy dust! I could combine it with your magic morning star to construct the Drone Morning Star, if you&apos;d like.</string>
<string name="44034">I could use that dragon blood and your magic rapier to make the Namarra Rapier.</string>
<string name="44035">I could forge that adamantite with that magic scimitar and make you a Desert Wind Scimitar.</string>
<string name="44036">If I remember right, the adamantite can be added to your magic scythe to make the Sea Reaver Scythe.</string>
<string name="44037">You know, I could use that fairy dust and your magic short sword to make you a Feyduster Short Sword.</string>
<string name="44038">Hmmm... that fairy dust will work into your magic spear. I could make a Fey Spear, if you want.</string>
<string name="44039">Hey, look at this! I can use this special holy water and your magic sickle to make a Golden Sickle.</string>
<string name="44040">I bet if I take that ironwood and that two-bladed sword I can create one of those Uthgardt Ceremonial Two-Bladed Swords.</string>
<string name="44041">Okay, I can take your adamantite and your magic war hammer make you a Rune Hammer.</string>
<string name="44042">I&apos;m a weapon and armor smith, of sorts. I take component items and combine them with magic items to make objects of even greater majesty and power. Not a bad little gig, if you can get it.</string>
<string name="44043">Nothing beats a good old sword, does it? Tried and true. Okay, let me peek inside your backpack and I&apos;ll give you a list of the wondrous blades I can make from the stuff in your inventory.</string>
<string name="44044">Here you go, just take this book I have here. It will explain everything you can make and the components required to do so.</string>
<string name="44045">Hey, I&apos;m not trying to pressure you. I&apos;ve got enough business as it is. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44046">Good day to you then, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="44047">I&apos;m afraid there isn&apos;t much I could tell you. I just recently arrived here from the south and the Lords&apos; Alliance soldiers have kept me so busy making them weapons and armor I haven&apos;t even unpacked.</string>
<string name="44048">I heard Husher was opening up a shop here, and with the war against Luskan I figured there would be plenty of business for a guy like me. So I came with him.</string>
<string name="44049">If you&apos;re curious about Husher Clay, go ask him yourself. He&apos;s right over there on the other side of the room. Anything else?</string>
<string name="44050">You&apos;ll have to remove any extraneous items from my forge and put the proper component item and an appropriate magic item in place. I can&apos;t be working with shoddy materials or in a cluttered forge, now can I? In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44051">If an item isn&apos;t on the list, you don&apos;t have the stuff I need to make it. Just pick something you&apos;re interested in having me make.</string>
<string name="44052">Hmmm... you don&apos;t seem to have the stuff I need to make a special axe or special armor. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44053">Excellent choice. When you&apos;re ready, just place the component and appropriate magic item on the forge then come speak to me again.</string>
<string name="44054">Just say you want me to create an item for you, and if everything is in the forge as it should be, we can do business.</string>
<string name="44055">If an item isn&apos;t on the list, you don&apos;t have the stuff I need to make it. Just pick something you&apos;re interested in having me make.</string>
<string name="44056">Hmmm... you don&apos;t seem to have the stuff I need to make a special blunt or crushing weapon. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44057">Hmmm... you don&apos;t seem to have the items I need to make a special sword of any type. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44058">If an item isn&apos;t on the list, you don&apos;t have the stuff I need to make it. Just pick something you&apos;re interested in having me make.</string>
<string name="44059">Hmmm... you don&apos;t seem to have the items I need to make a special rare or exotic weapon. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44060">If an item isn&apos;t on the list, you don&apos;t have the stuff I need to make it. Just pick something you&apos;re interested in having me make.</string>
<string name="44061">Who are you?</string>
<string name="44062">Who you be?</string>
<string name="44063">I wish to purchase some magic supplies.</string>
<string name="44064">Me want buy magic.</string>
<string name="44065">Why is there a branch of the Many-Starred Cloak guild out here?</string>
<string name="44066">Why guild be out here?</string>
<string name="44067">I would like to use your laboratory.</string>
<string name="44068">Me want use lab.</string>
<string name="44069">How do you know my name?</string>
<string name="44070">Me no say name. How you know me?</string>
<string name="44071">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="44072">Me go now.</string>
<string name="44073">Nevermind, I&apos;ll come back later.</string>
<string name="44074">I&apos;d like to go in.</string>
<string name="44075">I will pay the 2000 gold piece fee.</string>
<string name="44076">I will come back later.</string>
<string name="44077">Me go in.</string>
<string name="44078">Me leave. Come back later.</string>
<string name="44079">Me make magic thingy. Here 2000 gold. Me go in.</string>
<string name="44080">Welcome, &lt;FirstName&gt;, to this rather temporary branch of the guild of the Many-Starred Cloak. Normally the arcane knowledge of our guild is restricted to members, but Aarin Gend has asked me to forego that formality under these circumstances.</string>
<string name="44081">Is there some particular item of strange and wondrous magical properties that you seek? Or perhaps you have come to make use of the little laboratory I have set up in the back?</string>
<string name="44082">Welcome, &lt;FirstName&gt;, to this rather temporary branch of the guild of the Many-Starred Cloak. Rest assured that even here your membership cloak will grant you all the privileges you have come to expect from our guild.</string>
<string name="44083">Greetings, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Normally I don&apos;t deal with those who have no experience in the arcane arts, but Aarin Gend has asked me to make my inventory available to everyone if it will help the war effort.</string>
<string name="44084">I still don&apos;t think I want to give you access to my lab in the back - that&apos;s reserved for those who have some experience in magic. But I will open my inventory to you, though most of the items are more suited to mages and their ilk.</string>
<string name="44085">As you wish. Fare thee well, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps our paths will cross again.</string>
<string name="44086">Strange, I thought you would know me. Alas, I see my reputation is not as far-reaching as I had assumed. I am Eltoora Sarptyl, a mage within Neverwinter&apos;s guild of the Many-Starred Cloak. </string>
<string name="44087">Odd. I had assumed even one of your limited intelligence would know me by reputation at least. I am Eltoora Sarptyl, a mage within Neverwinter&apos;s guild of the Many-Starred Cloak.</string>
<string name="44088">Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I am a Mistress of the Arcane. Such information is easily divined by one with my power. Now, how may I help you?</string>
<string name="44089">You truly are simple, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Divining your name is an easy task for one as practiced in the arcane as I. Now, what else can I do for you?</string>
<string name="44090">Do not let the stereotype of the solitary wizard in the tower color your perception of all who employ magic in their livelihood. Neverwinter is in trouble, and the guild offered to help in any way possible.</string>
<string name="44091">Aarin Gend requested our presence here so that we could aid both the war effort and those adventurers seeking the mysterious Words of Power. The guild is glad to offer its resources to those seeking to save our fair city.</string>
<string name="44092">Of course, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You will find everything a spellcaster could wish for.</string>
<string name="44093">Of course, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though I am afraid you will find most of my inventory better suited to those who practice the arcane arts.</string>
<string name="44094">Your membership cloak gives you unlimited access, &lt;FirstName&gt;, though unless you have a tome of item creation I doubt there is much you can accomplish in my laboratory.</string>
<string name="44095">Of course! It is your right as a member of the guild. The door is protected by a powerful ward but you may enter the lab through the White Portal.</string>
<string name="44096">There is a fee to use the laboratory. After all, the guild must replace any supplies you use and magical components are not cheap. The cost is 2000 gold pieces to gain entrance.</string>
<string name="44097">In all fairness, I should also inform you that the lab will be of little use unless you happen to have a tome in your possession describing how to create a magical item. I would hate to see you waste your money.</string>
<string name="44098">As you wish. The door is warded with special protective magic. You can now step into the white portal to enter the lab.</string>
<string name="44099">As I explained earlier the lab is only available to those who practice the arcane arts. Only mages, bards and sorcerers are permitted access. Go on now and bother somebody else.</string>
<string name="44100">How someone as intellectually stunted as you ever learned to cast even the simplest of spells is quite beyond me. Yet somehow you have managed, so I suppose I should let you into the lab. Please be careful and don&apos;t do anything... well... stupid.</string>
<string name="44101">What kinds of things do you sell?</string>
<string name="44102">What type stuff you sell?</string>
<string name="44103">I&apos;d like to take a look at your inventory.</string>
<string name="44104">Me want buy stuff.</string>
<string name="44105">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="44106">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="44107">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="44108">Me go now.</string>
<string name="44109">What do you mean, the newest branch?</string>
<string name="44110">What you mean, new branch?</string>
<string name="44111">I&apos;m searching for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="44112">Me looking for Power Words.</string>
<string name="44113">What do you mean by that?</string>
<string name="44114">What you mean?</string>
<string name="44115">Maybe I could help you.</string>
<string name="44116">Maybe me could help you.</string>
<string name="44117">What&apos;s the job?</string>
<string name="44118">What&apos;s it pay?</string>
<string name="44119">What job be?</string>
<string name="44120">What job pay?</string>
<string name="44121">I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="44122">Me not interested.</string>
<string name="44123">Why do you want it?</string>
<string name="44124">Why you want it?</string>
<string name="44125">And you think the Star Sapphire is still in her tomb?</string>
<string name="44126">You think Star Sapphire still be in her tomb?</string>
<string name="44127">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; This sounds dangerous. Dead mages often become liches.</string>
<string name="44128">I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d feel right plundering her final resting place.</string>
<string name="44129">Me not feel right robbing dead girl&apos;s grave.</string>
<string name="44130">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ll need some money up front for this job. Expenses, you know.</string>
<string name="44131">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me gonna need money up front. For buy stuff and other costs.</string>
<string name="44132">Okay, I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="44133">Okay, me do it.</string>
<string name="44134">Okay.</string>
<string name="44135">Tell me about the Star Sapphire again.</string>
<string name="44136">You tell me &apos;bout Star Sapphire again, kay?</string>
<string name="44137">I&apos;m interested in that job you mentioned earlier.</string>
<string name="44138">Me want know more &apos;bout that job you mention earlier.</string>
<string name="44139">I want to ask about the job you mentioned earlier.</string>
<string name="44140">Me want ask &apos;bout job you mentioned earlier.</string>
<string name="44141">I have the Star Sapphire right here.</string>
<string name="44142">Me got Star Sapphire here.</string>
<string name="44143">Thank you, Husher.</string>
<string name="44144">Me thank you, Husher.</string>
<string name="44145">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I went through a lot of trouble to get this gem for you, Husher. A *lot* of trouble.</string>
<string name="44146">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This be hard work for get gem. Me think maybe you give more gold.</string>
<string name="44147">Dig a little deeper, Clay, or I&apos;ll rip out your guts and strangle you with your own intestines!</string>
<string name="44148">You give more gold or me rip off your head and drink brain from skull.</string>
<string name="44149">Okay.</string>
<string name="44150">Greetings, friend! Husher Clay at your service. Care to check out the wares here at this, the newest branch of my adventuring gear shops?</string>
<string name="44151">Good day to you then. Come back any time as this little shop is open night and day. And don&apos;t forget about my dwarven friend there in the corner.</string>
<string name="44152">Don&apos;t know if there&apos;s much I can tell you as I&apos;m kind of new here myself. Just came up from the southern Sword Coast to oversee the opening of the newest branch of my operations.</string>
<string name="44153">A little of this, a little of that. Items magic and mundane. Anything an adventurer might need.</string>
<string name="44154">But if my wares don&apos;t interest you, talk to my dwarven friend over there in the corner. He&apos;s quite the accomplished smith. When it comes to arms and armor, if I don&apos;t sell it there&apos;s a good chance he can make it.</string>
<string name="44155">Well, I used to run a little place way down south. Business was good, but the big money is in franchising. So I left my son in charge of my store and headed north to expand my merchant empire.</string>
<string name="44156">When I came across all these rich adventurers gathered here in Beorunna&apos;s Well, I figured this was the perfect place to set up my new shop, at least until I get a license to sell in Neverwinter. </string>
<string name="44157">By all means! I never turn a customer away.</string>
<string name="44158">Hmmm... you&apos;re a might bit slow, aren&apos;t you? Well, don&apos;t worry, I run an honest business. I&apos;d never take advantage of someone in your condition.</string>
<string name="44159">He&apos;s quite the accomplished smith. When it comes to arms and armor, if I don&apos;t stock it he can probably build it.</string>
<string name="44160">Ah, I&apos;m afraid that&apos;s something I don&apos;t actually have in stock. Ha-ha! But seriously, I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t know anything about that.</string>
<string name="44161">Hello again. Any luck in locating the Star Sapphire? Or did you come just to check out my wares? Nobody has more in stock than Husher Clay, I&apos;m fond of saying.</string>
<string name="44162">You might want to speak with Lillian Cambridge, that archeological expert Aarin Gend brought in. She spends most of her time at the tavern, from what I&apos;ve gathered.</string>
<string name="44163">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44164">Maybe you&apos;ll find her more helpful than I did.</string>
<string name="44165">When I heard there was an archeologist nearby I went to speak with her about a certain item I&apos;ve been trying to track down.</string>
<string name="44166">But she wasn&apos;t really interested. Said she only wanted items of historical significance and that she didn&apos;t have time to chase after trinkets.</string>
<string name="44167">I even offered her a generous reward, but she seemed more interested in the wine bottle on the table than my story.</string>
<string name="44168">Maybe you could at that. You seem like a capable &lt;man/woman&gt;. Tell you what, you help me out and I&apos;ll give you the payment I was offering Lillian.</string>
<string name="44169">Fair enough. If you change your mind let me know. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44170">I&apos;ll give you 3000 gold pieces, the same as I offered Lillian.</string>
<string name="44171">In addition to my retail business, I&apos;m also a collector of rare gems. Right now there&apos;s one particular gem I&apos;m interested in: the Star Sapphire.</string>
<string name="44172">The Star Sapphire is valuable, that I&apos;ll warrant you; but you&apos;ll never get more than 1000 gold from any other dealer. But it&apos;s interesting to me as a collector, so I&apos;m offering more: I&apos;ll give you 3000 gold if you bring it back to me.</string>
<string name="44173">The Star Sapphire was part of a dowry given to Layenne Cheroux, the youngest daughter of a powerful merchant family that flourished in Waterdeep nearly two centuries ago.</string>
<string name="44174">But Layenne wasn&apos;t ready to resign herself to a life of wedlock. She was an aspiring mage, and the morning of her wedding she fled to the north to seek her fame and fortune.</string>
<string name="44175">According to the reports, Layenne became quite an accomplished wizard. She was powerful enough to foresee her own death and construct an elaborate, trap-filled tomb to inter her remains.</string>
<string name="44176">By all accounts the Star Sapphire was one of her most treasured possessions. It reminded her of the life she had left behind in Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="44177">The Star Sapphire would make a nice addition to my collection. Bring it to me and I&apos;ll give you 3000 gold pieces, the same price I offered Lillian. It&apos;s far more than the sapphire is worth to a more typical buyer.</string>
<string name="44178">Excellent. Nobody knows for certain where Layenne was buried, but it&apos;s rumored to be somewhere in the Coldwood.</string>
<string name="44179">I don&apos;t think you have to worry about that. From everything I know about Layenne Cheroux, she was never interested in lichdom.</string>
<string name="44180">But she was rumored to have quite the analytical, mechanical mind. I imagine her tomb is filled with all manner of devious traps.</string>
<string name="44181">You can&apos;t be serious. Looting crypts is a time-honored tradition among you adventurers! Finders keepers is the rule of thumb, right?</string>
<string name="44182">The way I see it, if you vanquish the guardians or bypass the traps you&apos;ve earned your right to the treasures.</string>
<string name="44183">But I don&apos;t want to force you into doing something against your principles. If you won&apos;t go after Layenne&apos;s tomb I&apos;m sure some other adventurer will.</string>
<string name="44184">If anyone&apos;s ever found the exact location of her tomb, they never came back alive to report it. But don&apos;t let that scare you off. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s nothing you can&apos;t handle.</string>
<string name="44185">Just bring me the Star Sapphire once you find it and I&apos;ll give you your reward. Now, is there anything else?</string>
<string name="44186">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Expenses, eh? Well, I guess a small advance wouldn&apos;t be out of place. Tell you what, I&apos;ll give you another 100 gold if you agree to undertake this mission.</string>
<string name="44187">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but I can&apos;t afford to be handing out advances to everyone who says they&apos;re going to try and help me out in this.</string>
<string name="44188">That&apos;s just bad business. You&apos;ll get your reward when you come back with the Star Sapphire.</string>
<string name="44189">It&apos;s like I told you before: Lillian wanted nothing to do with me when I mentioned the Star Sapphire. Said it was a mere trinket and she couldn&apos;t be bothered.</string>
<string name="44190">But now that you&apos;ve agreed to find the Star Sapphire for me I don&apos;t need her help anyway. Anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44191">It was buried with the mage Layenne, in her tomb somewhere out in the Coldwood. Bring it back to me and I&apos;ll give you 3000 gold pieces, just like we agreed on earlier.</string>
<string name="44192">Now, is there anything else you need?</string>
<string name="44193">Hello again. You come back to check out my wares? Or is there something else I can do for you? Husher Clay is here to serve, after all.</string>
<string name="44194">You did a fine job recovering the Star Sapphire for me, but I hope you&apos;re not here to ask for more money. As far as I&apos;m concerned, this matter is over and done with. </string>
<string name="44195">I realize you sometimes have difficulty understanding things, so I&apos;ll explain this to you one more time... slowly.</string>
<string name="44196">Now, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44197">Ah, yes, the Star Sapphire. I&apos;m sorry, but I&apos;m afraid somebody else has already recovered it for me. That&apos;s the way free enterprise works.</string>
<string name="44198">Somehow I knew you&apos;d be back. The lure of gold and adventure is too hard to resist! Let me give you the details of the job.</string>
<string name="44199">Well done, my good &lt;man/woman&gt;. And, as promised, here is your reward. 3000 gold pieces was the price agreed upon, I believe.</string>
<string name="44200">It appears I have underestimated you. I guess your slow and slurred speech is no impediment to getting things accomplished.</string>
<string name="44201">The pleasure is all mine, good &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44202">Now just... just settle down. You obviously feel quite strongly about this, but there&apos;s no need to get violent. Don&apos;t get all worked up.</string>
<string name="44203">Here, take another 200 gold. That should be enough to smooth things over. Now let&apos;s just put this unpleasantness behind us and let bygones be bygones, shall we?</string>
<string name="44204">So, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44205">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, I imagine this was quite difficult to acquire. I imagine surviving the tricks and traps of Layenne&apos;s tomb was no easy task.</string>
<string name="44206">Very well, here is another 200 gold pieces. I&apos;ve given you far more than the gem itself is worth, but I suppose that&apos;s the price I pay for being a collector.</string>
<string name="44207">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry but I&apos;ve already given you far more than the gem is worth, and we did have a deal. I&apos;m not about to start renegotiating now.</string>
<string name="44208">I thank you for your greeting, Endar Heartfood. I am &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="44209">You nice man. Me name is &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="44210">What kind of tensions are there between the Uthgardt and the Lords&apos; Alliance?</string>
<string name="44211">What you mean, tension? You got stiff neck?</string>
<string name="44212">Aarin Gend mentioned the Elk tribe had allied against us. What can you tell me about them? </string>
<string name="44213">Gend say Elk tribe at war with us. Me want know &apos;bout Elk tribe.</string>
<string name="44214">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="44215">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="44216">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="44217">Me want go now.</string>
<string name="44218">Murder? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="44219"></string>
<string name="44220">I don&apos;t want to get involved in this.</string>
<string name="44221">Me no care &apos;bout this.</string>
<string name="44222">Don&apos;t worry, I will represent Rolgan!</string>
<string name="44223">Me go help Rolgan!</string>
<string name="44224">Tell me about your people.</string>
<string name="44225">What you people be like?</string>
<string name="44226">Why have the Uthgardt joined the Lords&apos; Alliance in this place?</string>
<string name="44227">Why you people camp here with them Neverwinter guys?</string>
<string name="44228">I sense there is tension between your people and the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="44229">Me think you no like them Neverwinter guys.</string>
<string name="44230">I, Endar Heartfood of the Black Lion tribe, greet you. As chieftain of this tribe I offer you our hospitality, despite the current tensions between the Uthgardt and the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="44231">Feel free to explore the tribal camp. I only ask that you respect the Uthgardt as you would respect your own kind.</string>
<string name="44232">I will do my best to answer them, though your ways are strange and unfamiliar to we of the Uthgardt tribes.</string>
<string name="44233">I know little of the Elk tribe. Their territory is to the south, near the fort you call Ilkard. Once they were an ally of the Lords&apos; Alliance, but now they slaughter the settlers and farmers of your kind. </string>
<string name="44234">The Elk tribe have turned their back on the Uthgardt ways. Something has destroyed their honor and they have allied themselves with the evil of Luskan. More than this I cannot tell you.</string>
<string name="44235">It is rare to see one who serves the Lords&apos; Alliance within the camps of the Uthgardt, &lt;FullName&gt;. Even rare now that Rolgan has been accused of murder.</string>
<string name="44236">You are of simple mind, I see. Yet among the Uthgardt we know none must be condemned for their failings. None of us are perfect, after all.</string>
<string name="44237">Either you are of simple mind, or you mock the seriousness of this situation. Hmmm... from the glazed look in your eyes, I will guess you did not mean to mock me.</string>
<string name="44238">There has always been tension between the Uthgardt and the Lords&apos; Alliance. Our cultures are very different. It is inevitable there will be some clash when our peoples are forced to work side by side.</string>
<string name="44239">But now the tension has reached a dangerous level. Rolgan, one of the Black Lion tribe, is accused of slaying a soldier of the Lords&apos; Alliance. He is charged with murder.</string>
<string name="44240">We are all involved, whether we wish it or no. Rolgan&apos;s trial will fan the flames of racial hatred between the Uthgardt and the Lords&apos; Alliance. I do not wish to imagine what could be the result.</string>
<string name="44241">But I cannot force you to care about the plight of Rolgan. Is there a reason you have sought me out?</string>
<string name="44242">But this is a time of war. Luskan&apos;s army allies itself with the humanoids of the North, and we must set aside our differences to defeat this common foe. Is there more you would know? </string>
<string name="44243">It is rare to see one who serves the Lords&apos; Alliance within the camps of the Uthgardt, &lt;FullName&gt;. It is as if they are so shamed by Rolgan&apos;s execution that they dare not even face his people.</string>
<string name="44244">It is rare to see one who serves the Lords&apos; Alliance within the camps of the Uthgardt, &lt;FullName&gt;. Perhaps the soldiers feel justice was not served when Rolgan was acquitted at his trial.</string>
<string name="44245">It was Neurik, priest of their own god Tyr, who declared Rolgan innocent by reason of self-defense. Yet still the soldiers eye us with dark suspicion, and tensions are high between the soldiers and my people.</string>
<string name="44246">We are forced to side with the Lords&apos; Alliance to survive the Luskan army yet our own allies slaughter our noble warriors and call it justice! Such is the curse of my people!</string>
<string name="44247">Rolgan, one of our most noble and respected warriors, has been seized by the Lords&apos; Alliance and accused of this vile crime. He is being held at Tyr&apos;s temple, awaiting his trial.</string>
<string name="44248">Neurik promises Rolgan a fair trial but it is a battle of words, not of swords. Such a proceeding is unknown to the Uthgardt. We must find another to champion Rolgan&apos;s cause.</string>
<string name="44249">Though your heart is pure, your mind is lacking. Rolgan&apos;s trial is a battle of words and wits, Neurik has explained. In such a battle you are an unfit champion. Is there some other reason you have sought me out?</string>
<string name="44250">If you speak the truth you must present yourself to Neurik at the Temple of Tyr. He alone will choose the one to defend Rolgan with words rather than steel. </string>
<string name="44251">But before you rush to speak to Tyr&apos;s priest, was there some other reason you sought me out?</string>
<string name="44252">The ignorant among the Lords&apos; Alliance call us savages and barbarians yet the honor of our ancestors shields us against their empty words. We are born of the Black Lion. </string>
<string name="44253">We are of the Uthgardt. Our tribe is strong and proud. We are noble warriors and great hunters, following the herds to feed and clothe our tribe. We are the Black Lion tribe, and we are one with the land.</string>
<string name="44254">Beorunna&apos;s Well is a holy place to the Uthgardt. Here the honor and power of our people lie buried. We camp here to draw upon the strength of our ancestors as we stand against a foe of great evil.</string>
<string name="44255">The Luskan forces march across our land, slaughtering all in their path. We stand with the Lords&apos; Alliance against the evil of our common foe though often we Uthgardt must wonder if we can trust our new allies.</string>
<string name="44256">I, Endar Heartfood of the Black Lion tribe, greet you. Your name is well known among us, &lt;FirstName&gt;, for it was you who stood forth to defend Rolgan at his trial. You bring honor to yourself and your ancestors.</string>
<string name="44257">You, &lt;FullName&gt;, are not welcome among this tribe. You promised to defend Rolgan, yet he is dead. You have broken your vow, you have dishonored yourself and your ancestors!</string>
<string name="44258">Among our people you are now called &lt;FirstName&gt; the Oath-Breaker, and the people of the Black Lion Tribe shall ever despise you. Begone, Oath-Breaker, for the sight of you disgusts me!</string>
<string name="44259">We are not a people of material possessions, the only reward I can give is the gratitude of our tribe. But if there is anything I can do for you, only ask and it shall be done. </string>
<string name="44260">You are a good &lt;man/woman&gt; to defend Rolgan, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I, Endar Heartfood of the Black Lion Tribe, greet you with honor.</string>
<string name="44261">I spit on you, Oath-Breaker! May Rolgan&apos;s spirit haunt you for breaking your promise to defend him!</string>
<string name="44262">Rolgan owes you his life, &lt;FullName&gt;. You have earned much honor in defending him.</string>
<string name="44263">I will not go into town. The soldiers eye me with hate and suspicion. They have no honor.</string>
<string name="44264">How can we ally ourselves with butchers who slaughter our warriors in the name of justice?</string>
<string name="44265">The Black Lion warriors will defend the sacred land of Beorunna&apos;s Well from the Luskan ravagers.</string>
<string name="44266">We are a proud people, born of the Black Lion! Yet the soldiers call us savages. It is not our fault the Elk tribe has joined the Luskan cause!</string>
<string name="44267">You are the Oath-Breaker! You promised to defend Rolgan, yet now he is dead! You are not welcome among the people of the Black Lion!</string>
<string name="44268">Rolgan&apos;s body sits on a spike, yet Andar our chief claims we must not break our treaty with the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="44269">This land is sacred to the Black Lion tribe. The Lords&apos; Alliance should treat the Uthgardt here with more respect.</string>
<string name="44270">Here among our people we Uthgardt can escape the prejudice of the Lords&apos; Alliance soldiers.</string>
<string name="44271">For saving Rolgan, the people of the Black Lion hail you as a hero, &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="44272">The armies of Luskan pillage the land and the Uthgardt Elk tribe have joined their cause. But we of the Black Lion tribe will stand against them with honor!</string>
<string name="44273">A miniature world? How is that possible?</string>
<string name="44274">Tiny people live in snowball?</string>
<string name="44275">What does this have to do with the Word of Power?</string>
<string name="44276">What this got do with Power Word?</string>
<string name="44277">How did you manage to get this teleportation scroll? And why did Nax tell you all this?</string>
<string name="44278">How you get teleporty paper? And why Nax tell you all this stuff?</string>
<string name="44279">How can I get the Word out?</string>
<string name="44280">How me get Power Word out?</string>
<string name="44281">Okay, get me in!</string>

<string name="44297">How you end up here in Beorunna&apos;s Well?</string>

<string name="44324">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This snow globe is pretty valuable to you. I think you could spare some coin for its return.</string>

<string name="44340">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="44341">Me go now.</string>
<string name="44342">What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="44343">What you talk about?</string>
<string name="44344">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="44345">How do I get into the snow globe?</string>
<string name="44346">How me get into snowball?</string>
<string name="44347">I don&apos;t have time to look for your snow globe. I need to find the Words of Power right now!</string>
<string name="44348">Me not got time for look for you snowball! Me got find Words of Power fast!</string>
<string name="44349">I can&apos;t waste my time looking for a snow globe!</string>
<string name="44350">Me not waste time looking for some snowball!</string>
<string name="44351">You&apos;re nothing more than a common grave robber!</string>
<string name="44352">You nothing but a grave robber!</string>
<string name="44353">But how did you end up working for Aarin Gend?</string>
<string name="44354">But how you be working for Gend?</string>
<string name="44355">Let me see... yes, this is it! The snow globe Nax stole from me! Well done, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Now, to put it somewhere safe. &lt;StartAction&gt;[She mutters something and the globe vanishes.]&lt;/Start&gt; </string>
<string name="44356">I have researched the snow globe in great detail, and I&apos;ve discovered something rather interesting. Within the glass globe there exists an entire miniature world, a real world with real, living creatures!</string>
<string name="44357">I was en route to deliver the snow globe to my buyer when it was stolen from me by an unscrupulous, albeit rather charming, wizard named Nax.</string>
<string name="44358">I&apos;ll bet Nax is exploring that laboratory right now and with my snow globe at his side! But if you want to go after him you&apos;ll need this teleportation scroll. Nax told me it was the only way to pass through the magical portal leading to the dungeon.</string>
<string name="44359">I&apos;m a capable and attractive woman, and I&apos;m not above using my charms to further my archeological investigations. Nax offered to buy me a few drinks, we got to talking about our respective research, one thing led to another... </string>
<string name="44360">But while I was out making copies, Nax took my snow globe! I didn&apos;t notice until he was long gone. I guess it&apos;s my own fault for leaving him asleep in my room.</string>
<string name="44361">It boggles the mind, doesn&apos;t it? Think of the magic involved in such a process! Bending the realities of time and space, constricting them into something the size of a fist, and then encasing it in an indestructible sphere of glass...</string>
<string name="44362">If the ancient texts and documents I have researched are accurate, someone has hidden one of the Words of Power inside the miniature world.</string>
<string name="44363">Based on my research, you actually have to go inside the snow globe and retrieve it. There doesn&apos;t seem to be any other way to get the Word out.</string>
<string name="44364">I can&apos;t say I blame you. I wouldn&apos;t want to risk going in there myself, even though Gend is offering a hefty reward to recover those Words of Power.</string>
<string name="44365">I imagine that sooner or later someone is going to have to take the risk. It won&apos;t be me, however.</string>
<string name="44366">The snow globe is on its pedestal in my room. Second door on the left at the top of the stairs. If you&apos;re determined to go inside, all you have to do is touch the globe and will yourself in. </string>
<string name="44367">If you want to go after the Word of Power, be my guest. Just head on up to my room whenever you feel ready. But I&apos;m washing my hands of this whole affair. It&apos;s way too dangerous for my taste.</string>
<string name="44368">Never fear, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have merely transitioned the snow globe to its pedestal in my room here at the inn using the command word. Had I done this before, Nax could not have stolen it from me.</string>
<string name="44369">I just wanted to get my snow globe back, and now that I have I intend to celebrate with several glasses of this tavern&apos;s best vintage.</string>
<string name="44370">From what he told me, Nax was in these parts doing some research of his own. It seems he found a magical entrance to the deserted laboratory of a long dead wizard somewhere in the Coldwood to the north. </string>
<string name="44371">Afterwards, when Nax fell asleep, I borrowed the scroll and slipped off to have copies made before returning the scroll to his pack. I planned to do a little investigating of this dungeon on my own later on.</string>
<string name="44372">About time you showed up. I&apos;ve been waiting at least ten minutes for someone to come by and refill my drink!</string>
<string name="44373">Ah, yes. &lt;FullName&gt;, the hero of Neverwinter. I&apos;d drink a toast to your legendary deeds if my glass wasn&apos;t empty.</string>
<string name="44374">My name is Lillian Cambridge, archeologist. I&apos;m the North&apos;s leading expert in antiquities and ancient artifacts. No doubt Aarin Gend has told you that I&apos;ve come to offer my rather unique knowledge to aid the cause of the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="44375">Off you go then. Best of luck in your mission. Come back and see me if you have any more questions. That&apos;s what I&apos;m here for, after all.</string>
<string name="44376">And if you happen to speak to one of the waitresses you might want to mention there&apos;s a thirsty lady with an empty wine glass over here in the corner.</string>
<string name="44377">That is why I&apos;m here: to answer your questions about the Words of Power and the Creator Race that constructed them... And to sample the local wines, of course. </string>
<string name="44378">I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t help you there. Since I&apos;ve arrived at Beorunna&apos;s Well I&apos;ve hardly left this inn. My room is clean and comfortable, and the wine here is quite palatable, after the first few glasses.</string>
<string name="44379">Besides, I don&apos;t think the camp is that difficult to find your way around in. Now, is there something else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="44380">Welcome back. I&apos;d ask you to join me in a glass of wine, but it seems my bottle is empty yet again. **hic** </string>
<string name="44381">Welcome back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope your search for my missing snow globe is going better than my search for a decent glass of wine in this place. </string>
<string name="44382">**hic** Hey, I know you! You&apos;re one of them herosshh Gend hired to find them Words of Power, right! **hic** Shhure, that&apos;s you.</string>
<string name="44383">If it were as simple as drawing you a map, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I&apos;d have told Aarin Gend everything I know. You have to remember that the Words are thousands and thousands of years old.</string>
<string name="44384">The Creator Race that fashioned the Words predated even the first Elven kingdoms. Everything I know about them is theory and conjecture upon a foundation of myth and legend.</string>
<string name="44385">I can tell you that there were several Words of Power created, but they have been scattered throughout the North and lost for countless millennia. All that remain are rumors of where they might have disappeared.</string>
<string name="44386">Some believe the Words were taken by the dragons who dwell in the mountains to the west. Others claim clues to their location may be found in the long deserted ruins far to the south of Fort Ilkard, or hidden in the forests to the north.</string>
<string name="44387">The truth is they could be anywhere... though I believe I have learned the location of one of the Words, after many years of research and study.</string>
<string name="44388">Before I tell you the location of the Word of Power I need you to perform a task. Something very precious was stolen from me recently: a snow globe I had acquired on behalf of a very wealthy benefactor.</string>
<string name="44389">If you want me to tell you what I know about the location of the Word of Power, you&apos;ll have to recover that snow globe for me.</string>
<string name="44390">But, as I&apos;ve already told you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I know the location of one of the Words of Power, and I will be happy to share this information with you as soon as you get my snow globe back from Nax.</string>
<string name="44391">Now, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="44392">Spare me your threats, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Aarin Gend himself has invited me here. What do you think he will do if you choose to harm me?</string>
<string name="44393">Bring me my snow globe and I will gladly tell you what I know about the location of the Word of Power. However, until I get the snow globe the secret remains with me.</string>
<string name="44394">The Creators resembled our modern day lizardman, though they were far more intelligent and far more powerful than any of the scaled humanoids who exist today.</string>
<string name="44395">Little is known about them, save that they were a cruel and ruthless empire, slaughtering or enslaving the other races whenever they came across them.</string>
<string name="44396">What became of the Creators I cannot say. For centuries they ruled this land and then suddenly they vanished, leaving virtually no evidence they had ever existed at all.</string>
<string name="44397">There are many strange and exotic artifacts scattered throughout the north, and I spend much of my time in and around this area on archeological digs.</string>
<string name="44398">When I heard Aarin Gend was seeking the Words of Power I came to offer my expertise in this area. Gend has a reputation for rewarding his allies well.</string>
<string name="44399">And I was also hoping to find some brave adventurer, some intrepid, would-be hero, who might aid me in a little task.</string>
<string name="44400">And of course I was interested in recruiting someone to recover my snow globe from Nax, as I have already explained to you.</string>
<string name="44401">Something was stolen from me. A very rare and precious snow globe I had acquired on one of my archeological expeditions for a wealthy benefactor.</string>
<string name="44402">If I could find someone to recover that snow globe for me I would be very grateful. So grateful, in fact, that I might even tell them what I know about the location of one of the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="44403">I don&apos;t carry a grudge against Nax for what he did. I just want the snow globe back. Deliver it to me and I&apos;ll tell you the location of one of the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="44404">What&apos;s this? You haven&apos;t even begun the task and already the sordid topic of compensation has come up?</string>
<string name="44405">Bring me the snow globe and we&apos;ll talk, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There&apos;s no point fixing a price when you don&apos;t even have the item on you.</string>
<string name="44406">I&apos;ll be looking forward to it. I hope you have better luck than the others. So far no one who&apos;s gone into the Coldwood after Nax has come back.</string>
<string name="44407">Let me see it, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I must examine it to be certain this is the snow globe that was stolen from me.</string>
<string name="44408">It&apos;s a snow globe, not a snowball, though you can call it whatever you wish, I suppose. No harm will come to it if you try to throw it against a tree, at least, as the globe is all but indestructable.</string>
<string name="44409">A snow globe? There was just such an item stolen from me some time ago by a rather charming mage named Nax. Is it possible you have recovered my missing treasure?</string>
<string name="44410">A reward? Yes, of course. Give me the snow globe and I will tell you where to find one of the Words of Power. But first I must verify that this snow globe is truly the one I seek.</string>
<string name="44411">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe it&apos;s just the wine talking, but I like you. I suppose I could afford to spare a small monetary reward for the recovery of my snow globe. How does 300 gold pieces sound?</string>
<string name="44412">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but by rights the snow globe is mine. I will not pay to have my own property returned to me.</string>
<string name="44413">Besides, I know how badly Aarin Gend desires the Words of Power. If you want to recover it for him you will give me the snow globe.</string>
<string name="44414">As you wish, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I doubt the snow globe you have is the one I need, anyway. </string>
<string name="44415">And if it is, I will be here waiting for you when you come to your senses. Remember, until you give me the snow globe you won&apos;t know where to find the Word of Power.</string>
<string name="44416">Of course I assume you are referring to a snow globe. There was such an item stolen from me some time ago. Is it possible you somehow stumbled across my missing treasure?</string>
<string name="44417">I keep telling you, it&apos;s snow globe, not a snowball! Oh, what&apos;s the use?</string>
<string name="44418">As I told you before, the snow globe was stolen from me by a wizard named Nax. He told me he was going to the Coldwood in search of a long forgotten wizard&apos;s laboratory.</string>
<string name="44419">If you intend to seek him out, you will need one of the teleportation scrolls to get into the wizard&apos;s lab. Here, take one of the scrolls if you haven&apos;t already, as I have many, many copies.</string>
<string name="44420">Find the snow globe and I&apos;ll tell where you can find one of the Words of Power. Now, is there anything else, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="44421">Now, as I promised I will tell you how to find the Word of Power. The key, as you may have already guessed, is the snow globe itself.</string>
<string name="44422">That&apos;s strange. I don&apos;t normally consider myself all that forgettable. My name is Lillian Cambridge, an archeologist and expert on antiquities and artifacts.</string>
<string name="44423">I&apos;m here to help Aarin Gend and his agents in their search for the Words of Power. I&apos;m amazed you don&apos;t remember me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I certainly remember you.</string>
<string name="44424">Not that I don&apos;t keep trying. *hic* Oh, excuse me. Perhaps I should slow down... it wouldn&apos;t do to get tipsy now, would it?</string>
<string name="44425">No matter. I suppose I was getting somewhat tipsy in any case. So, what can I do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="44426">But it seems I was a little... tipsy that night. The wine was somewhat stronger than I anticipated.</string>
<string name="44427">I am not drunk! *giggle* I am Lillian Cambridge, archeologisht eshtrodinaire! Gend wantsh me to help you herosh find them Words of Power. Go ahead, ashk me a queshtion.</string>
<string name="44428">You should really try the wine in thish place. The firsht couple bottles ain&apos;t so good, but after that... woweee!</string>
<string name="44429">You should go inshide my shnow globe. There&apos;s one of them Words of Power in there. At leasht, there used to be.</string>
<string name="44430">Off you goes then. If you see the bartender, be a doll and tell him my glassh ish almost empty. Thanks, love.</string>
<string name="44431">Now that I have my snow globe back I just want to have some wine and relax!</string>
<string name="44432">Whoo, that wine went right to my head! That&apos;s strong stuff! On your way out, let the bartender know I&apos;m ready for another round.</string>
<string name="44433">Inshide my room. Up the stairs. Shecond door on the left. There&apos;sh a snow globe on a pedeshtal.</string>
<string name="44434">Inshide is a tiny little world. *giggle* A whole tiny world inshide that shnow globe, and the Word of Power is inshide, too.</string>
<string name="44435">Just go up an touch the shnow globe. POOF! You&apos;re inshide! Jusht don&apos;t expect me to come shave you if you get into trouble.</string>
<string name="44436">That&apos;s too dangeroush for me. I&apos;ll jus&apos; shtay here and drink my wine.</string>
<string name="44437">(sigh) It&apos;s so hard to find good help these days. It&apos;s a snow globe, not a snowball. </string>
<string name="44438">I don&apos;t think you appreciate the importance of this particular snow globe, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There is power locked within that glass sphere, power we cannot even begin to comprehend!</string>
<string name="44439">Nax felt its power, even if he didn&apos;t understand it. That&apos;s why he stole the snow globe from me. But he&apos;ll never unlock its mysteries. It took me years of research to uncover the snow globe&apos;s secrets.</string>
<string name="44440">But all this is beside the point. If you want me to tell you where the Word of Power can be found, you&apos;ll bring me the snow globe. That alone should be incentive enough for you.</string>
<string name="44441">I don&apos;t think you appreciate the importance of this particular snow globe, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There is power locked within that glass sphere, power we cannot even begin to comprehend!</string>
<string name="44442">I have spent many years unlocking the snow globe&apos;s secrets, and I&apos;m not about to just forget about it. Not when I&apos;ve finally found a buyer for it!</string>
<string name="44443">Anyway, the bottom line is this: if you want my help in finding the Word of Power, you&apos;ll have to get my snow globe for me.</string>
<string name="44444">Burial mounds, ancient tombs, crypts... It&apos;s amazing what sort of treasures you can unearth!</string>
<string name="44445">Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;! The term grave robber has such unsavory connotations. I prefer to think of myself as a tomb raider, if you will.</string>
<string name="44446">Yeah, I&apos;ll have a drink.</string>
<string name="44447">Yeah, me want drink.</string>
<string name="44448"></string>
<string name="44449"></string>
<string name="44450">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="44451">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="44452">I think I&apos;ll pass.</string>
<string name="44453">Me no want drink.</string>
<string name="44454">I&apos;ll have a drink now.</string>
<string name="44455">Me want drink.</string>
<string name="44456">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="44457">Me go now.</string>
<string name="44458">Get you a drink, &lt;sir/madam&gt;? We&apos;ve got a fine selection of beverages if you&apos;re interested.</string>
<string name="44459"></string>
<string name="44460">Then quit bothering me. Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m swamped?</string>
<string name="44461"></string>
<string name="44462"></string>
<string name="44463"></string>
<string name="44464">Let me show you what we&apos;ve got.</string>
<string name="44465">Oh, I get it. A man selling drinks is automatically the information hub of the community, right? Well, I don&apos;t have the time or the inclination to pry my drunken customers about their dark secrets.</string>
<string name="44466">I sell drinks. I&apos;m a bartender. That&apos;s all I am, and I&apos;m fine with that. So, do you want a drink or not?</string>
<string name="44467">How do you know my name?</string>
<string name="44468">How you know my name?</string>
<string name="44469">What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="44470">What you do here?</string>
<string name="44471">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="44472">Me want ask you stuff.</string>
<string name="44473">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="44474">Why don&apos;t you trust the Uthgardt?</string>
<string name="44475">Why you not trust them Uthgardts?</string>
<string name="44476">Do you know anything about the surrounding area?</string>
<string name="44477">You know stuff &apos;bout area around here?</string>
<string name="44478">I&apos;m searching for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="44479">Me look for Power Words.</string>
<string name="44480">I need to purchase some supplies.</string>
<string name="44481">Me need buy stuff.</string>
<string name="44482">You better change your attitude if you know what&apos;s good for you!</string>
<string name="44483">You better change you attitude if you know what good for you!</string>
<string name="44484">I shouldn&apos;t be talking when I&apos;m on duty, but I guess I can make an exception for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="44485">You figure just because you&apos;re some great hero that you can bother me while I&apos;m on duty? What do you want, &lt;FirstName&gt;? And make it quick!</string>
<string name="44486">Guess I&apos;ll just go back to manning the ballista then.</string>
<string name="44487">Isn&apos;t it obvious? I&apos;m manning the ballista. You never know when those Luskan dogs might launch an attack on our camp!</string>
<string name="44488">Of course these ballista won&apos;t do much good if those Uthgardt camped on the plateau turn on us. It isn&apos;t easy fighting a war when you can&apos;t even trust your allies! </string>
<string name="44489">How can you even ask that? They&apos;re savages and pagans. Wouldn&apos;t surprise me if they&apos;re planning to sacrifice us all to their Gods next full moon!</string>
<string name="44490">But our orders are to treat them with respect, so I guess I shouldn&apos;t be saying anymore about this.</string>
<string name="44491">Uh... well, they&apos;re barbarians. Not like you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You&apos;ve proved yourself as an ally many times over. But the Uthgardt are nothing but bloodthirsty savages.</string>
<string name="44492">Come on, everybody knows you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. After all you&apos;ve done for Neverwinter? Your practically a living legend!</string>
<string name="44493">And if I may say so, it&apos;s good to have someone on our side who we can rely on when we end up facing Aribeth and that Luskan army.</string>
<string name="44494">I don&apos;t know what I can say that would be much help to a hero like you, but I&apos;ll give it my best shot.</string>
<string name="44495">Of course, everybody used to say the same thing about Aribeth and look how she turned out. So we&apos;ll just wait and see where you end up.</string>
<string name="44496">Any supplies you need can be found at the stores in the camp. Weapons, armor, even healing and magic supplies, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re after.</string>
<string name="44497">Anything else you need to know?</string>
<string name="44498">I guess I can answer a few questions, but make it quick. Like I said, I&apos;m on duty.</string>
<string name="44499">You can&apos;t bully me around just because you&apos;re famous! Look, you want to ask me questions then ask. Otherwise I&apos;ve got work to do.</string>
<string name="44500">Can&apos;t tell you much. I&apos;m a soldier, not a scout. There&apos;s mountains to the north and the Coldwood to the east. And of course there&apos;s Fort Ilkard to the south.</string>
<string name="44501">If you want to know more I guess you&apos;ll have to go check those places out for yourself.</string>
<string name="44502">Yeah, I heard Gend had some of you out looking for some old artifacts. But I&apos;m just a soldier, I don&apos;t know anything about that.</string>
<string name="44503">How did I get mixed up in this? I don&apos;t even know how to swing a sword!</string>
<string name="44504">I begged Commander Damas to grant me leave to check on my homestead, but that man&apos;s heart is stone.</string>
<string name="44505">I shouldn&apos;t be here. I&apos;m no soldier! I&apos;m just a farmer who got conscripted.</string>
<string name="44506">Commander Damas won&apos;t let us leave, not even to try and save our farms.</string>
<string name="44507">I am &lt;FullName&gt;. I have been sent by Aarin Gend on behalf of the Lords&apos; Alliance!</string>
<string name="44508">Me &lt;FullName&gt;. Aarin Gend send me. Me work for Lords Alli-thingy</string>
<string name="44509">I do not answer to you!</string>
<string name="44510">You not me boss!</string>
<string name="44511">Identify yourself, or we shall attack!</string>
<string name="44512">Oh, great! When they finally send us some help we get a half-wit! Hope you fight better than you speak.</string>
<string name="44513">About time they sent us some help! I don&apos;t know how much longer we could hold out against this siege!</string>
<string name="44514">You&apos;d better go see Commander Damas. Go to the building in the northeast corner of the Fort.</string>
<string name="44515">Can&apos;t say we didn&apos;t give you fair warning! To arms!</string>
<string name="44516">I should have left Fort Ilkard when I had the chance! Now I&apos;m going to die in this siege!</string>
<string name="44517">Great, the Uthgardt are gone. Now the Luskan army can come and kill us.</string>
<string name="44518">Shouldn&apos;t you be talking with Commander Damas? He&apos;s in the building at the southwest corner of the fort.</string>
<string name="44519">I am &lt;FullName&gt;. I work for Aarin Gend and the Lords&apos; Alliance.</string>
<string name="44520">Me name &lt;FullName&gt;. Me work for Aarin Gend and Lord Alli-thingy.</string>
<string name="44521">I don&apos;t answer to you!</string>
<string name="44522">You not boss of me!</string>
<string name="44523">Identify yourself or we&apos;ll have to attack!</string>
<string name="44524">Then you shall answer to our blades! Attack!</string>
<string name="44525">&apos;Bout time they sent us some help! I don&apos;t know how much longer we can hold the fort against this Uthgardt siege!</string>
<string name="44526">Oh, great! They finally send us some help and it&apos;s a half-wit! Hope you fight better than you talk. </string>
<string name="44527">You need to speak to Commander Damas. Go to the building in the northeast corner.</string>
<string name="44528">I don&apos;t know how much longer we can hold out against this siege.</string>
<string name="44529">Now that the siege is over, I wonder if they&apos;ll be sending us out to join the battle against Luskan.</string>
<string name="44530">I&apos;m just a low-ranking soldier. You should really be speaking to Commander Damas in the southwest building.</string>
<string name="44531">If I&apos;m going to save your wife and daughter, I want a reward up front.</string>
<string name="44532">Why do you hate Damas so much?</string>
<string name="44533">The Uthgardt are allied with Luskan. That isn&apos;t the Commander&apos;s fault.</string>
<string name="44534">Maybe I could speak to Damas on your behalf.</string>
<string name="44535">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="44536">Is there anything I can do to help?</string>
<string name="44537">Don&apos;t you think it&apos;s dangerous to bring your family here? The Fort is the first place an enemy will attack.</string>
<string name="44538">He&apos;s just doing his job as Commander.</string>
<string name="44539">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe Damas is trying to exterminate the Uthgardt so he can claim their land and bring in more settlers.</string>
<string name="44540">I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="44541">What&apos;s in this for me?</string>
<string name="44542">Sorry, I&apos;ve got more important things to do.</string>
<string name="44543">Why you hate Damas?</string>
<string name="44544">Uthgardt and Luskan be friends. War not Damas&apos; fault.</string>
<string name="44545">You want me speak at Damas?</string>
<string name="44546">Me go now.</string>
<string name="44547">Me want help. What me do?</string>
<string name="44548">Fort not safe for family. In war army attack fort first!</string>
<string name="44549">Me do it!</string>
<string name="44550">What me get?</string>
<string name="44551">Me got other stuff to do.</string>
<string name="44552">You pay now or me no do!</string>
<string name="44553">Damas be boss. Him just do job.</string>
<string name="44554">I thank you for this, Bret. I wish you and your family the very best.</string>
<string name="44555">That&apos;s it? I saved your family for a stupid bracelet?</string>
<string name="44556">You welcome. Me hope you and wifey and baby be happy.</string>
<string name="44557">You give stupid bracelet? Me want more!</string>
<string name="44558">I may not be able to leave this place until the war is over, but at least my wife and daughter are here in the safety of the fort with me.</string>
<string name="44559">Oh, sure, I give you the money now and I&apos;ll never see you again, right? You bring my family to me, then you&apos;ll get your reward.</string>
<string name="44560">Commander Damas is a cruel and stupid man! This war against the Uthgardt is entirely his fault!</string>
<string name="44561">He&apos;s a ruthless, heartless bastard! First he conscripts every able-bodied farmer and settler in the region and orders us to come to this Fort for training.</string>
<string name="44562">Then when reports of Uthgardt raiders attacking the abandoned homesteads start to come in, he refuses to let us leave! Our homes and families are defenseless without us!</string>
<string name="44563">I&apos;m desperate right now! My own wife and daughter are out there, helpless! If there was only some way to bring them here to the Fort, at least I could keep an eye on them.</string>
<string name="44564">Maybe so, but it&apos;s no more dangerous than leaving them out there on the homestead all alone. At least here I&apos;d be able to watch over them myself.</string>
<string name="44565">Don&apos;t waste your breath trying to reason with him. He&apos;s a heartless monster! He doesn&apos;t care that our families are in danger, and this war against the Uthgardt is his fault anyway!</string>
<string name="44566">We shared the land peacefully with the Uthgardt before Damas came to Fort Ilkard. Now this war starts up, and he hasn&apos;t even tried to make peace with them. </string>
<string name="44567">It&apos;s almost like he wants to wipe them all out, no matter what the cost! He couldn&apos;t care less that this war has put my family in danger.</string>
<string name="44568">Good luck. We conscripts aren&apos;t allowed to leave the Fort until the Luskan army has been defeated. So if you need to find me, I guess I&apos;ll be right here.</string>
<string name="44569">What kind of a man is that, I ask you? It&apos;s like he wants this war with the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="44570">Well, more settlers means more taxes. Maybe Damas wants to increase revenues from the lands around Fort Ilkard so he can earn himself a quick promotion. Or maybe he just hates the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="44571">Maybe you could help. We conscripts aren&apos;t allowed to leave, but you can come and go as you please. You could go to my farm and escort my wife and daughter back to the Fort!</string>
<string name="44572">Oh, I get it. My family are just a bunch of settlers. Their lives are meaningless. You&apos;re as bad as Commander Damas!</string>
<string name="44573">Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! Here, take my wedding band and show it to my wife so she knows to trust you. My farm is in the homesteads to the west of the Fort.</string>
<string name="44574">I don&apos;t have much, but I will give you whatever I can spare if you do this task for me. </string>
<string name="44575">No offense, but I don&apos;t think someone as slow as you would be very convincing. Besides, he doesn&apos;t care that our families are in danger. Besides, this war against the Uthgardt is his fault!</string>
<string name="44576">I have you to thank for this, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. You have brought my family together again. For that, I thank you.</string>
<string name="44577">I promised you a reward, though I do not have much to give. Here, take this bracelet. It is not much, but I wish you to have it.</string>
<string name="44578">Whatever awaits my family, at least we can face it together thanks to you.</string>
<string name="44579">The bracelet was given to me by my mother. If I had anything else of value it would be yours, but I am only a poor farmer. I&apos;m sorry but that&apos;s all there is.</string>
<string name="44580">Wow! You really don&apos;t like Damas.</string>
<string name="44581">You&apos;re pretty hard on your Commander. He&apos;s just doing his job.</string>
<string name="44582">Do you want me to try and speak to Damas on your behalf?</string>
<string name="44583">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="44584">Anything I can do to help?</string>
<string name="44585">Like you said, we gnomes have to stick together. Is there anything I can do to help? </string>
<string name="44586">You not like Damas much.</string>
<string name="44587">Damas be commander. He just do job.</string>
<string name="44588">Want me speak at Damas?</string>
<string name="44589">Me go now.</string>
<string name="44590">Me want help you.</string>
<string name="44591">You gnome like me. Me help you.</string>
<string name="44592">Okay, I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="44593">What&apos;s in this for me?</string>
<string name="44594">I&apos;ve got more important things to worry about.</string>
<string name="44595">Me do it!</string>
<string name="44596">What me get if me do it?</string>
<string name="44597">Me not got time for this.</string>
<string name="44598">I may be just a simple gnome, but Commander Damas doesn&apos;t have the right to treat me like this! What a pompous, self-absorbed jerk!</string>
<string name="44599">Hey, good to see one of my own kind here. We gnomes have to stick together! If we don&apos;t, pompous jerks like Commander Damas will just keep pushing us around.</string>
<string name="44600">Can you blame me? I finally get enough money to retire and buy a nice little homestead in the country and then BAM! I get conscripted into his army.</string>
<string name="44601">Now he won&apos;t even let me return home. I&apos;ve got to get buyers lined up for my crops. If I don&apos;t sort it out soon, I&apos;m going to lose a fortune! And it will all be because of that jerk Damas. </string>
<string name="44602">Well, he ain&apos;t doing it very damn well! The Uthgardt aren&apos;t normally on good terms with Luskan. If Damas wanted to I bet he could bargain a peace treaty and at least get the Uthgardt to call off their warriors.</string>
<string name="44603">But he&apos;s too stubborn or too stupid or too arrogant or too blind or too bloodthirsty to even try and make peace. The guy&apos;s a complete moron.</string>
<string name="44604">No point in that. He doesn&apos;t listen to anyone smarter than he is, which means he doesn&apos;t listen to ANYBODY!</string>
<string name="44605">I&apos;d join you if I could, but until this war with Luskan is over all the conscripts have to stay here to defend Fort Ilkard. If you need anything else, you know where to find me.</string>
<string name="44606">Forgive me for saying so, but you might be the only person in this place who&apos;s even stupidier than Damas. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any point in you speaking to that jerk.</string>
<string name="44607">Nothing you can really do, unless you want to buy several hundred bushels of turnips. Wait a minute... there is something you can do!</string>
<string name="44608">I could write up a note with instructions for my wife and a list of all the buyers she has to get in touch with to sell our crop. You could deliver the note for me! </string>
<string name="44609">Thanks! This will save me a bundle. Take this note back to my wife and she&apos;ll know what to do. Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ve put down that she should give you a substantial reward for this.</string>
<string name="44610">I didn&apos;t really think my valuables would be much use in a war, so I left them all back at the homestead. But if you deliver the note, my wife will make sure the effort is worth your while. </string>
<string name="44611">Hey, I understand. It&apos;s only my living. It&apos;s only my entire life savings. Don&apos;t worry about it. Really.</string>
<string name="44612">Now I sit around in a suit of armor two sizes too big waiting for a Luskan soldier to split my skull. Hell of a retirement, huh?</string>
<string name="44613">I really appreciate you taking that note for my wife. If you hadn&apos;t agreed to help me, I might have lost my farm. All because of that arrogant, self-absorbed jerk Damas!</string>
<string name="44614">I have a note here from your husband.</string>
<string name="44615">Me got note from husband.</string>
<string name="44616">Where is your husband?</string>
<string name="44617">Where you hubby be?</string>
<string name="44618">Luskan forces are pillaging all the farms around here. You have to leave for your own safety.</string>
<string name="44619">It no safe here. Bad men come. You go now.</string>
<string name="44620">Is there anything I can do to help you?</string>
<string name="44621">Me want help you.</string>
<string name="44622">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="44623">Me go now.</string>
<string name="44624">Hand over your valuables and I might let you live.</string>
<string name="44625">Give money or me kill you!</string>
<string name="44626">Thank you, that will be fine.</string>
<string name="44627">Gold be nice. Thank you, gnome lady.</string>
<string name="44628">Could you spare a little more for a fellow gnome?</string>
<string name="44629">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think you could spare a little more, seeing as how I saved your farm.</string>
<string name="44630">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me save you farm. You give more!</string>
<string name="44631">If you know what&apos;s good for you, you&apos;ll up the ante on that reward!</string>
<string name="44632">Give more or me kill you!</string>
<string name="44633">You gnome. Me gnome. You give more?</string>
<string name="44634">Sorry. You can&apos;t blame a &lt;man/woman&gt; for trying to get a little something extra.</string>
<string name="44635">Me sorry. Me just want more gold.</string>
<string name="44636">You&apos;ll get no apology from me! Take your best shot, sister!</string>
<string name="44637">Me no sorry! You got problem with that?</string>
<string name="44638">I hope my husband returns soon. Eckel handled all the business of the family. But I don&apos;t know anything about running a farm! This is terrible!</string>
<string name="44639">Off you go, then. Be careful with all those Luskan raiders roaming the countryside...</string>
<string name="44640">You think you can bully me because my husband is away? Well guess what: I didn&apos;t always used to be a farm wife! I may be retired, but I still know a few tricks of my former trade!</string>
<string name="44641">Great! We retired here to the farm to get away from this sort of thing. Ah, well. Here&apos;s a tip, dopey: Before you try to rob people make sure they aren&apos;t retired mages with a bad attitude!</string>
<string name="44642">All the able bodied men in the area were conscripted into the army at Fort Ilkard. They&apos;re all stuck there defending the fort until this war with Luskan is over.</string>
<string name="44643">Hmmm... not too bright, are you? Well, I guess ignorance isn&apos;t a crime, and you&apos;re obviously not from around here, so I guess you couldn&apos;t know. </string>
<string name="44644">Don&apos;t worry, I can take care of myself. I used to do my share of adventuring before I met Eckel and we decided to retire to this farm. I still remember a few tricks of the trade.</string>
<string name="44645">You may be dumb as a stump, but you sure are sweet to get all worked up over my safety.</string>
<string name="44646">Not unless you know someone who wants to buy several hundred bushels of turnips. I think my husband had some buyers lined up, but until he gets back I have no idea where to even begin.</string>
<string name="44647">Oh, well... not that I don&apos;t appreciate the offer, but this isn&apos;t really something you&apos;d be very good at. I doubt you would be much use.</string>
<string name="44648">A note from Eckel? May I see it? Hmmm... this looks like his signature, all right. And here&apos;s a list of buyers for our crops!</string>
<string name="44649">I can&apos;t thank you enough for delivering this note! It says here Eckel promised you a reward. How does 300 gold pieces sound?</string>
<string name="44650">I hope this war with Luskan ends soon, seeing how I miss my husband.</string>
<string name="44651">I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything anyone can do. Eckel has to do his duty, same as everyone else. I&apos;m not the only woman who&apos;s lonely for her husband right now.</string>
<string name="44652">Take the gold with my thanks. You&apos;ve earned it. Without this note, I wouldn&apos;t have had a clue where to begin unloading these turnips. We would have been ruined!</string>
<string name="44653">Well, I suppose it wouldn&apos;t kill me to kick in a little something extra. You did save Eckel and me from financial ruin. Here, take this scroll. It&apos;s a remnant from my adventuring days. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll need it anymore.</string>
<string name="44654">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Now don&apos;t go getting greedy on me. I think you&apos;ve been offered a pretty fair sum for delivering a simple note. 300 gold is nothing to sneer at now, is it?</string>
<string name="44655">Don&apos;t make the mistake of underestimating me! I wasn&apos;t always a farmer&apos;s wife, you know. I used to be a pretty fair mage in my adventuring days!</string>
<string name="44656">If you hadn&apos;t saved my farm, I&apos;d give you a taste of my spells you wouldn&apos;t soon forget! But I&apos;ll honor Eckel&apos;s commitment. Here&apos;s the reward you were promised. But you&apos;d better apologize before I do something we both regret!</string>
<string name="44657">You can&apos;t just go around threatening people, you know. But it&apos;s all water under the bridge now. Thanks again for bringing back Eckel&apos;s note. </string>
<string name="44658">I have some questions I need to ask.</string>
<string name="44659">Me want ask you question.</string>
<string name="44660">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="44661">Me go now.</string>
<string name="44662">Maybe I could do something about those catapults.</string>
<string name="44663">You want me go break catapults?</string>
<string name="44664">Why are your soldiers complaining so much?</string>
<string name="44665">Why soldier complain at you?</string>
<string name="44666">Do you know why the Elk tribe has allied itself with Luskan?</string>
<string name="44667">Why Elk Uthgardts work for Luskan now?</string>
<string name="44668">Maybe you could negotiate a truce with the Uthgardt Elk tribe.</string>
<string name="44669">Maybe you make nice with Uthgardt Elk tribe.</string>
<string name="44670">Anything I can do to help with the siege?</string>
<string name="44671">Me want help end siege.</string>
<string name="44672">Is there anything I can do to help?</string>
<string name="44673">Me want help.</string>
<string name="44674">The catapults have been destroyed.</string>
<string name="44675">Me break catapults.</string>
<string name="44676">I have the head of the Uthgardt sub-chief.</string>
<string name="44677">Me got Uthgardt sub-chief head.</string>
<string name="44678">I have the head of Zokan Thunderer.</string>
<string name="44679">Me got Zokan&apos;s head.</string>
<string name="44680">You contaminated the Elk tribe with these plague infected blankets!</string>
<string name="44681">You make Elk tribe sick! Me got plague blanket!</string>
<string name="44682">The reward should suffice.</string>
<string name="44683">Reward be good. Me be happy.</string>
<string name="44684">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I saved this fort from constant bombardment. Don&apos;t you think I deserve a little more?</string>
<string name="44685">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me saves fort from lots of flying rocks! Me want more!</string>
<string name="44686">You&apos;d better come up with more than that, unless you want Fort Ilkard to start looking for a new commander!</string>
<string name="44687">Give more or me snap neck like twig!</string>
<string name="44688">Thank you, Commander Damas.</string>
<string name="44689">Gold be shiny. Me be happy.</string>
<string name="44690">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;d think a whole fort would be worth a little more than that.</string>
<string name="44691">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That all? Me save fort! Me want more!</string>
<string name="44692">You&apos;d better increase that bounty or you&apos;ll share that Uthgardt&apos;s fate!</string>
<string name="44693">Give more or me chop you head off, too!</string>
<string name="44694">Don&apos;t forget my reward.</string>
<string name="44695">Me get reward, right?</string>
<string name="44696">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You wanted the Elk tribe wiped out, didn&apos;t you? Even if it meant a war!</string>
<string name="44697">I guess the Elk tribe got what they deserved. Now how about that reward?</string>
<string name="44698">Them Elks got what coming to them. Me want reward.</string>
<string name="44699">But the Uthgardt were here first! They have as much claim to this land as the settlers! Maybe more!</string>
<string name="44700">But Elks be here first. You steal them land.</string>
<string name="44701">I should report you for your actions!</string>
<string name="44702">Me going to tell on you!</string>
<string name="44703">You deserve to die for your actions!</string>
<string name="44704">You bad man. Bad man need die!</string>
<string name="44705">Keep your blood money! I want no part of this!</string>
<string name="44706">Keep reward. Me no want your blood money!</string>
<string name="44707">Thank you, Commander Damas. It has been a pleasure doing business with you.</string>
<string name="44708">Me like work for you. You give much gold.</string>
<string name="44709">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I went through a lot of trouble to kill this Uthgardt chief. A *lot* of trouble, if you get my meaning.</string>
<string name="44710">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Uthgardt not easy kill! Me do big lots work. Big, big lots work!</string>
<string name="44711">Unless you want to be as extinct as the Elk tribe you better hand over some more coin!</string>
<string name="44712">Me kill lots Uthgardts! Me kill you next if you no give more gold!</string>
<string name="44713">Fine, you&apos;ve made your point. The Uthgardt Elk tribe deserves death.</string>
<string name="44714">Okay, you right. Elkies be bad guys, we need kill them.</string>
<string name="44715">The only reason the Elk tribe joined Luskan is because they were promised a cure for the plague you gave them!</string>
<string name="44716">Elkies only help Luskan cause they want make sickness go away!</string>
<string name="44717">I know you have the cure. Now hand it over.</string>
<string name="44718">Me know you got cure! Gimmie!</string>
<string name="44719">Hand over the cure or I&apos;ll make you suffer until you wish you had the plague yourself!</string>
<string name="44720">Give cure or me rip you arm off!</string>
<string name="44721">I guess I don&apos;t have much choice. Here&apos; s your gold.</string>
<string name="44722">Me not got much choice. Here gold.</string>
<string name="44723">I think I&apos;ll just take the cure from your cold dead hands instead.</string>
<string name="44724">Me just take cure from you dead body instead.</string>
<string name="44725">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ll give you 500 gold. Not one coin more.</string>
<string name="44726">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Here be 500 gold.</string>
<string name="44727">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; 1000 gold and not one coin more.</string>
<string name="44728">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Here be 1000 gold.</string>
<string name="44729">Your price is too high. Forget it! I&apos;m out of here!</string>
<string name="44730">You want big much gold. Me go now.</string>
<string name="44731">Okay, 1500 it is.</string>
<string name="44732">Here be 1500. Give cure now.</string>
<string name="44733">Hey! This is the Commander&apos;s quarters! I don&apos;t want you enlisted men traipsing through... oh, sorry, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. I thought you were one of my soldiers.</string>
<string name="44734">Please forgive my outburst - I would not have it said that Commander Damas is a man without class. How may I be of service to you?</string>
<string name="44735">As you wish, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. If you need anything else, I am at your disposal.</string>
<string name="44736">I suppose I could spare you some time. Though between the catapults bombarding us and the endless complaints of my recruits I&apos;ve already got enough headaches.</string>
<string name="44737">I suppose I could spare you some time, though between the Uthgardt siege and the endless complaints of my recruits I&apos;ve already got enough headaches.</string>
<string name="44738">I suppose I could spare you some time, though between endless complaints of my recruits and the alliance between the Uthgardt Elk tribe and Luskan I&apos;ve already got enough headaches.</string>
<string name="44739">As you wish, though between the endless complaints of my soldiers and this war against Luskan I don&apos;t have much time to spare.</string>
<string name="44740">Who knows how the minds of those animals works? They probably just saw a chance to kill and pillage and jumped at it!</string>
<string name="44741">How can you even ask that? The Uthgardt are ruthless killers who prey on the weak and defenseless! They must be exterminated like the disease they are! Now, if there is nothing else... </string>
<string name="44742">They are soft and weak! They whine about missing their families and cry about going back to their farms and homesteads! Don&apos;t they realize this is war!</string>
<string name="44743">Fort Ilkard has to be defended if we are to win this war! And it would help if my soldiers wouldn&apos;t question my every command. Now, if there is nothing else... </string>
<string name="44744">Tell you what: you go out and disable all six catapults attacking the fort, and I&apos;ll make sure you get a healthy reward from the Fort Ilkard treasury. Now, if there is nothing else... </string>
<string name="44745">You don&apos;t seem like the brightest &lt;man/woman&gt; I&apos;ve ever met, but I can&apos;t be too picky at this time.</string>
<string name="44746">You could bring me the head of Arness, the Uthgardt sub-chief in charge of this siege! I stick his melon on a pole outside the gates, and the Uthgardt will think twice before attacking Fort Ilkard again!</string>
<string name="44747">You might be dull, but I like your attitude! I could use more soldiers like you!</string>
<string name="44748">Of course I would see you are justly rewarded for bringing me such a prize. Now, if there is nothing else... </string>
<string name="44749">That&apos;s the spirit! Jump right in there! You know, you&apos;re so incredibly stupid but you could teach the rest of my troops so, so much!</string>
<string name="44750">The best way to break the Luskan - Elk tribe alliance is to kill off the Uthgardt chief, Zokan Thunderer. Without Zokan to guide them, the Elk tribe will fall apart. And that will be the end of the alliance.</string>
<string name="44751">The Uthgardt chief is holed up in an old fort just west of here. Damn coward hasn&apos;t come out in weeks! Bring me his head and I&apos;ll give you a fine reward. Now, if there&apos;s nothing else... </string>
<string name="44752">This is excellent news! Of course I must assume that you are the one responsible for this. Therefore you shall be the one to receive your reward.</string>
<string name="44753">Well done! What did you do, bludgeon them with that rock-hard noggin of yours? I am only joking, of course.</string>
<string name="44754">Here, 500 gold pieces for your act of wanton destruction. A fine payday, wouldn&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="44755">I&apos;d think twice before threatening me here in my own fort! My troops may not love me, but they will slay you if you kill their commander!</string>
<string name="44756">If you desire even more gold, I have another job you might be interested in. The Uthgardt siege is still a problem, even without their catapults lobbing death from above.</string>
<string name="44757">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; We don&apos;t always get what we deserve in life now, do we?</string>
<string name="44758">Excellent! I will have this placed on a pole outside Fort Ilkard&apos;s gates at once!</string>
<string name="44759">Excellent! For one so lacking in brains, your success is truly amazing! I will have this head mounted on a pole outside Fort Ilkard&apos;s gates right away.</string>
<string name="44760">For ending the siege of Fort Ilkard, I am pleased to give you this gift of 750 gold pieces!</string>
<string name="44761">Don&apos;t be a fool! My soldiers may not like me, but they won&apos;t stand idly by while I am attacked. Your threats will get you nothing, I say! But I do have an offer you may wish to hear...</string>
<string name="44762">Since you have proven yourself so useful already, there is something else I would ask of you.</string>
<string name="44763">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I am being a bit stingy. I can&apos;t spare anymore gold for this particular task, but I have a powerful shield here you can have. None of the soldiers under my command are worthy of it, anyway.</string>
<string name="44764">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Greed disgusts me, unless it is my own. If you want more from my coffers, you will have to earn it! Luckily, I know just how you can do that.</string>
<string name="44765">I have to admit, I didn&apos;t like your looks when I first saw you. But maybe I was wrong. After all, you&apos;ve earned your reward. 500 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="44766">I knew from the first moment I laid eyes on you that you&apos;d come through for me. You just have that aura of success. Take this reward: 1000 gold pieces for ending the siege of Fort Ilkard.</string>
<string name="44767">And the Elk tribe is no more! The world is rid of their vile presence. At last, the lands have been cleansed of those wandering savages!</string>
<string name="44768">So what if I did? Damn savages, running loose like animals over the land, causing trouble whenever the settlers tried to build their homes and plant their crops.</string>
<string name="44769">That&apos;s exactly the kind of bleeding heart talk I don&apos;t need! Look, I tried to do this nice and quiet. Slipped them Uthgardt a bunch of plague-infected blankets. It didn&apos;t kill them off quick enough, that was the problem!</string>
<string name="44770">Then this war came along and my problem was solved. Wipe the tribe out because they allied with Luskan, and the land is empty for the settlers now. Works out good for everyone... except the Elk tribe. Ha! </string>
<string name="44771">Who are you going to tell? Who&apos;s going to care? The Elk tribe are gone now, thanks to you! It&apos;s too late, there&apos;s nothing you can do. So just take the reward...</string>
<string name="44772">Careful, you don&apos;t want to try anything here in the fort! My troops may not like me much, but they won&apos;t stand idly by while their Commander is under attack! Just let this go. Take the reward and be done with it.</string>
<string name="44773">I can&apos;t tell if you&apos;re principled or just stupid but if you don&apos;t want the money, fine. That just means more stays in the Fort Ilkard treasury. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I think our business here is done.</string>
<string name="44774">Your reward. Of course. 1000 gold pieces for you, friend. You may be one ugly &lt;man/woman&gt;, but at least now you&apos;re rich, right? Ha-ha!</string>
<string name="44775">Your reward. Of course. 1200 gold pieces seems fair. You&apos;re becoming quite the wealthy &lt;man/woman&gt; working for me.</string>
<string name="44776">Your reward. Of course. 1500 gold pieces for you, my friend. Now you&apos;re not only physically attractive, you&apos;re also stinking rich! Ha-ha!</string>
<string name="44777">The pleasure has been all mine. I doubt there is little more you can do for me here at Fort Ilkard, but if anything comes up I will surely keep you in mind. Good day to you, &lt;Sir/Madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="44778">I would have thought slaughtering the Elk tribe and their chieftain would have sated your bloodlust. Never fear, I&apos;m a reasonable man.</string>
<string name="44779">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I take your meaning well enough. Genocide is hard work. You&apos;ve cleared out an entire people, I guess you&apos;ve earned a little something extra. How about this executioner&apos;s axe? It seems appropriate, doesn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="44780">I guess that settles the matter. So now if you&apos;ll excuse me I&apos;ll get back to the duties of my position as fort Commander. Good day, &lt;Sir/Madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="44781">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hey, this is war! Everybody has to suck it up and do what&apos;s expected. You don&apos;t get any special credit for doing a job just because you had to work at it!</string>
<string name="44782">So what if I did? The Uthgardt are nothing but primitive savages! Their time is over. We have the strength to remove them from their land, and that gives us the *right* to remove them!</string>
<string name="44783">These blankets change nothing. We are at war here! The Uthgardt are the enemy, or did you forget that? They allied themselves with Luskan! </string>
<string name="44784">Glad we could see eye to eye on this. Now, if there&apos;s nothing else... </string>
<string name="44785">You don&apos;t really believe that, do you? You think if I hand over the cure the Elk tribe will suddenly abandon their Luskan allies? Uh... not that I have a cure on me... </string>
<string name="44786">Okay, let&apos;s not do anything crazy. You attack me and every soldier in this fort will come to the defense of their Commander. But I&apos;m a reasonable man... Tell you what, I&apos;ll sell you the cure for 3000 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="44787">Guards, help! Enemy in the compound!</string>
<string name="44788">I knew we could work this out. Here&apos;s the cure. </string>
<string name="44789">If you change your mind and decide you&apos;d rather exterminate these Uthgardt after all, just bring me back the head of their leader Zokan.  Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me I have business to attend to.</string>
<string name="44790">Can&apos;t say I blame you. I wouldn&apos;t spend my own money to save those savages either. My earlier offer still stands. You know, the one where you act like a soldier and kill our enemies instead of saving them?</string>
<string name="44791">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I guess if it means that much to you, you got yourself a deal.</string>
<string name="44792">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ll go down to 1500 but that&apos;s my final offer. Not 1200, not 1400, not 1499. 1500 or no deal, understood?</string>
<string name="44793">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s an insult! I set the price here and it&apos;s 3000 gold pieces!</string>
<string name="44794">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You drive a hard bargain, but I guess 500 is better than what I&apos;ll get if I let them all die. Okay, it&apos;s a deal. Here&apos;s the cure.</string>
<string name="44795">Grovel all you want, orc dog. It won&apos;t save your worthless hide!</string>
<string name="44796">Give me one reason I should spare you!</string>
<string name="44797">You beg, but me still kill you!</string>
<string name="44798">Why me let you live?</string>
<string name="44799">I&apos;m supposed to bring your head back for a reward.</string>
<string name="44800">Me need you head for reward.</string>
<string name="44801">Hand over all your gold and I might let you live!</string>
<string name="44802">Give gold now!</string>
<string name="44803">Where is Vaath hiding?</string>
<string name="44804">You tell where Vaath be!</string>
<string name="44805">Go on, get out of here before I change my mind!</string>
<string name="44806">Go now or me might change mind!</string>
<string name="44807">I think I&apos;m just going to kill you after all.</string>
<string name="44808">Me want kill you now.</string>
<string name="44809">Vaath is already dead!</string>
<string name="44810">Vaath be dead already!</string>
<string name="44811">Stupid &lt;race&gt; scum! Me be Guzud, mighty Orc warrior! You die now!</string>
<string name="44812">Spare me, mighty &lt;race&gt; warrior! Guzud grovels at your feet and begs for his worthless life!</string>
<string name="44813">To the death, then!</string>
<string name="44814">Guzud give you gold! And Guzud tell you where Vaath be hiding! Then Guzud go away and never come back!</string>
<string name="44815">You take other head. All orc look alike. No one know. Here, this be head of Guzud&apos;s second in command. Guzud kill him yesterday for taking extra food. You take this head and let Guzud go.</string>
<string name="44816">Guzud has lots of gold. It all for you. Take it all. Now Guzud can go?</string>
<string name="44817">Vaath make his camp in the Coldwood northeast of Guzud hideout. You let Guzud go now?</string>
<string name="44818">But you not need kill Guzud! Guzud go away and never come back! Guzud give you gold!</string>
<string name="44819">You great and merciful &lt;race&gt; warrior! Guzud go now and never come back!</string>
<string name="44820">You trick Guzud, &lt;race&gt; fool! Guzud kill you!</string>
<string name="44821">Stop! Guzud surrender! You too strong!</string>
<string name="44822">Are you surrendering?</string>
<string name="44823">You be giving up?</string>
<string name="44824">This bloodshed will only end when you are all dead!</string>
<string name="44825">Me not stop killing &apos;til no one left to kill!</string>
<string name="44826">Very well, I will speak with Zokan.</string>
<string name="44827">Okay, me speak at Zokan.</string>
<string name="44828">I&apos;m here to kill Zokan, not bargain with him!</string>
<string name="44829">Me want kill Zokan, not speak at him!</string>
<string name="44830">I have already spoken to Zokan.</string>
<string name="44831">Me talk to Zokan already.</string>
<string name="44832">Where will I find Zokan?</string>
<string name="44833">Me not know where Zokan is.</string>
<string name="44834">I&apos;ll just kill you instead.</string>
<string name="44835">Me just want kill you.</string>
<string name="44836">Who are you?</string>
<string name="44837">Who you be?</string>
<string name="44838">Please, mighty &lt;class&gt;! This slaughter of my tribe must end. We cannot stand against your strength. Let us end this bloodhsed.</string>
<string name="44839">Then may the fury of the Great Elk rain down upon your head!</string>
<string name="44840">We are weakend by plague and sickness, you will slay us all if we resist. Our chieftain Zokan Thunderer wishes a parlay. Please accept, for the sake of the people born of the Elk.</string>
<string name="44841">You will find Zokan at the center of this complex. Please, go to him now.</string>
<string name="44842">The children born of the Elk weep with sorrow. The plague ravages our people. Please, if you have not done so I beg you to parlay with Zokan Thunderer, chieftain of our tribe.</string>
<string name="44843">Then I pray you will go to Fort Ilkard as he requested. Our people&apos;s time grows short.</string>
<string name="44844">You have saved our tribe from extinction, &lt;FullName&gt;. With the cure you have brought Zokan, I have been able to heal our tribe. The Wailing Death is no more.</string>
<string name="44845">Once the children of the Elk wept, but &lt;CUSTOM201&gt; saved our people from the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="44846">For your heroism the spirit of the Elk shall walk by your side always. Thank you, &lt;FullName&gt;. We owe you everything.</string>
<string name="44847">I am Sacuna, a shaman of the tribe. Please, you are too strong. My people fall before you like the leaves before an autumn storm. Let us end this slaughter.</string>
<string name="44848">Did they hurt you?</string>
<string name="44849">Did Uthgardts hurt girlie?</string>
<string name="44850">Who are you?</string>
<string name="44851">Who you be?</string>
<string name="44852">How did the Uthgardt capture you?</string>
<string name="44853">How Uthgardts catch you?</string>
<string name="44854">Can you find your way safely out of here?</string>
<string name="44855">You get out here safe alone?</string>
<string name="44856">Anything else you can tell me?</string>
<string name="44857">What else you know?</string>
<string name="44858">It&apos;s about time someone showed up to rescue me! Who knows what those savages would have done if you had been much slower!</string>
<string name="44859">Of all the luck, I had to get rescued by a moron!</string>
<string name="44860">So far all they&apos;ve done is throw me in this cage. Probably saving me for some pagan ritual they hope will cure them of this plague that&apos;s infected their whole tribe.</string>
<string name="44861">I suppose I can find my own way out, with these savages all so sick with plague. Some rescue this turned out to be! Hmph! </string>
<string name="44862">Mother was right. It isn&apos;t safe living out on a farm. I&apos;m heading straight for Neverwinter, and you can bet I won&apos;t be leaving the city anytime soon again!</string>
<string name="44863">My name is Mileene, if you must know. Daddy left me a nice inheritance, so I thought I&apos;d buy a little farm in the countryside. Then those damn savages came and ruined everything!</string>
<string name="44864">Are you saying this is my fault? It wasn&apos;t! I was just working in my garden out on my farm when those barbarians attacked! They destroyed my home and dragged me kicking and screaming to this prison.</string>
<string name="44865">What else do you expect me to tell you? They captured me. The fact they haven&apos;t killed me yet, or worse, probably just means they&apos;re planning some horrible, unimaginable torture! Filthy savages!</string>
<string name="44866">Oh, yes, let&apos;s waste time with introductions. Don&apos;t worry about getting me safely away from here! That would be too much to ask, wouldn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="44867">Who are you?</string>
<string name="44868">Who be you?</string>
<string name="44869">How did you get captured?</string>
<string name="44870">How Uthgardts catch you?</string>
<string name="44871">Can you tell me anything about Zokan and the Uthgardt Elk tribe?</string>
<string name="44872">You tell me bout Zokan and Uthgardts.</string>
<string name="44873">Can you get away from here safely on your own?</string>
<string name="44874">You get out of here okay alone?</string>
<string name="44875">Why does he blame Damas for the plague?</string>
<string name="44876">Why he blame Damas for Elkies be sick?</string>
<string name="44877">Thanks for freeing me. I was afraid Zokan would never let me out of that cage!</string>
<string name="44878">Most of the Uthgardt are too sick with plague to even try and stop me. I&apos;ll get out of here okay. I wish I had a reward for you, but all I can do is thank you again before I go. So... thanks.</string>
<string name="44879">My name is Arden. I&apos;m a soldier with the Lords&apos; Alliance. At least I was until Zokan&apos;s people captured me.</string>
<string name="44880">I was on a scouting mission when I stumbled onto a group of Elk warriors. I was outnumbered four to one. Lucky for me they decided to show mercy and took me prisoner instead of simply killing me.</string>
<string name="44881">Wow, you&apos;re kind of slow, aren&apos;t you? Sorry, I don&apos;t mean to sound rude. You did rescue me, after all. And I was the one dumb enough to get captured by Zokan&apos;s people, not you.</string>
<string name="44882">They treated me okay, though I was a little worried about catching the plague. Seems the whole tribe is infected. Their chief, Zokan, came and spoke to me a bit. I expected some kind of violent savage, but he seemed like a reasonable man.</string>
<string name="44883">Zokan asked if I knew Commander Damas from Fort Ilkard. I don&apos;t, but it was obvious Zokan hates him. He blames Damas for the plague that&apos;s killing all the Uthgardt.</string>
<string name="44884">I don&apos;t know why Zokan hates Damas so much. You&apos;d have to ask the Uthgardt chief, I guess. Like that would happen!</string>
<string name="44885">You aren&apos;t even smart enough to say &apos;plague?&apos; Wow, I&apos;m amazed you were able to figure out how to unlock my cell. But I shouldn&apos;t insult you after you saved my ass.</string>
<string name="44886">Who are you?</string>
<string name="44887">Time stream? What in Faerun are you talking about?</string>
<string name="44888">What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="44889">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="44890">A wild mage. No wonder you&apos;re talking crazy.</string>
<string name="44891">Time stream, temporal reference... What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="44892">Are you completely insane?</string>
<string name="44893">Could you just get to the point please?</string>
<string name="44894">I can&apos;t take anymore of this. I&apos;m out of here.</string>
<string name="44895">Time travel. Right... </string>
<string name="44896">Time sink?</string>
<string name="44897">I don&apos;t really have time for this.</string>
<string name="44898">Do you know anything about this Creator Race?</string>
<string name="44899">Are the sun dials still working?</string>
<string name="44900">I&apos;m searching for a Word of Power.</string>
<string name="44901">Guardian golems?</string>
<string name="44902">Will you help me?</string>
<string name="44903">What&apos;s the task?</string>
<string name="44904">Forget it, I&apos;m not your lackey!</string>
<string name="44905"></string>
<string name="44906">Okay, I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="44907">What&apos;s in this for me?</string>
<string name="44908">Why don&apos;t you do this yourself?</string>
<string name="44909">Tell me about these guardian golems.</string>
<string name="44910">So the Word of Power is inside the ruins?</string>
<string name="44911">How do I use the sun dial?</string>
<string name="44912">Do you know anything about the Creator Race?</string>
<string name="44913">I have some questions for you.</string>
<string name="44914">Anything else?</string>
<string name="44915">Okay, I think I got it. Anything else?</string>
<string name="44916">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; If I can&apos;t bring anything back from the past I can&apos;t bring back the Word of Power from the vault, can I?</string>
<string name="44917">Let&apos;s recap what you told me last time.</string>
<string name="44918">Sounds simple.</string>
<string name="44919">What about my reward?</string>
<string name="44920">Thank you, Sapphira. You are most generous.</string>
<string name="44921">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I give you a tree that was ten thousand years in the making, and all you give me is a handful of gems?</string>
<string name="44922">You better cough up something else or you&apos;ll end up dead at the foot of this tree!</string>
<string name="44923">Tell again what you tell before.</string>
<string name="44924">Who you be?</string>
<string name="44925">What be time stream?</string>
<string name="44926">What you do here?</string>
<string name="44927">Me look for Power Word.</string>
<string name="44928">Me go now.</string>
<string name="44929">Me want reward.</string>
<string name="44930">Me thank you.</string>
<string name="44931">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me want more! Me give big old tree. Old, old, old tree!</string>
<string name="44932">Give more or me stomp you!</string>
<string name="44933">Wild mage? No wonder you crazy!</string>
<string name="44934">Time stream? Temp... &apos;ral revnance? Me no get it.</string>
<string name="44935">Me not want listen no more. Me go now.</string>
<string name="44936">You be crazy, me think.</string>
<string name="44937">You boring. Hurry up.</string>
<string name="44938">Me not got time for this.</string>
<string name="44939">What you know &apos;bout Creator Race?</string>
<string name="44940">Is sun dials still working?</string>
<string name="44941"></string>
<string name="44942">What be task?</string>
<string name="44943">You not boss of me! Me no do this!</string>
<string name="44944">Me do it!</string>
<string name="44945">What me get if me do this?</string>
<string name="44946">Why you no do this yourself?</string>
<string name="44947">Tell me &apos;bout golems.</string>
<string name="44948">Power Word be inside crumbly buildings?</string>
<string name="44949">What you know &apos;bout Creator Race?</string>
<string name="44950">How me use sun dial?</string>
<string name="44951">You need tell more at me?</string>
<string name="44952">Okay, me get it.</string>
<string name="44953">Golems?</string>
<string name="44954">You be help me?</string>
<string name="44955">What? Who? Oh, pardon me. I didn&apos;t notice you there. I was rather engrossed in my contemplations of the time stream. It&apos;s easy to get lost in their paradoxical currents, if I do say so myself.</string>
<string name="44956">Don&apos;t you remember me? Oh, wait... maybe we haven&apos;t met yet. It&apos;s hard to keep things straight without a linear temporal reference in the time stream. No matter. I am Sapphira the Wild Mage.</string>
<string name="44957">I suppose I should start at the beginning. Ha-ha. Get it: the beginning? A little time travel joke. In a recursively accessible time stream a begining, by definition, cannot exist! Now do you see what&apos;s so funny? No? Nevermind. </string>
<string name="44958">Don&apos;t go jumping to conclusions. Just because I&apos;m a wild mage and the Realms foremost leading expert on time travel does not mean I am insane. You are simply too blind to see the reason of my words!</string>
<string name="44959">I&apos;m sorry. I sometimes forget temporal displacement is a confusing subject. Let me explain. I will try to keep this brief and simple.</string>
<string name="44960">I have already told you my purpose here... or will tell you. It amounts to the same thing when all is said and done I suppose. When you travel the time stream cause meets effect meets cause ad nauseum.</string>
<string name="44961">Well then, goodbye. We shall meet again soon... or is it that we already met in the past? It&apos;s so hard to keep this stuff straight.</string>
<string name="44962">I am a researcher in fluid temporality... time travel, if you will. That is why I am here in these ruins. Because they were built on a time sink.</string>
<string name="44963">You scoff, but subjective temporality is a fact. Time travel&apos;s not easy, you understand. And backward is much simpler than forward. But it is possible, on a time sink.</string>
<string name="44964">A time sink is an area where it is possible to tap into the time stream and travel backwards in time... though not forwards, unless you are returning to the temporal reality you started from.</string>
<string name="44965">Of course such a thing is not easily accomplished. It requires old and powerful magic. Fortunately, the Creator Race has already done the hard work for us by building the sun dials.</string>
<string name="44966">They were a brutal people, enslaving the other races with their powerful magic. Physically the Creator Race resemble the lizard people of our own time. I have seen them when using the sun dials to travel to the past. </string>
<string name="44967">They are, if you know how to use them. I could teach you how to travel back to the ancient past, when these ruins were still being built. But you have to perform a task for me. </string>
<string name="44968">I already told you that I think the Word of Power you seek is inside the ruins of this vault! Oh, wait, maybe I didn&apos;t already tell you. Have we met before, or are we going to meet in the future? Nevermind, it doesn&apos;t really matter.</string>
<string name="44969">What I told you... or will tell you when we meet later in the time stream... is that you won&apos;t get that Word without my help. Not with those guardian golems in the way. </string>
<string name="44970">Powerful constructs virtually immune to all physical and magical damage, all but indestructible. They patrol the ruins of the vault, but I know a way to avoid them.</string>
<string name="44971">I could be of assistance to you, provided you will do something for me.</string>
<string name="44972">I need the fruit of the rare Ultarg tree. I have the seeds, but the tree only bears fruit every ten thousand years or so. What I need you to do is use the time sink to go back in time and plant the tree for me.</string>
<string name="44973"></string>
<string name="44974">According to my research, the only place you can safely plant the seeds and have the tree bear fruit is beneath the red warding rune painted on the soil of this garden. Plant the tree in the past, and I&apos;ll be waiting here in the present to harvest the fruit.</string>
<string name="44975">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll see you are well paid for your troubles. I&apos;ve made a fortune in gambling over the years. Plus, using the sun dial to go back to the age of the Creator Race will send you to a time before the guardian golems were created.</string>
<string name="44976">I&apos;ve had enough run-ins with that lizard-like Creator Race to last me an eternity! Ha! Eternity! Get it? That&apos;s a little time travel joke! Oh, nevermind. Point is, it&apos;s dangerous back there in the past. </string>
<string name="44977">I&apos;m not about to risk it myself but if some brave adventurer wanted to go back there for me... </string>
<string name="44978">You could go back into the past and maybe find a way to weaken the golems so you could get to the Word of Power you mentioned at our last meeting... or maybe you mention it at our next meeting. It&apos;s hard to keep everything straight.</string>
<string name="44979">Didn&apos;t we already go over this at our next meeting? The vault at the heart of the complex is protected by several golems that are immune to all physical and magical attacks.</string>
<string name="44980">To beat them you&apos;ll have to use the sun dials to go back into the past before the golems were created and find a way to weaken them. That&apos;s the only way you&apos;ll get to the Word of Power in the center of this vault.</string>
<string name="44981">They were a brutal people, enslaving the other races with their powerful magic. Physically the Creator Race resemble the lizardfolk of our own time. I have seen them occasionally when using the sun dials to travel to the past. </string>
<string name="44982">As far as my research shows. There&apos;s a vault at the center of the complex. But you won&apos;t get past those guardian golems without using the sun dial to go back to the time of the Creator race. </string>
<string name="44983">I&apos;ve actually got a notebook that explains it all. It&apos;s pretty simple. Here, take the notebook. And these Ultarg tree seeds you promised to plant. Oh, and you&apos;ll need this time crystal. The time crystals are magic items with a special use.</string>
<string name="44984">Just use the special property of the time crystal and target the effect on the sun dial and you&apos;ll be sucked back to a time when these ruins were still being built. When you want to come back, just use the crystal again on the sun dial and you&apos;ll be transported back to the present age.</string>
<string name="44985">Just remember the rules. They&apos;re all in that notebook in case you forget. One: the area of the time sink only extends the length of the ruins. You won&apos;t be able to leave the vault complex while you are back in the past.</string>
<string name="44986">Two: you can&apos;t bring any items of power from the past back with you. When you come forward they will be left behind. Take only memories and leave only footprints, right? That&apos;s a little time travel joke. Get it? Nevermind.</string>
<string name="44987">The sun dials will take you to a time before this complex was completed - the Word of Power isn&apos;t even in there. Going back into the past won&apos;t help you get the Word.</string>
<string name="44988">Maybe you could find some way to weaken the golems in the past, then come back to the future and defeat them so you could break into the vault. Just a suggestion.</string>
<string name="44989">Remember to plant the Ultarg tree seeds in this spot. Anywhere else and they won&apos;t grow. Then come back to the future and speak to me and I&apos;ll give you your reward. I guess that&apos;s it, unless you have more questions.</string>
<string name="44990">Ah, you are back - or is this our first meeting? Temporal instability in the time stream makes introductions difficult, doesn&apos;t it? Is there a problem? Do you need me to refresh your memory of our last meeting - or is that our next meeting?</string>
<string name="44991">I need you to travel into the ancient past to plant the seeds of the Ultarg tree. Plant them in this location in the past so that when the tree bears fruit at the end of its ten thousand year lifespan I can harvest them.</string>
<string name="44992">Oh, hello - I didn&apos;t see you there. I was too busy studying this amazing tree. Remarkable, isn&apos;t it? Ten thousand years to produce a single fruit, and then it dies.</string>
<string name="44993">Only a few more days until the Ultarg fruit blossoms, and I can&apos;t afford to miss my chance. Lucky for me I found someone willing to slip through the time stream and plant these seeds for me.</string>
<string name="44994">They are, but you need a time crystal to use them. I&apos;m afraid I don&apos;t have any time crystals to spare or I&apos;d give you one myself.</string>
<string name="44995">Just remember the rules of time travel. One: you can&apos;t leave the area of the time sink. Physically impossible, which means you won&apos;t be able to leave the vault complex once you are in the past.</string>
<string name="44996">Two: you can&apos;t bring any items of power back from the past into the present. When you return only the stuff you brought with you in the first place and mundane items can make the trip home with you.</string>
<string name="44997">That&apos;s what you said at our next meeting! Anyway, that&apos;s about all I can tell you about time travel. Anything else you want to know?</string>
<string name="44998">Well, I hope you find it. As for me, I&apos;m just going to wait here for a few days. It&apos;s taken this Ultarg tree ten thousand years to get to this stage, and I can&apos;t afford to miss my chance when the fruit blossoms.</string>
<string name="44999">Waiting for the tree to blossom and drop its fruit. It might take another week, maybe even a month. But this chance only comes once every ten thousand years. I can&apos;t afford to miss it. </string>
<string name="45000">Greetings, &lt;FullName&gt; - once more I must thank you for planting the Ultarg seed trees for me. Or is this the first time I am thanking you? No matter - I am grateful in any case.</string>
<string name="45001">Have I not given it to you yet? No... I suppose I haven&apos;t, or you wouldn&apos;t be asking now, would you? What to give, what to give? Ah, I know!</string>
<string name="45002">Take these gems with my blessing. Though your own sparkling beauty might draw attention from their glitter, I imagine you will still find them most valuable.</string>
<string name="45003">I think these gems will make a suitable reward. They say they can add sparkle to your personality.</string>
<string name="45004">Perhaps these gems will be a suitable reward. Their beauty may offset your ugliness. Oh! Uh, what I meant was... well, let&apos;s face it, you are rather unattractive. </string>
<string name="45005">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, I suppose I could afford something else. After all, you did risk capture by those scaly slavers in the past to plant this tree for me. </string>
<string name="45006">I don&apos;t have much else on me, except for this scroll. You can have it, I suppose. There&apos;s nothing else I can give you.</string>
<string name="45007">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; True enough but those gems were a thousand centuries in the making, weren&apos;t they? I think we are even, &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="45008">Obviously you have no concept of existence across multiple temporal realities. As long as I remain in this place and this time period I am eternal and, in effect, immortal. You can&apos;t hurt me, so your threats have no meaning.</string>
<string name="45009">Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;, until we meet again for the first time. Ha! Another time travel joke! Or maybe I haven&apos;t told any yet...</string>
<string name="45010"></string>
<string name="45011">You are rather thick, aren&apos;t you? Let me see if I can explain this so you will understand.</string>
<string name="45012">This is a confusing subject, particularly for one as dull as you. Wipe the drool from your chin and I will try to explain it as simply and quickly as I can.</string>
<string name="45013"></string>
<string name="45014">A simple errand. Well, simple for normal people. You might find it a little above your mental faculties to comprehend but I can&apos;t really be picky at this point.</string>
<string name="45015">Do you know how to read? Hmmm.... you seem dim, but hopefully not that dim. I think you&apos;ll muddle through somehow.</string>
<string name="45016">What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="45017">Why you here?</string>
<string name="45018">The Elk tribe has allied with Luskan and is now the enemy of Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="45019">You Elk! You hate Neverwinter! You friend with Luskan!</string>
<string name="45020">I could use some healing.</string>
<string name="45021">Me want heal.</string>
<string name="45022">I don&apos;t need anything. You are free to go, if you wish.</string>
<string name="45023">Me not need nothing. You go now if you want.</string>
<string name="45024">This isn&apos;t a rescue, Elk boy! Time for you to die!</string>
<string name="45025">Me not save you. Me kill you!</string>
<string name="45026">Why would Guzud capture you when the Elk tribe and Luskan are allies?</string>
<string name="45027">Why Guzud catch you when Elkies and Luskan be friends?</string>
<string name="45028">Zokan Thunderer is dead, the Elk tribe is no more.</string>
<string name="45029">Zokan be dead. Elk tribe go bye-bye.</string>
<string name="45030">Reasons don&apos;t matter. You are an Elk, enemy of Neverwinter. You must die!</string>
<string name="45031">Me no care why. You be Elk, me kill all Elkies!</string>
<string name="45032">Maybe I could find a way to cure the Elk tribe of the plague.</string>
<string name="45033">Elkies be sick. Maybe me help Elkies get better.</string>
<string name="45034">I am Uncas, a shaman of the Uthgardt Elk tribe. Thank you for saving me. I have many curative powers that are at your disposal. Are you in need of healing?</string>
<string name="45035">I shall return to my tribe, the people of the Elk. Thank you once more for saving me.</string>
<string name="45036">I shall use all my medicinal knowledge to heal you as best I may.</string>
<string name="45037">I, Uncas of the Uthgardt Elk tribe, owe you my life. Is there anything else I can do to repay you for saving me?</string>
<string name="45038">May the strength of the Elk empower my spells!</string>
<string name="45039">My people, the tribe of the Elk, were afflicted with the terrible plague that swept Neverwinter. My chief, Zokan Thunderer, sent me to try and find a cure.</string>
<string name="45040">But I was captured by Guzud and his band of orc raiders. This was many weeks ago, I have not seen the light of day since. Is there some way I can repay you for rescuing me?</string>
<string name="45041">The Elk tribe is no ally of Luskan! At least, it was not so when I left. But I have been gone a long time.</string>
<string name="45042">But Zokan would never join with the evil of Luskan. Unless... maybe Luskan offered a cure for the plague that ravishes my people. Perhaps in desperation Zokan joined them to save the tribe.</string>
<string name="45043">No, it cannot be! My tribe, my people, they are all dead? How could such a thing happen?</string>
<string name="45044">Please, I must leave at once. Their spirits wander the wastelands of the other world, I must appease the gods so my tribe may find rest. Forgive me, but for the sake of my people I must leave immediately.</string>
<string name="45045">You should speak to Zokan. If he has formed an alliance with Luskan, however, the Elk warriors will attack you on sight.</string>
<string name="45046">Take this feather token. When the guard at the Elk tribe fort sees it on your person, he will know you come under a banner of peace. He will let you in to talk to Zokan and you can avoid needless bloodshed. </string>
<string name="45047">Where are the Uthgardt now?</string>
<string name="45048">How did you survive the attack?</string>
<string name="45049">Are you hurt? Is there anything I can do to help?</string>
<string name="45050">Where Uthgardts go?</string>
<string name="45051">How you not dead?</string>
<string name="45052">You be hurt? Me need help you?</string>
<string name="45053">Please, help us! The Uthgardt attacked our caravan!</string>
<string name="45054">We heard their war cries and we were able to run off before they found us. But we had to leave our wagons behind and they looted our goods. </string>
<string name="45055">We need someone to help us repair our caravan.... OH NO!!! The Uthgardt are back! Run for your life!</string>
<string name="45056">Thank you for saving us from those savages! Forget about the caravan, I&apos;m getting out of here!</string>
<string name="45057">I wish to speak to your chieftain, Zokan Thunderer.</string>
<string name="45058">Me want speak at you chief Zokan.</string>
<string name="45059">The only thing I want to negotiate is your death!</string>
<string name="45060">Me no want &apos;notiate! Me want kill Uthgardts!</string>
<string name="45061"></string>
<string name="45062"></string>
<string name="45063"></string>
<string name="45064"></string>
<string name="45065">You come bearing an Uthgardt token of peace. Do you wish to negotiate with the people of the Elk?</string>
<string name="45066">Taste the fury of the Uthgardt Elk tribe!</string>
<string name="45067">Follow me. I will take you to Zokan.</string>
<string name="45068">You have come under a banner of peace and you look like a noble and trustworthy &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="45069"></string>
<string name="45070"></string>
<string name="45071"></string>
<string name="45072"></string>
<string name="45073"></string>
<string name="45074">You are a great hero, &lt;FullName&gt;! Through every generation the legend of how you saved the Elk people from the Wailing Death shall be retold.</string>
<string name="45075">Our tribe is saved! &lt;CUSTOM201&gt; has cured the people of the Elk from the Wailing Death!</string>
<string name="45076">I bow to no one! I am no slave!</string>
<string name="45077">Me bow for no one! Me not no slave!</string>
<string name="45078">Die, Morag!</string>
<string name="45079">I meant no offense, Mistress. I only wanted to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="45080">Me sorry, Mistress. Me me just want ask you stuff.</string>
<string name="45081">I am &lt;FullName&gt;. I have come from the far distant future.</string>
<string name="45082">Me am &lt;FullName&gt;! Me come from future.</string>
<string name="45083">I&apos;ll be the one who asks the questions around here!</string>
<string name="45084">Me be one who asks questions, not you!</string>
<string name="45085">What is this place?</string>
<string name="45086">What this place be?</string>
<string name="45087">How can we understand each other?</string>
<string name="45088">How come me understand you?</string>
<string name="45089">I want to know more about you, Morag.</string>
<string name="45090">Me want know more about you, Morag.</string>
<string name="45091">Do you know anything about the Words of Power?</string>
<string name="45092">You know stuff &apos;bout Power Words?</string>
<string name="45093">What manner of slave are you, that does not cast down &lt;his/her&gt; eyes in my presence! (hiss) I could have you flayed for this!</string>
<string name="45094">Guards! Protect me from this creature!</string>
<string name="45095">There is something strange about you, creature. Where is your collar? (hiss) Why is your forehead not branded with the mark of the house you serve?</string>
<string name="45096">Do you not recognize me? I am Morag, First Daughter of the Queen and heir to the throne! (hiss) How dare you approach me?</string>
<string name="45097">Your mistress should have removed your tongue for such defiance! (hiss) But wait... </string>
<string name="45098">Your clothes and appearance are unknown to me. (hiss) You are no slave! Who are you, creature?</string>
<string name="45099">Of course, the time sink! (hiss) This is not the world you know, creature. The secrets of the Creator Race are not yours for the taking.</string>
<string name="45100">You are arrogant, when you should tremble before the terrible power of the Creator Race. (hiss) How can this be? Unless... </string>
<string name="45101">Guards! Slay this creature! (hiss) It must not escape back to its own time!</string>
<string name="45102">(hiss) I see your mind is simple, even for a slave. I wonder that your mistress would let you wander unsupervised.</string>
<string name="45103">I could have your tongue removed for daring to speak to me, slave. (hiss) But your brazen courage amuses me. It is rare for a slave to show such bravery.</string>
<string name="45104">This is a temple to the glory of the Creator Race! (hiss) The power and might of our people shall be housed within the heart of these walls for all eternity!</string>
<string name="45105">I shall answer your questions, creature, though if you displease me your life shall be forfeit. (hiss) What is it you wish to know, slave?</string>
<string name="45106">As a slave you need not understand more than that. (hiss) It is the will of your mistresses that you build this temple, and you will bow down to that will.</string>
<string name="45107">Has your mistress taught you nothing? (hiss) The translation amulet I wear gives you an understanding of my words.</string>
<string name="45108">(hiss) If not for the amulets we would have no use for your kind. It is the only way we can make our servants and slaves bow down to our orders.</string>
<string name="45109">I will not discuss my royal person with a mere slave. (hiss) The intrigue and political machinations of court would be lost on a lowly creature like you in any case.</string>
<string name="45110">Poison slipped into a mother&apos;s cup, an assassin&apos;s blade twisted in the belly of an elder sister, an ally betrayed by a false rumor, an infant sibling smothered in his sleep... (hiss) What could a slave know of the motivation behind such things?</string>
<string name="45111">My actions transcend mere life and death! I am of royal blood and I seek the immortality of the throne! (hiss) But your life is void of ambition. You are a slave. Your only concern is to bow to the will of your mistress.</string>
<string name="45112">How dare you speak the name of our most sacred relics? (hiss) I could have your entrails torn from your body for profaning the holy Words, slave!</string>
<string name="45113">I demand you tell me how you heard of the Words of Power! No slave must know of such things! (hiss) But wait... </string>
<string name="45114">What are you saying? I can&apos;t make out a single word!</string>
<string name="45115">I&apos;m sorry, I don&apos;t understand you.</string>
<string name="45116">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45117">What you say?</string>
<string name="45118">Huh? Me no understand.</string>
<string name="45119">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45120">I need to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="45121">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll protect you from the Mistresses!</string>
<string name="45122">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45123">Me want ask stuff.</string>
<string name="45124">No worry, me save you against Mistresses!</string>

<string name="45126">You don&apos;t have a slave collar! The Mistresses will remove my tongue if they see me speaking to you! Go away! </string>
<string name="45127">Urg idi bacaac, ad picat wab! Noba wade?</string>
<string name="45128">Moab uhtadea.</string>
<string name="45129">Speak to Lokar, our leader. He often helps escaped slaves like you, but I am not brave enough to take such a risk.</string>
<string name="45130">Don&apos;t be a fool! The Mistresses are the Creator Race! Beside them we humans are nothing! </string>
<string name="45131">Don&apos;t be a fool! The Mistresses are of the Creator Race! Beside them &lt;race&gt; kind is nothing!</string>
<string name="45132">Aiding an escaped slave is punishable by death! I can&apos;t be seen with you!</string>
<string name="45133">I don&apos;t what manner of creature you are! You aren&apos;t human, and you don&apos;t look like any dwarf or elf I&apos;ve ever seen. But the Mistresses are the Creator Race! Beside them your kind is nothing!</string>
<string name="45134">Who are you?</string>
<string name="45135">Who you be?</string>
<string name="45136">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="45137">Me want ask question.</string>
<string name="45138">Why are you helping me?</string>
<string name="45139">Why you help me?</string>
<string name="45140">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45141">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45142">I&apos;m sorry, I don&apos;t understand you.</string>
<string name="45143">Me no understand.</string>
<string name="45144">What are you trying to say?</string>
<string name="45145">Huh?</string>
<string name="45146">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45147">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45148">I am no escaped slave! I am a visitor from the distant future.</string>
<string name="45149">Me not slave. Me come time travel from future!</string>
<string name="45150">Me not crazy! Me am from future!</string>
<string name="45151">I&apos;m not crazy! I really am from the future.</string>
<string name="45152">What can you tell me about the Creator Race?</string>
<string name="45153">What you know &apos;bout Creator Race?</string>
<string name="45154">What is this place you are building?</string>
<string name="45155">What you build here?</string>
<string name="45156">I am searching for one of the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="45157">Me look for Power Word.</string>
<string name="45158">Can you tell me anything else about this vault?</string>
<string name="45159">You know more &apos;bout vault?</string>
<string name="45160">What was that you said about magical wards?</string>
<string name="45161">What you say &apos;bout magic wards?</string>
<string name="45162">Do you know some way I can get into the vault?</string>
<string name="45163">You know how me get into vault?</string>
<string name="45164">Thank you for your help. I will be going now.</string>
<string name="45165">Me thank you for help. Me go now.</string>
<string name="45166">You must be careful! I will help you if I can, but if the Masters see us speaking they will cut out my tongue.</string>
<string name="45167">Ulak sabba por! Poad hisa ul pathcea fea gal!</string>
<string name="45168">Jula va pekito. Rawa asagus.</string>
<string name="45169">I am Lokar, leader of the slaves. I often help those who have escaped the chains of the Creator Race, as you have obviously done.</string>
<string name="45170">I wish there was more I could do for you. Every slave that escapes is a victory for our people and a blow against the tyranny of the Creator Race. May luck be with you.</string>
<string name="45171">Of course, I understand now. You are simple-minded. It&apos;s probably from the beatings of your cruel Mistress. No wonder you have risked your very life to escape.</string>
<string name="45172">Of course, I understand now. You have lost your mind, probably from the beatings of your cruel Mistress. No wonder you have risked everything to escape.</string>
<string name="45173">I admit your appearance is strange to me, but the Mistresses&apos; empire extends to distant, exotic lands. Often they bring back slaves of races and cultures never before seen in this part of the world.</string>
<string name="45174">I find it far more likely you are one of these than a visitor from the future. But I do not wish to upset you. If you claim to be from a distant time, I will not dispute it. I only want to help you.</string>
<string name="45175">You have returned. Is there something else you wish to know about the vault we are building or the magical wards protecting it?</string>
<string name="45176">I will tell you what I can, if it will help against the Creator Race that enslaves us.</string>
<string name="45177">I can tell you only what is common knowledge. The Lizard People rule the world with a terrible scaled fist. They enslave us lesser races, forcing us to serve the reptilian Mistresses until our deaths.</string>
<string name="45178">They are savage and cruel, and care nothing for those that serve them. Many slaves have perished during the building of this complex beneath the lashes of the Mistresses. I am afraid that is all I know of the Creator Race.</string>
<string name="45179">The Mistresses are forcing us to build a great fortress complex. At its heart we are constructing an enormous vault that will be protected by various magical wards once it is complete - though what our Masters plan to place inside the vault I cannot say.</string>
<string name="45180">I am sorry, I have not heard of such a thing. But I am only a slave, born into servitude. My knowledge is limited to what the Mistresses tell me. This Word may indeed be here. </string>
<string name="45181">I am afraid I cannot tell you much more about the vault as I have not worked on it myself. There are other slaves who are more involved in the construction of the central vault. If you find them, perhaps they will have answers I do not.</string>
<string name="45182">Take this ring before you go. Show it to the other slaves in the complex, and they will be more willing to risk themselves to help you. </string>
<string name="45183">Right now the vault is unguarded and empty - you could enter it if you wish. But once this complex is complete the vault will be sealed by the power of three magical wards.</string>
<string name="45184">I do not know much about the magical wards, but I suspect that once they are activated it will be impossible to enter the vault without first deactivating them. Is there anything else I can tell you?</string>
<string name="45185">Who are you?</string>
<string name="45186">Who you be?</string>
<string name="45187">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="45188">Me want ask question.</string>
<string name="45189">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45190">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45191">I&apos;m sorry, I don&apos;t understand you.</string>

<string name="45210">Me thank you for help. Me go now.</string>
<string name="45211">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to fire instead.</string>

<string name="45220">Me want know more about vault and golems.</string>
<string name="45221">Is there any way I could convince you not to finish building the golem?</string>
<string name="45222">You no finish golem.</string>
<string name="45223">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I could free you from your enslavement.</string>
<string name="45224">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I could give you gold. Lots of it!</string>
<string name="45225">Here is Lokar&apos;s ring. He said you would help me.</string>
<string name="45226"></string>
<string name="45227">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me help you escape!</string>
<string name="45228">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me give you big gold.</string>
<string name="45229">Me got Lokar ring. Him say you help.</string>
<string name="45230"></string>
<string name="45231">Please, if you help me it will strike a great blow against the tyranny of the Creator Race that has enslaved you.</string>
<string name="45232">You help me and it be bad for lizard folk who make you slave.</string>
<string name="45233">Fire.</string>
<string name="45234">Cold.</string>
<string name="45235">Blunt weapons.</string>
<string name="45236">Slashing and piercing weapons.</string>
<string name="45237">I am not an escaped slave! I am visitor from the distant future.</string>
<string name="45238">Me not slave! Me come from future!</string>
<string name="45239">You cannot be here! If the Mistresses catch an escaped slave in the golem room they will kill us both!</string>

<string name="45243">Be careful! If the Mistresses catch you, all of the slaves will be beaten as punishment... or worse!</string>
<string name="45244">Do not worry, we will make the Golem vulnerable to fire as you have asked us.</string>
<string name="45245">I will tell you what you I can, but then you must go! I cannot risk you being caught in here!</string>
<string name="45246">I can tell you only what is common knowledge. The Lizard People rule the world with a terrible scaled fist. They enslave us lesser races, forcing us to serve the reptilian Mistresses until our deaths.</string>

<string name="45248">The Mistresses are forcing us to build a great vault. When finished it will be protected by magical wards of smoke, light and sound, as well as the golem guardians I am working on.</string>
<string name="45249">I am sorry, I have not heard of such a thing. But I am only a slave, born into servitude. My knowledge is limited to what the Mistresses tell me. Is there anything else you wish to know?</string>
<string name="45250">When complete, the vault will be protected by three indestructible guardians: golems immune to all physical and magical attacks. My task is to complete the creation of one of these golems.</string>
<string name="45251">Once complete the vault will be protected by three wards, one each of smoke, light and sound. Once activated, each of the wards can only be deactivated from a different room within the complex where the mechanisms that power the individual wards are to be located. </string>
<string name="45252">I do not know the secret to deactivating the wards once they are finished, but I imagine you would have to solve the riddles of smoke, light and sound to gain entry once the wards are in place. And once my work here is complete, the golems will have to be vanquished as well.</string>
<string name="45253">Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to cold as you have asked us.</string>
<string name="45254">Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to blunt weapons as you have asked us.</string>
<string name="45255">Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to slashing and piercing weapons as you have asked us.</string>
<string name="45256">We shall do as you wish. Is there anything else you require of us?</string>
<string name="45257">The Mistresses have not told me what the vault will protect. Until the magical wards are crafted to guard the vault, it lies empty and unguarded. Anyone can enter, though they would risk capture by the Masters.</string>
<string name="45258">If I do not complete the golem the Mistresses will torture me until I beg for death... and then they will grant it to me in gruesome fashion.</string>
<string name="45259"></string>
<string name="45260">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Where would I go? The lizard people rule the entire world! I would be a fugitive forever on the run, knowing a horrible fate awaits if I am captured.</string>
<string name="45261">I am a high ranking, privileged slave. I am given private quarters and bountiful food. I am allowed to choose a mate and I am rarely beaten. Your offer is nothing compared to that.</string>
<string name="45262">Why did you not say so earlier? If Lokar sent you, your mission must be one of great importance to the fate of all those enslaved by the Creator Race!</string>
<string name="45263">If I do not build the golem the Mistresses will know I have aided you. But it might be possible for me to construct the golem with a single subtle flaw they will not detect. This will give the golem one fatal vulnerability. </string>
<string name="45264">There is something strange about you. You seem more than an escaped slave. Perhaps you speak the truth. If I aid you I am taking a terrible risk but it would be worth it if you could truly strike a blow against the Mistresses. </string>
<string name="45265">I am sorry, but the risk is too great. I will not help you and if you kill me they will simply find another slave to replace me. The golem will be built regardless. There is nothing you can say to persuade me.</string>
<string name="45266">What use would gold serve me? I am not allowed property, I cannot buy anything with it. If the Mistresses find it they will take it and no doubt whip me for being a thief.</string>
<string name="45267">I can only introduce one flaw. Should I introduce more, the Mistresses will surely notice. Would you rather I make the golem vulnerable to fire, cold, blunt weapons or slashing and piercing weapons?</string>
<string name="45268">I shall do as you have asked. However, my change will only affect the golem I am working on. There are other golems, but you would have to speak to the slaves building them or they will be invulnerable. </string>
<string name="45269">The Mistresses will not care who or what you claim to be! You are not of the Creator Race and they will destroy you if they catch you here!</string>
<string name="45270">I am one of the slaves the Mistresses have commanded to create golems. When finished, the golems will be indestructible guardians of the vault.</string>

<string name="45376">Me look for Power Word.</string>
<string name="45377">What can you tell me about these golem guardians?</string>
<string name="45378">You know more &apos;bout golems?</string>
<string name="45379">What was that you said about magical wards?</string>
<string name="45380">What you say &apos;bout magic wards?</string>

<string name="45383">Thank you for your help. I will be going now.</string>
<string name="45384">Me thank you for help. Me go now.</string>
<string name="45385">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to fire instead.</string>
<string name="45386">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to cold instead.</string>
<string name="45387">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to blunt weapons instead.</string>
<string name="45388">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to slashing and piercing weapons.</string>
<string name="45389">Me change mind. Make golem hurt by cold now, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="45390">Me change mind. Make golem hurt by blunt weapons now, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="45391">Me change mind. Make golem hurt by slashing &apos;n&apos; piercing weapons now, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="45392">Me change mind. Make golem hurt by fire now, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="45393">Tell me more about this vault and these golems.</string>
<string name="45394">Me want know more about vault and golems.</string>
<string name="45395">Is there any way I could convince you not to finish building the golem?</string>
<string name="45396">You no finish golem.</string>
<string name="45397">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I could free you from your enslavement.</string>
<string name="45398">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I could give you gold. Lots of it!</string>
<string name="45399">Here is Lokar&apos;s ring. He said you would help me.</string>
<string name="45400"></string>
<string name="45401">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me help you escape!</string>
<string name="45402">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me give you big gold.</string>
<string name="45403">Me got Lokar ring. Him say you help.</string>
<string name="45404"></string>
<string name="45405">Please, if you help me it will strike a great blow against the tyranny of the Creator Race that has enslaved you.</string>
<string name="45406">You help me it be bad for lizard folk who make you slave.</string>
<string name="45407">Fire.</string>
<string name="45408">Cold.</string>
<string name="45409">Blunt weapons.</string>
<string name="45410">Slashing and piercing weapons.</string>
<string name="45411">I am not an escaped slave! I am visitor from the distant future.</string>
<string name="45412">Me not slave! Me come from future!</string>
<string name="45413">You cannot be here! If the Mistresses catch an escaped slave in the golem room they will kill us both!</string>
<string name="45414">Ulak sabba por! Poad hisa ul pathcea fea gal!</string>
<string name="45415">Jula va pekito. Rawa asagus.</string>
<string name="45416">It is forbidden for me to have contact with the other slaves on pain of death. That is why you should not be here!</string>
<string name="45417">Be careful! If the Mistresses catch you, all of the slaves will be beaten as punishment... or worse!</string>
<string name="45418">Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to fire as you have asked us.</string>
<string name="45419">I will tell you what you I can, but then you must go! I cannot risk you being caught in here!</string>
<string name="45420">I can tell you only what is common knowledge. The Lizard People rule the world with a terrible scaled fist. They enslave us lesser races, forcing us to serve the reptilian Mistresses until our deaths.</string>
<string name="45421">They are savage and cruel, and care nothing for those that serve them. Many slaves have perished during the building of this complex beneath the lashes of the Mistresses. I am afraid that is all I know of the Creator Race.</string>
<string name="45422">The Mistresses are forcing us to build a great vault. When finished it will be protected by magical wards of smoke, light and sound, as well as the golem guardians I am working on.</string>
<string name="45423">I am sorry, I have not heard of such a thing. But I am only a slave, born into servitude. My knowledge is limited to what the Mistresses tell me. Is there anything else you wish to know?</string>
<string name="45424">When complete, the vault will be protected by three indestructible golems, immune to all physical and magical attacks. My task is to complete the creation of one of these golems.</string>
<string name="45425">Once complete the vault will be protected by three wards, one each of smoke, light and sound. Once activated, each of the wards can only be deactivated from a different room within the complex where the mechanisms that power the individual wards are to be located.</string>
<string name="45426">I do not know the secret to deactivating the wards once they are finished, but I imagine you would have to solve the riddles of smoke, light and sound to gain entry once the wards are in place. And once my work here is complete, the golems will have to be vanquished as well.</string>
<string name="45427">Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to cold as you have asked us.</string>
<string name="45428">Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to blunt weapons as you have asked us.</string>
<string name="45429">Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to slashing and piercing weapons as you have asked us.</string>
<string name="45430">We shall do as you wish. Is there anything else you require of us?</string>
<string name="45431">The Mistresses have not told me what the vault will protect. Until the magical wards are crafted to guard the vault, it lies empty and unguarded. Anyone can enter, though they would risk capture by the Masters.</string>
<string name="45432">If I do not complete the golem the Mistresses will torture me until I beg for death... and then they will grant it to me in gruesome fashion.</string>
<string name="45433"></string>
<string name="45434">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Where would I go? The lizard people rule the entire world! I would be a fugitive forever on the run, knowing a horrible fate awaits if I am captured.</string>
<string name="45435">I am a high ranking, privileged slave. I am given private quarters and bountiful food. I am allowed to choose a mate and I am rarely beaten. Your offer is nothing compared to that.</string>
<string name="45436">Why did you not say so earlier? If Lokar sent you, your mission must be one of great importance to the fate of all those enslaved by the Creator Race!</string>
<string name="45437">If I do not build the golem the Masters will know I have aided you. But it might be possible for me to construct the golem with a single subtle flaw they will not detect. This will give the golem one fatal vulnerability. </string>
<string name="45438">There is something strange about you. You seem more than an escaped slave. Perhaps you speak the truth. If I aid you I am taking a terrible risk but it would be worth it if you could truly strike a blow against the Mistrisses. </string>
<string name="45439">I am sorry, but the risk is too great. I will not help you and if you kill me they will simply find another slave to replace me. Regardless, the golem will be built. There is nothing you can say or do to persuade me.</string>
<string name="45440">What use would gold serve me? I am not allowed property, I cannot buy anything with it. If the Mistresses find it they will take it and no doubt whip me for a thief.</string>
<string name="45441">I can only introduce one flaw. Any more and the Mistresses would surely notice. Should I make the golem vulnerable to fire, cold, blunt weapons. or slashing and piercing weapons?</string>
<string name="45442">I shall do as you have asked. However, my change will only affect the golem I am working on. There are other golems, but you would have to speak to the slaves building them or they will be invulnerable. </string>
<string name="45443">The Mistresses will not care who or what you claim to be! You are not of the Creator Race. They will destroy you if they catch you here!</string>
<string name="45444">I am one of the slaves the Mistresses have commanded to create golems. When finished, the golems will be indestructible guardians of the vault.</string>
<string name="45445">Now please go before the Mistresses see you here.</string>
<string name="45446">You must speak to Zokan Thunderer. He is the leader of the tribe.</string>
<string name="45447">Our tribe is saved! &lt;CUSTOM201&gt; has cured the people of the Elk from the Wailing Death!</string>
<string name="45448">You are a great hero, &lt;FullName&gt;! Through every generation the legend of how you saved the Elk people from the Wailing Death shall be retold.</string>
<string name="45449">I am &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="45450">Me be &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="45451">My name is none of your business!</string>
<string name="45452">Me not want tell you name.</string>
<string name="45453">Time for you to die, old man!</string>
<string name="45454">Me kill you now!</string>
<string name="45455">Then I guess we&apos;re enemies!</string>
<string name="45456">Then me be enemy!</string>
<string name="45457">I have come to help you find a cure for the plague.</string>
<string name="45458">Me want help get cure for sick Elkies.</string>
<string name="45459">Yusam, Druid of the Grove, has sent me to find why you have allied with Luskan.</string>
<string name="45460">Tree-man Yusam sended me. Why you help Luskan?</string>
<string name="45461">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45462">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45463">Why has the Elk tribe allied with Luskan?</string>
<string name="45464">Why Elkies be friend with Luskan?</string>
<string name="45465">Damas? Why do you want revenge on him?</string>
<string name="45466">Damas? Why you hate him?</string>
<string name="45467">If I bring you a cure, will you break your alliance with Luskan?</string>
<string name="45468">Me get cure you no help Luskan no more, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="45469">I see I can&apos;t change your mind. Guess I&apos;ll just have to kill you!</string>
<string name="45470">You be Luskan friend. Me got kill you now.</string>
<string name="45471">I shall return once I make Damas give me the cure.</string>
<string name="45472">Me be back after me get Damas give me cure.</string>
<string name="45473">This is too much work. I think I&apos;ll just kill you now.</string>
<string name="45474">This be big work. Me no like. Me kill Uthgardts instead.</string>
<string name="45475">What kind of reward will I get for saving your people?</string>
<string name="45476">What you give me save Elkies?</string>
<string name="45477">Don&apos;t worry, Zokan. I have a cure for the plague right here. Take it to heal your people.</string>
<string name="45478">No worry, Zokan. Me got cure. You take and make Elkies not sick.</string>
<string name="45479">I have a cure for the plague, Zokan. You can have it for a price.</string>
<string name="45480">Me got cure. Me give you for right price.</string>
<string name="45481">Okay, you can have the cure for nothing. Here, take it.</string>
<string name="45482">Me sorry. Take cure for nothing.</string>
<string name="45483">Hey, no reward, no cure.</string>
<string name="45484">Give gold or me no give cure.</string>
<string name="45485">Thank you Zokan, you honor me.</string>
<string name="45486">Me like spear. You nice man.</string>
<string name="45487">That&apos;s it? I save your entire tribe and I get a lousy spear?</string>
<string name="45488">Me want more than pointy stick!</string>
<string name="45489">I am Zokan Thunderer, leader of my tribe, the people born of the Elk. Who are you that comes before me?</string>
<string name="45490">May the strength of the Elk guide my blows!</string>
<string name="45491">In names there is power. I have shared the power of my name with you, you must do the same. Only an enemy hides the power of his name.</string>
<string name="45492">May the thunder of the Elk god rain down upon his enemies!</string>
<string name="45493">Why have you come, &lt;FullName&gt;? My people wither and die, young and old alike. The Wailing Death ravages my tribe and even our strongest warriors cannot stand against it.</string>
<string name="45494">This is a place of death, &lt;FullName&gt;. Soon we shall all be infected, we have come here to die. I ask you again, why have you come to this doomed fort?</string>
<string name="45495">The Wailing Death is among my people. Men of Luskan came to me. They promised to heal my people. That is why we allied with them. But they spoke false. </string>
<string name="45496">They have no cure. My people are doomed. But now we fight with Luskan for another reason. Revenge! Revenge against the Lord&apos;s Alliance and the man they sent to command Fort Ilkard. A man called Damas.</string>
<string name="45497">The fate of my tribe is my greatest care. Cure us of the Wailing Death and the Elk tribe will no longer serve the Luskan forces. We will even forget our hatred and desire for vengeance against Commander Damas. </string>
<string name="45498">Damas is the one who has infected us with the Wailing Death. We thought him a friend, but he only wants the Elk tribe gone so he can steal our land. He offered us a gift of blankets but he had secretly infected them with the plague! </string>
<string name="45499">Damas knew how quickly the plague could spread. No doubt he has a cure in his possession in case his own people become infected. We attack Fort Ilkard to try and recover the cure Damas will not give us. </string>
<string name="45500">Damas will deny everything. You must take these blankets as proof of his crime. They are harmless now, the plague cannot spread after a few days but these blankets are what killed my people.</string>
<string name="45501">If you truly intend to help the Elk tribe, you will go to Fort Ilkard and get the plague cure from Damas. I wish you luck, &lt;FullName&gt;, for the sake of my people.</string>
<string name="45502">Then our parlay is over, though the Elk shall respect the banner of peace under which you have approached us.</string>
<string name="45503">I, Zokan Thunderer, thank you for saving my people from the Wailing Death. You are a hero to us, &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="45504">The plague that ravaged my people is no more. We of the Elk Tribe owe our lives to &lt;CUSTOM201&gt;, the one who brought us the cure.</string>
<string name="45505">As we promised when we recieved the cure, the Elk tribe is no longer allied with Luskan. We will trouble the Lord&apos;s Alliance no more.</string>
<string name="45506">I still see you have the plague blankets I gave you before. Please, take them to Damas at Fort Ilkard. Show him the proof of his crime.</string>
<string name="45507">We are children of the land, we value no gold or treasure. If you will not save us form the goodness of your heart, I have nothing I can offer to change your mind.</string>
<string name="45508">My people wither and die from the plague. If they are not cured, the name of Zokan Thunderer will be remembered as the Uthgardt chieftain who could not save his tribe from extinction.</string>
<string name="45509">You have brought the salvation of my people to this place of suffering, and now you insult our Uthgardt honor by bargaining for it? You would do well to rethink your heartless actions.</string>
<string name="45510">You are a vile &lt;man/woman&gt;! I will not bargain for the lives of my people with one such as you! You have revealed yourself to be an enemy of the Elk!</string>
<string name="45511">I thank you for this, &lt;FullName&gt;. With this cure my shamans will heal our tribe. You have saved the people of the Elk.</string>
<string name="45512">We are children of the land, we have no gold or treasure to give you. But take this spear. It is a treasure of the Elk tribe, long handed down from father to son among us. You have earned it by saving us from the terrors of the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="45513">We have nothing else to give, we are a nomadic people who care little for the treasures of your culture. But you will always have the gratitude of the Elk tribe.</string>
<string name="45514">Please, take this token to Yusam the Druid in Beorunna&apos;s Well as a promise that we will no longer join the Luskan forces against them. Go with the blessing of the Elk, &lt;FullName&gt;. </string>
<string name="45515">What will you give me if I spare you, dog?</string>
<string name="45516">Mercy? When have you ever shown mercy to your victims?</string>
<string name="45517">Get up and fight, coward, or I&apos;ll slay you where you stand!</string>
<string name="45518">Beg all you want... I&apos;m still going to kill you!</string>
<string name="45519">What you give if me let live?</string>
<string name="45520">Mercy? You not never show mercy when you kill people!</string>
<string name="45521">No surrender! Fight, coward! Fight or me kill you!</string>
<string name="45522">Me want kill you anyway.</string>
<string name="45523">I need to bring your head back to collect a bounty.</string>
<string name="45524">I will spare you if you come back as my prisoner.</string>
<string name="45525">I think I&apos;ll just kill you and take your treasure anyway.</string>
<string name="45526">Me need you head for get bounty.</string>
<string name="45527">Me not kill if Obould be me prisoner.</string>
<string name="45528">Me just kill Obould and take treasure anyway.</string>
<string name="45529">Letting you live is a crime against the thousands you have slaughtered, Obould Many-Arrows! You must die!</string>
<string name="45530">What will you give me if I spare your miserable life?</string>
<string name="45531">Wrong. Killing defenseless opponents is how I get my kicks!</string>
<string name="45532">You kill big lots of people, babies even. Me let you live, you just kill more babies! You die, Obould!</string>
<string name="45533">What you give if me let live?</string>
<string name="45534">Wrong! Me like kill when no fight back! It be fun!</string>
<string name="45535">Very well, Obould, you may go. If you ever return, I shall not be so merciful.</string>
<string name="45536">Okay, me let Obould live. But you come back, me kill you for sure!</string>
<string name="45537">You too strong a &lt;class&gt; for me! Obould Many-Arrows begs you for his life!</string>
<string name="45538">Then Obould will die with blood on his blade!</string>
<string name="45539">You too strong to fight. Obould begs for pity. You will not kill Obould if he does not fight back.</string>
<string name="45540">I give you treasure. All treasure Obould has here is for you!</string>
<string name="45541">You speak true, Obould has slain many. But you are not a butcher. You cannot kill a defenseless foe.</string>
<string name="45542">Take this head. It look like Obould. It be Obould&apos;s older brother. Him run when Obould take his throne, but Luskan found and killed him. They sent me head as gift so Obould would join Luskan forces. </string>
<string name="45543">You give this head for bounty and let Obould go. No one ever know. Obould not come back.</string>
<string name="45544">You are a great &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt; of kindness and compassion! Obould will run far, far away and never come back. Obould swears it!</string>
<string name="45545">NO! If you take Obould prisoner the Lords&apos; Alliance will chop off Obould&apos;s head! Just let Obould go. I never come back. Obould swears it!</string>
<string name="45546">You die now dog!</string>
<string name="45547">Mercy! Me surrender!</string>
<string name="45548">Who are you?</string>
<string name="45549">You had better tell me about these hill giant attacks.</string>
<string name="45550">Some of your men look hurt. Is there anything I can do to help them?</string>
<string name="45551">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45552">Who be you?</string>
<string name="45553">What you say &apos;bout giants? Tell more &apos;bout giants!</string>
<string name="45554">You friends got ouchies. You want me help?</string>
<string name="45555">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45556">Why did the hill giants attack your people?</string>
<string name="45557">Why giants come down from mountains?</string>
<string name="45558">Why have you not fled with the rest of your tribe?</string>
<string name="45559">Why you stay when you friends all go?</string>
<string name="45560">Is your tribe aligned with Luskan or with Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="45561">You Eagle tribe be friend with Luskan or Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="45562">I wish to help. What should I do?</string>
<string name="45563">What reward will you give me if I help you?</string>
<string name="45564">Me want help. What me do?</string>
<string name="45565">What me get if me help you?</string>
<string name="45566">I thank you for this gift.</string>
<string name="45567">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Are you sure that&apos;s all you can give me? Nothing else you could spare?</string>
<string name="45568">You better sweeten this pot, or you&apos;ll learn I can kill as well as heal!</string>
<string name="45569">Me thank you for gift.</string>
<string name="45570">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You got more you give? Anything?</string>
<string name="45571">Give more or me show how to kill, not heal!</string>
<string name="45572">I regret that I cannot offer you the hospitality of our tribe, for we have little in the way of supplies and we must keep them to care for those injured in the most recent hill giant attack.</string>
<string name="45573">Allow me to extend the hospitality of our tribe to you. You are welcome to rest here on this once-sacred land that has since been defiled by the attacks of the hill giants. </string>
<string name="45574">We are Uthgardt of the Eagle tribe. Once this land was ours, but when the hill giant attacks came most of our people fled to safer territory. Only the strongest Sons of the Eagle were left to guard our sacred land.</string>
<string name="45575">The giants came down from the mountain plateau to the north. They defiled the lands of our ancestors and drove off our tribe. Now only the strongest Sons of the Eagle remain to stand against them.</string>
<string name="45576">Many giants are slain in these battles, but they do not flee as they would if all they sought was the gold of the serpent&apos;s hoard. Their purpose is something more, but I cannot tell you what that may be.</string>
<string name="45577">May the soaring Eagle watch over you. I will stay here, to defend the lands of my people with my warrior brothers in case the giant raiders return.</string>
<string name="45578">These lands are sacred to the Sons of the Eagle. We who are strongest have vowed to defend the home of our ancestors to our death, that their spirits may find rest in the sacrifice of our blood.</string>
<string name="45579">The Sons of the Eagle care nothing for the wars of others. We only seek to defend our sacred lands from the attacks of the hill giants.</string>
<string name="45580">I am grateful for your offer. My power is that of the arcane, the divine healing arts are unknown to me. If you heal my warriors the Sons of the Eagle may stand against the hill giants for one more battle. </string>
<string name="45581">I am Ixaristu, Shaman of the Golden Eagle, practitioner of the arcane arts and Son of the Eagle. I am the leader of what remains of this small group of warriors. </string>
<string name="45582">I have tried to divine this information, seeking with the eyes of the eagles who soar over the mountains. I do not know what drives the giants, but I have seen them battling dragons in their lairs.</string>
<string name="45583">Some of the warriors are so injured they cannot even stand. Speak to those who lie in pain, offer to heal them. They will not ask this boon unless it is first offered. This is the way of our tribe.</string>
<string name="45584">We are a people of honor and duty. If you do this only for a reward, do not do it. The Sons of the Eagle will bear you no ill will.</string>
<string name="45585">Thank you for healing the warriors of my tribe. The Sons of the Eagle are grateful to you. We have little we can offer to show our gratitude. </string>
<string name="45586">We are warriors, we have little of the wealth your society values. All I can give you is this stone, which your people may find of some worth.</string>
<string name="45587">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; We have nothing else we can offer but our weapons and armor. But these we need to defend the land of our ancestors against the hill giant invaders.</string>
<string name="45588">We offer you this gift, and you insult us with threats? The Sons of the Eagle will not allow you to dishonor this sacred place with your greed! We will sanctify this ground with your blood!</string>
<string name="45589">Who are you?</string>
<string name="45590">You should tell me about these hill giant attacks; maybe I can help.</string>
<string name="45591">You are hurt. Here, let me heal you.</string>
<string name="45592">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45593">Who be you?</string>
<string name="45594">What you say &apos;bout giants? Tell more &apos;bout giants! Me help!</string>
<string name="45595">You gots ouchie. Me fix you.</string>
<string name="45596">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45597">Why did the hill giants attack your people?</string>
<string name="45598">Why giants fight you?</string>
<string name="45599">Why have you not fled with the rest of your tribe?</string>
<string name="45600">Why you stay when you friends all go?</string>
<string name="45601">Is your tribe aligned with Luskan or with Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="45602">You Eagle tribe be friend with Luskan or Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="45603">Forgive me but I can stand for only a short time. The Sons of the Eagle are known for their hospitality, but in the last hill giant attack I was badly injured.</string>
<string name="45604">Now that my injuries have been healed, I am ready to fight once more. This Son of the Eagle shall not fall with the next hill giant raid.</string>
<string name="45605">We are Uthgardt of the Eagle tribe. Once this land was ours, but when the hill giant attacks came most of our people fled to safer territory. Only the strongest Sons of the Eagle were left to guard our sacred land.</string>
<string name="45606">The giants came down from the mountain plateau to the north in great raiding parties, ravaging the land. They fell upon the camps of our tribe, slaughtering many before moving on.</string>
<string name="45607">You must speak to our Shaman for these answers. He sees with the eyes of eagles that soar over the mountains, he knows what we warriors do not. </string>
<string name="45608">May the soaring Eagle watch over you. I will stay here, to defend the lands of my people with my warrior brothers in case the giant raiders return.</string>
<string name="45609">These lands are sacred to the Sons of the Eagle. We who are strongest have vowed to defend the home of our ancestors to our death, that their spirits may find rest in the sacrifice of our blood.</string>
<string name="45610">The Sons of the Eagle care nothing for the wars of others. We only seek to defend our sacred lands from the attacks of the hill giants.</string>
<string name="45611">I thank you, kind &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Perhaps our Shaman has something to reward this action. I have nothing to repay you for this kindness except the blessings of a Son of the Eagle. </string>
<string name="45612">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. I am searching for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="45613">What was that you said about hill giants?</string>
<string name="45614">Great Akulatraxas, why would the hill giants be foolish enough to challenge your might? </string>
<string name="45615">Give me your treasure, wyrm, or I will slay you!</string>
<string name="45616">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45617">Me be &lt;FullName&gt;. Me look for Power Words.</string>
<string name="45618">What you say &apos;bout giants?</string>
<string name="45619">Why giants be stupid and fight big strong dragon?</string>
<string name="45620">Me want gold or me make dragon stew!</string>
<string name="45621">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45622">I have some questions you must answer.</string>
<string name="45623">Please, mighty Akulatraxas, I seek your wisdom in answering these questions I have.</string>
<string name="45624">You got to answer me questions.</string>
<string name="45625">You big smart, dragon. Me need you smart brain answer me questions.</string>
<string name="45626">You are truly a spectacular being. Are there more dragons in the area that I might gaze upon the glory of your species further?</string>
<string name="45627">In the grand scope of all your knowledge, do you know anything about the Words of Power?</string>
<string name="45628">Dragon be pretty. Is more pretty dragons nearby me can look at?</string>
<string name="45629">You know lots of stuff. You so smart. You know bout Power Words?</string>
<string name="45630">These vile raiders deserve death for daring to come after your offspring!</string>
<string name="45631">I could take care of these hill giants for you... for a price.</string>
<string name="45632">Where might I find the hill giant chief?</string>
<string name="45633">Giants who be steal pretty dragon eggs must die!</string>
<string name="45634">Me kill giants if you give gold, dragon.</string>
<string name="45635">Are you done yapping yet, you overgrown lizard? Your breath stinks like chlorine.</string>
<string name="45636">Stop talk now, lizard! Breath stink real bad-like!</string>
<string name="45637">Where be giant boss?</string>
<string name="45638">I am honored to give you the hill giant&apos;s head, mighty Akulatraxas.</string>
<string name="45639">What kind of reward will I get for bringing you this head?</string>
<string name="45640">Me happy give head at you dragon.</string>
<string name="45641">Dragon give me gold or me give dragon&apos;s head!!</string>
<string name="45642">I thank you for this generous gift, mighty Akulatraxas.</string>
<string name="45643">Great Akulatraxas, your hoard is as vast as your might. Surely the lives of your offspring are worth more than this?</string>
<string name="45644">You better dig a little deeper into that pile of gold, Akulatraxas, or your eggs might not be as safe as you think!</string>
<string name="45645">Me thank you, dragon. You big strong and give good presents!</string>
<string name="45646">You big, strong dragon with lots big gold. Me save you eggs. Maybe you give more?</string>
<string name="45647">Give more gold or me smash you eggs!</string>
<string name="45648">I don&apos;t like your attitude, dragon. I think I&apos;ll keep this head for myself.</string>
<string name="45649">Me not like you. Me keep head meself!</string>
<string name="45650">I am searching for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="45651">Me look for Words of Power.</string>
<string name="45652">Why have you come, puny one? For what reason have you sought out the cave of one greater than yourself? Why do you disturb the magnificent Akulatraxas?</string>
<string name="45653">I see you must be taught a lesson about the might of dragons, &lt;race&gt; fool! I shall slaughter you as I did the hill giants who attacked my lair!</string>
<string name="45654">If you have business elsewhere you may attend to it. Akulatraxas gives you permission to go, tiny creature.</string>
<string name="45655">Your manner is brusque, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. You should show more respect when addressing dragons... Others of my kind may not be as tolerant of your lack of etiquette but I will answer your question.</string>
<string name="45656">I have never heard of these Words of Power, and I have lived in these mountains all my life. I will continue to live here for many more, for that matter, despite the efforts of the hill giants to dislodge me.</string>
<string name="45657">The hill giants were trying to steal my eggs! The lairs of many of my kind have come under attack. Too many dragons have all been slain and their eggs taken.</string>
<string name="45658">But the hill giants are like all the lesser creatures: they are no match for a dragon of my power, even in great numbers. The raiders shall not steal my eggs, I vow this!</string>
<string name="45659">I can tell by your speech you are even less intelligent than most of your already-inferior species. Yet I shall try not to hold it against you, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;.</string>
<string name="45660">I suspect the boldness of your question is due to your limited intelligence rather than any lack of reverence for my species. Not all dragons would be so forgiving, but I will answer you. </string>
<string name="45661">You speak with the respect due a dragon. This is good, &lt;race&gt; one. Conversation is far more pleasant than the slaughter I was forced to unleash upon the hill giants who attacked my lair. Now what would you ask of me?</string>
<string name="45662">Your efforts to flatter me are clumsy, &lt;race&gt; fool. Yet I feel they are a sincere attempt to show the proper respect. I shall answer your question and not hold your stupidity against you.</string>
<string name="45663">Should your insolence continue I will destroy you as I destroyed the hill giants who were foolish enough to attack me here in my own lair! Ask your question but choose your words carefully.</string>
<string name="45664">Bargaining with a dragon in her own lair? You are as stupid as you are brave... Normally I would slay you for your insolence, but these are unusual circumstances.</string>
<string name="45665">I cannot leave my lair. I must stay to protect my eggs until they hatch. But I will not rest until the giants are no more and the head of their chief lies at my feet! </string>
<string name="45666">I would even be willing to part with some of my great hoard to secure the life of my children. Is there more I might do for you while you consider this offer, &lt;race&gt; creature?</string>
<string name="45667">The steading of the hill giant chief is on the plateau to the west. Bring me his head and you will get your reward. Now, my tiny instrument of vengeance, is there anything else?</string>
<string name="45668">There are other dragons in the area, though none so magnificent as I. Gorgotha makes her lair to the north in the Spine of the World, though I know little of her. Gold dragons are not fond of my particular breed. </string>
<string name="45669">A great brass named Scylandara also lairs in the Spine of the World, another I try to avoid for she is jealous of me. Most of the others have fled, driven off by the same hill giants who dared to attack me here in my lair!</string>
<string name="45670">Tread carefully, tiny &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. Only a fool orders about a dragon in her lair. I will forgive your lack of etiquette... this time.</string>
<string name="45671">**sniff - sniff** Akulatraxas smells blood and... something else. Something foul. **SNIFF** You have the head of the hill giant chief! Give it to me that I might see the proof of his death with my own eyes!</string>
<string name="45672">The hill giants will raid the lairs of my kind no more! By killing their chieftain you have earned my gratitude. The favor of a dragon is not given lightly. </string>
<string name="45673">We dragons are loathe to part with our treasure hoard, but you have saved my eggs and the lives of my unhatched children from the threat of further giant raids. Take this gold, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. It is a fortune by most standards.</string>
<string name="45674">You dare threaten my children, foolish &lt;race&gt; creature? Such a crime is unforgivable! Now you shall feel the wrath of Akulatraxas!</string>
<string name="45675">You are bold, &lt;male/female&gt;. A smarter creature would accept an offer of dragon&apos;s gold before the dragon changes her mind. But I like you, &lt;male/female&gt;. You amuse me, as my last few pets failed to do.</string>
<string name="45676">And what would a pet be without a collar? Take this necklace, &lt;race&gt; one. Its magic is beneath my notice, but you might find it amusing. Now, is there a reason you are still in my presence, tiny one?</string>
<string name="45677">Your manner is displeasing, creature... but I will forgive your coarse nature because of the task you have done for me. Take this necklace as a final boon, and let this matter be done.</string>
<string name="45678">In the future you might wish to speak with more respect when you address a creature far greater than yourself. Now, tiny &lt;race&gt; creature, is there a reason you still remain in my presence?</string>
<string name="45679">Tread carefully, &lt;race&gt; creature. It is not wise to expose your greed when speaking to a dragon in her lair, lest I think you plan to steal my hoard. Your reward will come in due time, once you give me the chieftain&apos;s head!</string>
<string name="45680">Foolish &lt;male/female&gt;!! You dare to deny a dragon&apos;s request in her very lair?!</string>
<string name="45681">But now I have the head of the hill giant chieftain as a trophy, and without their chief the others will not dare come after my eggs again!</string>
<string name="45682">**sniff - sniff** Akulatraxas recognizes your scent, tiny creature. Why have you returned, puny one, to disturb one far greater than yourself?</string>
<string name="45683">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I am an envoy who wishes to speak to the hill giant leader.</string>
<string name="45684">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I *am* supposed to be here. Didn&apos;t you get the message?</string>
<string name="45685">Die, you two-headed freak!</string>

<string name="45687">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me *am* s&apos;posed be here. You no get message?</string>

<string name="45692">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You go ask your chief about that message. You&apos;ll see it&apos;s true. I&apos;ll wait right here.</string>
<string name="45693">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me be speak true. You go ask chief. Him tell you. Me wait here.</string>
<string name="45694">Who be you? Only hill giants and ettins be here! You not &apos;posed be here!</string>

<string name="45698">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Me boss not like guests!</string>

<string name="45703">Hurry, go speak boss. Him not like wait.</string>
<string name="45704">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You no trick me! Me stupid me not look!</string>
<string name="45705">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Me like you looks. You be talk like me. Me think me can trust you. Go speak at boss.</string>
<string name="45706">Me gots visitor for Chief!</string>
<string name="45707">Idiot! This no visitor. This enemy!</string>
<string name="45708">No enemy! Maybe you enemy! Maybe me kill you and I be next chief-guard!</string>
<string name="45709">You are not strong enough to budge this lever.</string>
<string name="45710">Who are you?</string>
<string name="45711">How did the Hill Giants catch you?</string>
<string name="45712">Can you tell me anything about the Hill Giants?</string>
<string name="45713">I have to go now. Can you find your own way out of here?</string>
<string name="45714">Who be you?</string>
<string name="45715">How giants grab you?</string>
<string name="45716">You know stuff &apos;bout giants?</string>
<string name="45717">You be safe if me go now?</string>
<string name="45718">What would they want with dragon&apos;s eggs?</string>
<string name="45719">Klauth? Who is that?</string>
<string name="45720">What was that about a fire giant envoy?</string>
<string name="45721">Why giant want dragon eggs?</string>
<string name="45722">Klauth? Who be that?</string>
<string name="45723">What you say &apos;bout fire giant?</string>
<string name="45724">And just who are you, exactly? And why did the Hill Giants capture you?</string>
<string name="45725">Who you be? And why giants catch you?</string>
<string name="45726"></string>
<string name="45727"></string>
<string name="45728">Thank you for saving me from that butcher. He wanted to chop me up for stew!</string>
<string name="45729">I am an Uthgardt Daughter of the Eagle, a proud warrior. I shall find my own way out of this place.</string>
<string name="45730">I am an Uthgardt of the Golden Eagle tribe. The giants captured me during a raid on our camp. We fought to defend the land of our ancestors, but the giants were too many and several of us were taken prisoner.</string>
<string name="45731">I have heard my captors speaking about a fire giant envoy from Klauth who has offered to pay a great reward for any dragon&apos;s eggs the hill giants might find.</string>
<string name="45732">This I do not know. But before I was captured I had heard rumors of bands of hill giants attacking the dragons in the mountains. They must have been gathering eggs for Klauth&apos;s fire giant envoy.</string>
<string name="45733">Among my people we have heard whispers of this evil name. It is said this Klauth lives in a fortress in the Spine of the World. They say even Skrogg, the great fire giant king in the North, has sworn fealty to Klauth.</string>
<string name="45734">What manner of person this Klauth may be is not known to my people but it was Klauth who sent the fire giant envoy with his offer of gold in exchange for dragon&apos;s eggs. </string>
<string name="45735">I heard my captors speaking of a fire giant envoy serving Klauth who is staying here in the hill giant steading. He was the one who delivered Klauth&apos;s message demanding the hill giants gather unhatched dragon&apos;s eggs.</string>
<string name="45736">I shall go to rejoin my people now. Farewell, and may the soaring eagle watch over you.</string>
<string name="45737">Who are you?</string>
<string name="45738">How did the Hill Giants catch you?</string>
<string name="45739">Can you tell me anything about the Hill Giants?</string>
<string name="45740">I have to go now. Can you find your own way out of here?</string>
<string name="45741">Who be you?</string>
<string name="45742">How giants grab you?</string>
<string name="45743">You know stuff &apos;bout giants?</string>
<string name="45744">You be safe if me go now?</string>
<string name="45745">What would they want with dragon&apos;s eggs?</string>
<string name="45746">Klauth? Who is that?</string>
<string name="45747">What was that about a fire giant envoy?</string>
<string name="45748">Why giant want dragon eggs?</string>
<string name="45749">Klauth? Who be that?</string>
<string name="45750">What you say &apos;bout fire giant?</string>
<string name="45751">And just who are you, exactly? And why did the Hill Giants capture you?</string>
<string name="45752">Who you be? And why giants catch you?</string>
<string name="45753"></string>
<string name="45754"></string>
<string name="45755">Thank you for freeing me from this prison. I fear the giants were planning to use me for their stew!</string>
<string name="45756">I am an Uthgardt Son of the Eagle. Now that I am free you need not fear for my well-being.</string>
<string name="45757">I am an Uthgardt of the Golden Eagle tribe. The giants raided our camp, and though we fought bravely to defend the land of our ancestors many of us were taken prisoner. </string>
<string name="45758">I have heard my captors speaking about a fire giant envoy from Klauth who has offered to pay a great reward for any dragon&apos;s eggs the hill giants might find.</string>
<string name="45759">I cannot say. Back in my tribe I heard many rumors of hill giant raiders attacking the dragons in the mountains. They must have been gathering eggs for Klauth&apos;s fire giant envoy.</string>
<string name="45760">The name is only spoken in hushed tones among my tribe. It is said this Klauth lives in a fortress in the Spine of the World. They say even Skrogg, the great fire giant king in the North, has sworn fealty to Klauth.</string>
<string name="45761">What manner of person this Klauth may be is not known to my people but it was Klauth who sent the fire giant envoy with his offer of gold in exchange for dragon&apos;s eggs. </string>
<string name="45762">There is a fire giant envoy serving Klauth who is staying here in the hill giant steading. He was the one who delivered Klauth&apos;s message demanding the hill giants gather unhatched dragon&apos;s eggs.</string>
<string name="45763">I will follow the trail of bodies you have left back to the exit. Farewell, and may the soaring Eagle watch over you.</string>
<string name="45764">I shall go to rejoin my people now. Farewell, and may the soaring eagle watch over you.</string>
<string name="45765">I am searching for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="45766">Klauth? Who is this Klauth?</string>
<string name="45767">What did you say about fire giants?</string>
<string name="45768">Prepare to die, wyrm!</string>
<string name="45769">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45770">Me look for Power Words.</string>
<string name="45771">Who be Klauth?</string>
<string name="45772">What that &apos;bout giants?</string>
<string name="45773">You die now, dragon!</string>
<string name="45774">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45775">Eggs? Why would I want your eggs?</string>
<string name="45776">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="45777">Me want ask you questions.</string>
<string name="45778">Eggs? Why me want you eggs?</string>
<string name="45779">Are there more dragons in the area?</string>
<string name="45780">Do you know anything about the Words of Power?</string>
<string name="45781">Is more dragons nearby?</string>
<string name="45782">You know &apos;bout Power Words?</string>
<string name="45783">I am honored to give you the wyrm&apos;s head, mighty Gorgotha.</string>
<string name="45784"></string>
<string name="45785">Me happy give head at you dragon.</string>
<string name="45786"></string>
<string name="45787">I thank you for this generous gift, mighty Gorgotha.</string>
<string name="45788">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Great Gorgotha, your hoard is as vast as your might. Surely the lives of your offspring are worth more than this?</string>
<string name="45789">You better dig a little deeper into that pile of gold, Gorgotha... or your eggs might not be as safe as you think!</string>
<string name="45790">Me thank you, dragon. You big strong and give good presents!</string>
<string name="45791">You big, strong dragon with lots big gold. Me save you eggs. Maybe you give more?</string>
<string name="45792">Give more gold or me smash you eggs!</string>
<string name="45793">Why does Klauth want dragon eggs?</string>
<string name="45794">Why don&apos;t you just leave the area?</string>
<string name="45795">I could get rid of Klauth for you.</string>
<string name="45796">Why Klauth be want dragon egg?</string>
<string name="45797">Why dragon not fly far away and be safe?</string>
<string name="45798">Maybe me could kill Klauth for you.</string>
<string name="45799">I will do this for you, Gorgotha!</string>
<string name="45800">I&apos;d need some kind of payment up front for an undertaking as dangerous as this.</string>
<string name="45801">Me do this, dragon!</string>
<string name="45802">You give gold now or me not do this.</string>
<string name="45803">Is there anything more you can tell me about Klauth?</string>
<string name="45804">Me want know more &apos;bout Klauth?</string>
<string name="45805">For what reason have you violated the sanctity of this cave? Have you come seeking Gorgotha&apos;s eggs? You would be wise to answer me, tiny one.</string>
<string name="45806">I see you must be taught a lesson about the might of dragons, &lt;race&gt; fool! I shall slaughter you as I did the fire giants who attacked my lair!</string>
<string name="45807">Then go. Your presence here in my cave makes me uneasy, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. These are dark times for my kind, and I trust no one.</string>
<string name="45808">I know something of these Words of Power. It is rumored that the foul Klauth has one in his possession, guarded by his fire giant servants.</string>
<string name="45809">Many dragons would slay you for boring them with your dull mind and poor speech, &lt;race&gt; fool. But I am a gold dragon and far more merciful to the lesser species than others of my kind.</string>
<string name="45810">But I am a Gold Dragon and the nobility of my species is such that I will answer your questions despite the possibility that you are an agent of Klauth himself.</string>
<string name="45811">There used to be many dragons here in the Spine of the World. A great brass named Scylandara once made her lair to the west, but I have not seen her for many moons. </string>
<string name="45812">Further to the south is a vain and evil green wyrm named Akulatraxas, but we Gold Dragons have little to do with her kind. The others have all fled since Klauth&apos;s fire giants started raiding our lairs.</string>
<string name="45813">Klauth has offered a great reward for each dragon egg brought to the lair by his fire giant servants. It would not surprise me to find some greedy adventurers are eager to collect this reward as well. </string>
<string name="45814">**sniff - sniff** I smell blood and... something else. Something foul. **SNIFF** You have the head of Klauth the ancient red wyrm! Give it to me that I might see the proof of his death with my own eyes!</string>
<string name="45815">The terror of Klauth has been ended! No longer will his minions raid my lair! The evil power of the ancient wyrm has been broken!</string>
<string name="45816">We dragons are loathe to part with our treasure hoard, but you have earned your reward. Take this, the premier item of all the treasure I have collected.</string>
<string name="45817">I have treated you with nothing but respect, &lt;race&gt; creature, and now you dare threaten my children? Such a crime is unforgivable! Feel the fury of Gorgotha unleashed!</string>
<string name="45818">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You are bold, &lt;race&gt; one, to demand treasure from a dragon in her own lair. But your words are true enough, and I suppose the honorable thing to do would be to give you something more.</string>
<string name="45819">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You have already been well rewarded for your task, &lt;race&gt; one. Do not press me further. My scales may be hued with golden virtue, but my temper is still that of a dragon. </string>
<string name="45820">Then go with my blessing, &lt;race&gt; creature. I cannot thank you enough for slaying Klauth and preserving my eggs. </string>
<string name="45821">Why have you entered my cave, tiny creature? Are you another adventurer seeking to get rich from Gorgotha&apos;s legendary hoard? You would be wise to answer.</string>
<string name="45822">I remember you. You are the one who brought me the head of Klauth. Because of you I no longer need fear for the lives of my children. How may I help you?</string>
<string name="45823">Then go. Your presence makes me uneasy. Far too many adventurers have plotted to steal my hoard for me to feel comfortable with you in my lair.</string>
<string name="45824">Questions make me suspicious, &lt;race&gt; one. While Klauth and his fire giant servants walk the world, I do not trust anyone. </string>
<string name="45825">Skrogg, king of the fire giants in the north, has sworn allegiance to Klauth, an ancient red dragon of unimaginable evil. Now Klauth lives with the fire giants in their lair to the north and they serve his every whim.</string>
<string name="45826">Now Klauth has his fire giant minions scouring the mountains of the Spine of the World, slaying female dragons so they may steal their eggs and bring them back to Klauth.</string>
<string name="45827">I do not know why Klauth hunts the eggs of other dragons, but the reason is surely one of pure evil. Klauth is a monster, his name is a curse among my species. Even other red dragons fear him.</string>
<string name="45828">My eggs will soon hatch, I cannot risk taking them on a great journey with my brood so close to hatching. I must stay here to defend my lair and my children from falling into Klauth&apos;s clawed clutches.</string>
<string name="45829">You? But you are nothing but a &lt;race&gt; creature! Klauth is an ancient red wyrm! Even I, a Gold Dragon, fear his power. Still... these are strange times, and I am desperate. I dare not leave until my eggs have hatched.</string>
<string name="45830">Only death will stop Klauth from stealing my eggs. Bring me proof of his death. Bring me the head of Klauth the Wyrm and the greatest treasures of my hoard will be yours.</string>
<string name="45831">I admire your courage, small one. Return to me when you have Klauth&apos;s head. Otherwise I may think this has all been a deception to somehow trick me out of my eggs.</string>
<string name="45832">I wish you success, though in all truth I fear you are doomed to a grisly end. For the sake of my unhatched young I hope I am wrong.</string>
<string name="45833">Do not be foolish, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. I have promised you a share of my hoard. The honor of a gold dragon is beyond question... unless this is all just a plan to trick me out of my treasure hoard. </string>
<string name="45834">If you decide the risk is too great, I will understand. But I will not part with any of my treasure until the head of Klauth is at my feet.</string>
<string name="45835">Your stupidity is offset only by your bravery, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. Return to me when you have Klauth&apos;s head. Otherwise I may think this has all been a plot to trick me out of my eggs.</string>
<string name="45836">You must think me as stupid as you, &lt;race&gt; fool! I have promised you a share of my hoard. The honor of a gold dragon is beyond question... unless this is all just a plan to trick me out of my treasure hoard. </string>
<string name="45837"></string>
<string name="45838">I will do my best to answer them with the wisdom of my species.</string>
<string name="45839">Now, my little hero. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="45840">Questions make me suspicious, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. Too often those who speak with dragons are plotting to steal their hoard. But I will not judge you without evidence. Ask your questions.</string>
<string name="45841">Klauth, the ancient red wyrm to the north, held one of the Words of Power. But now that Klauth has been slain I do not know what may have happened to the Word.</string>
<string name="45842">Klauth no longer matters. Never again will his minions terrorize the Spine of the World, hunting and stealing the eggs of the dragons in these mountains.</string>
<string name="45843">Klauth is dead, and whatever foul purpose he intended for the stolen eggs of the other dragons ended with his life. He is nothing but a memory now.</string>
<string name="45844">The only dragon I know of who still lives in this area is Akulatraxas, a vain and evil green. Her cave is to the South, in the mountains below the Spine of the World - though we golds have little to do with her kind.</string>
<string name="45845">Take this ring. Its power may be of some use to you. But you would be wise not to press me further. My scales may be hued with golden virtue, but my temper is still that of a dragon.</string>
<string name="45846">Why have you returned to my cave, tiny creature? You would be wise to answer me, lest you incur the wrath of the mighty Gorgotha!</string>

<string name="45862">I&apos;ve decided I&apos;m just going to kill you.</string>

<string name="45865">Me just want kill you.</string>
<string name="45866">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45867">Why would the King want a half-orc for an advisor?</string>
<string name="45868">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="45869">You be half-orc. Half-orc be stupid. How you be advisor?</string>
<string name="45870">Me want you answer questions.</string>
<string name="45871">Information?</string>
<string name="45872">Tell me about Klauth.</string>
<string name="45873">Tell me about the dragon experiments.</string>
<string name="45874"></string>
<string name="45875">You tell &apos;bout Klauth.</string>
<string name="45876">You tell &apos;bout dragon exper&apos;ments.</string>
<string name="45877"></string>
<string name="45878">Fine. Here&apos;s your money.</string>
<string name="45879">I don&apos;t have that much.</string>
<string name="45880">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; How can you charge me for information after I save your life?</string>
<string name="45881">Maybe I should cut off your tongue, since you don&apos;t seem to want to use it!</string>
<string name="45882">Here be you money.</string>
<string name="45883">Me not have that much.</string>
<string name="45884">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me save your life! You not s&apos;posed to charge me!</string>
<string name="45885">You talk or me rip you tongue out!</string>
<string name="45886">Fine. Here&apos;s 300 gold.</string>
<string name="45887">Here be 300 golds. Now talk!</string>
<string name="45888">Forget it, I&apos;m out of here.</string>
<string name="45889">Me not spend money. Me go now.</string>
<string name="45890">Fine, 100. Now talk!</string>
<string name="45891">Anything else you know?</string>
<string name="45892">Hey, you there! Pull this lever here beside the door and get me out of this prison. Come on, I&apos;ve got information you might be interested in.</string>
<string name="45893"></string>
<string name="45894"></string>
<string name="45895"></string>
<string name="45896"></string>
<string name="45897"></string>
<string name="45898"></string>
<string name="45899">Hey, thanks for springing me from that cell. I guess I owe you one. So, what can I do for you?</string>
<string name="45900">What? But... Help! Intruders in the compound! They&apos;re trying to kill me!</string>
<string name="45901">Off you go then. Good luck. Hope you get rid of Skrogg. It couldn&apos;t happen to a nicer guy. As for me, I&apos;m out of here.</string>
<string name="45902">Not too swift, are you? Well, I&apos;ll try and speak slow so you can follow along.</string>
<string name="45903">My name is Wogar. The fire giants caught me trying to sneak in here about a month ago. I thought they were going to kill me, but I managed to convince King Skrogg that I&apos;d make a better advisor than a stew. </string>
<string name="45904">I was just looking for a few gems or maybe some gold, and instead I end up a prisoner forced to use my brilliant mind to help out a Giant King too stupid to rule his own people!</string>
<string name="45905">Hey, don&apos;t lay your stereotypes on me! I&apos;m as smart as you, I&apos;d wager. I&apos;m a damn sight smarter than any of the giants in this place, at any rate! </string>
<string name="45906">Not all us half-orcs are drooling idiots, you know. If I wasn&apos;t giving good advice, do you think the King would have kept me alive? But this whole time I&apos;ve also been gathering information so I could escape.</string>
<string name="45907">Hey, don&apos;t judge me just because my father was a filthy beast! You&apos;re the gibbering moron here, not me! </string>
<string name="45908">Sure, I&apos;ve picked up a ton of information since I got here. I can tell you about Klauth, and I can tell you about the dragon experiments going on in the basement. </string>
<string name="45909">Not all us half-orcs are drooling idiots, you know. If I wasn&apos;t giving good advice, do you think the King would have kept me alive? </string>
<string name="45910">I could tell you what I know, sure. But this kind of information doesn&apos;t come cheap. 500 gold pieces and I&apos;ll tell you everything I know.</string>
<string name="45911">Klauth is an ancient red dragon who&apos;s made his lair here beneath the giant complex. King Skrogg and all his giants serve Klauth. It&apos;s almost like they worship him as some kind of god or something.</string>
<string name="45912">But Klauth is old even for a dragon, and his days are numbered. That&apos;s why he has the giants gathering dragon eggs: so he can use them for those bizarre experiments in the basement. </string>
<string name="45913">Klauth has some Yuan-Ti sorcerers working for him. Those damn shapeshifters have been using magic to grow an egg into a full grown dragon in the space in a few months instead of the centuries it normally takes.</string>
<string name="45914">I&apos;m not sure why they&apos;re doing this, but I know the adult dragons tend to disappear after reaching maturity. I bet it has something to do with Klauth trying to recapture his youth. He&apos;s pretty old, even for one of his kind.</string>
<string name="45915"></string>
<string name="45916"></string>
<string name="45917">A pleasure doing business with you. Now what was it you wanted to know again?</string>
<string name="45918">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell you what, make it 300. I&apos;m going to need some gold, since I plan on getting out of this place as soon as we&apos;re done talking.</string>
<string name="45919">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Look, as soon as we&apos;re done here I&apos;m making a break for the civilized lands of the South. But I&apos;m going to need some gold when I get there. 500 or I don&apos;t talk.</string>
<string name="45920">Normally I wouldn&apos;t believe a line like that, but there&apos;s something about you I like. Okay, I&apos;ll tell you what I know for 100 gold but that&apos;s my final offer!</string>
<string name="45921">You know what? I think you&apos;re lying! And lying ticks me off! 500 gold or my lips stay sealed!</string>
<string name="45922">Hey now, let&apos;s all just settle down. Can&apos;t blame a guy for trying, right? I&apos;ll talk, just don&apos;t do anything I&apos;ll regret. What was it you wanted to know, again?</string>
<string name="45923">Klauth, the experiments in the basement... I think I did pretty damn good, considering I was a prisoner the whole time I was here.</string>
<string name="45924">Uh... I seem to have misplaced my amulet. Couldn&apos;t you just let me go down?</string>
<string name="45925">Stand aside or die, construct!</string>
<string name="45926">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45927">Here is the pass amulet.</string>
<string name="45928">Me got amulet here.</string>
<string name="45929">Uh... me left amulet in room.</string>
<string name="45930">Me smash you, stone man!</string>
<string name="45931">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45932">Only those with a pass amulet are permitted entrance.</string>
<string name="45933">I must destroy all who intrude without an amulet.</string>
<string name="45934">Then you may enter.</string>
<string name="45935">Who are you?</string>
<string name="45936">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="45937">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45938">Who be you?</string>
<string name="45939">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="45940">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45941">It&apos;s too dangerous to come with me.</string>
<string name="45942">Okay, you can come with me. Just stay out of the way when the fighting starts.</string>
<string name="45943">You no be safe with me. Me got lots big danger.</string>
<string name="45944">You be come with me. You be stay back if me make big fight.</string>
<string name="45945">Just stay here. I&apos;ll come back for you later.</string>
<string name="45946">Forget it. I&apos;m leaving now and you&apos;re *not* coming with me!</string>
<string name="45947">You be stay. Me get you later.</string>
<string name="45948">Me no want you come. Me go now, you stay!</string>
<string name="45949">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; This room is pretty fancy for a prison cell. I didn&apos;t know giants were so accommodating.</string>
<string name="45950">I don&apos;t trust you. I think I&apos;ll just leave you here.</string>
<string name="45951">Praise the Gods! When we heard you outside the door we thought you were giants coming to haul us off to the kitchens. </string>
<string name="45952">We are simple farmers. The Fire Giants captured us in a raid, and now we are held prisoner until they decide to feast on our bones! Please take us with you. Our families will reward you if you save us! </string>
<string name="45953">We don&apos;t know anything. We were thrown into this rooom by the giants when we first arrived, and haven&apos;t been allowed to leave since. Please, take us with you. Our families will reward you for saving us!</string>
<string name="45954">No, don&apos;t leave us here. Please, take us with you. Our families will reward you for saving us!</string>
<string name="45955">It is far more dangerous if we stay. Please, take us with you. Our families will reward you greatly for saving us!</string>
<string name="45956">Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. We will follow behind you, and try to stay clear of the fighting while you destroy the fire giants. Your reward for rescuing us will be beyond all your expectations. </string>
<string name="45957">We will follow behind you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, and try to stay clear of the fighting while you destroy the fire giants. </string>
<string name="45958">You are not as foolish as we assumed, &lt;race&gt; creature, but that will not be enough to save you!</string>
<string name="45959">Stone walls do not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage. Despite the decor this room is still a prison. Please, free us from our captivity. Our families will reward you well for rescuing us.</string>
<string name="45960">Gullible fool! See how easily you were tricked? You could not even detect a simple illusion. Now you shall pay for your mistake!</string>
<string name="45961">Burn you they will! Hee hee.</string>
<string name="45962">Who are you? What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="45963">I am &lt;FullName&gt;! Prepare to die, wyrm!</string>
<string name="45964">Can I ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="45965">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45966">You&apos;ve got a real one track mind there.</string>
<string name="45967">Not too bright for a dragon, are you?</string>
<string name="45968">Okay, I&apos;ll feed you. Where is your food?</string>
<string name="45969">Obviously there&apos;s something wrong with you. I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45970">You&apos;re the studpidest dragon I&apos;ve ever met! I&apos;m out of here!</string>
<string name="45971">I should just kill you and put you out of your misery.</string>
<string name="45972">Who be you? What you do here?</string>
<string name="45973">Me am &lt;FullName&gt;! You die now, Dragon!</string>
<string name="45974">Me want ask question.</string>
<string name="45975">Me go now.</string>
<string name="45976">Okay, me get it! Dragon hungry! Stop saying &apos;food!&apos;</string>
<string name="45977">You be stupid for dragon. Even me be smart more you.</string>
<string name="45978">Me feed you. Where be food?</string>
<string name="45979">Me smash you, dragon!</string>
<string name="45980">You crazy, dragon. Me go now.</string>
<string name="45981">You too stupid for me! Me go now!</string>
<string name="45982">Hungry. Food. Food? Hungry.</string>
<string name="45983">Food? Feed me. Hungry. Food?</string>
<string name="45984">Hungry. Food. Hungry.</string>
<string name="45985">Hungry! Food! Food! Food!</string>
<string name="45986">Food? Food? Hungry. Food?</string>
<string name="45987">Zzzzzzzz.</string>
<string name="45988">How do you know my name?</string>
<string name="45989">Who are you?</string>
<string name="45990">I&apos;ve decided to take your evil head as a trophy, Wyrm!</string>
<string name="45991">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="45992">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="45993">Stuff it you old windbag! You&apos;re dragon meat!</string>
<string name="45994">I&apos;m ready to face my death, Klauth. Are you?</string>
<string name="45995">Tell me about the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="45996">Tell me about the Creator Race.</string>
<string name="45997">Do you know anything about Maugrim and his cult?</string>
<string name="45998">What&apos;s wrong with the dragon in the other lair within this complex?</string>
<string name="45999">You feed on your own kind. You&apos;re a monstrous cannibal!</string>
<string name="46000">I think you&apos;re an insane egomaniac.</string>
<string name="46001">I have an essence sphere here.</string>
<string name="46002">Forget it, I&apos;m not striking a deal with you!</string>
<string name="46003">Trade? What kind of trade?</string>
<string name="46004">What do you mean, too much to lose?</string>
<string name="46005">Maybe I could do this task for you.</string>
<string name="46006">What if I just decide to destroy this essence sphere?</string>
<string name="46007">Gold? I was hoping for some other reward. A powerful magic item, perhaps?</string>
<string name="46008">How do I use this sphere?</string>
<string name="46009">I&apos;ll be back as soon as I get this sphere filled up!</string>
<string name="46010">Here, take the orb.</string>
<string name="46011">What if I decide to destroy the orb instead?</string>
<string name="46012">I was hoping for a more substantial reward than gold. A powerful magic item, perhaps?</string>
<string name="46013">Wait, I&apos;ve reconsidered. Tell me your offer.</string>
<string name="46014">Where can I find these dragon eggs?</string>
<string name="46015">How do I know I can trust you?</string>
<string name="46016">I&apos;ll be back as soon as I have these dragon eggs!</string>
<string name="46017">I&apos;ll think about your offer, but right now I have some more questions for you.</string>
<string name="46018">No, I do not have the eggs yet.</string>
<string name="46019">I have the eggs of a dragon right here.</string>
<string name="46020">How do you know so much about me?</string>
<string name="46021">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="46022">Take the eggs.</string>
<string name="46023">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think I deserve a little something extra for these eggs.</string>
<string name="46024">Then I think I&apos;ll just keep these eggs for myself, Klauth!</string>
<string name="46025">Fine, take the eggs.</string>
<string name="46026">I have some more dragon&apos;s eggs for you.</string>
<string name="46027">Here, take the eggs.</string>
<string name="46028">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think I deserve a little more than 5000 gold.</string>
<string name="46029">Fine, take the eggs.</string>
<string name="46030">Then I think I&apos;ll just keep these eggs for myself!</string>
<string name="46031">Me got more dragon egg here.</string>

<string name="46061">Maybe me could do task?</string>
<string name="46062">What if me just break ball?</string>

<string name="46064">How me use ball?</string>
<string name="46065">Me be back when ball be full with dragon!</string>
<string name="46066">You talk too much. You boring. You die!</string>
<string name="46067">Me not scared to die. What &apos;bout you, dragon?</string>
<string name="46068">You take eggs.</string>
<string name="46069">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me should get more. Me work hard to get eggs.</string>
<string name="46070">Come closer, I will not harm you. These last days of the eons of my life pass slowly now and I would speak with you to break the monotony.</string>
<string name="46071">Your comings and goings make no matter to me. You are insignificant, a nothing beside my own existence. Go, stay, it doesn&apos;t matter to me. For I, Klauth, am eternal.</string>
<string name="46072">Then your life will end, &lt;FullName&gt;. I have seen what awaits beyond this world: a void of still darkness. Are you ready to face the bleak nothingness beyond this life? </string>
<string name="46073">Speak with me if you dare, or flee like insignificant fleck of dust before the storming glory of my existence. But do not attack me, &lt;FullName&gt;, unless you are ready for death.</string>
<string name="46074">The wisdom of eternity speaks, but you refuse to listen. So be it. I shall bring you the death you so eagerly seek.</string>
<string name="46075">I am old as time itself, the infinite wisdom of eternity is mine to command. Your name and your deeds are known to me, &lt;FullName&gt;, and I shall remember them long after history has forgotten you. </string>
<string name="46076">I am Klauth, Wyrm of the North, oldest of the Dragons, greatest of the mortal creatures who walk the Realms. My power and my knowledge know no bounds!</string>
<string name="46077">Ask your question, &lt;FullName&gt;, and I shall answer if it pleases me. </string>
<string name="46078">Dragon? That term hardly applies. That creature is simply a vessel for the essence of my existence, an ignorant beast created by the power of my sorcerer servants&apos; magic from the eggs of another dragon. </string>
<string name="46079">In mere months their bodies go from eggs and hatchlings to full grown adults, though their minds remain empty. Then, when they are mature and their essence waxes full, I absorb them utterly to sustain my own waning life.</string>
<string name="46080">My own kind? I am unique! There is no other creature like me in the world! What value is the life of a common dragon against my own continued existence? I am great and terrible and awe-inspiring like no other being!</string>
<string name="46081">If I succumb to the darkness that encircles me, the world will not even comprehend what it has lost. I do not expect you to understand, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Ironically, only I have the wisdom to appreciate the value of my own life.</string>
<string name="46082">Your taunts are nothing to me. Would you heed the buzzings of a fly? Save your insults for one who does not deem you beneath his notice, &lt;FullName&gt;. </string>
<string name="46083">The Words are ancient, fashioned by the Creator Race when even I was young. The power of the Words is great. Once I even thought their magic could sustain me, though I know better now.</string>
<string name="46084">The magic of the Words is not the sort I need to prolong my life, and so the Word of Power sits in my hoard, as meaningless as all the other material treasures I have collected over eons of time. </string>
<string name="46085">I know you desire the Word, &lt;FullName&gt;, and it is of no use to me. So I will give it to you in trade.</string>
<string name="46086">This land was not always ice and snow. Once it was steaming jungle, ruled over by a race of powerful, ruthless lizardmen who forced the lesser creatures, all of you humans, dwarves, and elves, to serve them as slaves.</string>
<string name="46087">But the land changed, the world grew cold, the Old Ones died out and became a forgotten legend in the mists of time. Now all that remains is the legacy of their glory, the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="46088">Maugrim and his cult are nothing, a single drop of water in the ocean of history. He dreams of greatness, of the legacy of the Creator Race and claiming the Words of Power... but they are the dreams of a fool.</string>
<string name="46089">His people came to me seeking the Word of Power, but I sent them away. Maugrim is blind with ambition, consumed by an insane lust for power. I will not deal with a madman. I have too much to lose.</string>
<string name="46090">My continued existence is my only concern. Maugrim and his followers could not recognize my grandeur. All the same, they possessed just enough power to be a threat to me. That is why I sent them away. </string>
<string name="46091">Ah, you have one of my essence spheres. Within the ritual rooms here beneath the fire giant complex my servants use the spheres to trap the soul of a full grown dragon.</string>
<string name="46092">But since you are here, I suspect my servants are slain. No matter, I will find other servants. There are many who will perform tasks for me to gain access to the gold I possess.</string>
<string name="46093">Ah, an essence sphere with the soul of a full grown dragon already trapped within for me to feast upon. Give it to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I shall reward you with a mountain of gold from my vast hoard.</string>
<string name="46094">Your threat is meaningless to me. I can create more essence spheres, and I will find more servants. There are many who will perform tasks for me to obtain treasure from my hoard.</string>
<string name="46095">If you do this I will reward you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Capture the essence of a mature, living dragon in the sphere and bring it to me and I will reward you with a mountain of gold.</string>
<string name="46096">This is a simple task, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It requires no great skill or capabilities on your part. If the offer of gold does not entice you, do not perform the task. Others will come to serve me later and perform this task for me.</string>
<string name="46097">Find the staircases in the giant complex that lead down to the ritual rooms, where a dragon is held in stasis. The orb will absorb the soul of the dragon when it is placed upon the pedestal. Then return the sphere to me.</string>
<string name="46098">Then go. When you return you will reap your just reward.</string>
<string name="46099">Then you shall get no reward. I can make other orbs, I can find other servants. Keep the orb if you wish, &lt;FullName&gt;, it makes no difference to me.</string>
<string name="46100">You have performed a simple task, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It required no great risk or capabilities on your part. If the gold I offer is not to your liking, keep the sphere for yourself. I can make other orbs and find other servants.</string>
<string name="46101">Here is your reward, &lt;FirstName&gt;. 5000 gold pieces. Now I must savor this sweet essence of life!</string>
<string name="46102">The wither of age slips from my scales, &lt;FullName&gt;. You have done well. Now what else do you wish of me?</string>
<string name="46103">Then you shall not have the Word of Power I possess. There are others who will serve me in this matter, if you are unwilling or unable.</string>
<string name="46104">There is only one thing I desire and that is to prolong my life. I perform dark rituals to feed my essence, and for these rituals I need the eggs of other dragons. Bring me these treasures and I will give you the Word of Power.</string>
<string name="46105">In the lair of a female dragon, of course. I know there are a few who still dare make their nests in these mountains. Return to me with dragon eggs and I shall give you the Word of Power.</string>
<string name="46106">Beside me you are so insignificant that it would be beneath me to betray you. But if this is not assurance enough, you do not have to undertake the task. I can find others to bring me the dragon eggs.</string>
<string name="46107">So at last you have come. I assume my fire giant servants are dead. No matter, they are of little consequence to me. I can find other servants. Perhaps even you will serve, &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="46108">So you return, &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="46109">Have you considered my offer? Have you brought me the eggs of a dragon? </string>
<string name="46110">I am old as time itself, the infinite wisdom of eternity is mine to command. Your name and your deeds are known to me, &lt;FullName&gt;, and I shall remember them long after history has forgotten you. </string>
<string name="46111">I am Klauth the ancient Wyrm. I know much that is hidden. I even know you seek the Words of Power, remnants of the Creator Race, so you can save the city you call Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="46112">Since you are not here to give me the eggs, I assume you have some other reason for coming to speak with me. What boon do you ask of me, &lt;FullName&gt;?</string>
<string name="46113">Then all you have to do is give them to me and the Word of Power shall be yours, &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="46114">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; It is beneath me to bargain with the likes of you, &lt;FullName&gt;. I am an ancient red dragon, and you are a mere &lt;race&gt; mortal. My offer stands. You will get nothing more from me.</string>
<string name="46115">Keep them, it matters not to me. There are others who will serve me in this; there are other caches of eggs to be found.</string>
<string name="46116">Then I give you the legacy of the Creator Race. This key will open the chamber behind me, where the Word is stored. The Word of Power is yours, &lt;FullName&gt;, as it is of no use to me, anyway. Now, is there something else you wish of me?</string>
<string name="46117">Once more you return to speak to me, &lt;FullName&gt;. I have given you the Word of Power - what more do you desire of Klauth?</string>
<string name="46118">Why do you come to speak to me, &lt;FullName&gt;? You are too late to gain the Word of Power - I have already given it to another in exchange for the eggs of a dragon.</string>
<string name="46119">Since the Word of Power is no longer mine I can only offer you gold in exchange for the eggs. I will give you 5000 gold if you wish.</string>
<string name="46120">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; It is beneath me to bargain with the likes of you, &lt;FullName&gt;. I am an ancient red dragon, and you are a mere &lt;race&gt; mortal. My offer stands. You will get nothing more from me.</string>
<string name="46121">Then the gold is yours, &lt;FullName&gt;, as it is of little use to me. Now, is there more you wish of me?</string>
<string name="46122">I normally find you lesser creatures to be quite lacking in intelligence. You I find even more lacking than most. I will try to explain, slow one.</string>
<string name="46123">You truly are dense, even for a &lt;race&gt; cretin. Where would you expect to find dragon eggs?</string>
<string name="46124">I doubt you have the mental capacity to understand my instructions, but I will try anyway. Perhaps you will muddle through.</string>
<string name="46125">Betrayal! The tainted essence of a dead dragon! Now you will die!</string>

<string name="46214">The snow globe floats above the magical pedestal. Within the snow globe you see small shapes moving.</string>
<string name="46215">Snow is falling within the globe and a small group of dwarves are being attacked by dryads.</string>
<string name="46216">There are clear skies in the globe below you and a ragtag group of dwarves are busily butchering dryads beneath a warm sun.</string>

<string name="46227">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="46228">The Fort?</string>
<string name="46229">Duh Fort?</string>
<string name="46230">Gonmir, wake up... Gonny, get up. Get up, please.</string>
<string name="46231">Go on. Leave us. Gonmir&apos;s dead and the rest of us will follow him shortly. Leave me be.</string>
<string name="46232">Gonmir and I were wounded again during the fighting at the Fort. They send us back to the Well and Neurik heals us. Then we come back and fight some more.</string>
<string name="46233">I guess this is the last trip for Gonmir. He&apos;s dead. One of those barbarians got him with an arrow. I thought he&apos;d make it, but... </string>
<string name="46234">I&apos;m all right. When I get back to the Well, Neurik will heal me. Gonmir, he&apos;s not so lucky.</string>
<string name="46235">Whatever. I&apos;m not waiting around here to die, I&apos;m getting back to the Well.</string>
<string name="46236">Yeah, Fort Ilkard. It is just down the road. I&apos;d stay clear of it though, if you&apos;re not a fighting &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="46237">The siege weapon cannot be harmed while its commander is still alive.</string>
<string name="46238">Without the protection of its crew, the siege weapon is easily destroyed.</string>
<string name="46239">To Fort Ilkard.</string>
<string name="46240">Move on.</string>
<string name="46241">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place the last volume on Gnomish Airmachines into the bookcase.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="46282">There&apos;s the intruder. Kill it! KILL IT!</string>
<string name="46283">The intruder!</string>
<string name="46284">I live for the hunt... not this... boredom.</string>
<string name="46285">To me, my brothers! An intruder is before me.</string>

<string name="46288">Kill the intruder!</string>
<string name="46289">The intruder!</string>
<string name="46290">Move along.</string>
<string name="46291">Ack! That ain&apos;t so pretty.</string>
<string name="46292">I&apos;m walking toward death and don&apos;t feel much like talking.</string>
<string name="46293">Heal me, or pray for me, but I ain&apos;t got the time for talking.</string>
<string name="46294">Well, at least I&apos;m not dead, like the rest of those poor sods at the Fort are soon to be.</string>
<string name="46295">The Fort is doomed. You&apos;ll steer clear of the road there, if you&apos;re smart.</string>

<string name="46298">How you know me name?</string>

<string name="46331">Where me find this portal?</string>
<string name="46332">What do you plan to do now?</string>
<string name="46333">What you gonna do now?</string>
<string name="46334">Maybe you could help me in my mission.</string>
<string name="46335">Maybe you help me in me mission.</string>
<string name="46336">Who are you again?</string>
<string name="46337">Who you be again?</string>
<string name="46338">Sure, go over the information again.</string>
<string name="46339">Sure. You tell me info again.</string>
<string name="46340">Looks like you&apos;re all alone out here. You better give me fifty gold. For protection.</string>
<string name="46341">You all by youself here. You give me fifty gold and me protect you.</string>
<string name="46342">Bandits. Wild creatures. Me. You wouldn&apos;t want to end up a corpse in the ditch, after all.</string>
<string name="46343">No one, I guess. You can probably look after yourself. Forget I said anything.</string>
<string name="46344">Bandits. Monsters. Me. You not want end up dead in the ditch, right?</string>
<string name="46345">Me guess you can look after youself. Nevermind.</string>
<string name="46346">Gend finds out, you die.</string>
<string name="46347">I need to speak to you.</string>
<string name="46348">I know you! You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, right? You&apos;re that &lt;class&gt; who&apos;s working for Aarin Gend, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="46349">My name is Delvar. I&apos;m a scout working for Aarin Gend. Before he sent me out he mentioned that &lt;FullName&gt;, the hero who saved Neverwinter from the plague, was working for him now.</string>
<string name="46350">Relax, friend. We&apos;re on the same side here.</string>
<string name="46351">He told me to keep an eye out for you, though I have to admit his description didn&apos;t really do you justice, my lady. You&apos;re far prettier than he described.</string>
<string name="46352">He told me to keep an eye out for you, but his description didn&apos;t really do you justice. Forgive me for saying so, but words can&apos;t convey the true physical impact of your... odd appearance.</string>
<string name="46353">He told me to keep an eye out for you and gave me a brief description of what you looked like.</string>
<string name="46354">You are right, of course. This is neither the time nor the place for such things.</string>
<string name="46355">Nothing would please me more than to contiue to exchange compliments with such fine lady as yourself, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But this is neither the time nor the place for such things.</string>
<string name="46356">As you wish. I shall remain here, as per Aarin&apos;s orders. If you have any questions regarding my explorations of the Coldwood you can come speak to me again.</string>
<string name="46357">Forgive me, &lt;FullName&gt;. I meant no offense. Sometimes I speak without thinking.</string>
<string name="46358">You have a right to be angry, but I hope you will accept my apology. This is not the time or place to dwell on such things.</string>
<string name="46359">Some time ago Aarin Gend sent me out to scout the Coldwood. He thought it might help you in your mission if you had some advance information about the area.</string>
<string name="46360">This is the only path into the Coldwood, so I set up a little camp here to keep an eye out for you and anyone else working for Aarin who might pass my way. It&apos;s the only way I could be sure of getting you the information.</string>
<string name="46361">I&apos;m afraid I didn&apos;t find anything about the Words of Power themselves. If I had, I would have reported that directly to Aarin, pronto.. </string>
<string name="46362">I did stumble across some orc bandits, though. Had to watch my step so they didn&apos;t find me spying on them. And I nearly stumbled over a strange magical portal in the forest.</string>
<string name="46363">A few nights ago I heard footsteps crashing through the undergrowth, so I darted into the trees. After all, I&apos;m a scout, not a fighter.</string>
<string name="46364">It turned out to be a couple orcs tromping around, grumbling about having to go out on patrol. Needless to say, I followed them.</string>
<string name="46365">I followed them for a while, but they didn&apos;t lead me back to their camp. From what they were saying I&apos;m pretty sure their camp was somewhere here in the Coldwood.</string>
<string name="46366">I gathered their leader was an orc named Vaath, if that helps. And it almost sounded as if they were planning a raid on the Lords&apos; Alliance supply lines, though that&apos;s pretty ambitious for a group of simple bandits.</string>
<string name="46367">Not really anything else I can tell you about those orc bandits, I&apos;m afraid. Is there anything else you want to know, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="46368">I was scouting around and I stumbled across a clearing filled with shimmering columns of dancing lights. Not really what you&apos;d expect to find in the middle of a forest.</string>
<string name="46369">I don&apos;t know much about magic, but I am a tracker and I know about paths and hidden passages. I&apos;m pretty sure those columns were marking a magical entrance to some wizard&apos;s tower or mage&apos;s lab.</string>
<string name="46370">I haven&apos;t heard of any particular wizard who makes his home in the Coldwood, so I imagine the portal leads to somewhere that hasn&apos;t been used in quite a while.</string>
<string name="46371">I&apos;m just a scout, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m not about to start messing with powerful magic I don&apos;t understand. That&apos;s a job better left to adventurers like you.</string>
<string name="46372">To be honest, I doubt I could have gone through it anyway. Usually you need some type of activation word or wardstone or scroll to work those things.</string>
<string name="46373">That&apos;s the funny thing, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I pride myself on being a great tracker. I *never* get lost but I couldn&apos;t even begin to tell you where I stumbled across that portal...</string>
<string name="46374">I must have triggered a spell to disorient me. Maybe there was some type of magical ward to keep me from remembering where the entrance was hidden.</string>
<string name="46375">But the good news is that most of these protection wards are one-shot deals. If you manage to find the clearing with the glittering columns you probably won&apos;t have to worry about the same thing happening to you.</string>
<string name="46376">I don&apos;t really know what else I can tell you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, apart from what I know about the orc bandits and the magical portal.</string>
<string name="46377">My orders from Aarin Gend were pretty clear. Scout out the Coldwood then make sure I&apos;m here to give my information to any of Gend&apos;s agents who happen to be passing by.</string>
<string name="46378">I&apos;m a scout, I&apos;m not much good in a fight. That&apos;s why Aarin sent me to gather information.</string>
<string name="46379">Aarin has a pretty good idea of what his people can do. If he wanted me to join you he&apos;d have told me so. Truth is, he knew I&apos;d probably do you more harm than good.</string>
<string name="46380">Whatever you decide to do, I&apos;ll just stay here at my camp. I have to make sure anyone else working for Gend gets this information before they enter the Coldwood.</string>
<string name="46381">Hello again, &lt;FullName&gt;. I hope your mission is going well, not that&apos;s it any of my business. Anything you find out should be reported directly to Aarin Gend himself.</string>
<string name="46382">But I&apos;m here to help you if you need it. I don&apos;t have any new information for you, but I can recap what I discovered earlier while scouting the Coldwood?</string>
<string name="46383">Protection? I can look after myself. Who would I need protection from? </string>
<string name="46384">So, is there anything you need from me? Do you want me to go over the information I gathered from before?</string>
<string name="46385">This is a... a shakedown? But we both work for the same man! What will Aarin Gend say when he finds out!</string>
<string name="46386">Okay... I get it. I won&apos;t say anything to anybody. Just take the fifty gold and leave me alone.</string>
<string name="46387">You again? Look, I already gave you fifty gold. Now just leave me alone.</string>
<string name="46388">I can&apos;t believe the kind of people Gend&apos;s got working for him now. Thugs and ruffians! It&apos;s a disgrace!</string>
<string name="46389">Give me one good reason I should let you live!</string>
<string name="46390">You give one good reason me let you live!</string>
<string name="46391">If you want to live you better answer my questions!</string>
<string name="46392">Who is you? Why you is attacking?</string>
<string name="46393">Who are you? Why did you attack me?</string>
<string name="46394">If you want live you got answer me questions!</string>
<string name="46395">Forget it, dog! Time for you to die!</string>
<string name="46396">Me here to kill. Time you be dying!</string>
<string name="46397">Give me the gold and get out of here before I change my mind!</string>
<string name="46398">You give gold now and scram before me change mind.</string>
<string name="46399"></string>
<string name="46400"></string>
<string name="46401">I think I&apos;ll just kill you and take your stuff anyway.</string>
<string name="46402">Me just going to kill you and take you stuff anyway.</string>
<string name="46403">I need something else, as well: your head.</string>
<string name="46404">Me needs you head, too.</string>
<string name="46405">I need it to collect a bounty.</string>
<string name="46406">Me needs it for collect bounty.</string>
<string name="46407">Fine. I&apos;ll take the head from the other orc.</string>
<string name="46408">Me takes other orc head instead. Okay.</string>
<string name="46409">No, I&apos;ll just take the head off your shoulders instead.</string>
<string name="46410">Me no want fake head! Me kills you now, takes real head!</string>
<string name="46411">You not too bright, for come stumbling into camp of great Vaath!</string>
<string name="46412">Me surrender! Me surrender!</string>
<string name="46413">You not kill Vaath. You let Vaath live.</string>
<string name="46414">Me not know nothing! Me be just bandit. But you no kill me yet... me got stuff me can give you.</string>
<string name="46415">Then me gonna die fighting!</string>
<string name="46416">You not know Vaath the Mighty? Me am great bandit who rob from rich and give to me! This be camp of Vaath.</string>
<string name="46417">Me attack &apos;cause you come into camp. But you strong. Too strong for Vaath. Maybe you let Vaath live?</string>
<string name="46418">Me give you gold if you not kill Vaath. 500 gold for let Vaath live.</string>
<string name="46419">Me got 300 gold on belt. You let Vaath go, it be yours.</string>
<string name="46420">Here, me got 100 gold. You let Vaath live, me give you gold.</string>
<string name="46421"></string>
<string name="46422"></string>
<string name="46423"></string>
<string name="46424">You great &lt;man/woman&gt;! Vaath go far away now and not ever come back!</string>
<string name="46425">What? Vaath not give you him head! Vaath need head for live!</string>
<string name="46426">Wait, me got idea! Me give you head of other orc. One already dead. All orc head look alike! No one know it not Vaath!</string>
<string name="46427">Here, you take this head. Now you not need kill Vaath. You take gold and let Vaath live, okay?</string>
<string name="46428">You go gets you bounty with other head, and me go far, far away. No one ever know Vaath not dead. It good idea, no?</string>
<string name="46429">Perhaps I could free you.</string>
<string name="46430">Me can maybe free you?</string>
<string name="46431">Who are you?</string>
<string name="46432">Who is you?</string>
<string name="46433">I have to be going now.</string>
<string name="46434">Me got go now.</string>
<string name="46435">Snow globe?</string>
<string name="46436">You show me snow globe first or me not let you out.</string>
<string name="46437">Let me see the snow globe before I let you out.</string>
<string name="46438">How did you become a prisoner?</string>
<string name="46439">Why you is prisoner here?</string>
<string name="46440">Refresh my memory: who are you again?</string>
<string name="46441">I suppose I could help you if the price were right.</string>
<string name="46442">I&apos;ll set you free if you tell me how...</string>
<string name="46443">Me forget: who you be again?</string>
<string name="46444">Me could help you get out, if you give me nice stuff.</string>
<string name="46445">Me set you free but you got tell me how.</string>
<string name="46446">Tell me what you know about this dungeon.</string>
<string name="46447">Me want know stuff &apos;bout this dungeon.</string>
<string name="46448">How do I get you out of there?</string>
<string name="46449">How me get you out of you prison?</string>
<string name="46450">How do I perform the summoning ritual?</string>
<string name="46451">How me do summon ritual?</string>
<string name="46452">Where could I find the library?</string>
<string name="46453">What if the summoning requires a spell I can&apos;t cast?</string>
<string name="46454">Don&apos;t worry, Nax. I&apos;ll get you out of here.</string>
<string name="46455">I think I&apos;ll just leave you in there. Bye.</string>
<string name="46456">Where me find library?</string>
<string name="46457">What if summon ritual need spell that me not know how to cast?</string>
<string name="46458">You not worry, Nax. Me get you out of there.</string>
<string name="46459">Me just leave you there</string>
<string name="46460">Tell me about the snow globe again.</string>
<string name="46461">Tell me &apos;bout snowball again.</string>
<string name="46462">How am I supposed to get you out of your prison, again?</string>
<string name="46463">How me suppose to get you out of you prison, again?</string>
<string name="46464">What about my reward?</string>
<string name="46465">What &apos;bout me reward?</string>
<string name="46466">Freeze, Nax! Cough up the reward you promised!</string>
<string name="46467">Freeze, Nax! You cough up reward now!</string>
<string name="46468">Goodbye, Nax... and good luck.</string>
<string name="46469">Bye, Nax.</string>
<string name="46470">I should kill you for lying to me!</string>
<string name="46471">Why didn&apos;t you tell me this before?</string>
<string name="46472">Okay, tell me how to get the snow globe.</string>
<string name="46473">Me should kill you for lying!</string>
<string name="46474">Why you not say this before?</string>
<string name="46475">Okay, you tell me how get snowball.</string>
<string name="46476">Keep your secret, then. It&apos;s time for you to die!</string>
<string name="46477">Keep you secret, then. It die time for you now!</string>
<string name="46478">What does all this have to do with finding the snow globe?</string>
<string name="46479">Get to the point, Nax.</string>
<string name="46480">Quit stalling and spill your guts... or I&apos;ll spill them for you!</string>
<string name="46481">What this got do with finding snowball?</string>
<string name="46482">Hurry and get to point.</string>
<string name="46483">Stop stalling and spill you guts... or me spill them for you!</string>
<string name="46484">Where can I find these gongs?</string>
<string name="46485">Where me find gongs?</string>
<string name="46486">Thanks for the info. You can go now.</string>
<string name="46487">Me thank you for info. You go now.</string>
<string name="46488">Thanks for the info. Guess it&apos;s time to kill you now.</string>
<string name="46489">Me thank you for info. Me kill you now.</string>
<string name="46490">Free! I&apos;m free! I suppose I have you to thank for this, so please accept my humble gratitude before I take my leave. </string>
<string name="46491">Ah, you there. Yes, you. Would you be so kind as to help me out? I seem to find myself a prisoner here. It&apos;s a rather delicate situation from which I cannot extract myself.</string>
<string name="46492">Precisely what I was thinking, my good &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="46493">My name is Nax, a wizard whose grasp has somewhat exceeded his reach. I came to explore this ancient laboratory&apos;s long lost secrets. Like you, I passed through the magical portal in the Coldwood. It&apos;s the only possible way to enter this nefarious dungeon!</string>
<string name="46494">But since our positions are not reversed, it is I who must appeal to you for help. So, if you free me from this prison I will reward you with gold or magic items... I have a certain snow globe of immense power you might find interesting.</string>
<string name="46495">I suppose there&apos;s not much I can do except wait here and hope you eventually decide to help me escape.</string>
<string name="46496">An extremely powerful magic item I... acquired... from a lovely young archeologist named Lillian. I won&apos;t bore you with the tawdry details.</string>
<string name="46497">I haven&apos;t been able to ascertain quite how to unlock the powers of the snow globe, but I&apos;m sure Lillian would gladly explain it to you.</string>
<string name="46498">She&apos;ll probably give you a nice reward, too. I imagine she&apos;s most eager to reclaim her little prize. She&apos;s probably in the tavern at Beorunna&apos;s Well sulking over its disappearance even now.</string>
<string name="46499">I&apos;m afraid that is impossible. The spell that imprisoned me here stripped me of all my magic items. But if you free me I&apos;m certain the spell will be broken and the globe will once more be in my possession, and then I will give it to you for rescuing me.</string>
<string name="46500">Never fear, you will receive your reward once I have been freed.</string>
<string name="46501">Then I shall go at once from this accursed place! The last thing I need to do is stumble into another one of Cyril&apos;s traps! </string>
<string name="46502">However, I was caught unaware by a rather powerful ward placed upon the portal itself. With a brilliant flash of light the ward stripped me of my most powerful magic items, teleported them somewhere within this dungeon and imprisoned me here in this inescapable cell.</string>
<string name="46503">It is your good fortune that I arrived here first, and not you. Had you crossed through the portal before me it would have been you who triggered the magical ward, and I would be the one on the other side of this wall.</string>
<string name="46504">And so we meet again. Have you reconsidered my offer? Have you come to help me escape this prison?</string>
<string name="46505">The rewards will be worth it, I assure you. Gold, for starters. And a rather powerful magic item: a certain snow globe of immense power. This seems fair, does it not?</string>
<string name="46506">Of course, of course. And in exchange I will give you not only gold but a certain magical snow globe, an item of great and immense power.</string>
<string name="46507">This dungeon was once the laboratory of Cyril Lyricus, a mage well known for his abilities in summoning magical creatures to serve his every need. </string>
<string name="46508">His library and notes on various summoning rituals were rumored to be kept within this hidden laboratory. That is all I know, unfortunately. I was imprisoned the instant of my arrival, and never had a chance to explore this place.</string>
<string name="46509">None of my research ever indicated a ward like the one I stumbled into guarding the entrance. I want no more of Cyril&apos;s surprises. If you free me I will leave as soon as I have given you your reward.</string>
<string name="46510">Well, I&apos;m not certain but I do have a theory. Cyril Lyricus, the long dead owner of this dungeon, was well known for his skill in summoning various creatures.</string>
<string name="46511">He was particularly fond of water elementals, or so the legends say. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there was a magical summoning pool or two in this dungeon.</string>
<string name="46512">You could use the pool to enact a summoning ritual and call a water elemental. I think it might have the power to release me. Either that, or it would attack you on sight. I&apos;m not really sure.</string>
<string name="46513">All you have to do is find the proper reagent and place it into the summoning pool, then cast the appropriate spell on the pool. The only problem is, I don&apos;t know what reagents or which spell Cyril might have used.</string>
<string name="46514">But you could probably find that information in the library. Cyril liked to keep detailed records of everything he did.</string>
<string name="46515">I&apos;d tell you if I could, but as you know I never had an opportunity to explore this place. Just look for a room with a lot of books and you&apos;ll know you&apos;ve found it.</string>
<string name="46516">Well, I doubt Cyril would have wanted to prepare a spell every time he needed to perform the ritual. Whatever spell it requires, I&apos;ll bet there&apos;s a ring or two in this dungeon that can cast the spell.</string>
<string name="46517">Figure out the reagent and the spell, then all you have to do is find the ring. Put the reagent in the pool and zap it with the ring and presto! One water elemental.</string>
<string name="46518">Your determination is reassuring, friend. I wish you all the luck in the world.</string>
<string name="46519">I see you are here once more. However I also see that this wall which imprisons me still remains. If you want your promised reward, you&apos;ll have to get me out of here.</string>
<string name="46520">But since our positions are not reversed, it is I who must appeal to you for help. So, if you free me from this prison I will reward you with gold, magic items... I have information about a certain snow globe of immense power you might find interesting.</string>
<string name="46521">Ah yes... the gold and the powerful magic items. The truth is, I don&apos;t have any gold on me. See for yourself: my pockets are empty.</string>
<string name="46522">As for the snow globe and my other magic items... well, I had them when I came in. But the ward&apos;s magic stripped them from me when I was imprisoned. I thought they would reappear when I was released, but obviously I was mistaken. Still, I think I know how you can get the snow globe back, at least.</string>
<string name="46523">Ah, but if you do you&apos;ll never learn the secret of how to get your hands on the snow globe.</string>
<string name="46524">I was afraid you wouldn&apos;t help me. You can understand the predicament I was in. I needed help, but I had nothing to offer by way of reward.</string>
<string name="46525">I had no choice, really. I&apos;m sure you would have done the same. But I can still tell you how to get the snow globe.</string>
<string name="46526">Then you shall learn why the name Nax is feared throughout the North!</string>
<string name="46527">I&apos;m glad you decided to be reasonable about this. If my theory is correct, and so far my theories have been pretty sound, the key to finding the snow globe is two-fold.</string>
<string name="46528">First, you must know something of the history of Cyril himself and his famous duel with Nebacha the Mountain Witch. It was a summoning battle before a great crowd. Cyril was immensely proud of his victory in this contest.</string>
<string name="46529">The second clue was something I noticed at the instant I was imprisoned: a faintly audible collage of animal calls, underlaid with the deep resonance of a heavy gong.</string>
<string name="46530">When Cyril and Nebacha had their summoning duel, Cyril began by summoning a cat. Nebacha countered by summoning a dog. Cyril retaliated by summoning a bear.</string>
<string name="46531">Nebacha thought she&apos;d put a quick end to things by summoning a dragon. However, as dragons aren&apos;t fond of being summoned, the wyrm promptly swallowed Nebacha in one gulp and flew away, leaving Cyril the victor.</string>
<string name="46532">When the snow globe was taken from me by the ward I triggered, I distinctly heard a cat&apos;s meow, followed by a dog&apos;s bark, a bear&apos;s growl and finally a dragon&apos;s roar. As well, I heard the resonance of a gong accompanying each sound.</string>
<string name="46533">To counter the spell and reclaim the snow globe you simply have to find the magic gongs I triggered accidentally and ring them in the correct order: cat, dog, bear, dragon.</string>
<string name="46534">Well, that I couldn&apos;t say. After all, I was imprisoned immediately upon my arrival. I never had a chance to explore this dungeon.</string>
<string name="46535">Tell me of this dungeon.</string>
<string name="46536">What you is knowing of dungeon here?</string>
<string name="46537"></string>
<string name="46538"></string>
<string name="46539">I want you to give me a magical item.</string>
<string name="46540">Could you gots me a magic stuff?</string>
<string name="46541">You are dismissed to your home plane.</string>
<string name="46542">Me gots no wants. You go home!</string>
<string name="46543"></string>
<string name="46544"></string>
<string name="46545">I&apos;m looking to free the enchanter, Nax.</string>
<string name="46546">Me wants Nax freed from prison.</string>
<string name="46547"></string>
<string name="46548"></string>
<string name="46549">Yes. Go free Nax.</string>
<string name="46550">Me wants Nax freed.</string>
<string name="46551"></string>
<string name="46552"></string>
<string name="46553">Yes. I wish you to leave.</string>
<string name="46554">Me wants you going away!</string>
<string name="46555">Who are you? What are you?</string>
<string name="46556">Whoa! Who is you! What you come from?</string>
<string name="46557">Yes, give me something magical.</string>
<string name="46558">Me wants item! Gives me magic!</string>
<string name="46559">No. I don&apos;t want a magical item.</string>
<string name="46560">Me not wants item.</string>
<string name="46561">Ah, so another water elemental is summoned forth to this plane. Tell me, &lt;race&gt; creature, what would you have me do?</string>
<string name="46562">This was once the lair of the mage Cyril Lyricus, greatest of all the summoners. Here he practiced great magic and created many servants.</string>
<string name="46563">If it pleases you, I can give you something that I brought with me from my home plane. Do you wish this?</string>
<string name="46564">I am in your control still, and so I must warn you that if you relinquish control of me, I am under no obligation to return.</string>
<string name="46565">I am the greatest of his servants... though I sense my creator is no more. Yet even with Cyril&apos;s death, my power is bound to this summoning pool.</string>
<string name="46566">You have disrupted the ritual of summoning by your approach. I am no longer under your control, and so I leave.</string>
<string name="46567">Who calls to me, and for what purpose am I summoned to this plane?</string>
<string name="46568">You have summoned me, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt; and so by the magic of Cyril Lyricus I must perform a task for you. What is it you wish of me?</string>
<string name="46569">Very well. If you wish it, this deed will be performed and then I will absolve myself of your control.</string>
<string name="46570"></string>
<string name="46571">Very well. I do as you wish.</string>
<string name="46572"></string>
<string name="46573"></string>
<string name="46574">Very well. I return from whence I have come.</string>
<string name="46575"></string>
<string name="46576">I am, obviously, a water elemental. You performed the ritual and summoned me. Now, I am bound to obey one command.</string>
<string name="46577">You might wish me to perform some random task, or perhaps you wish me to gift you with a boon. Simply command me.</string>
<string name="46578">I cannot tell you what the item will be, but it will be powerful enough to suit you.</string>
<string name="46579">Fine. Then simply tell me what you do wish, and I will fulfill your request.</string>
<string name="46580">Fine, then take this item. And now, I will take my leave of you.</string>
<string name="46581">Why are the dryads fighting with you?</string>
<string name="46582">Me wonders what dryad is fighting you for.</string>
<string name="46583">All right, dwarf. Now it&apos;s your turn to die.</string>
<string name="46584">Me likes killing dwarf. You ready to die?</string>
<string name="46585">I think I will go now. Farewell.</string>
<string name="46586">Me not talk no more. Me go. Bye!</string>
<string name="46587">Do you know anything more about the dryads?</string>
<string name="46588">Me gots questions about dryads. You know more stuff?</string>
<string name="46589">What is this place? How can this world exist inside a snow globe?</string>
<string name="46590">What this place be? How it be inside snowball?</string>
<string name="46591">Who are you? What are you doing in this place?</string>
<string name="46592">Who be you? What you doing in this place?</string>
<string name="46593">Where can I find Hodd?</string>
<string name="46594">Where me is finding Hodd?</string>
<string name="46595">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="46596">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="46597">Immortal dryads? What do you mean by that?</string>
<string name="46598">What you mean by immortal dryad?</string>
<string name="46599">I&apos;ll crush yer skull like an egg on me anvil!</string>
<string name="46600">These dryads are mad! Ye can&apos;t reason with these leaf lovers!</string>
<string name="46601">We don&apos;t see many strangers &apos;round here. But you ain&apos;t attackin&apos; me on sight like them dryads, so I guess there ain&apos;t no harm in talkin&apos; to ye.</string>
<string name="46602">Die, ye tree huggers!</string>
<string name="46603">Death to you all! The dwarfs is for the dwarfs!</string>
<string name="46604">Har! Ye be thinking that we&apos;re fer laying down like that? We&apos;re fer fighting each and every day. This be no exception. Bring it ont!</string>
<string name="46605">Travel safely while yer in these parts. Danger be all around!</string>
<string name="46606">If ye got questions, ye really should speak to Hodd. He&apos;s the leader of our clan in our war with these damn immortal dryads.</string>
<string name="46607">Them bloody tree huggers won&apos;t stay dead! Even the trees that get chopped down spring back up again.</string>
<string name="46608">But they&apos;re not fer beatin&apos; us neither, because we seem to be reborn just the same. Can&apos;t explain it to you better than that. Maybe Hodd can make it more plain.</string>
<string name="46609">I ain&apos;t tryin&apos; to be rude, but yer talkin&apos; as daft as the dryads. I don&apos;t know nothin&apos; &apos;bout no snow globe, but this place is... home.</string>
<string name="46610">We be dwarves of Hodd&apos;s clan, that much is true and simple. And we do what Hodd tells us. Mostly that means fightin&apos; them battle-raged dryads.</string>
<string name="46611">The leaf lovers ain&apos;t sane, that much I know. Every tree hugger ye meet&apos;s an enemy. If ye see &apos;em, best hope they don&apos;t see you... or yer in fer a fight!</string>
<string name="46612">I see that answer don&apos;t help ye much. Maybe Hodd&apos;s the one ye should be talkin&apos; to fer yer answers. He be the leader of our clan fer this entire war against them immortal dryads.</string>
<string name="46613">We&apos;re not fer knowing. Not really, at any rate. Them dryads is crazed! Kill &apos;em a thousand times and they just keep coming back for more!</string>
<string name="46614">Hodd be in the northwestern area of this region. He&apos;ll not be hard to find, fer sure. Just be careful in the northeast. There be the home of them immortal dryads.</string>
<string name="46615">Ye may not be of me own clan, but yer a fellow dwarf so I guess yer all right. And at least you ain&apos;t attackin&apos; me on sight like them dryads!</string>
<string name="46616">Why do the dwarves attack you?</string>
<string name="46617">Me wonders what dwarf is fighting you for.</string>
<string name="46618">All right, dryad. Now it&apos;s your turn to die.</string>
<string name="46619">Me likes killing dryad. You ready to die?</string>
<string name="46620">I think I will go now. Farewell.</string>
<string name="46621">Me not talk no more. Me go. Bye!</string>
<string name="46622">Do you know anything more about the dwarves?</string>
<string name="46623">Me gots questions about dwarves. You know more stuff?</string>
<string name="46624">What is this place? How can this world exist inside a snow globe?</string>
<string name="46625">What this place be? How it be inside snowball?</string>
<string name="46626">Who are you? What are you doing in this place?</string>
<string name="46627">Who be you? What you doing in this place?</string>
<string name="46628">Where can I find Arwyl?</string>
<string name="46629">Where me is finding Arwyl?</string>
<string name="46630">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="46631">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="46632">Immortal dwarves? What do you mean by that?</string>
<string name="46633">What you mean, immortal dwarf?</string>
<string name="46634">You shall wither and die!</string>
<string name="46635">The dwarves are mad! The brutes will not listen to reason!</string>
<string name="46636">Welcome, &lt;race&gt; friend. Your kind is strange to us. We are used to seeing only the dwarves and they attack us on sight.</string>
<string name="46637">Death to the bearded ones and their allies!</string>
<string name="46638">Only the dryads shall survive!</string>
<string name="46639">We battle the dwarves each and every day, and it has made us strong with courage. We shall not fly from another fight!</string>
<string name="46640">May the earth be ever soft beneath your feet. But travel with care, good &lt;man/woman&gt;. Danger is ever present.</string>
<string name="46641">I will do my best to help you, but if it is answers you seek you must speak with Arwyl. She is the wisest of we dryads, and has been our leader throughout our war against the immortal dwarves.</string>
<string name="46642">What else would you call an enemy that will not remain dead? Even those dwarves slain by our strongest magic return to attack us once more.</string>
<string name="46643">Yet neither can they triumph over us, for we are ever reborn in the same manner. I am unable to explain it more clearly, though perhaps Arwyl can make you understand.</string>
<string name="46644">I mean no disrespect, but I fear your words make no sense. I know nothing of a snow globe, and all I can tell of this place is that it is our home.</string>
<string name="46645">We are the dryads of Arwyl&apos;s grove. Our days are spent running and hiding from the dwarves, and trying to protect our groves against their axes.</string>
<string name="46646">The bearded ones are enraged with battle lust. That is all you need to know of the dwarves. If you see them you must flee for your life, or they will surely attempt to slay you.</string>
<string name="46647">I see in your eyes my answers do little to satisfy you. Perhaps you should speak to Arwyl for she is wiser than I. She has been our leader throughout this war with the immortal dwarves.</string>
<string name="46648">The dwarves are insane with bloodlust, there is no other explanation. They cannot be reasoned with and they slaughter our kind with no remorse.</string>
<string name="46649">She is to the northeast, and not hard to find. But be careful in the northwest for that is the domain of the immortal dwarves.</string>
<string name="46650">I bid you welcome, dwarf, for I see you are not of the clan that hunts us and destroys our trees. </string>
<string name="46651">Why are the dwarves at war with you?</string>
<string name="46652">Me wonders what dwarf is fighting you for.</string>
<string name="46653">All right, dryad. Now it&apos;s your turn to die.</string>
<string name="46654">Me likes killing dryad. You ready to die?</string>
<string name="46655">I think I will go now. Farewell.</string>
<string name="46656">Me not talk no more. Me go. Bye!</string>
<string name="46657">What is this place? How can this world exist inside a snow globe?</string>
<string name="46658">What this place be? How it be inside snowball?</string>
<string name="46659">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="46660">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="46661">Have you always been at war with the dwarves?</string>
<string name="46662">You always be at war with dwarves?</string>
<string name="46663">What do you make of this amulet?</string>
<string name="46664">What you think &apos;bout this amulet?</string>
<string name="46665">That&apos;s horrible!</string>
<string name="46666">That be bad life.</string>
<string name="46667">You are immortal! You get to live forever.</string>
<string name="46668">You not never die. You be live forever!</string>
<string name="46669">Can you do anything to fix it?</string>
<string name="46670">You know how for fix it?</string>
<string name="46671">Can you make it magic?</string>
<string name="46672">You know how make it magic?</string>
<string name="46673">Are you okay? Is something wrong?</string>
<string name="46674">What the matter with you?</string>
<string name="46675">Tell me more about this vision.</string>
<string name="46676">You say more &apos;bout this vision.</string>
<string name="46677">Maybe I could free you from this Master.</string>
<string name="46678">Maybe me could free you from this Master.</string>
<string name="46679">Immortal? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="46680">Immortal? What you mean by that?</string>
<string name="46681">You shall wither and die!</string>
<string name="46682">The dwarves are mad! The brutes will not listen to reason!</string>
<string name="46683">I am Arwyl, leader of the dryads. I bid you welcome, &lt;race&gt; one. Your kind is strange to us - we are used to seeing only the dwarves who attack us on sight.</string>
<string name="46684">Death to the bearded ones and their allies!</string>
<string name="46685">Only the dryads shall survive!</string>
<string name="46686">We battle the dwarves each and every day, and it has made us strong with courage. We shall not fly from another fight!</string>
<string name="46687">May the earth be ever soft beneath your feet. But travel with care, good &lt;man/woman&gt;. Danger is ever present.</string>
<string name="46688">As you wish, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. What wisdom I have I shall gladly share with you, though I know little beyond our endless war with the immortal dwarves.</string>
<string name="46689">The true horror of this war is that it can never, ever end. The dwarves we slay are reborn and venture forth to wage war upon us again, just as we are reborn after each and every death.</string>
<string name="46690">A thousand, thousand times I have felt the cold steel of a dwarven sword pierce my flesh, or had my skull broken by their great war hammers. Yet each time I reappear whole again in this grove.</string>
<string name="46691">Forgive me but I do not understand your question. I know nothing of this snow globe of which you speak, and our world is as it is.</string>
<string name="46692">The dwarves cannot be reasoned with. They slaughter my sisters and chop down our trees. It is as if they are possessed by a kind of madness.</string>
<string name="46693">I bid you welcome, dwarf, for I see you are not of the clan that hunts us and destroys our trees. I am Arwyl, leader of the dryads.</string>
<string name="46694">For what reason have you sought me out, &lt;race&gt; one? Is there some boon you would ask of me?</string>
<string name="46695">I bid you welcome once again, &lt;race&gt; friend.</string>
<string name="46696">And yet sometimes I feel the dwarves are not solely to blame. I do not speak of this with my sisters, but there are times when... things are not clear, as if I am in a dream or nightmare. </string>
<string name="46697">I have dark visions of me and my sisters unleashing our magic on the dwarves and revelling in the slaughter. I cannot help but wonder if we dryads do not sometimes succumb to the same bloodlust as our foe.</string>
<string name="46698">I... I think not, though it is hard to remember anything else. But within my mind there are fleeting images of a time long, long ago. A time when dwarf and dryad stood side by side.</string>
<string name="46699">We were slaves to a terrible master, a monstrous creature of pure evil. Dwarf and nymph alike served this being, and together we dared stand against it.</string>
<string name="46700">But the memories are clouded and unclear, a trembling reflection in a muddied pond. Perhaps they are not even real, for it seems as if our war with the dwarves has raged since the dawn of existence.</string>
<string name="46701">Our life is one of endless suffering and hate. We feel the pain of death and the horrors of eternal war, but for us there can be no escape.</string>
<string name="46702">I know not how we came to be this way, though I know our existence is... wrong. But we know no other life. War, death, rebirth... the cycle shall never end.</string>
<string name="46703">We know no other life but this one of constant, endless war with the dwarves.</string>
<string name="46704">This amulet looks... familiar. As if I knew it once long, long ago.</string>
<string name="46705">See the inscription on the back? It is written in an old and ancient tongue... yet I know what the words say: &quot;Tree and forge united, to overthrow the Master.&quot; </string>
<string name="46706">I can sense that once this amulet held great magic. The power of nature itself was contained within. But it is cracked, and the magic within it is gone.</string>
<string name="46707">Perhaps I could imbue it with the magic of tree and earth, if it were whole. But the amulet is cracked. It must be repaired before I can fill it with magic.</string>
<string name="46708">However, metallurgy is beyond the skill of I or my sisters. The dwarves may possess such power, but they will surely attack you on sight if you try to reason with them.</string>
<string name="46709">I am sorry I can tell you no more of this amulet.</string>
<string name="46710">I sense that this amulet once held great power. The magic of nature itself was contained within. But the magic is now gone, the amulet is cold within my hand.</string>
<string name="46711">Perhaps... yes, it is possible for me to restore the magic of tree and earth to this amulet. Prepare yourself.</string>
<string name="46712">It... it is done. The amulet... is whole again.</string>
<string name="46713">This amulet conjures strange visions in my mind: half-remembered images of a time long ago, when dryad and dwarf alike served a terrible, cruel Master. </string>
<string name="46714">I see a... creature. Cold as death. The Master. And I see... it is unclear... I see... the amulet. Yes, the Amulet of Ages! Forged to slay the Master and free us from this existence.</string>
<string name="46715">I remember! We set out against the Master, dwarves and dryads together and... no, the memory is fading... the Master was too strong... the amulet cracked, its magic was lost and... and... </string>
<string name="46716">I&apos;m sorry, the vision is gone. It... it as if some great spell has stripped the memories from my mind. I can tell you nothing more about the amulet or the Master we once served. I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="46717">The only release we seek is death. Perhaps, if you could slay the Master we could find peace... but it may be the Master is already dead. Even now I cannot remember... </string>
<string name="46718">The magic is too strong. I am sorry, but the memories jarred by the amulet are gone. I cannot even recall the face of the Master. I can tell you no more.</string>
<string name="46719">Arwyl will have the answers to your questions. She is waiting to see you now.</string>
<string name="46720">&lt;StartAction&gt;This nymph averts her eyes from you, and then points shyly in the direction of a fellow nymph.&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Speak with Arwyl.&quot;</string>
<string name="46721">Arwyl has said that you would come. Arwyl wishes to speak with you.</string>
<string name="46722">I would not speak for Arwyl. She will speak for herself.</string>
<string name="46723">Arwyl is standing over there. If you wish to speak with her, I am sure she would be happy to oblige.</string>
<string name="46724">Ye really should be speaking with Hodd. He&apos;s the one to go to fer a talking to.</string>
<string name="46725">Why are ye talking to me? Hodd be standing right there, and ye&apos;re fer ignoring him?</string>
<string name="46726">That be Hodd standing over there. He be our leader for this clan, and the man you should be consulting.</string>
<string name="46727">Why are you looking at me fer? Hodd be over there, and he be the man to help you out.</string>
<string name="46728">How long are you going to walk around talkin&apos; to us when Hodd is the one you be looking to see?</string>
<string name="46729">Why are the dryads at war with you?</string>
<string name="46730">Me wonders what dryad is fighting you for.</string>
<string name="46731">All right dwarf. Now it&apos;s your turn to die.</string>
<string name="46732">Me likes killing dwarf. You ready to die?</string>
<string name="46733">I think I will go now. Farewell.</string>
<string name="46734">Me not talk no more. Me go. Bye!</string>
<string name="46735">What is this place? How can this world exist inside a snow globe?</string>
<string name="46736">What this place be? How it be inside snowball?</string>
<string name="46737">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="46738">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="46739">Have you always been at war with the dryads?</string>
<string name="46740">You always be at war with dryads?</string>
<string name="46741">What do you make of this amulet?</string>
<string name="46742">What you think &apos;bout this amulet?</string>
<string name="46743">That&apos;s horrible!</string>
<string name="46744">That be bad life.</string>
<string name="46745">You are immortal! You get to live forever.</string>
<string name="46746">You not never die. You be live forever!</string>
<string name="46747">Can you do anything to make it magic again?</string>
<string name="46748">You know how make it magic again?</string>
<string name="46749">Can you do anything to fix it?</string>
<string name="46750">You know how fix it?</string>
<string name="46751">Tell me more about this vision.</string>
<string name="46752">You say more &apos;bout this vision.</string>
<string name="46753">Maybe I could free you from this Master.</string>
<string name="46754">Maybe me could free you from this Master.</string>
<string name="46755">Immortal? What do you mean by that?</string>
<string name="46756">Immortal? What you mean?</string>
<string name="46757">I&apos;ll crush yer skull!</string>
<string name="46758">Them tree huggers is mad! They won&apos;t listen to reason!</string>
<string name="46759">Me name be Hodd, leader of this dwarven clan. We don&apos;t see yer kind &apos;round here much. But at least you ain&apos;t attackin&apos; us on sight like them crazed dryads!</string>
<string name="46760">Death to the leaf lovers!</string>
<string name="46761">The dwarves is fer the dwarves!</string>
<string name="46762">Then ye&apos;ll taste me battle hammer before ye finish me off!</string>
<string name="46763">Aye, and good luck to ye. Mind yerself as ye never know where the dryads might be lurkin&apos;!</string>
<string name="46764">So be it. The wisdom of me and my clan is yours for the takin&apos;, though I don&apos;t know much beyond this endless war with them damn immortal tree huggers!</string>
<string name="46765">Ye can never end a war when the dead keep coming back. The dryads are reborn after every death, just as me own kin come back time after time.</string>
<string name="46766">The spells of the dryads have ended me own life too many times to count, yet every time I reappear here risen, healed and ready to battle and die all over again.</string>
<string name="46767">Snow globe? Ach, yer talking daft! The world is the world, right enough. There be nothing more to it than that.</string>
<string name="46768">The leaf lovers canna&apos; be reasoned with! They&apos;re mad, I tell ye! They attack us on sight, unleashing their fey magic upon me and me kin!</string>
<string name="46769">Ye may not be of me own clan, but yer a dwarf right enough - I figure ye must be all right. My name is Hodd, leader of me clan.</string>
<string name="46770">Is there somethin&apos; I can help ye with?</string>
<string name="46771">Aye, me an&apos; me clan bid ye greetings once more.</string>
<string name="46772">And yet in me heart I wonder if the dryads are the only ones to blame. I don&apos;t speak of it with me kin but sometimes things are... strange. Like I be havin&apos; a dream... or a nightmare. </string>
<string name="46773">In me visions I see dryads slain and their trees chopped down by me own kin&apos;s axes. Aye, &apos;tis enough to make me wonder if we dwarves have ever fallen under the same strange madness as the tree huggers.</string>
<string name="46774">Nay, I... I think once it were different, long ago... though it be hard to recall naught but bloodshed. Yet there be strange images hauntin&apos; me dreams of dwarf and dryad standin&apos; shoulder to shoulder. </string>
<string name="46775">I see another time when my kin and the leaf lovers both served a terrible Master, slaves to a faceless shadow of evil. </string>
<string name="46776">But the memories be dark as shadows in the heart of a mine. Maybe me thoughts is not even real. Aye, it truly seems my kin has always been at war with the dryads.</string>
<string name="46777">Me kin be no cowards, but a never ending war be a terrible fate. The tortures and agonies of the dryad&apos;s magic be visited upon our souls with every death and rebirth.</string>
<string name="46778">I canna&apos; say how we came to be like this. This life be wrong and... unnatural, but we know no other way. War, death, rebirth... There be no escape for us.</string>
<string name="46779">And the way of the world is war. A never-ending war with the tree huggers and their fell magic!</string>
<string name="46780">Aye, &apos;tis a pretty thing indeed. And it looks... familiar. As if it were known to me long ago.</string>
<string name="46781">Ye see the fancy writin&apos; on the back? An old and ancient tongue... yet I can figure out the words: &quot;Tree and forge united, to overthrow the Master.&quot; </string>
<string name="46782">The amulet be repaired, right enough, and finely forged. But there be no magic in it save the magic of a great craftsman. Its original powers be no more.</string>
<string name="46783">Me clan know the secrets of magic, aye, but only the power of fire, forge, hammer and anvil. This amulet be forged to hold the power of tree and earth.</string>
<string name="46784">The dryads have such power, right enough. They could craft it for ye. But the tree huggers be crazed. Ye be a fool if ye try to speak to them as they&apos;ll attack ye on sight.</string>
<string name="46785">That be all I can tell ye about yer amulet, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="46786">This amulet was forged to hold great magic, but ye see how it be cracked now? Whatever magic it once had is long gone.</string>
<string name="46787">Aye, I suppose I could repair the crack. It be simple enough for me to cast a mending spell on it for ye. Stand back while I work me magic.</string>
<string name="46788">There, the amulet be whole again, though it still be lacking the magic to make it a true artifact.</string>
<string name="46789">The amulet brings strange thoughts into me head. It... it stirs up dreams of ages past. Aye, I can see it now: a time when dryad and dwarf were allies against a brutal Master.</string>
<string name="46790">I see a... beast. Cold as heartless winter. The Master. And I see... ach, &apos;tis all unclear... I see... the amulet. Aye, the Amulet of Ages! Forged to slay the Master and free us from this existence.</string>
<string name="46791">Aye, now I recall! Dwarves and dryads united against a commmon foe and... nay, &apos;tis fading... the Master was too strong... the amulet cracked, its magic was lost and... and... </string>
<string name="46792">Ach, the vision be gone. It as if some foul magic has plucked the very memories from me mind. I canna&apos; even see the face of the Master anymore.</string>
<string name="46793">The only release we seek is death. Maybe, if ye could slay the Master my clan could find peace... but could be the Master already be dead. Even now I begin to forget... </string>
<string name="46794">Nay, the magic is too strong. The memories yer amulet awoke in me mind be gone: the Master, the amulet... there is nothing left I can tell ye. </string>
<string name="46795">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="46796">Me got question for you.</string>
<string name="46797">I should go now.</string>
<string name="46798">Me want go now.</string>
<string name="46799">Who are you?</string>
<string name="46800">Who you be?</string>
<string name="46801">What is this place? How does this world exist inside a snow globe?</string>
<string name="46802">What be this place? How it be inside snowball?</string>
<string name="46803">Can you tell me anything about the dwarves and dryads?</string>
<string name="46804">Me want know more &apos;bout dwarf and dryad.</string>
<string name="46805">I am &lt;FullName&gt;. I am searching for the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="46806">Me am &lt;FullName&gt;. Me look for Power Word.</string>
<string name="46807">I&apos;m here to kill you, wyrm!</string>
<string name="46808">Me want kill you, dragon!</string>
<string name="46809">May I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="46810">It okay if me ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="46811">Enough talking, coward! Time to die!</string>
<string name="46812">No more talk! You die now, coward!</string>
<string name="46813">Yes. Tell me about the Word of Power.</string>
<string name="46814">Yes. Me want you tell me &apos;bout Word of Power.</string>
<string name="46815">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="46816">Me want ask you something else.</string>
<string name="46817">Do you know anything about a Word of Power?</string>
<string name="46818">You know stuff &apos;bout Power Word?</string>
<string name="46819">Can you tell me anything about this amulet?</string>
<string name="46820">You know stuff &apos;bout this amulet?</string>
<string name="46821">How did you end up inside this snowglobe?</string>
<string name="46822">How you end up inside snowball?</string>
<string name="46823">Why are they always fighting each other?</string>
<string name="46824">Why creatures be always fighting each other?</string>
<string name="46825">What was that about the Word of Power?</string>
<string name="46826">You say something &apos;bout Power Word?</string>
<string name="46827">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You seem quite upset about this amulet. Is there something about it you&apos;re not telling me?</string>
<string name="46828">Artifact?</string>
<string name="46829">Where is the Word now?</string>
<string name="46830">Where be Word now?</string>
<string name="46831">What if I just take it from you?</string>
<string name="46832">Maybe me just take Power Word from you?</string>
<string name="46833">Give me the Word or die!</string>
<string name="46834">You give Word or you die!</string>
<string name="46835">Is there nothing I can offer in exchange for the Word?</string>
<string name="46836">There not be nothing you want in trade for Power Word?</string>
<string name="46837">It&apos;s wrong to enslave these creatures!</string>
<string name="46838">It be wrong to make them be you slave!</string>
<string name="46839">You are not one of my slaves. It is strange for me to see one who does not cower and flee in terror at my presence, tiny &lt;race&gt; being. I find your courage... intriguing.</string>
<string name="46840">Come, tiny creature. Speak with me if you have the courage.</string>
<string name="46841">Then I give you permission to take leave of my presence, small one.</string>
<string name="46842">I will grant you your request, puny one. Ask your questions and I shall share my infinite wisdom with you as I see fit.</string>
<string name="46843">I am The Master. Visitors are a great curiosity in my world, so I will forgive your intrusion. Tell me, puny one, why have you come to my realm?</string>
<string name="46844">Once more you intrude upon my solitude, tiny creature being - and yet again I forgive your trespass, because I am a merciful Master. Tell me, for what reason have you returned?</string>
<string name="46845">You are either very brave or very foolish, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. There was a time when I would have slain you for your insolence, but I have grown more placid in my centuries of solitude. </string>
<string name="46846">I will forgive your disrespect... this time. If you push me, however, I will give you a slow and painful death. Know that you are no threat to me, tiny creature.</string>
<string name="46847">So be it, &lt;race&gt; fool! You have brought the wrath of Ma&apos;fel&apos;no&apos;sei&apos;kedeh&apos;naar upon yourself!</string>
<string name="46848">Conversation instead of combat? I see there is enough sense in your tiny skull to choose life over death.</string>
<string name="46849">When a dragon asks you a question it is not wise to respond with a question of your own. But my centuries of solitude have brought me a serenity uncommon to my kind.</string>
<string name="46850">Your name means nothing to me, &lt;male/female&gt;... I have been too long absent from your world. But the Word of Power, that is something with which I am very familiar.</string>
<string name="46851">There was a time when I would have snuffed out your existence for daring to even mention the Word in my presence. But centuries of solitude have cooled the passions of my icy blood.</string>
<string name="46852">I can tell you of this Word of Power if you wish, though its magic is far greater than anything your trivial intellect will be able to comprehend.</string>
<string name="46853">Long ago I was known as Ma&apos;fel&apos;no&apos;sei&apos;kedeh&apos;naar in the old language. There was a time when I was known as Winter Fang in the tongues of the manlings.</string>
<string name="46854">But these names mean nothing now, they are forgotten and vanished from your world, as am I. Now I am the Builder, the Creator, the Master. This realm is mine, and within it all bow down to me.</string>
<string name="46855">You have the Amulet of Ages! You must die!</string>
<string name="46856">I am ancient beyond comprehension, even by the reckoning of my dragon kin. We wyrms are not immortal, though it may seem so to a short-lived creature such as you.</string>
<string name="46857">When I first felt the fingers of enfeeblement creeping through my flesh, I vowed I would not sit idly by to await my inevitable end. I created this world for myself. It is a haven where I am safe from the ravages of time.</string>
<string name="46858">They are my creations, my servants, my slaves. I gave them eternal life when I built this realm, that they might serve my every need. </string>
<string name="46859">But my needs are few, and it is rare that I am forced to call upon the creatures for their service. It has been many centuries since I last spoke with them, and now they only cower in fear or flee in terror at my approach.</string>
<string name="46860">Slaves must have an enemy. If they do not, they will turn against their Master. I learned this once, long ago. The dwarves and dryads were plotting against me.</string>
<string name="46861">I gave them existence and eternal life, and they dared to conspire to defeat me? I could have destroyed them, but they are MY servants. I would only be destroying my own property.</string>
<string name="46862">Instead, I bound their loyalties to this realm so that neither dwarf nor dryad would ever work together again. Now they have each other to hate, and I am left in peace.</string>
<string name="46863">When I have need of one race to serve me, the other is consumed by an insane bloodlust. When I have need of the other race, the spell is inverted and those who were sane are now taken by the madness.</string>
<string name="46864">I cannot even begin to explain the magics I used to create this realm to a creature so pitiful as you. Suffice to say, this realm is mine, created using the ancient magic of the Creator Race bound in the Word of Power.</string>
<string name="46865">That? That is nothing but a bauble, a worthless piece of junk! I have offered you the gift of my vast knowledge, and you dare waste time with such banal trivialities?</string>
<string name="46866">Speak to me no more of this trinket, &lt;male/female&gt;. I have no time for such foolishness.</string>
<string name="46867">Tread lightly, creature. I have warned you once about this subject. If you press me about this artifact constructed by my slaves you shall incur my anger.</string>
<string name="46868">Foolish &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;! You were warned!</string>
<string name="46869">The Word is an ancient magic, fashioned by the Creator Race that ruled the North before the time of manlings. Even I was not yet hatched when they vanished from the world.</string>
<string name="46870">I was able to harness the magic of the Word, using it to shape this realm, to give eternal life to my slaves, and to make my own body immortal.</string>
<string name="46871">The magic of the Word sustains this realm and my own existence. It is never far from me. More than this I will not tell you. The Word is mine and you shall never have it.</string>
<string name="46872">Then you would die in the attempt. Do not trifle with me on this, small one. The blood in my veins is thick with age and slow to boil, yet my anger is terrible once unleashed.</string>
<string name="46873">I have suffered you to live far too long, &lt;race&gt; fool!</string>
<string name="46874">Can you offer immortality? The Word sustains me, it is life itself. There is nothing you can offer in trade, mortal.</string>
<string name="46875">I created them and they are mine to do with as I please. Without me and the magic of the Word of Power to sustain them, they would cease to exist! </string>
<string name="46876">Who are you? What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="46877">Who you be and what you be doing here?</string>
<string name="46878">How can you help me?</string>
<string name="46879">How you help me?</string>
<string name="46880">Sorry. I&apos;m not talking to a demon. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="46881">Me not talk to demon. Bye!</string>
<string name="46882">What do you want from me?</string>
<string name="46883">Me hear what you want first.</string>
<string name="46884">Tell me more about how you can help me.</string>
<string name="46885">Me wanting know how you is helping me.</string>
<string name="46886">I&apos;d rather not have you help me. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="46887">Me not want you is helping me. At all!</string>
<string name="46888"></string>
<string name="46889"></string>
<string name="46890">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Do I need to sell my soul or something?</string>
<string name="46891">Take the talisman. Now, how will you help me?</string>
<string name="46892">Me gives you talisman. You helping now?</string>
<string name="46893">No, I won&apos;t give you the talisman you want.</string>
<string name="46894">Me not gives you my talisman.</string>
<string name="46895">I&apos;d like you to open all of the doors.</string>
<string name="46896">Me wants stuck doors opened!</string>
<string name="46897">Give me a powerful magical item.</string>
<string name="46898">Me wants magic item! Powerful magic item!</string>
<string name="46899">I don&apos;t want you to do anything for me.</string>
<string name="46900">Me not want you helping me at all!</string>
<string name="46901">Fine, I will do this.</string>
<string name="46902">Me can do this.</string>
<string name="46903">So without those talismans you&apos;re trapped here?</string>
<string name="46904">So if you not get jewelry you be trapped here?</string>
<string name="46905">I will not do this for you!</string>
<string name="46906">If me gets talismans, me is keeping!</string>
<string name="46907"></string>
<string name="46908"></string>
<string name="46909">I have one of your talismans here.</string>
<string name="46910">Hey! Me gots you jewelry here now!</string>
<string name="46911">Fine, you may help me then,</string>
<string name="46912">Me changes mind. You can helps me.</string>
<string name="46913">No. I do not wish your aid.</string>
<string name="46914">Me not needs you do thing.</string>
<string name="46915">How do I know that I can trust you?</string>
<string name="46916">Me not thinking me can trust you.</string>
<string name="46917">A visitor? This is unexpected. Please, do not let the old tales of demons dissuade you from... talking. There is much help I can give you.</string>
<string name="46918">The choice is yours mortal, though you know not what you refuse. Should you decide to accept my offer I shall be here, waiting to... help you.</string>
<string name="46919">Revealing my true name to a mortal is how I was bound into the service of the mage Layenne and stripped of my power; I will not make that mistake again.</string>
<string name="46920">Why, I can give you so many things. And I can do things for you, too. I can... help you.</string>
<string name="46921">But you will need to help me, too. You will need to bring me... things. Things that I need to restore my lost power so that I can... help you.</string>
<string name="46922">I am a succubus, a demon. I have power, mortal. Do you want magic? I have great magic to give you.</string>
<string name="46923">Or I can perform a service for you. There are doors within this temple, doors that cannot be easily opened. I will open them, if you wish.</string>
<string name="46924">If you help me, mortal, your reward will be great. This I promise you.</string>
<string name="46925"></string>
<string name="46926">I have no interest in your soul, mortal. My only desire is to escape the spell that binds me to this tomb. For this I need your help... and I offer my own help to you in return.</string>
<string name="46927">Greetings once more, mortal. Have you brought me my missing jewelry? I need the precious talismans if I am to use their power to help you.</string>
<string name="46928">My promise to serve you binds me even as I am bound to this tomb. This single talisman cannot free me, but it gives me enough power to serve you.</string>
<string name="46929">My power is fully restored! I am free from this wretched prison and the oaths that bind me! Now, foolish mortal, your soul is mine to devour!</string>
<string name="46930">Tell me, mortal, what would you have me do? I can open this tomb&apos;s doors, so you may pass unhindered. Or I can give you powerful magic of the kind you mortals so desire.</string>
<string name="46931">Scattered about this tomb are... talismans... of my power. A ring, a necklace and a gem were taken from me when Layenne bound me to her service. </string>
<string name="46932">Layenne imprisoned me so that I might serve her, as mages are wont to do to my kind. Even her death long ago did not free me from this prison.</string>
<string name="46933">But if you were to bring me my jewelry, the talismans of my power, I could escape this servitude. In return, I could use my power to... help you.</string>
<string name="46934">Thank you, mortal. I will be waiting here for you to return with the talismans so that I might free myself... and help you.</string>
<string name="46935"></string>
<string name="46936">But without the talisman, I haven&apos;t the strength to... help you. Do not forsake me to this prison. If you help me, mortal, then I can help you. Please, I beg you for the talisman.</string>
<string name="46937">Then you must give it to me, so that I might regain some of my lost power so that I might... help you. Please, give me what is rightfully mine. </string>
<string name="46938">All you need know is that even after her death I am still bound to Layenne&apos;s service, trapped in this tomb, unable to retreat and too weak to break free of my magical bonds.</string>
<string name="46939">But if you would let me help you, and you would help me in return, I could escape this bondage and return to my home plane. Let me... help you.</string>
<string name="46940">Then it shall be so. Allow me to cast a spell, and then you will find the doors are opened.</string>
<string name="46941">Are you certain? I am bound to your service, mortal. I merely wish to... help you.</string>
<string name="46942">Yes, I can help you in... so many ways. Tell me, what would you have... me do?</string>
<string name="46943">My power is not yet fully restored. I am still bound to this place. Bring me the rest of my missing talismans so that I may be free and I shall grant you an even greater reward.</string>
<string name="46944">Yes, you wish for great power. I will summon forth an item from my plane to... help you. Take this item, mortal.</string>
<string name="46945">I am bound to honor my word, just as I am bound to this prison. I have promised to help you and so I must do as I have sworn.</string>
<string name="46946">Bring me my talismans and I will... help you. This is my solemn vow.</string>
<string name="46947">Mortal! Come over here!</string>
<string name="46948">How dare you defile the tomb of Layenne! You will burn for this intrusion!</string>
<string name="46949">30... </string>
<string name="46950">25... </string>

<string name="47078">Ritual Book</string>
<string name="47079">This tome details the process of capturing a dragon&apos;s essence within a dragon sphere:

The ritual is most effective when used upon a newly-hatched wyrm whose growth has been accelerated through the use of spells and rituals: a beast whose mind is still empty and pure. Only these have the vitality and energy of youth necessary to prolong the life of the mighty Klauth. 

The creature to be absorbed must be lured or trapped within the center of the ritual room, and the dragon sphere must be placed upon the pedestal. The dragon&apos;s body will be instantly consumed even as its very life force is sucked into the sphere for Klauth to feed on at his leisure.

But a warning, lest you displease the Master and suffer his terrible wrath: should a dead dragon&apos;s body be absorbed, the sphere must be destroyed immediately. If it is mistakenly presented to Klauth, the essence of the dead wyrm will poison him and deal a crippling blow to his awesome.</string>
<string name="47080">Dragon Sphere</string>
<string name="47081">This sphere is roughly the size of an ogre&apos;s head and appears to be made of polished black stone, though it is far lighter than one would first expect. The flawless surface is cool to the touch and seems to draw all light into it.</string>
<string name="47082">Dead Dragon Sphere</string>
<string name="47083">This sphere is roughly the size of an ogre&apos;s head and appears to be made of polished black stone, though it is far lighter than one would first expect. 

The sphere radiates a powerful heat, and on closer inspection there appears to be a winged shape lying motionless beneath the smooth, dark surface. It is the captured essence of a dead dragon.</string>
<string name="47084">Full Dragon Sphere</string>
<string name="47085">This sphere is roughly the size of an ogre&apos;s head and appears to be made of polished black stone, though it is far lighter than one would first expect. 

The sphere radiates a powerful heat, and on closer inspection there appears to be a draconic shape moving slowly beneath the smooth, dark surface. It is the captured essence of a living dragon.</string>

<string name="47105">Roughly the size of an ogre&apos;s fist, this crystal sphere is far heavier than it would appear. Inside the globe can be seen an exquisitely detailed miniature realm, right down to the tiny figures of dwarves and dryads populating the landscape. From time to time the position of these figures seems to shift and change, as if they were somehow moving too slowly for the naked eye to see. 

When flipped or turned, drifting flakes of snow swirl and settle over the figures within the globe, covering the tiny world in a blanket of purest white. There is also a strong aura of magic surrounding the snow globe, and you sense that, despite its fragile appearance, it would be virtually impossible to destroy the glass casing.</string>

<string name="47125">Blood stains the cover and many of the pages of this diary. Most of the entries are written in a firm, bold hand and describe the day-to-day activities of a settler family as they worked the fields and tilled the land. The final entry is written in a finer script:

&quot;The Uthgardt fell upon us as we were working in the fields. There was no warning and we can find no reason for the sudden attack. Father stumbled when an arrow took him in the leg but, while the savages hacked away at his fallen form, Mother and I escaped to the homestead and barred the doors. 

&quot;There is no escape for us now: the barbarians have the home surrounded. The soldiers at Fort Ilkard are too far away to arrive in time to save us, and I fear our neighbors are already dead. I can only pray that, when the savages break through the door, our deaths are merciful and quick.&quot;</string>

It also contains a detailed examination of all the perils associated with sea travel in general. A short chapter on the pleasures of swimming has been included as a hand-written appendix to the end of the book, but given Islegood&apos;s well-documented fear of water, the addendum is likely a forgery by some anonymous prankster.</string>

<string name="47159">This remarkable stone is obviously a time crystal. According to legend, the power of these stones can be used as a catalyst to facilitate the process of time travel. However, most accounts indicate that the magic of the time crystals can only be unlocked when used in conjuction with a temporal conduit such as a time portal or time sink.</string>
<string name="47160">Time Crystal</string>
<string name="47161">This book is written in an ancient language you cannot understand. In the margins, however, someone has scribbled notes in the common tongue detailing how the time crystals can be used to travel back to ancient days:

&quot;The Creators built this complex over a time sink, and constructed several sundials that tap into the heart of the temporal instability. Using a time crystal on one of these sundials activates the time sink, drawing the person back into the ancient past. Using the crystal on the sundial in the past will return the person to the future.

&quot;In my explorations of the ancient past, I have discovered several interesting anomalies associated with time travel. First, it is not possible to travel beyond the range of the time sink&apos;s influence. For this reason I have only been able to explore the complex itself, despite my desire to see the world as it was before the changing climate covered the land in ice and snow. 

Also, I have discovered that it is not possible to bring certain items back from the past into the present. This is likely an inherent aspect of temporal displacement that minimizes paradoxes and disruptions of the time stream. This is fortunate, for I shudder to think of the consequences if the Creators had ever discovered a way to travel from the past into our own time. 

&quot;Had another run-in with the Creator Race during my last visit to the past. Those walking lizards surprised me in a dead-end hall. It was all I could do to escape with my life. I am beginning to wonder if further exploration of these ruins is truly worth the risk.&quot;</string>

&quot;The enslaved fairy will guide you through the ritual of sound, for she is bound to the magic of the gongs. 

&quot;To complete the ritual of smoke you must cast the blessed powders on the sacred brazier so that their combinations match the descending order of the stones set into brazier&apos;s base.

&quot;The ritual of light can only be completed using the stones drawn from the holy pool. Begin by placing any two of the single stones in the primary pillars. The secondary pillars must then be filled with the twin gems that match the corresponding color that would be created by combining the hues of the stones in the primary pillar.

&quot;You may keep this letter for a fortnight, and then you will be tested on what you have learned. Master the secrets of the rituals and the Queen will be pleased with you. Fail to learn them and you shall suffer a grisly fate.&quot;</string>

&quot;Dearest Mathilda:

&quot;I meant to send this note to offer you words of comfort, but even in a letter I cannot lie to you, my love. In the morning I am being sent out on patrol to verify reports of a strange ruin found far to the south of Fort Ilkard. It is further south than even the newly settled homesteads and farmlands. The last two patrols sent out were set upon by the Uthgardt and brutally slaughtered, and I fear I may suffer the same fate. 

&quot;Yet I am more troubled by the ever-growing number of reports of defenseless settlers being butchered by the savages. I fear the homestead is no longer safe. You must take the children and flee to Neverwinter as soon as you can.

&quot;I would come to escort you myself, but Commander Damas has a heart of stone. He has ordered anyone caught leaving their post without authorization to be hung as a deserter without trial. All I can do is send this note and pray it reaches you before the Uthgardt do.

Love, Willem&quot;</string>

&quot;I believe I have at last unlocked the keys to creating the Staff of Command! As I suspected all along, the key ingredients were rakshasa eyes and a quartz crystal. However, determining the proper spell to cast on the components once they were combined in my laboratory was not as simple as I had at first assumed.

&quot;My error came in looking for an obscure solution, and missing the stunningly obvious answer right in front of me. Of course the necessary spell to create a Staff of Command is Dominance.

&quot;I must remember this valuable lesson: the most obvious solution is often the right one, even when dealing with the arcane.</string>

&quot;As I suspected, there are a number of natural pools in these underground chambers that can be easily converted into summoning cisterns.

&quot;The Mountain Witch is no more! I have defeated the Hag Nebacha in a summoning duel.

&quot;I began with a standard opening, the summoning of a feral cat. She countered with the rather predictable conjuration of a large hunting dog to best my feline.
I then escalated the proceedings by summoning a great bear to devour her canine champion.

&quot;Nebacha was not expecting such a bold move. Caught off guard, she summoned a great red dragon, a classic case of panicked over-reaction. Needless to say the wyrm was enraged at her foolishness, and promptly devoured her.

&quot;Perhaps I should commemorate this victory in a song: something that encompasses the essence of all the combatants in the duel: feline, canine, ursine and draconic.&quot;</string>

&quot;A wise chieftain knows there is a time for war and there is a time for allegiance with and submission to a greater power. The time for petty warfare and tribal strife among the giants is over. King Skrogg has already bowed to my greatness, and has reaped the rewards for his people. Now I demand the same from you.

&quot;As proof or your allegiance I require tribute in the form of undamaged, living eggs seized from the lairs of the dragons throughout these mountains. Should you agree to my terms I will reward you with a thousand pieces of gold for each dragon egg delivered to my lair. Should you refuse I will destroy you and all your tribe. 

&quot;You may give your answer to my envoy, who will convey your message back to me with the utmost urgency.

A common nursery rhyme goes &quot;Silvanus&apos; wife went mad one night, murdering her child by candlelight.&quot;</string>
<string name="47457">Often called the &quot;Poor Man&apos;s Ruby,&quot; the common Garnet is nevertheless a distinct and attractive blood-red gem in its own right. The violet form, also called Rhodolite, is the rarest, most prized, and most valuable.</string>

<string name="47611">Lesser Robe of Eyes</string>
<string name="47612">This colorful robe is marked all over with patterns that look vaguely like eyes. </string>
<string name="47613">The lesser robe of eyes, like its more powerful counterpart, provides the wearer with improved vision and the ability to detect many things that are hidden. Once per day, the wearer can invoke the power of the robe to pierce the veil of invisibility or etherealness.

When not fully armored, the more powerful clerics of Helm often wear such robes to allow them to maintain their vigilance, even when unable to maintain their armament.</string>
<string name="47614">Robe of Scintillating Colors</string>
<string name="47615">This light robe is woven of many different brightly-colored wools and gives off a faint aura of magic.</string>
<string name="47616">The wearer can cause the Robe of Scintillating Colors to become a shifting pattern of incredible hues, color after color cascading from the upper part of the robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows of dazzling light.  The colors daze those near the wearer, conceal the wearer, and illuminate the surroundings.

The first of such robes was said to have been made by a Halruaan Lliira-worshipper named Persephenon.  An unusual Halruaan, Persephenon showed talent for sorcery rather than wizardry.  This social stigma, combined with his pursuit of the Joybringer&apos;s path and his flamboyant personality, put Persephenon at odds with his contemporaries.  

Despite these obstacles, Persephenon was appointed captain of a skyship.  He made his robe as a tribute to Lliira, in order to paint rainbows across the sky as he flew.

This undignified behavior ultimately lost Persephenon his captaincy and later led to his exile from Halruaa.  Welcomed in Luiren by the less-rigid halfling culture, Persephenon enjoyed a happy life and copies of his robes have similarly enjoyed a favored place among the hin bards.</string>

<string name="47673">You&apos;re right, Aarin. You can&apos;t help me with this anyway.</string>
<string name="47674">You right. You can&apos;t help me &apos;bout this anyhow.</string>
<string name="47675">I understand, Aarin. You have sworn your loyalty to this city.</string>
<string name="47676">Me understand, Aarin. You swear you be loyal to Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="47677">What are you saying, Aarin?</string>
<string name="47678">What you say, Aarin?</string>
<string name="47679">If your place is here then my place is by your side, Aarin.</string>
<string name="47680">If you got stay here then me stay with you, Aarin.</string>
<string name="47681">I wanted to see how you were holding up, Aarin.</string>
<string name="47682">Me just want to know how you hold up, Aarin.</string>
<string name="47683">You must stay strong, Aarin. Neverwinter needs you. I need you.</string>
<string name="47684">Stay strong, Aarin. Neverwinter need you. Me need you.</string>
<string name="47685">We will survive this, Aarin. I believe that.</string>
<string name="47686">You not worry, Aarin. We gonna survive this. Me know it.</string>
<string name="47687">Don&apos;t despair over what the future may bring, Aarin. Cherish what we have now.</string>
<string name="47688">You not be sad over stuff that not even happen yet. Be happy for what we have now.</string>
<string name="47689">Stay alive, Aarin. Promise me this. Whatever happens I will find you!</string>
<string name="47690">Stay alive, Aarin. Promise. No matter what happen me will find you!</string>
<string name="47691">Aribeth might have said the same thing when Fenthick was executed.</string>
<string name="47692">Maybe Aribeth say same thing when Fenthick be killed.</string>
<string name="47693">These are indeed dark times, &lt;FullName&gt; - though not so dark as Lord Nasher portrays them. The people of Neverwinter are made of sterner stuff than any of us imagine.</string>
<string name="47694">You should speak to Haedraline before you go, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Maybe she will tell you something about the Source Stone or the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="47695">She arrived here shortly after the third Word of Power was delivered to Castle Never. Lord Nasher suspected she was a spy and had her imprisoned in the dungeons.</string>
<string name="47696">After Aribeth&apos;s betrayal he has grown overly cautious, and I fear it has made Haedraline mistrustful of us. She did tell us about the Source Stone beneath the castle, but nothing beyond that.</string>
<string name="47697">Maybe you could try speaking to her. She trusts you. And I sense there&apos;s something important she&apos;s not telling us about the Words of Power and that Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47698">She&apos;s locked away in the castle dungeon. Just head south and down the stairs.</string>
<string name="47699">You must speak with Lord Nasher first, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="47700">Yes, &lt;FirstName&gt; - there is still much that must be done if Neverwinter is to be saved.</string>
<string name="47701">But if Neverwinter is to survive we must all play our part. My place is here, by Lord Nasher&apos;s side. I must oversee every aspect of the defense of the city.</string>
<string name="47702">My instincts tell me that she is the key if Neverwinter is to be saved - and I have learned to trust my instincts. </string>
<string name="47703">I once knew every secret in this city, but these are turbulent times and even I am left stumbling in the dark. Yet I will tell you whatever I can.</string>
<string name="47704">Lord Nasher would never consent to that, I&apos;m afraid. Not while we are besieged by a hostile army.</string>
<string name="47705">I doubt it would help, in any case. She does not trust us, plain and simple. Perhaps because of Aribeth&apos;s actions Haedraline fears everyone from Neverwinter is corruptible.</string>
<string name="47706">I&apos;ll do my best to help you.</string>
<string name="47707">Lord Nasher gave them to Master Ford, chief archeologist of Neverwinter. He believes there is a link between the Words and the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47708">But Master Ford has not been able to learn anything more about the Words of Power or the Source Stone, unfortunately.</string>
<string name="47709">Ever since we unearthed the Stone beneath the castle, Master Ford has spent all his time studying it.</string>
<string name="47710">You can speak to him yourself, if you want to know more. Although I suspect you would find talking to Haedraline more productive.</string>
<string name="47711">Haedraline told us about the Source Stone and secret door beneath Castle Never. As spy master I&apos;m embarrassed to admit I never suspected there were hidden chambers beneath our dungeons before this.</string>
<string name="47712">When we found the Stone Lord Nasher put Master Ford, Neverwinter&apos;s leading archeological expert, in charge of studying it.</string>
<string name="47713">But so far the Source Stone has refused to give up its secrets. If you want to know more about it you should speak with Master Ford.</string>
<string name="47714">Things have calmed since the initial onslaught. The defenders fell back to the City Core, but I do not know how long we will be able to hold it.</string>
<string name="47715">We are badly outnumbered, and Aribeth knew every inch of this city. All her knowledge is being used against us now.</string>
<string name="47716">I doubt it would help. Aribeth has likely shared our every weakness with all her generals by now.</string>
<string name="47717">If Maugrim were killed it might break the enemy&apos;s spirit, though in truth that also seems unlikely.</string>
<string name="47718">Normally Luskan forces are but cowards and raiders. They hit and run. This time, however, something is different. Some sinister force drives our enemies forward.</string>
<string name="47719">And there is a pall lingering in the air, a dark cloud hanging over all the defenders and driving them to despair.</string>
<string name="47720">Reinforcements from the Lords&apos; Alliance are on their way, but I do not know if we can hold out until they get here.</string>
<string name="47721">Maugrim&apos;s death has had little effect on the battle. It seems he was not the true force behind our enemy.</string>
<string name="47722">He was once a great adventurer, you know. I wish you could have known him then - a true hero in all his magnificent glory.</string>
<string name="47723">He is a different man now. Still a good man, but the bureaucracy and responsibility of leadership weigh heavily on him. He has grown somber and serious.</string>
<string name="47724">And now, in Neverwinter&apos;s darkest hour, I fear he has given in to complete despair. Aribeth&apos;s betrayal, the guilt over Fenthick&apos;s execution, the slaughter of his people... sometimes the burden on Lord Nasher is too great.</string>
<string name="47725">Once you have spoken with him you may return and speak to me.</string>
<string name="47726">Surely you must feel it, &lt;FirstName&gt;? There is a shadow over Neverwinter, a curse that drags down morale and inspires our enemy.</string>
<string name="47727">Perhaps, on some level, the people of Neverwinter feel they deserve to suffer. I know Lord Nasher feels such guilt, at least. For what happened to Fenthick.</string>
<string name="47728">It&apos;s one thing to say the law is always right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But there are exceptions to every rule.</string>
<string name="47729">Fenthick&apos;s execution was legal, but even while he was pronouncing sentence I suspect Lord Nasher knew justice was not being served.</string>
<string name="47730">Fenthick&apos;s death was born of anger and vengeance, plain and simple - the same motives behind Aribeth&apos;s betrayal. Lord Nasher is well aware we reap what we sow.</string>
<string name="47731">For all our sakes, I hope he is given that chance. Is there something else I might do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="47732">There is that hope. Lord Nasher will think long and hard before he executes Aribeth, I suspect. He may even let her live, if Neverwinter survives this invasion.</string>
<string name="47733">It pains me to talk of her. There was a time when I considered her a champion of Neverwinter and I called her &apos;friend&apos;.</string>
<string name="47734">Her betrayal struck us all hard, especially Lord Nasher. He will not admit it, but I imagine the situation was made even worse by the guilt he felt over Fenthick&apos;s execution.</string>
<string name="47735">I make no excuse for Aribeth&apos;s actions, but seeing the cheering crowds at her lover&apos;s execution might very well be what turned her against the city.</string>
<string name="47736">You cannot let your emotions get the better of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Aribeth has detailed information about the enemy that we need.</string>
<string name="47737">I agree with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;... but it is not as simple as that. Aribeth&apos;s crimes cannot simply be ignored. Be glad we are not the ones who must decide her fate.</string>
<string name="47738">Lord Nasher was haunted by Fenthick&apos;s execution, just as Aribeth was. Maybe, given a second chance, he would have acted differently.</string>
<string name="47739">Now, with Aribeth, he must face not only her betrayal but the demons of his own failures. But he is a good man, and in the end I trust he will make the wise decision.</string>
<string name="47740">As long as this war goes on, Aribeth has to be kept alive. She has already given us information that has saved the lives of hundreds of our civilians.</string>
<string name="47741">I hope Lord Nasher remembers that, if Neverwinter survives.</string>
<string name="47742">But now is not the time to discuss whether Aribeth&apos;s actions were justified. We must stay focused on finding a way to save the city.</string>
<string name="47743">I understand your concern for her, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I do not know what to tell you. Her fate has yet to be decided.</string>
<string name="47744">As long as the war continues, Lord Nasher will keep her alive so she can continue to provide information about the Luskan forces.</string>
<string name="47745">I normally consider myself well informed, &lt;FirstName&gt; - particularly when it comes to matters directly concerning the defense of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="47746">What&apos;s this? You were not aware of this turn of events? I see I was not the only one caught unawares. Aribeth arrived a short time ago, alone. She surrendered herself without a fight.</string>
<string name="47747">We were suspicious at first, but the information she has given us about the Luskan army has allowed many of our people to escape the city with their lives.</string>
<string name="47748">Neverwinter may still fall, but at the very least there are hundreds of our people who owe Aribeth their lives. I hope Lord Nasher takes that into account.</string>
<string name="47749">Nothing, yet. As long as we are at war he shall keep her alive to provide us with information about the Luskan troops.</string>
<string name="47750">If we survive this war... I do not know. The law is clear enough; the penalty for Aribeth&apos;s betrayal is death.</string>
<string name="47751">After that... well, the law is clear. But the law demanded Fenthick&apos;s death as well, and the consequences of his execution are plain for all to see.</string>
<string name="47752">Seeing you here I cannot help but wonder what further surprises you might bring my way.</string>
<string name="47753">And your own part is one you know all too well. You must save Neverwinter once more - though how you might accomplish this I cannot say. Perhaps the creature Haedraline knows something of this.</string>
<string name="47754">Organizing our remaing troops to withstand the next Luskan assault requires all my attention, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If the enemy breaches the City Core we are lost.</string>
<string name="47755">I am afraid I can only spare a few moments for you, though I will try to help you however I can.</string>
<string name="47756">Some of my operatives reported that you had recovered the fourth Word of Power, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I wasn&apos;t surprised, given all your previous accomplishments.</string>
<string name="47757">And what good will this Word do us? We already have three of the damn things!</string>
<string name="47758">Now that we have all four Words we may be able to unlock their power, Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="47759">And just how are we supposed to do that, Gend? Do you know how to use them?</string>
<string name="47760">No - but I suspect Haedraline understands their mysteries. She might be willing to share her secrets with &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="47761">You should quit wasting Gend&apos;s time, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Go speak with Haedraline if you think the Word is any use.</string>
<string name="47762">I am afraid Lord Nasher is right - you should speak to Haedraline about this. Is there anything else you need, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="47763">Yes, I heard he met a fittingly violent end. Yet the enemy&apos;s spirit is not broken. Others step forward from the ranks to assume the leadership of Luskan&apos;s army.</string>
<string name="47764">As we feared, there is some darker power behind the invaders than even Maugrim. All we can do is hold on as long as we are able, and pray help arrives in time.</string>
<string name="47765">Is there something else you need, &lt;FirstName&gt;? If not, I should get back to my reconnaissance reports.</string>
<string name="47766">Haedraline does not trust us, I fear. Understandable, considering the reception she received upon her arrival. You are the only one she is willing to speak to.</string>
<string name="47767">Perhaps it would be best if you kept her secrets. If she wishes to share them with us she will send for either Lord Nasher or myself.</string>
<string name="47768">If we had the manpower I would place an entire company at your disposal. But I need every warm body on the battle lines just to keep Luskan from taking the City Core.</string>
<string name="47769">You will have to act on Haedraline&apos;s information on your own, I&apos;m afraid. Is there anything else I can help you with, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="47770">I am more than just a spymaster now, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am responsible for coordinating the entire defense of Neverwinter. I will not risk alienating a potential ally in Haedraline.</string>
<string name="47771">I trust you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I suspect that whatever information Haedraline has shared is something I cannot help you with in any case.</string>
<string name="47772">I must confess I was somewhat embarassed at having no advance warning when Aribeth appeared at the gates to surrender herself to Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="47773">And yet, I know Lord Nasher deeply regrets Fenthick&apos;s execution and the turmoil it brought upon the city. And he rarely makes the same mistake twice. I suppose we shall just have to wait and see.</string>
<string name="47774">Heavy is the head that wears the crown, they say. There is little we can do for him, other than trying to save the city. Is there anything else, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="47775">So now you know how things stand, my love - though I do not think the picture so bleak as Lord Nasher paints it. There is a deep strength in Neverwinter and its people.</string>
<string name="47776">I had hoped that, after recovering the Words of Power, we might have a chance to be together... but duty calls. I still serve Neverwinter and Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="47777">When this is over maybe we can finally be together, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But until then we each have our part to play. I must stay here with Lord Nasher to oversee the defenses of the city.</string>
<string name="47778">Ah, my love - it is good to see you again. I only wish it were under less trying circumstances.</string>
<string name="47779">I will not lie to you, it has not been easy. All my time and energy are poured into organizing the defenses of the city.</string>
<string name="47780">Our troops are badly outnumbered and morale is dangerously low. Lord Nasher has all but given in to despair. It is hard not to do the same. </string>
<string name="47781">Sometimes the memory of your love and the hope that we can finally be together when this is over are all that keep me going.</string>
<string name="47782">Why is life so unfair, &lt;FirstName&gt;? We have only just found each other, and now events seem as if they might tear us apart.</string>
<string name="47783">I cannot promise you that, my love. If Neverwinter should fall I will fight to the very end to defend her from the Luskan horde.</string>
<string name="47784">You are right, my love - as ever. The future is uncertain, there is no sense brooding over it.</string>
<string name="47785">I see your point, my love. Nobody ever said the world was fair.</string>
<string name="47786">Few people in the world are lucky enough to have what we share. Whatever the future brings, we must be grateful for our time together.</string>
<string name="47787">I am glad you stand with me in this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But if we are to save Neverwinter we cannot let our feelings for each other distract us. We must stay focused on the task at hand.</string>
<string name="47788">As well as can be expected, my love. These are difficult times for all concerned.</string>
<string name="47789">On some level, my love, I even understand Aribeth&apos;s actions. I might have done the same, were you to suffer Fenthick&apos;s fate.</string>
<string name="47790">So you think if Morag awakes she&apos;ll turn the North into a tropical jungle?</string>
<string name="47791">Morag make winter go away? She got big magic!</string>
<string name="47792">Morag was foolish to trust her fate to a group of slaves.</string>
<string name="47793">Morag be stupid, hoping slaves wake her up!</string>
<string name="47794">How did Maugrim become involved in all this?</string>
<string name="47795">How Maugrim get in this stuff?</string>
<string name="47796">Why would she imprison herself inside this Source Stone?</string>
<string name="47797">Why Morag go inside stone?</string>
<string name="47798">But the Words of Power are safe here in Castle Never!</string>
<string name="47799">What are you doing in this prison?</string>
<string name="47800">Who are you again?</string>
<string name="47801">Morag? Source Stone? Old Ones? I&apos;m lost.</string>
<string name="47802">Sorry, I can&apos;t help you with this.</string>
<string name="47803">But Power Words be safe in castle!</string>
<string name="47804">Why you in this jail?</string>
<string name="47805">Who you be?</string>
<string name="47806">Morag? Old Ones? Source Stone? Me lost.</string>
<string name="47807">Sorry. Me not help you with this.</string>
<string name="47808">What must I do?</string>
<string name="47809">What me need do?</string>
<string name="47810">I will return once I have the final Word of Power!</string>
<string name="47811">Me be back when me got last Power Word.</string>
<string name="47812">How do I know I can trust you?</string>
<string name="47813">Me not trust lizard girly.</string>
<string name="47814">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="47815">Me want ask you stuff.</string>
<string name="47816">Tell me about Maugrim.</string>
<string name="47817">Tell me about Aribeth.</string>
<string name="47818">Tell me about you.</string>
<string name="47819">Tell me about Morag and the Old Ones.</string>
<string name="47820">Tell me about the Words of Power and the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47821">Me want know stuff &apos;bout Maugrim.</string>
<string name="47822">Me want know stuff &apos;bout Aribeth.</string>
<string name="47823">Me want know stuff &apos;bout you.</string>
<string name="47824">Me want know stuff &apos;bout Morag and Oldies.</string>
<string name="47825">Me want know stuff &apos;bout Power Words and Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47826">Then all is lost!</string>
<string name="47827">Surely there must be something we can do.</string>
<string name="47828">I knew I couldn&apos;t trust you!</string>
<string name="47829">You mean we is going to lose?</string>
<string name="47830">Me not give up! Me got do something!</string>
<string name="47831">Me know me not trust you, lizard girly!</string>
<string name="47832">I will enter the Source Stone and destroy Morag!</string>
<string name="47833">How can I enter the Source Stone?</string>
<string name="47834">I&apos;m not going to do this!</string>
<string name="47835">Where are the Words of Power now?</string>
<string name="47836">Me go into Source Stone and kill Morag!</string>
<string name="47837">How me get inside Source Stone?</string>
<string name="47838">Me not want do this!</string>
<string name="47839">Where be Power Words now?</string>
<string name="47840">What does this have to do with me?</string>
<string name="47841">What this got do with me?</string>
<string name="47842">I am Haedraline, Word Slave and handmaiden to Morag of the Old Ones before she was entombed in the Source Stone. **hiss** </string>
<string name="47843">Morag was the Queen of my people - the Old Ones, the Creator Race. **hiss** It was she who created the Source Stone when the world became cold and the snow covered the land.</string>
<string name="47844">Morag used the Words to put her people into a deep hibernation when the cold winter came, imprisoning the heat of the steam fissures in the magical Source Stone - and her and all her people with it.</string>
<string name="47845">Within the Source Stone Morag would gather her strength year after year, century after century. **hiss** When her power waxed full, we Word Slaves would awaken the Queen to banish the never ending winter.</string>
<string name="47846">The Source Stone is buried beneath the streets of Neverwinter, and even in its dormant state the magical heat radiating from within keeps the city habitable during the coldest blizzards.</string>
<string name="47847">Imagine what will happen when the power is awakened fully and released. Those who survive the global warming will become slaves to the Creators, and I will be bound to the Words of Power once more. **hiss** I will not allow this to happen!</string>
<string name="47848">You do not comprehend the magic that once bound the Word Slaves to the Words! **hiss** We were compelled to obey, even though our Masters slept. But Morag underestimated us.</string>
<string name="47849">Abandoned in the frozen waste, we grew strong enough to free ourselves from our wretched servitude. **hiss** We scattered the Words that their power might never enslave us again, and our Masters might never awake.</string>
<string name="47850">Something has awakened Morag&apos;s spirit - though her body and true power remain trapped in the Source Stone for now. She speaks to Maugrim through projections as I am speaking to you.</string>
<string name="47851">Maugrim serves her, a pawn blinded by her promises of rewards and power. **hiss** The plague was the first step in Morag&apos;s return. Each death fed the Queen&apos;s power, bringing her closer to a true awakening.</string>
<string name="47852">Now Maugrim seeks to wake the Old Ones with the Words of Power. If he succeeds Morag will bring complete and utter devastation to the North.</string>
<string name="47853">The Old Ones could not survive the coming of the endless winter. **hiss** Morag sought a shelter where she could escape the death of ice and cold.</string>
<string name="47854">**hiss** I have been waiting for you, &lt;FullName&gt;. These other warm bloods are weak. **hiss** I do not trust them.</string>
<string name="47855">Maugrim has unlocked the magic of the Words of Power. **hiss** The Old Ones awake and the world you know shall be no more.</string>
<string name="47856">Three of the Words are here in this castle. **hiss** But there are four Words of Power in all. Maugrim has found the final Word, strongest of them all.</string>
<string name="47857">**hiss** I came here to warn your people against Morag&apos;s return, but the warm bloods do not trust me. **hiss** They cast me into this dungeon.</string>
<string name="47858">Do not waste time trying to free me from this prison - it serves no purpose. **hiss** Instead, you must help me stop Morag&apos;s return before the Old Ones awake and I am made a Word Slave once more.</string>
<string name="47859">Then we are all doomed. **hiss** Maugrim will raise the lizard queen and the warm bloods will be cast down. And I will be enslaved once more.</string>
<string name="47860">**hiss** I came to warn your people of Morag&apos;s return, but the warm bloods do not trust me. **hiss** They cast me into this dungeon.</string>
<string name="47861">Three of the Words are here in this castle. **hiss** But there are four Words of Power in all. Maugrim has the other.</string>
<string name="47862">Long ago the world was hot and lush jungle covered this land of ice and snow. The Creator Race ruled - enslaving the warm bloods and other lesser races.</string>
<string name="47863">The fourth Word is close - I can feel its power. **hiss** Maugrim and Aribeth brought it here to this city you call Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="47864">You must hurry, &lt;FullName&gt;. **hiss** With each passing hour Morag&apos;s power grows. Soon I will not be strong enough to stop my Queen from awakening her people. </string>
<string name="47865">Bring the Word to me. I am Haedraline, leader of the Word Slaves. **hiss** With the final Word I can break Morag&apos;s power and trap her forever inside the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47866">You must trust me, &lt;FullName&gt;. **hiss** If not, Morag will awaken the Old Ones and Neverwinter will be destroyed.</string>
<string name="47867">Your kind are ever curious, &lt;race&gt; one. A curse of your warm blood, perhaps. **hiss** Our time grows short, but I will answer your questions.</string>
<string name="47868">Maugrim is nothing but a foolish pawn. **hiss** Morag twists and warps his mind, and in the end she will destroy him.</string>
<string name="47869">My Queen has promised him power but when the Old Ones awake he will be enslaved with the rest of the lesser races.</string>
<string name="47870">The one you call Aribeth has fallen under Morag&apos;s spell. Some terrible fate left her vulnerable to Morag&apos;s corrupting evil. </string>
<string name="47871">My Queen touched her mind through her dreams, feeding a dark and festering hatred until it consumed all else. Aribeth is a slave to Morag&apos;s evil now.</string>
<string name="47872">I am Haedraline, handmaiden of Morag and last of the Word Slaves. **hiss** When my people vanished my kind were left behind, bound to the will of our Mistress by the power of the Words.</string>
<string name="47873">Forced to survive the endless winter, we Word Slaves grew strong in our torment. **hiss** We broke the magic bonds of our fell Queen and found our freedom.</string>
<string name="47874">We scattered the Words of Power so the Old Ones might never wake to enslave us again. **hiss** But Maugrim has disturbed the Source Stone and Morag stirs once more.</string>
<string name="47875">Long ago, when even the elves were young, the world was hot and jungle covered this frozen waste. This was the time of my people: the Creator Race, the Old Ones.</string>
<string name="47876">The Old Ones enslaved the lesser races, and all bowed to us and the terrible power of Morag, our Queen.</string>
<string name="47877">But then the long winter came. To survive, Morag placed her people into a deep hibernation within the Source Stone, to await the day they might rise and reclaim what was once theirs.</string>
<string name="47878">Morag created the Source Stone with the power of the Words, **hiss** capturing the essence of fire within the gem even as the world began to grow cold around her people.</string>
<string name="47879">Morag placed her people in a deep hibernation within the Source Stone&apos;s core. **hiss** In her slumber the Queen&apos;s power grew, so one day she might use the Words to rise again and banish the endless winter.</string>
<string name="47880">If Morag fully awakens the true power of the Source Stone will be unleashed. This land of ice will become steaming jungle and the Old Ones will return to enslave the lesser races as they did at the dawn of time.</string>
<string name="47881">You have returned, &lt;race&gt; one. You must listen to my words if Morag&apos;s rebirth is to be stopped.</string>
<string name="47882">You are back, &lt;race&gt; one. **hiss** But I do not feel the presence of the final Word of Power.</string>
<string name="47883">You must find Maugrim and the fourth Word of Power. **hiss** Only if I have all four will I be able to try and stop Morag&apos;s return.</string>
<string name="47884"> I sense you have the Word of Power, &lt;race&gt; one. **hiss** But you have come too late - Morag has grown too strong.</string>
<string name="47885">Soon my Mistress will have the power to break free of the Source Stone even without the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="47886">I am only a Word Slave, I can do nothing against the growing power of my Queen. **hiss** But where I have failed, you may yet succeed, &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="47887">&lt;Race&gt; fool! **hiss** Morag&apos;s return means slavery and torments for me beyond any you can imagine. This is no betrayal on my part.</string>
<string name="47888">She has feasted on the souls of the plague victims and fed her power through the rituals of Maugrim. **hiss**. I can no longer stop her return.</string>
<string name="47889">You could enter the Source Stone itself and confront Morag before she reclaims her full power. You could destroy her before she awakens the Old Ones.</string>
<string name="47890">Morag&apos;s power has grown too strong. Soon she will be able to escape the Source Stone even without the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="47891">You must use the Words to enter the Source Stone itself and confront her before her magic becomes unstoppable!</string>
<string name="47892">**hiss** You must hurry. Every delay allows Morag to grow stronger. **hiss** I wish you luck for the sake of us all.</string>
<string name="47893">The Source Stone is located in the dungeons beneath this castle. **hiss** I have already told this to the warm blood you call Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="47894">There are four pedestals surrounding the Source Stone. **hiss** Place the Words of Power on the pedestals and you will be drawn into the very heart of the Source Stone itself.</string>
<string name="47895">Then Morag shall triumph and the city you call Neverwinter shall fall. The world you know will be washed away in the fire of the Old Ones&apos; return.</string>
<string name="47896">If this is your choice, &lt;race&gt; one, I can do nothing. But it is a foolish choice. **hiss** Speak to me again if you come to your senses.</string>
<string name="47897">The three Words recovered outside the city were in the possession of the warm blood known as Lord Nasher. **hiss** If he is wise he will give them to you.</string>
<string name="47898">The fourth Word you recovered from Maugrim yourself. **hiss** You will need all four to enter the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47899">The fourth Word was recovered by &lt;CUSTOM4001&gt; from Maugrim. **hiss** All four are necessary to enter the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47900">The other warm bloods are weak in spirit and will - I do not trust them. **hiss** If you come to your senses, &lt;race&gt; one, come and speak to me again. **hiss** Only you can stop Morag.</string>
<string name="47901">They are weak, like the ones you call Aribeth and Maugrim. **hiss** They cannot stand against the Creators now that Morag stirs within the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47902">I should be going now.</string>
<string name="47903">Me go now.</string>
<string name="47904">Where can I find Haedraline?</string>
<string name="47905">Where me find Haedraline?</string>
<string name="47906">Lord Nasher, may I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="47907">Me want ask you some stuff.</string>
<string name="47908">What can you tell me about Haedraline?</string>
<string name="47909">What can you tell me about the Words of Power that were brought here earlier?</string>
<string name="47910">What can you tell me about the Source Stone?</string>
<string name="47911">What&apos;s the latest news from the battle lines?</string>
<string name="47912">I&apos;m interested in knowing more about you, Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="47913">What you know &apos;bout Haedraline lizard girly?</string>
<string name="47914">What you know &apos;bout Power Words that was brought here earlier?</string>
<string name="47915">What you know &apos;bout Source Stone?</string>
<string name="47916">You got news &apos;bout how war going?</string>
<string name="47917">Me want know stuff &apos;bout you.</string>
<string name="47918">Can you let Haedraline out of the dungeon?</string>
<string name="47919">Maybe you let lizard girly out of dungeon, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="47920">I would like to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="47921">Me want ask you other stuff.</string>
<string name="47922">Where can I find Master Ford?</string>
<string name="47923">Where me find Master Ford?</string>
<string name="47924">What if I could kill Aribeth and Maugrim?</string>
<string name="47925">Is there no one who will come to our aid?</string>
<string name="47926">What if me kill Aribeth and Maugrim? That help, maybe.</string>
<string name="47927">Ain&apos;t you got no friends who come help you?</string>
<string name="47928">I want to ask you about Aribeth.</string>
<string name="47929">Me want ask you &apos;bout Aribeth.</string>
<string name="47930">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="47931">What you mean?</string>
<string name="47932">You followed the law, Lord Nasher. You had no choice.</string>
<string name="47933">What is done is done, Lord Nasher. No sense dwelling on it now.</string>
<string name="47934">Fenthick&apos;s execution may have been wrong, but it does not excuse Aribeth&apos;s betrayal!</string>
<string name="47935">You just follow the law. You not have choice.</string>
<string name="47936">It be done now. You waste time if you think of it when it all over.</string>
<string name="47937">It maybe wrong for you kill Fenthick, but that not make what Aribeth do right!</string>
<string name="47938">Perhaps you can atone for what you have done.</string>
<string name="47939">Maybe you got chance for make it all better.</string>
<string name="47940">You&apos;re right. She deserves death.</string>
<string name="47941">Her death will only continue the cycle of vengeance and bloodshed.</string>
<string name="47942">You right. She need death.</string>
<string name="47943">You kill Aribeth, maybe someone else want come kill you. It never end.</string>
<string name="47944">What are you planning to do with Aribeth?</string>
<string name="47945">What you gonna do with Aribeth?</string>
<string name="47946">Aribeth is in your dungeon? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="47947">Aribeth be in you dungeon? What you talking about?</string>
<string name="47948">The law is the law, Lord Nasher. Aribeth deserves death.</string>
<string name="47949">There can be no forgiveness for what Aribeth has done, Lord Nasher. She deserves death.</string>
<string name="47950">The law be the law. It say she need die, she get death.</string>
<string name="47951">You not forgive her for what she done. Aribeth need death.</string>
<string name="47952">We meet again, &lt;FullName&gt;. As you know, I am Nasher Alagondar, Lord of Neverwinter. I was once an adventurer like you - though that was long ago.</string>
<string name="47953">Aarin Gend tells me you have done much in the defense of our city. For this I thank you, though I fear it was all in vain.</string>
<string name="47954">Do not give up hope, my Lord. We still have the Words of Power, after all.</string>
<string name="47955">And what good has that done, Aarin? We have no way to use them. Whatever magic is locked within those stone tablets is of no use to us.</string>
<string name="47956">Of course, &lt;FirstName&gt;, of course. But before you go... maybe Gend is right. Maybe you should go speak to this Haedraline creature.</string>
<string name="47957">We captured the lizardwoman slinking around the city shortly after Luskan attacked. After Aribeth&apos;s betrayal I&apos;m not too trusting, so we keep her locked in a cell in the dungeon.</string>
<string name="47958">She was hissing and babbling about Maugrim wanting the Words of Power and the Source Stone, but we couldn&apos;t get much else out of her.</string>
<string name="47959">She&apos;s half mad, I fear, and doesn&apos;t seem to trust us. Gend seems to think she might trust you, though. You&apos;re free to speak with her in the dungeons if you wish.</string>
<string name="47960">She&apos;s locked away in the castle dungeon. Just head south and down the stairs.</string>
<string name="47961">Aribeth knows our defenses too well, we could not stand against her forces. The enemy has breached our walls. All is lost.</string>
<string name="47962">By some miracle the city still stands, and Aarin Gend clings to the hope we may yet survive. But I am older and wiser; I harbor no such illusions.</string>
<string name="47963">Come and go as you please, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You&apos;ve earned that right. Perhaps if Neverwinter had more people like you things wouldn&apos;t look so bleak.</string>
<string name="47964">Perhaps Haedraline will reveal their secret to us - if you release her from the dungeons.</string>
<string name="47965">I don&apos;t trust that creature, Aarin, and neither should you! We have done her no harm. If she was truly our ally she would tell us what she knows.</string>
<string name="47966">Haedraline told us about the secret door beneath Castle Never. Without her we would never have found the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47967">And what good has that done, Aarin? That creature won&apos;t tell us anything about it. The Source Stone is as useless to us as the Words of Power.</string>
<string name="47968">Perhaps Haedraline will speak to &lt;FirstName&gt;. She has spoken with &lt;him/her&gt; before.</string>
<string name="47969">Enough, Aarin. &lt;FirstName&gt;, if you want to speak to Haedraline you are free to do so. But I will not release her from the dungeon while an enemy is within our city gates.</string>
<string name="47970">Personally, I think this is all a waste of time: Words of Power, the Source Stone, Haedraline. What good is this against Aribeth&apos;s army? Our fate is sealed... we are all doomed.</string>
<string name="47971">I doubt it will do much good, but maybe - just maybe - she knows something that can save us. We&apos;re desperate, after all.</string>
<string name="47972">After all you have done for the city, the least I can do is answer your questions, &lt;FirstName&gt; - though Gend probably knows more than I do.</string>
<string name="47973">Any important information you come across should be reported directly to Aarin Gend. I&apos;ve placed him in charge of the defense of the city.</string>
<string name="47974">I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I won&apos;t do that. Not while there&apos;s an enemy inside the city. She might be an ally, but it&apos;s just as likely she&apos;s a spy.</string>
<string name="47975">Besides, we aren&apos;t doing her any harm. Only keeping an eye on her. And if she has information to help us, she should be willing to share it whether we keep her in prison or not.</string>
<string name="47976">Gend can probably answer your questions better than I, but I&apos;ll help you if I can.</string>
<string name="47977">I&apos;ve given them to Master Ford, chief archeologist of Neverwinter. He seems to think there&apos;s some link between the Words and the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47978">Initially, I hoped he could figure out how to unleash their power, but, even as wise as Master Ford is, he hasn&apos;t been able to learn anything more about the Words of Power or the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="47979">Since we discovered the Source Stone in the secret chambers beneath Castle Never, Master Ford has spent all his time studying it.</string>
<string name="47980">You can go speak to him to see what he&apos;s discovered, if you wish - though you might have more luck getting information from that creature Haedraline, if you can get her to talk.</string>
<string name="47981">When we first captured Haedraline she said something about the Source Stone and secret chambers beneath Castle Never. She sounded half crazy, but I though it was worth looking into.</string>
<string name="47982">I put Master Ford, Neverwinter&apos;s leading archeological expert, in charge of the search. He unearthed a previously undiscovered chamber beneath the castle.</string>
<string name="47983">Inside was an enormous crystalline boulder - the Source Stone. If you want to know more about it you should speak with Master Ford.</string>
<string name="47984">The reports are grim. In the initial assault Luskan overwhelmed us with sheer numbers and the unbridled ferocity of their attack. The defenders were forced to fall back to the City Core.</string>
<string name="47985">Aribeth knew our defenses too well, we never stood a chance. My troops are loyal, but against such odds there&apos;s little hope. It&apos;s only a matter of time until Castle Never itself falls.</string>
<string name="47986">It is too late for that I fear. Our defenses are already broken, the damage has been done.</string>
<string name="47987">If Aribeth and Maugrim were both slain, there is a chance it might break the spirits of the Luskan invaders. But I wouldn&apos;t count on it.</string>
<string name="47988">The Luskans attacked with a rage and ferocity I have never seen before. Some sinister force drives our enemies forward.</string>
<string name="47989">Or perhaps this is justice, of a sort. Neverwinter may have brought this doom upon itself.</string>
<string name="47990">Reinforcements from the Lords&apos; Alliance are marching, but they are too far away. By the time they arrive all that will remain of Neverwinter is burnt bodies and charred rubble.</string>
<string name="47991">Even without Maugrim and Aribeth to lead them, the Luskan fury is unabated. We will never last long enough for the Lords&apos; Alliance reinforcements to arrive.</string>
<string name="47992">Some sinister power drives our enemies forward - I feel it in my weary old bones. Or perhaps this is simply justice for what I have done.</string>
<string name="47993">Once I was an adventurer like you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Were the situation not so desperate I would call upon the court bards to sing you tales of my exploits.</string>
<string name="47994">But I am long since retired. I am ruler of Neverwinter now and my life is one of administrative duties and the delegation of responsibility. Hardly the stirring stuff of legends.</string>
<string name="47995">I miss those days of glory and heroism, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I gave them up to serve the city I love. Alas, my sacrifice was all in vain. Neverwinter will fall and I can do nothing about it.</string>
<string name="47996">That is why I have placed Gend in charge of the defense of the city. Let him handle the reports flooding in - I have no stomach for it anymore.</string>
<string name="47997">The blood of Fenthick is on my hands. After the plague the mob cried for blood, and I gave it to them. Fenthick was guilty only of trusting Desther - he was no enemy of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="47998">And yet I saw him hanged for failing to protect the city, as was his sworn duty. Can we really be so surprised Aribeth betrayed us after we executed her lover?</string>
<string name="47999">That is what I tell myself over and over, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But the words are hollow to my own ears.</string>
<string name="48000">I only wanted to do what was best for Neverwinter, to heal the wounds left by the Wailing Death. Yet even as I passed sentence on Fenthick, I knew in my heart it was wrong. This was not justice.</string>
<string name="48001">Fenthick died to feed the city&apos;s lust for revenge. Now Neverwinter shall fall to an army that was raised to feed Aribeth&apos;s own vengeance. Perhaps that is justice.</string>
<string name="48002">I fear it is too late for that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Fenthick is dead and Aribeth... Perhaps if I were given the chance to pass judgment again I would act differently. More mercifully.</string>
<string name="48003">But I fear that chance shall never come. I must live with the burden of what I have done, as must my city. Neverwinter will fall.</string>
<string name="48004">You... you are asking me to show Aribeth mercy? After what she did? After raising an army against Neverwinter and slaughtering her people?</string>
<string name="48005">Aribeth? She is a traitor! The sentence for her crimes is death...</string>
<string name="48006">Her actions are not without reason, Lord Nasher. Neverwinter turned its back on her when it executed her lover, Fenthick.</string>
<string name="48007">I did not ask for your opinion on this matter, Gend. What do you know of such things?</string>
<string name="48008">When I came into your service, Lord Nasher, you asked if I would serve you faithfully. Do you remember what I said?</string>
<string name="48009">You... you told me you would not serve a master who did not do what was right. Are you saying it was wrong to execute Fenthick, Gend?</string>
<string name="48010">I am still by your side, Lord Nasher. But Fenthick and Aribeth were lovers. In her eyes you gave Fenthick as a sacrifice to appease the unruly mob.</string>
<string name="48011">And so she shall have it, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but now is not the time. We are fighting a war, and Aribeth can give us much information about our enemy.</string>
<string name="48012">Aribeth&apos;s crimes cannot simply be forgiven with a wave of the hand, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And yet... there is truth in your words.</string>
<string name="48013">I have often wondered if I made a mistake in Fenthick&apos;s sentence. Had he lived, perhaps none of this would have happened. At the very least he could have worked to atone for his mistakes.</string>
<string name="48014">Perhaps Fenthick deserved a second chance. Perhaps we all do. I... I must think carefully on this matter before my decision is made.</string>
<string name="48015">As long as we battle the Luskan forces, Aribeth is too valuable to be slain. However, if the walls of Castle Never fall I shall slay her myself rather than let her go free.</string>
<string name="48016">Rest assured, justice will be served when the time comes, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Is that all?</string>
<string name="48017">I... I do not wish to discuss this anymore. Aribeth&apos;s fate is not ours to decide, and I have no time for philosophical debates. Is there more I can do for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="48018">I understand you have an interest in her fate, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I see you will not be satisfied until I answer your question.</string>
<string name="48019">But it is no easy question to answer. Aribeth has brought death to Neverwinter. For this the law states she must die.</string>
<string name="48020">These are strange times, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My city is in ruins and all but overrun by Luskan forces, and yet Aribeth, the leader of our enemy, sits in our dungeons awaiting my judgment.</string>
<string name="48021">I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I assumed you would have heard the news by now. Aribeth has surrendered herself to us. She seeks atonement for her crimes against Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="48022">At first I thought it was some trick, but she has given us valuable information about the Luskan army that has allowed many of our people to escape a brutal end.</string>
<string name="48023">The city may not survive, but Aribeth&apos;s actions have spared the lives of many innocents. Though these must be weighed against the thousands she has helped slay.</string>
<string name="48024">While the war rages on, she will live. She can provide us valuable information about our enemy&apos;s tactics and numbers.</string>
<string name="48025">As for her fate when this is all over... that is a matter I have not yet decided. Such matters are to be decided later.</string>
<string name="48026">And yet I remember another who was sentenced by the same law to death. Fenthick, Aribeth&apos;s lover... I cannot help but wonder if there is a lesson to be learned there.</string>
<string name="48027">Were things not so grim I might laugh at the absurdity of it all. (sigh) What is it you need of me, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="48028">Greetings, I am Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="48029">I need to see what you have in stock, druid.</string>
<string name="48030">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="48031">Bye.</string>
<string name="48032">Me need see what you got in stock, tree man.</string>
<string name="48033">Me ask questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="48034">G&apos;bye.</string>
<string name="48035">May the blessings of Earthmother Chauntea and the Treefather Silvanus be upon you in these dark times.</string>
<string name="48036">Welcome, child. Even those shunned by the world are welcome here. We are all children of nature, after all.</string>
<string name="48037">As you wish. As long as this grove stands I will try to maintain the balance by offering my services to any who ask.</string>
<string name="48038">There is little I can tell you, I fear. I have not left my grove for many days or nights and I know nothing of the details of this war ravaging the city.</string>
<string name="48039">May the Earthmother and Treefather give you the strength to maintain balance in these troubled times.</string>
<string name="48040">I have worked long to preserve nature&apos;s balance in this city, but in the chaos and destruction of war all my efforts are focused on preserving this grove as a place of tranquility and refuge for those who need it.</string>
<string name="48041">I will help you, if I can.</string>
<string name="48042">I have no time for this.</string>
<string name="48043">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="48044">I might help you... if the price is right.</string>
<string name="48045">Me help, if me can.</string>
<string name="48046">Me not got time for this!</string>
<string name="48047">Me want ask stuff.</string>
<string name="48048">Me help if you give gold.</string>
<string name="48049">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="48050">What kind of heirloom? Let me see.</string>
<string name="48051">Okay, I&apos;ll help you.</string>
<string name="48052">What you mean, heirloom? You show me reward.</string>
<string name="48053">Okay, me help you.</string>
<string name="48054">Forget it. Show me the heirloom or no Leesa.</string>
<string name="48055">You no show me reward, me no get your sister.</string>
<string name="48056">Didn&apos;t you look for her?</string>
<string name="48057">Where did you last see her?</string>
<string name="48058">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll bring her back!</string>
<string name="48059">Why you not look for your sister?</string>
<string name="48060">Where you last see sister?</string>
<string name="48061">You not be sad. Me bring sister back!</string>
<string name="48062">Your sister is dead.</string>
<string name="48063">Sister be dead.</string>
<string name="48064">No, but I am still looking.</string>
<string name="48065">No, but me still look.</string>
<string name="48066">Forget it. I&apos;ve changed my mind.</string>
<string name="48067">Me not help no more. Me change me mind.</string>
<string name="48068">Thank you.</string>
<string name="48069">Keep your cloak. You need it more than I do.</string>
<string name="48070">You keep cloak. Me got lots stuff. You need cloak more. You look cold.</string>
<string name="48071">Please, &lt;sir/madam&gt;! I beg of you, help my sister. Leesa&apos;s just a little girl.</string>
<string name="48072">I&apos;m sorry, but I can&apos;t speak with you right now, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I have to keep an eye on my little sister.</string>
<string name="48073">Leesa already vanished once. I don&apos;t want her to disappear on me again.</string>
<string name="48074">Please, I have no time for questions. Don&apos;t you understand? Leesa is missing! Please, help her. I beg you.</string>
<string name="48075">Please, Leesa&apos;s just a little girl. Please bring her back to me. Please.</string>
<string name="48076">Why won&apos;t anybody help me? She&apos;s just a little girl! Please, somebody find her. Please.</string>
<string name="48077">I... I have no gold to pay you. But there is something. A family heirloom. It&apos;s all I have left. You can have it if you bring back Leesa.</string>
<string name="48078">No, I can&apos;t show it to you. I&apos;m afraid to even say what it is. Someone will steal it. This place is full of thieves. </string>
<string name="48079"> I... I don&apos;t even have it with me. Bring Leesa to me and I&apos;ll get it for you. I just want Leesa back.</string>
<string name="48080">Thank you, kind &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I&apos;m so worried about Leesa. Before our mother died from the plague I promised her I&apos;d watch out for my sister.</string>
<string name="48081">When Luskan attacked we tried to sneak out of the city one night, but we couldn&apos;t get through. There were Luskan soldiers everywhere. We had to hide while they passed by. We hid for hours, it seemed.</string>
<string name="48082">I... I must have fallen asleep, waiting there in the dark. I didn&apos;t mean to, but I was so tired. And when I woke up Leesa was... *sob*... she was *sob*... she was gone!</string>
<string name="48083">I searched all night, until the dawn came. But there were so many soldiers! If they caught me... I can&apos;t go back. I just can&apos;t!</string>
<string name="48084">Poor Leesa! I had to leave her there, wandering around in that war zone to the south. I... I had no other choice.</string>
<string name="48085">She&apos;s somewhere in the Luskan war zone. To the south. I know she&apos;s still alive... She has to be! Please, bring her back to me!</string>
<string name="48086">No! Why would you say that? NO! It isn&apos;t true! I know it isn&apos;t! You just don&apos;t want to help me!</string>
<string name="48087">Have you... have you found my sister? Have you found Leesa yet?</string>
<string name="48088">Thank you, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Thank you for bringing me back my little Leesa. </string>
<string name="48089">I... I have no gold to give you, but I do have this cloak. It was a family heirloom. My mother said it was magic.</string>
<string name="48090">But... but you promised! Please, bring her back! Please, I beg you! Bring Leesa back to me!</string>
<string name="48091">You... you are too kind, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Thank you. For everything.</string>
<string name="48092">Now I just have to keep an eye on her. With all that&apos;s happened, I hope we make it through this.</string>
<string name="48093">I have need of your services.</string>
<string name="48094">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="48095">Didn&apos;t this place used to be a brothel?</string>
<string name="48096">Bye.</string>
<string name="48097">Me needs service.</string>
<string name="48098">Me ask questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="48099">This place used be whore house, yuh?</string>
<string name="48100">G&apos;bye.</string>
<string name="48101">Yes, let me see what you have in stock.</string>
<string name="48102">Yuh. Me want see what stuff you got.</string>
<string name="48103">These are strange times, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. The beds in the Moonstone Mask being filled by wounded soldiers. Who could have imagined?</string>
<string name="48104">Your face is a frightful mess! Those Luskanites really did a number on... Oh! I&apos;m so sorry, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! I thought you were one of the wounded.</string>
<string name="48105">Well, I&apos;m afraid most of the Moonstone Mask&apos;s services are unavailable. My staff are busy tending to the wounded and the beds are filled with the dead and dying.</string>
<string name="48106">No time for questions. We&apos;re swamped! I&apos;ve never seen so many men and women flat on their backs. Well, not from injuries, anyway.</string>
<string name="48107">The Moonstone Mask was known for the... comforts... we gave our customers. But there are many wounded, the temple is full and we have more beds than anywhere else in town. </string>
<string name="48108">Off with you then. I&apos;m too busy to say a long goodbye.</string>
<string name="48109">Hardly sets the proper mood for romance. However, if you&apos;re interested in purchasing supplies for some clandestine operation I can still help you out.</string>
<string name="48110">And Luce is no help. Used to be one of my best girls, but ever since her little sister disappeared she does nothing but mope in the corner.</string>
<string name="48111">And Luce is no help. Used to be one of my best girls, but ever since she was reunited with her little sister she spends all her time doting on that girl.</string>
<string name="48112">Is it really so strange that in these troubled times we&apos;re willing to provide a more conventional kind of comfort for the wounded of Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="48113">A whore house? You ignorant lout! I&apos;ll have you know I ran a respectable business!</string>
<string name="48114">I can use your gold to buy more bandages and clean sheets. The ones we have are a little bloodstained, you know. </string>
<string name="48115">I never really saw myself as a nurse before, though I have often been complimented on my bedside manner!</string>
<string name="48116">I guess I shouldn&apos;t be joking with all the suffering around us. Especially not while Luce&apos;s baby sister is still missing. Poor little girl.</string>
<string name="48117">I guess I shouldn&apos;t be joking with all the suffering around us, but Luce and her sister have been reunited and I can&apos;t help but feel it&apos;s a sign of better times ahead.</string>
<string name="48118">When I look at all the wounded I can&apos;t help but curse those Luskan dogs for what they have done.</string>
<string name="48119">It&apos;s even worse for poor Luce. Her little sister is missing. I pray the Luskan scum don&apos;t find that little girl.</string>
<string name="48120">Thank the gods Luce has been reunited with her little sister. I hate the thought of what might have happened if the Luskan scum got their dirty hands on that girl.</string>
<string name="48121">Aren&apos;t you a handsome one? Come back when all this is over and I&apos;ll give you a night of pleasure you&apos;ll never forget... and at a very reasonable price! Just ask for Tamora.</string>
<string name="48122">But right now I must tend to the wounded. Maybe Ophala can help you, she&apos;s in charge of the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="48123">I can&apos;t speak to you right now. I have to change the dressings of all these soldiers.</string>
<string name="48124">If you need anything you should speak to Ophala, she&apos;s in charge of the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="48125">Things were always hectic around here, but never like this. There seems to be no end to the number of wounded!</string>
<string name="48126">There&apos;s so many wounded we haven&apos;t even be able to help poor Luce look for her missing sister.</string>
<string name="48127">At least Luce and her sister have been reunited. It&apos;s small things like that that give me hope.</string>
<string name="48128">Normally visiting soldiers are good for business around this place, but the Luskanites only want to kill us all!</string>
<string name="48129">It makes me shudder to think of poor Luce&apos;s missing sister. I hope the little girl is still alive.</string>
<string name="48130">It&apos;s a miracle little Leesa survived with those butchers running around! But at least she&apos;s back safe with Luce now.</string>
<string name="48131">If you return when this madness is over, my lady, I promise an evening of pleasure and delight... and at a very reasonable price. Just ask for Tanith.</string>
<string name="48132">But right now I must tend to the wounded. Perhaps Ophala can help you, she&apos;s in charge of the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="48133">I have no time to speak with you. The wounded demand all my attention.</string>
<string name="48134">If you need anything you should speak to Ophala, she&apos;s in charge of the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="48135">With the golems stopped and the catapults broken, we&apos;ve got a fighting chance against those Luskan dogs!</string>
<string name="48136">But I&apos;m just an ordinary soldier. You need to speak to Trancar, the battalion commander.</string>
<string name="48137">Have you come to help us? We need all the help we can get. Luskan&apos;s got us outnumbered ten to one at least.</string>
<string name="48138">I hope Trancar sends me out on patrol soon! The enemy won&apos;t know what hit &apos;em!</string>
<string name="48139">Those war golems are unstoppable, I tell ya! </string>
<string name="48140">Even Trancar knew better than to fight those monstrosities! That&apos;s why he had the battalion pull back to here.</string>
<string name="48141">If it wasn&apos;t for the catapults smashing our formations, we&apos;d have stood against the Luskan scum!</string>
<string name="48142">But how can you fight when it&apos;s raining boulders and flaming pitch all around you? That&apos;s why Trancar had the battalion pull back.</string>
<string name="48143"></string>
<string name="48144"></string>
<string name="48145">Who are you? What are you doing in here?</string>
<string name="48146">Cause? What cause?</string>
<string name="48147">I have to go now.</string>
<string name="48148">Who you be? What you do here?</string>
<string name="48149">Cause? What you mean?</string>
<string name="48150">Me want go now.</string>
<string name="48151">War golems? Catapults?</string>
<string name="48152">Is there anything I can do to help?</string>
<string name="48153">Sounds like you turned tail and ran, Trancar!</string>
<string name="48154">Where are the Luskan forces now?</string>
<string name="48155">Me want help you. What me do?</string>
<string name="48156">You bunch o&apos; cowards! You run like babies!</string>
<string name="48157">Where be Luskan army now?</string>
<string name="48158">I don&apos;t have time for this. I need to find Aribeth and Maugrim!</string>
<string name="48159">Me no got time for this. Me need find Aribeth and Maugrim!</string>
<string name="48160">What must be done, Trancar?</string>
<string name="48161">What you need me do, Trancar?</string>
<string name="48162">And the golems?</string>
<string name="48163">Where can I find these wizards?</string>
<string name="48164">Where wizard be?</string>
<string name="48165">I&apos;ll destroy the golems and the catapults for you, Trancar!</string>
<string name="48166">What&apos;s in this for me?</string>
<string name="48167">Me destroy golems and catapults for you!</string>
<string name="48168">What me get if me help you?</string>
<string name="48169">Tell me about you and your men again.</string>
<string name="48170">Where can I find the catapults?</string>
<string name="48171">How can I stop the war golems?</string>
<string name="48172">I&apos;m looking for Aribeth and Maugrim.</string>
<string name="48173">How goes the war effort?</string>
<string name="48174">Why you all here in this place?</string>
<string name="48175">Where me find catapults?</string>
<string name="48176">How me stop war golems?</string>
<string name="48177">We winning war yet?</string>
<string name="48178">Me look for Aribeth and Maugrim.</string>
<string name="48179">And a worthy song it would be, Trancar.</string>
<string name="48180">You story make a good song, Trancar.</string>
<string name="48181">I need to ask you some questions, Trancar.</string>
<string name="48182">Me got ask you questions, Trancar.</string>
<string name="48183">The bards don&apos;t sing about nobodies, Trancar.</string>
<string name="48184">Bards not sing &apos;bout nobody like you.</string>
<string name="48185">Can you spare any of your troops to help me?</string>
<string name="48186">You got any extra troops for help me?</string>
<string name="48187">Where will I find these wizards?</string>
<string name="48188">Where me find golem mage?</string>
<string name="48189">You! I know you! You are &lt;FullName&gt;, the &lt;class&gt; who saved Neverwinter from the plague!</string>
<string name="48190">You honor us humble servants of the city with your presence, &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="48191">A face as... uh, unique... as yours is not easy to miss in a crowd. Your looks are something of a legend in the city, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. As are your deeds.</string>
<string name="48192">Alas, it seems the city has need of your aid once again, if we hope to drive these Luskan dogs off! Will you join our cause, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="48193">The city bards sing tributes to you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. They claim a shining radiance emanates from your very features.</string>
<string name="48194">I am Trancar, battalion commander of the Neverwinter militia. My men and I tried to hold the southern section of the city, but Luskan forces overran our position.</string>
<string name="48195">We were forced to retreat and set up our base here in the City Core. But we haven&apos;t given up the fight! I still send my men out in small groups, trying to slow the Luskan advance through guerilla tactics.</string>
<string name="48196">Good luck to you, &lt;FullName&gt;. I shall remain here with my men, organizing what resistance we can against the Luskan invaders.</string>
<string name="48197">We do what we can, but our numbers are too few. Between the catapults and the war golems I fear it is only a matter of time before even the City Core falls to the Luskan scum!</string>
<string name="48198">We held out as long as we could, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. We were outnumbered ten to one, at least. Even then we would have stayed and fought if we had any chance at all.</string>
<string name="48199">But between the catapults and the war golems we were being slaughtered. My men are common soldiers. They don&apos;t have the strength to stand against that kind of assault.</string>
<string name="48200">The dogs have us surrounded, but so far the barricades have kept them out of the City Core. Right now their main force is making a big push up from the south.</string>
<string name="48201">That&apos;s where the fierciest fighting is, along with those damn catapults and war golems. We held out against them as long as we could, but in the end we had to retreat.</string>
<string name="48202">The Luskanites came well prepared. It started with the catapults bombarding us wherever we made a stand, scattering our ranks and formations.</string>
<string name="48203">But even with flaming pitch falling from the sky, we held our ground and faced our enemy. That&apos;s when we met the war golems and knew we had no hope.</string>
<string name="48204">The huge monstrosities tore through an entire company in mere seconds, and our weapons can&apos;t even make a dent in their rock-hard hides! We had to fall back.</string>
<string name="48205">Normally I&apos;d say one &lt;man/woman&gt; can&apos;t make a difference, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But you&apos;re no ordinary &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="48206">Someone has to take out those catapults and stop those war golems. It won&apos;t be easy, but you saved us from the plague, maybe you can save us from this.</string>
<string name="48207">Last I heard, those two were leading the attack to the south. Finding them won&apos;t be easy, but that&apos;s probably the best place to look. </string>
<string name="48208">I&apos;m just a simple soldier, &lt;FullName&gt;. I don&apos;t know what mission you&apos;re on and I don&apos;t expect you to tell me. But finding Aribeth and Maugrim is going to be a lot easier if you take out those catapults and war golems.</string>
<string name="48209">The catapults are somewhere to the south, in the war zone. Don&apos;t know where exactly, seeing how they keep moving them around.</string>
<string name="48210">If you find them, just kill the soldiers guarding them and smash the catapult to bits. Destroy all three catapults and we&apos;ll finally get a break from those boulders raining down on our heads.</string>
<string name="48211">The war golems are a different story. Even you might have trouble going head to head against those brutes, &lt;FullName&gt;. But there&apos;s a better way.</string>
<string name="48212">The war golems are controlled by Luskan mages. Kill the wizards controlling them and the golems are nothing but expensive statues. </string>
<string name="48213">That I don&apos;t know. They have to be close enough to control their golems, so they&apos;re probably in the southern war zone. But if they&apos;re smart they won&apos;t be standing out in the open.</string>
<string name="48214">According to our intelligence reports Luskan brought two of the golem masters with them: one to control the golems on the east of the battle and one to control the golems on the west. </string>
<string name="48215">It&apos;s a lot to ask, &lt;FullName&gt;, I know. But you&apos;re the only one who can do this. My men and I don&apos;t stand a chance.</string>
<string name="48216">So the rumors are true, you&apos;re a mercenary to the very bone! Sorry, but I don&apos;t even have two coppers to rub together.</string>
<string name="48217">You&apos;ll either do this to try and save the city, or you won&apos;t. Simple as that, &lt;FullName&gt;. Glory is your only reward here.</string>
<string name="48218">I&apos;d send my men with you, &lt;FullName&gt;, but the more people at your side the more likely you are to be seen.</string>
<string name="48219"></string>
<string name="48220">Welcome back, &lt;FullName&gt;. Have you reconsidered and come back to aid us in our cause? Or is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="48221">Greetings, &lt;FullName&gt;. Are you here to lend your prowess to our motley crew? We&apos;re making a last stand against the Luskan dogs who&apos;ve driven us from our homes!</string>
<string name="48222">The catapults still reign down upon our heads and the war golems still walk the streets, or so I hear. But at least you are still alive, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="48223">Is there something else you need of me? I will help you however I can though there is little enough I can do, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="48224">The war golems still slaughter my men like sheep, &lt;FullName&gt;. I was afraid you had died trying to stop them. But I see you&apos;re still alive and well.</string>
<string name="48225">At least we no longer live in fear of death from above, &lt;FullName&gt;. I can only assume you are the one responsible for destroying the catapults, and for that you have our thanks.</string>
<string name="48226">I can still hear the steady pounding of the stones and flaming pitch hurled at us by the enemy catapults, &lt;FullName&gt;. I feared you had been slain trying to destroy them.</string>
<string name="48227">But I have reports the war golems have ground to a halt, and I think you are the only one who could have stopped them. For that, I and my men thank you.</string>
<string name="48228">Well met, &lt;FullName&gt;! First you save us from the plague, and now the catapults and war golems are vanquished by your hand! So the bards have begun to proclaim, at any rate. Congratulations.</string>
<string name="48229">Your legend continues to grow, it would seem. And now is the time for me and my men. The Luskan dogs may have us outnumbered ten to one, but we won&apos;t go down without a fight!</string>
<string name="48230">Maybe when this war is over the bards will sing a song for Trancar and his battalion, eh &lt;FullName&gt;?</string>
<string name="48231">Harsh words, &lt;FullName&gt;, but true enough I suppose. Still, my men need something to hope for. Their odds of surviving are grim enough as it is.</string>
<string name="48232">I&apos;ll tell you what I can, though in all truth my attention has been focused on organizing resistance to the Luskan invaders.</string>
<string name="48233">Was there something you needed?</string>
<string name="48234">Kind words, &lt;FullName&gt;. Perhaps even true, if the city manages to survive against these odds. Was there something else you needed?</string>
<string name="48235">I had heard tell of your astounding lack of wit, but I didn&apos;t believe it until now! Listen closely, &lt;FullName&gt; and I will tell you once more why we are here.</string>
<string name="48236">I am Trancar, battalion commander of the Neverwinter militia. My men and I tried to hold the southern section of the city, but Luskan forces overran our position.</string>
<string name="48237">We were forced to retreat and set up our base here in the City Core. But we haven&apos;t given up the fight! I still send my men out in small groups, trying to slow the Luskan advance through guerilla tactics.</string>
<string name="48238">The catapults are somewhere to the south, in the war zone. Don&apos;t know where exactly, however, as they keep moving them around.</string>
<string name="48239">If you find them, just kill the soldiers guarding them and smash the catapult to bits. Destroy all three catapults and we&apos;ll finally get a break from those boulders raining down on our heads.</string>
<string name="48240">The war golems ravaging the southern war zone are controlled by Luskan mages. Kill the wizards and the golems are nothing but expensive statues.</string>
<string name="48241">According to our intelligence reports Luskan brought two of the golem masters with them: one to control the golems on the east of the battle and one to control the golems on the west.</string>
<string name="48242">That I don&apos;t know. They have to be close enough to control their golems, so they&apos;re probably in the southern war zone. But if they&apos;re smart they won&apos;t be standing out in the open.</string>
<string name="48243">Last I heard, those two were organizing the attack to the south. They&apos;re probably holed up somewhere in the war zone, surrounded by guards and planning the end of Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="48244">I won&apos;t lie to you... The odds are stacked against us. We&apos;re badly outnumbered and we took heavy losses from the catapults and war golems.</string>
<string name="48245">But it helps to have someone like you on our side, &lt;FullName&gt;. It inspires the troops. You&apos;ll find a way to save the city. I know you will!</string>
<string name="48246">Developed by Lantanese spelunkers, this type of silk vest has been coated by a slick, oily substance allowing the wearer to slip through small crevices -- and incidentally making it very difficult to restrain the wearer in any way.

The Lady&apos;s Hand Monastery in the Nether Mountains has recently taken to equipping all of their members with this item.

<string name="48303">As you wish. Good luck with your mission, &lt;FullName&gt;. The fate of Neverwinter depends on you.</string>
<string name="48304">Greetings, &lt;FullName&gt;. I am Vanya of the Neverwinter militia. Trancar&apos;s orders are that I accompany you in your mission to stop the Luskan golems and catapults.</string>
<string name="48305">You will not regret this, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. My skills are yours to command.</string>
<string name="48306">I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me.</string>
<string name="48307">Do not underestimate me, &lt;FullName&gt;. Though no hero such as you, my arm is strong, my courage true and my steel sharp.</string>

<string name="48310">Mystran Belt of Priestly Might and Warding</string>
<string name="48311">These items first appeared in Halruaa at the end of the Time of Troubles, which the wizards took as a sign that Mystra had returned. 

The belt of priestly might and warding grants its wearer protection from attack and increased strength, and further allows them to create a magic circle against alignment once per day.

This particular belt is inscribed with the holy symbol of Mystra, goddess of magic.</string>

The belt of priestly might and warding grants its wearer protection from attack and increased strength, and further allows them to create a magic circle against alignment once per day.

This particular belt is inscribed with the dark symbol of Shar, goddess of shadow magic.</string>
<string name="48314">Boots of the Winterlands</string>
<string name="48315">A common magic item among adventurers, travelers and monsters of the frozen North alike, these thick, furry boots have been enchanted to magically warm the wearer, offering protection against cold similar to that provided by an endure elements spell.</string>
<string name="48316">Lesser Boots of Tumbling</string>
<string name="48317">Made for members of a militant order of Lliira-worshippers known as the Scarlet Mummers, these boots aid those deadly dancers in their acrobatic assassinations of the agents of the Maiden of Pain.</string>
<string name="48318">Boots of Tumbling</string>
<string name="48319">Greater Boots of Tumbling</string>
<string name="48320">Bracers of Archery</string>
<string name="48321">These wristbands look like normal protective wear. The bracers grant the wearer deadly accuracy when using bows. They are likely from the armory of some disbanded elven militia.</string>
<string name="48322">Bracers of the Blinding Strike</string>
<string name="48323">Beyl Van Yoren was a young student in the monastery of the Dark Moon who was seduced away from her order by a local transmuter named Vergol. 

To punish Beyl for her desertion, the Order&apos;s elder monks contracted a rival spellcaster to arm several of their best remaining students with these bracers, hoping the bracers would prove a match to Vergol&apos;s haste-inducing spells. However, the Order did not foresee Vergol&apos;s equal expertise with hindering spells, and the students have not been seen since.</string>
<string name="48324">Gloves of Appraisal</string>
<string name="48325">At one time, almost every successful merchant in Waterdeep was reputed to own a pair of these gloves.  Embroidered with the image of the goddess Waukeen, the supple balance of the glove and the sheen of its silk are enhanced with a minor magic to help the wearer better gauge the weight and quality of gems and other small goods.

During the Interdeium of Waukeen, many lost faith in the Merchant&apos;s Friend, and many such gloves were sold into general circulation on the open market.</string>

<string name="48328">With the golems beaten and the catapults destroyed, we have a chance against those Luskan dogs!</string>
<string name="48329">If you need anything you must speak with Trancar, the battalion commander.</string>
<string name="48330">I cannot speak with you right now, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I am on duty.</string>
<string name="48331">Gloves of the Artificer</string>
<string name="48332">Trancar knows there is no soldier in the battalion more capable. That is why he wanted me to aid you in your mission.</string>
<string name="48333">I hope Trancar sends me out on foray soon. I&apos;m eager to strike a blow against our enemy.</string>
<string name="48334">I want to see what you have in stock.</string>
<string name="48335">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="48336">I&apos;m surprised you&apos;re still here with the Luskanites so close.</string>
<string name="48337">Bye.</string>
<string name="48338">Me need buy stuff.</string>
<string name="48339">Me ask questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="48340">Why you still here when Luskan army be so close?</string>
<string name="48341">G&apos;bye.</string>
<string name="48342">Welcome, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, to the Shining Knight. You&apos;ll find the best arms and armor in the entire city in my shop.</string>
<string name="48343">You need something? A sword, or maybe a shield? I&apos;m swamped already, but I&apos;ll never turn a customer away.</string>
<string name="48344">I hope you&apos;re here to buy a sword and a suit of armor... or at least a nice dagger. With the war effort, my shop is far too busy to waste time on window shoppers.</string>
<string name="48345">The war effort&apos;s depleted my stock, but you&apos;ll find I still have a few choice items left.</string>
<string name="48346">I don&apos;t got time to be answering no questions. I can barely keep up with demand for my products as it is. War is hell, but it&apos;s sure good for business.</string>
<string name="48347">Lord Nasher&apos;s ordered me to come up with as many swords and shields as I can lay my paws on to aid the defense of Neverwinter. But I&apos;m not complaining.</string>
<string name="48348">If you ever find yourself in need of quality weapons or armor you know where to find me.</string>
<string name="48349">Everyone&apos;s got to do their part in times like these. And all that gold Nasher&apos;s paying me don&apos;t hurt none.</string>
<string name="48350">I&apos;m not about to let my city fall to these Luskan dogs!</string>
<string name="48351">My blade is yours. I&apos;ll follow you every step of the way! Let&apos;s drive these invaders back to the rock they crawled out from!</string>
<string name="48352">Who are you? What are you all doing in here?</string>
<string name="48353">You sure have a negative attitude.</string>
<string name="48354">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="48355">Who you be? What you all be doing in here?</string>
<string name="48356">You got bad attitude!</string>
<string name="48357">Me go now.</string>
<string name="48358">We aren&apos;t dead yet. We still have a chance.</string>
<string name="48359">We not dead yet. We still got a chance.</string>
<string name="48360"></string>
<string name="48361"></string>
<string name="48362"></string>
<string name="48363"></string>
<string name="48364">The Luskans came on us so fast. We didn&apos;t stand a chance. I never even had time to order a retreat.</string>
<string name="48365">It&apos;s only a matter of time until they find us here. They&apos;ll probably kill me last... that&apos;s what they do. They make the captain watch all his men die first.</string>
<string name="48366">Come here to die with the rest of us, have you? You&apos;re welcome to stay and await the gruesome end, if you want.</string>
<string name="48367"></string>
<string name="48368">We&apos;re just a company of Neverwinter soldiers, a few survivors. Though I fear we won&apos;t be alive much longer.</string>
<string name="48369">Back out into the street? That&apos;s suicide. The Luskans will kill us all anyway, mind you, so what does it matter?</string>
<string name="48370">I&apos;m just a realist. My troops are bloody and beaten and the streets are crawling with Luskan soldiers. We&apos;re outmanned ten to one at least.</string>
<string name="48371">Even if we could make it back to the City Core alive, what&apos;s the point? Any help we expect to get from the Lords&apos; Alliance will never get here in time. The whole city is doomed.</string>
<string name="48372">There&apos;s no way we can win this war. What, do you plan to lead a handful of soldiers against an army?</string>
<string name="48373"></string>
<string name="48374"></string>
<string name="48375"></string>
<string name="48376"></string>
<string name="48377">I know you. You&apos;re the hero who saved us from the Wailing Death. Ha! Lot of good that did. Death by plague or death by war... doesn&apos;t make much difference, does it?</string>
<string name="48378"></string>
<string name="48379"></string>
<string name="48380"></string>
<string name="48381"></string>
<string name="48382">How bad is it in there?</string>
<string name="48383">How bad things be in there?</string>
<string name="48384">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="48385">What can you tell me about the war golems?</string>
<string name="48386">You tell me stuff &apos;bout golems.</string>
<string name="48387">Is there anything more you can tell me about them?</string>
<string name="48388">Any more you know &apos;bout them?</string>
<string name="48389">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="48390">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="48391">What do you know about the catapults?</string>
<string name="48392">You tell me &apos;bout catapults.</string>
<string name="48393">Any reports of where Aribeth or Maugrim might be?</string>
<string name="48394">You know &apos;bout where Aribeth or Maugrim be?</string>
<string name="48395">Anything else you can tell me about them?</string>
<string name="48396">You got more you know &apos;bout them?</string>
<string name="48397">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m no gossip monger, and your information might help end this war.</string>
<string name="48398">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me not rumor-spreader. Me need information for stop this war.</string>
<string name="48399">If you&apos;re planning on going through the gates you better make sure you&apos;re well armed. The fighting is thick and bloody in the war zone. </string>
<string name="48400">Perhaps we&apos;ll meet again if the Luskan army doesn&apos;t kill us all first.</string>
<string name="48401">You&apos;re a little slow on the uptake, ain&apos;t you? I&apos;ll try not to use any big words as I go over this.</string>
<string name="48402">It&apos;s pretty much a no man&apos;s land beyond the gates. The catapults have smashed the city to bits and the streets are swarming with Luskan soldiers. Worse things, too, like them damn war golems.</string>
<string name="48403">There&apos;s no way to fight those bloody things! They hacked us up like lumberjacks chopping wood, and nothing we tried could even slow them down.</string>
<string name="48404">I&apos;ve heard some things... but it&apos;s not a good idea to be spreading rumors in times like these.</string>
<string name="48405">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I guess the situation&apos;s already as bad as it can get. Telling you sure won&apos;t make things worse!</string>
<string name="48406">People are saying the only way to stop them golems is to kill their master. But I heard these golems actually have two masters: a pair of mages from the Arcane Brotherhood.</string>
<string name="48407">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but I saw the harm rumors can do during the plague. The last thing we need right now is panic in the streets. If you want to know more you should go speak to Captain Trancar.</string>
<string name="48408">During the initial assault on Neverwinter that traitor Aribeth led the Luskan troops while Maugrim stayed at the back and unleashed his magic on us. Haven&apos;t heard of any sightings lately, though.</string>
<string name="48409">They&apos;re probably holed up somewhere plotting how to get inside the City Core and bring down Castle Never before reinforcements arrive to help us. The Gods know where they might be: an abandoned home, an old shop... they could be anywhere!</string>
<string name="48410">If that&apos;s true, then what hope do we have? Finding and killing one Arcane Brother is hard enough, but two? We&apos;re doomed. No wonder Captain Trancar couldn&apos;t stop those golems.</string>
<string name="48411">To tell you the truth, last I heard the golems were dead in their tracks. Something must have happened to them.</string>
<string name="48412">But the damage is already done. Too many Neverwinter defenders fell against them. I don&apos;t think we can hold the City Core until the reinforcements from the Lords&apos; Alliance get here.</string>
<string name="48413">The only hope we have of surviving this invasion is to hold the City Core until reinforcements from the Lords&apos; Alliance arrive. But with boulders and burning pitch raining down on us day and night, it ain&apos;t going to happen.</string>
<string name="48414">Unless somebody takes out those catapults, and I mean all of them, we&apos;ll be pounded into submission! Luskan will capture the City Core and even Castle Never will fall. Maybe you&apos;ll have better luck than Captain Trancar did.</string>
<string name="48415">The bombardment has stopped! Someone must have taken the catapults out but that won&apos;t be enough to save us. We&apos;ve already suffered too many losses as it is.</string>
<string name="48416">We&apos;ll hold the City Core as long as we can, but the reinforcements from Waterdeep are too far away. Castle Never itself will fall before they get here.</string>
<string name="48417">I doubt you&apos;re smart enough to really grasp the situation, but I&apos;ll try and explain it.</string>
<string name="48418">People have been saying stuff, as you might expect. But I doubt any of it&apos;s true. And I don&apos;t want to spread false stories and add to the fear and panic.</string>
<string name="48419">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I doubt one &lt;man/woman&gt; can stop this war, but I guess there&apos;s no harm in telling you what I&apos;ve heard.</string>
<string name="48420">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I doubt one &lt;man/woman&gt; can stop this war. You sound like a glory hound to me. Just the type to start flapping their gums and spreading the rumors I&apos;m trying to keep off the street.</string>
<string name="48421">There&apos;s whispers that Maugrim and that cult of his are planning some kind of ritual. Something to destroy Neverwinter once and for all.</string>
<string name="48422">Don&apos;t know that they need to bother, though. I doubt we&apos;ll be able to hold the City Core long enough for the Lords&apos; Alliance reinforcements to get here as it is.</string>
<string name="48423">There&apos;s too many of those Luskan soldiers in the streets. We don&apos;t stand a chance.</string>
<string name="48424">The captain should have given the order to retreat long ago. Now it&apos;s too late.</string>
<string name="48425">We&apos;re with you, &lt;FullName&gt;! We&apos;ll follow you every step of the way!</string>
<string name="48426">I&apos;d surrender, but the Luskans don&apos;t take prisoners.</string>
<string name="48427">We&apos;re trapped here. We&apos;ll never make it out alive.</string>
<string name="48428">Death to the Luskan invaders!</string>
<string name="48429">I won&apos;t hurt you, little girl.</string>
<string name="48430">What are you doing out here?</string>
<string name="48431">Get lost, runt!</string>
<string name="48432">Me not hurt you, little girl.</string>
<string name="48433">What you do out here?</string>
<string name="48434">Are you Leesa? Luce&apos;s little sister?</string>
<string name="48435">You be Leesa? Luce&apos;s sister?</string>
<string name="48436">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="48437">Me want ask you questions.</string>
<string name="48438">It&apos;s safe now, Leesa. You can go back to the Moonstone Mask.</string>
<string name="48439">You go home, girly. It safe now.</string>
<string name="48440">Sorry, kid. I can&apos;t help you.</string>
<string name="48441">Sorry, me no can help you.</string>
<string name="48442">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m not a stranger. I&apos;m &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m a friend of your sister, Luce.</string>
<string name="48443">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me &lt;FirstName&gt;. Me be friend of sister Luce.</string>
<string name="48444"></string>
<string name="48445"></string>
<string name="48446">Who are you? You ain&apos;t one of them Luskan soldiers, are you? Luce said to stay away from them &apos;cause they&apos;d hurt me.</string>
<string name="48447">When I get to the Moonstone Mask I&apos;ll see Luce again! I sure miss her.</string>
<string name="48448">We made it! We made it! I&apos;m going to be with my sister Luce!</string>
<string name="48449">It&apos;s warm in here. Out in the streets it was always cold.</string>
<string name="48450">Eeeek!!</string>
<string name="48451">*hee-hee* You talk funny. I like you.</string>
<string name="48452">*hee-hee* You talk funny. I like you.</string>
<string name="48453">*hee-hee* You talk funny. I like you.</string>
<string name="48454">Luce is my sister, but I can&apos;t get back to her; I&apos;m too scared.</string>
<string name="48455">I don&apos;t know anything. I&apos;m cold. Please, don&apos;t hurt me.</string>
<string name="48456">I&apos;m Leesa. I came here with Luce. She&apos;s my big sister. She&apos;s pretty. There were lots of soldiers out here, so we had to hide. </string>
<string name="48457">Luce fell asleep &apos;cause it was dark. I heard a noise and got scared, so I ran away. Then there were monsters.</string>
<string name="48458">I want to go back to the Moonstone Mask. That&apos;s where Luce works. I miss her. It&apos;s cold out here and I&apos;m scared at night.</string>
<string name="48459">I can? Gosh, thanks! You&apos;re a real nice &lt;man/woman&gt;. I can&apos;t wait to see Luce again!</string>
<string name="48460">Oh. That&apos;s okay, &lt;mister/missus&gt;. You look real busy. You got to fight them other soldiers and stuff. </string>
<string name="48461">If you see Luce tell her to come get me, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="48462">I&apos;m not supposed to trust strangers. Luce taught me that.</string>
<string name="48463">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I guess if you know Luce you&apos;re not so bad. Okay, I&apos;ll go back to the Moonstone Mask!</string>
<string name="48464">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I better stay here. I&apos;m too scared to leave with all this fighting going on.</string>
<string name="48465"> You&apos;re a real nice &lt;man/woman&gt;. I can&apos;t wait to see Luce again!</string>
<string name="48466">I hope she ain&apos;t mad &apos;cause I ran off. I was just scared. I didn&apos;t mean to get lost.</string>
<string name="48467">Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t hurt you.</string>
<string name="48468">Who are you old man? What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="48469">You not worry. Me not hurt you.</string>
<string name="48470">I need to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="48471">Who you be, old man? Why you here?</string>
<string name="48472">Me need ask you stuff.</string>
<string name="48473">How have you avoided capture by the Luskan army?</string>
<string name="48474">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="48475">How did a blind man help the children leave the city?</string>
<string name="48476">How a blind man help kiddies leave city?</string>
<string name="48477">How come Luskan not catch you yet?</string>
<string name="48478">Follow me, old man. I&apos;ll take you to safety.</string>
<string name="48479">You follow me, old man. Me take you somewhere safe.</string>
<string name="48480">What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="48481">What you mean?</string>
<string name="48482">Never heard of you.</string>
<string name="48483">Back door? This place doesn&apos;t have a back door.</string>
<string name="48484">Back door? This place no got back door!</string>
<string name="48485">Where can I find this back door?</string>
<string name="48486">Where me find secret back door?</string>
<string name="48487">Thanks for the info! I&apos;m going to use it to find Aribeth and Maugrim!</string>
<string name="48488">Me going to use door for finding Maugrim and Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48489">Who... who are you? What do you want? I&apos;m just a poor old blind man. Don&apos;t hurt me, please.</string>
<string name="48490">Hmmm... your voice. You don&apos;t have a Luskan accent. And I guess if you were a Luskan soldier you&apos;d already have chopped my head off.</string>
<string name="48491">My name is Asgard. Asgard the Aged, the children call me. Or sometimes Asgard Eagle-Eyes if they want to be mean.</string>
<string name="48492">At least, the children used to call me that. No children left here now, thanks to those Luskan butchers. I got as many of them out of the city as I could, but I couldn&apos;t save them all.</string>
<string name="48493">Since you don&apos;t seem like you&apos;re interested in killing me, I&apos;ll be happy to answer your questions for you.</string>
<string name="48494">Ah, I can tell by your voice that you are a &lt;man/woman&gt; of simple mind.</string>
<string name="48495">But if you aren&apos;t a Luskan soldier, I can only wonder what brings you here.</string>
<string name="48496">Yes, leave an old, blind man in peace. I only wish the Luskan army would do the same for this city.</string>
<string name="48497">Follow you? That would be a neat trick, considering I&apos;m blind as a stone!</string>
<string name="48498">Besides, I&apos;m not leaving. A small thing like an invading army isn&apos;t enough to make me leave my home.</string>
<string name="48499">You might look at me and see just a blind, helpless old man. But if that&apos;s the case you&apos;re getting no more use out of your eyes than I do of mine.</string>
<string name="48500">Long ago, before my hair grew white and my eyes grew black, I was a smuggler here in Neverwinter. Back then I wasn&apos;t known as Asgard the Aged. Just Asgard, I was... Just Asgard...</string>
<string name="48501">That just proves how good I was. I knew every secret way into or out of the city, and even blind I can still find most of them. That&apos;s how I was able to help the children escape when the Luskan army first came.</string>
<string name="48502">And that&apos;s how I&apos;ve avoided capture by the Luskan soldiers so far. Whenever I heard them lumbering up my front steps to search the building I just slipped away out my back door.</string>
<string name="48503">Ah, but it does. A secret door. Unfortunately it leads right into the heart of where the Luskan army&apos;s high command has set up their camp.</string>
<string name="48504">It&apos;s kind of funny, really. They built a huge iron gate guarded by a score of archers to protect their high commanders, and an old, blind smuggler&apos;s got himself a secret, unguarded way in.</string>
<string name="48505">It&apos;s over there against the far corner wall; just touch the bookshelf. Not too difficult to find, once you know what you&apos;re looking for. Feel free to use it, if you like.</string>
<string name="48506">But please, don&apos;t go spreading news of it all about. If Neverwinter survives this war, I want to keep my little secret. You never know when it might come in handy.</string>
<string name="48507">Well, then. I hope you kill them when you find them. After the slaughter they brought down on this city, they deserve no less.</string>
<string name="48508">As for me, I think I&apos;ll stay here. I doubt a blind man would be much help on your expedition.</string>
<string name="48509">Who are you? What are you all doing in here?</string>
<string name="48510">You sure have a negative attitude.</string>
<string name="48511">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="48512">Who you be? What you all be doing in here?</string>
<string name="48513">You got bad attitude!</string>
<string name="48514">Me go now.</string>
<string name="48515">We aren&apos;t dead yet. We still have a chance.</string>
<string name="48516">We not dead yet. We still got a chance.</string>
<string name="48517"></string>
<string name="48518"></string>
<string name="48519"></string>
<string name="48520"></string>
<string name="48521">The Luskan&apos;s came on us so fast. We didn&apos;t stand a chance. I never even had time to order a retreat.</string>
<string name="48522">It&apos;s only a matter of time until they find us here. They&apos;ll probably kill me last - that&apos;s what they do. They make the captain watch all his men die first.</string>
<string name="48523">Come here to die with the rest of us, have you? You&apos;re welcome to stay and await the gruesome end, if you want.</string>
<string name="48524"></string>
<string name="48525">We&apos;re just a company of Neverwinter soldiers, a few survivors - though we won&apos;t be alive much longer, I fear.</string>
<string name="48526">Back out into the street? That&apos;s suicide. Of course the Luskan&apos;s will kill us all anyway, so what does it matter?</string>
<string name="48527">I&apos;m just a realist. My troops are bloody and beaten and the streets are crawling with Luskan soldiers. We&apos;re outmanned ten to one at least.</string>
<string name="48528">Even if we could make it back to the City Core alive, what&apos;s the point? Any help we expect to get from the Lords&apos; Alliance will never get here in time. The whole city is doomed.</string>
<string name="48529">There&apos;s no way we can win this war. What, do you plan to lead a handful of soldiers against an army?</string>
<string name="48530"></string>
<string name="48531"></string>
<string name="48532"></string>
<string name="48533"></string>
<string name="48534">I know you. You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, the hero who saved us from the Wailing Death. HA! Lot of good that did. Death by plague or death by war - doesn&apos;t make much difference, does it?</string>
<string name="48535"></string>
<string name="48536"></string>
<string name="48537"></string>
<string name="48538"></string>
<string name="48539">There&apos;s too many of those Luskan soldiers in the streets. We don&apos;t stand a chance.</string>
<string name="48540">The captain should have given the order to retreat long ago. Now it&apos;s too late.</string>
<string name="48541">We&apos;re with you, &lt;FullName&gt;! We&apos;ll follow you every step of the way!</string>
<string name="48542">I&apos;d surrender, but the Luskans don&apos;t take prisoners.</string>
<string name="48543">We&apos;re trapped here. We&apos;ll never make it out alive.</string>
<string name="48544">Death to the Luskan invaders!</string>
<string name="48545">Neverwinter shall not fall to your army, Aribeth!</string>
<string name="48546">If you surrender I will let you live.</string>
<string name="48547">The time for words is past, Aribeth. Defend yourself!</string>
<string name="48548">Time to die, traitor!</string>
<string name="48549">Neverwinter not give up! You army not going to win!</string>
<string name="48550">If you give up now, me let you live.</string>
<string name="48551">Me not got time for you words. Me want fight!</string>
<string name="48552">You traitor! You die now!</string>
<string name="48553">Is that why you kill the innocent of Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="48554">That be why you kill innocent mans and womans of Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="48555">Is that why you destroyed Neverwinter? Out of a perverted sense of justice?</string>
<string name="48556">That be why you destroy Neverwinter? You think you bring justice?</string>
<string name="48557">Morag is just using you, Aribeth! She&apos;ll kill you as soon as you&apos;ve served her purpose.</string>
<string name="48558">Morag just use you, Aribeth! She kill you when she done with you.</string>
<string name="48559">I would never bow down to the Queen of the Old Ones!</string>
<string name="48560">If she had I wouldn&apos;t quit in the middle of a fight!</string>
<string name="48561">Answer my questions and I might let you live!</string>
<string name="48562">Put up your sword and die with honor!</string>
<string name="48563">Die, traitor! Die!</string>
<string name="48564">Me never bow down to lizard girly Queen!</string>
<string name="48565">If she pick me, at least me not quit in middle of fight!</string>
<string name="48566">You keep fighting! Die with honor!</string>
<string name="48567">Answer me question and me let you live.</string>
<string name="48568">I still believe Neverwinter can be saved.</string>
<string name="48569">There is still hope.</string>
<string name="48570">I am the one who will ask the questions, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48571">Me still think Neverwinter can be saved.</string>
<string name="48572">Me the one who ask questions here!</string>
<string name="48573">There still be hope.</string>
<string name="48574">Where are Maugrim and the Word of Power?</string>
<string name="48575">Tell me about Morag.</string>
<string name="48576">How did you come to this, Aribeth? Surely there is more to it than Fenthick&apos;s death.</string>
<string name="48577">Where be Maugrim and Power Word?</string>
<string name="48578">Me want know more &apos;bout Morag!</string>
<string name="48579">How you get like this, Aribeth? It got be more than just &apos;cause of Fenthick.</string>
<string name="48580">I cannot let you live after what you have done.</string>
<string name="48581">Me cannot let you live after what you done.</string>
<string name="48582">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="48583">Me want ask you stuff.</string>
<string name="48584">The only thing inevitable is your death!</string>
<string name="48585">Me sick of you words! Me kill you now!</string>
<string name="48586">It sounds like you&apos;re trying to justify what you did.</string>
<string name="48587">You were angry and you sought revenge. You acted like a child!</string>
<string name="48588">Sound like you try to make excuse for what you done. </string>
<string name="48589">You mad and you want get even. You sound like spoiled child!</string>
<string name="48590">You&apos;re right - Neverwinter brought this upon itself.</string>
<string name="48591">You right - Neverwinter bring this on itself.</string>
<string name="48592">It is not too late, Aribeth. There is still a chance to make things right.</string>
<string name="48593">It not be too late yet, Aribeth. You still got chance for make stuff right.</string>
<string name="48594">You can never make up for the evil you have done, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48595">You bring lots of evil to Neverwinter. You never make up for that.</string>
<string name="48596">Your knowledge of the Luskan forces could save hundreds of lives.</string>
<string name="48597">You know stuff &apos;bout Luskan army. It could save lots of lives.</string>
<string name="48598">It&apos;s too dangerous to let you live. You must die, Aribeth!</string>
<string name="48599">It dangerous for me let you live. You die now!</string>
<string name="48600">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Lord Nasher has promised me he would be lenient if you surrendered to him.</string>
<string name="48601">You would do this to save the people of Neverwinter, not to save yourself.</string>
<string name="48602">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Lord Nasher tell me he go easy on you if you surrender.</string>
<string name="48603">You do this for help Neverwinter people, not for help youself.</string>
<string name="48604">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You cannot undo what you have done. But you can change the path you are on.</string>
<string name="48605">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You not change what you done, but you can change what path you on.</string>
<string name="48606">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Look inside yourself, Aribeth. You may discover you have not changed as much as you think.</string>
<string name="48607">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Look inside youself. You not change so much, me think.</string>
<string name="48608">The woman who gave me this ring would not have said such a thing. </string>
<string name="48609">Woman who give me this ring not say such things.</string>
<string name="48610">To remember you as you once were, Aribeth. And in the hopes you would one day remember yourself.</string>
<string name="48611">Me want remember you as you used to be. And me hope one day you remember youself.</string>
<string name="48612">Then go forward. Leave your hate and vengeance behind.</string>
<string name="48613">You not go back. You go forward. Leave all you hate behind.</string>
<string name="48614">Remember who you are, Aribeth. Look into your heart.</string>
<string name="48615">You forget who you be. Look in you heart to remember.</string>
<string name="48616">I trust you to do what is right, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48617">Me trust you for do what is right, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48618">Go to meet your fate with honor, Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48619">Nasher may be more merciful than you think.</string>
<string name="48620">This is madness! Flee this place, Aribeth - escape with your life!</string>
<string name="48621">Join with me, Aribeth - together we can defeat Maugrim and Morag!</string>
<string name="48622">What was I thinking? I can&apos;t trust you - you&apos;re a traitor!</string>
<string name="48623">Go meet you fate with honor, Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48624">Maybe Nasher be merciful?</string>
<string name="48625">This be crazy! You need run away, Aribeth! Run away and save you life.</string>
<string name="48626">You join me, Aribeth! We go fight Maugrim and Morag together!</string>
<string name="48627">What me thinking? Me not trust you - you big traitor!</string>
<string name="48628">How are feeling, Aribeth?</string>
<string name="48629">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="48630">I should be going now.</string>
<string name="48631">How you be feel, Aribeth?</string>
<string name="48632">Me want ask you stuff.</string>
<string name="48633">Me go now.</string>
<string name="48634">I want to know about Morag and the Old Ones.</string>
<string name="48635">Tell me about the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="48636">What do you know about the Words of Power?</string>
<string name="48637">Me want know &apos;bout Morag and Old Ones.</string>
<string name="48638">You tell me &apos;bout Source Stone.</string>
<string name="48639">What you know &apos;bout Power Words?</string>
<string name="48640">I have no wish to talk to traitors!</string>
<string name="48641">Me not want talk at traitors!</string>
<string name="48642">You are quite calm for one who is facing execution.</string>
<string name="48643">You be calm for one who maybe be executed.</string>
<string name="48644">Saved you? But you&apos;re to be executed.</string>
<string name="48645">How me save you? You going to be executed.</string>
<string name="48646">I am glad you have found peace, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48647">Me glad you find peace, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48648">You are special to me as well, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48649">Me think you special too.</string>
<string name="48650">I care for you too, Aribeth - but I can never forgive you for what you have done.</string>
<string name="48651">Me care for you too, but me not able forgive you for what you done.</string>
<string name="48652">But things aren&apos;t different. You are a prisoner sentenced to execution.</string>
<string name="48653">No, Aribeth - don&apos;t do this to me. It isn&apos;t fair to tell me this. Not now, when I know I will soon lose you.</string>
<string name="48654">No! It not fair you tell me this now! Me no want know this if me going to lose you.</string>
<string name="48655">But things not be different. You be prisoner. They going to execute you.</string>
<string name="48656">Please, Aribeth - I wish to speak more of this.</string>
<string name="48657">Your words are no burden to me, Aribeth. In truth, they lighten the load I carry.</string>
<string name="48658">You are right, Aribeth - I must concentrate on the task at hand.</string>
<string name="48659">It okay. Me want talk more &apos;bout this.</string>
<string name="48660">You no worry - you words make me happy, not sad.</string>
<string name="48661">You right. Me got to worry &apos;bout Morag right now.</string>
<string name="48662">Will you join with me to defeat Morag?</string>
<string name="48663">Me want you join up with me for go fight Morag!</string>
<string name="48664">You&apos;re just stalling! Time to die, Aribeth!</string>
<string name="48665">You just stalling! You die now!</string>
<string name="48666">&lt;FirstName&gt; - I am not surprised to see you here. You have become quite the thorn in Maugrim&apos;s side. Though he would never admit it, I believe you have impressed him with your accomplishments.</string>
<string name="48667">I, however, am not too proud to admit my respect for you. You have thwarted us at almost every turn, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Yet in the end Morag&apos;s will cannot be denied.</string>
<string name="48668">So be it. We shall settle this with blood!</string>
<string name="48669">I was about to make you the same offer, &lt;FirstName&gt; - though I suspect Maugrim would rather sacrifice you to his new Queen.</string>
<string name="48670">Morag is a voracious mistress - it seems there are never enough dead to satisfy her hunger.</string>
<string name="48671">You dare call these people innocent? The citizens of Neverwinter screamed for Fenthick&apos;s death - and Lord Nasher gave it to them!</string>
<string name="48672">His blood is on their hands, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We are all guilty here, and we are all deserving of death.</string>
<string name="48673">You have already lost, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My troops control the city; soon even Castle Never will fall. The streets will run red with the blood of Neverwinter&apos;s children.</string>
<string name="48674">Justice? There is no such thing. I came here for vengeance. But I am not responsible for Neverwinter&apos;s fall.</string>
<string name="48675">My position at the head of the armies only hastened the inevitable end, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Neverwinter was doomed as soon as Maugrim unleashed the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="48676">Can you not feel it in the air? An evil cloud covers the city - the shadow of Morag. The Queen of the Old Ones has awakened, and none shall survive her coming.</string>
<string name="48677">I am no blind fool like Maugrim. I know Morag will betray me. In fact, I&apos;m counting on it. I deserve death for what I have done.</string>
<string name="48678">But when I die I will have the satisfaction of knowing Neverwinter was made to pay for what happened to Fenthick!</string>
<string name="48679">There is nothing more to say, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is too late for words. We must settle this in blood.</string>
<string name="48680">I yield! I yield!</string>
<string name="48681">You have come far since our first meeting, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can no longer stand against you.</string>
<string name="48682">Had Morag foreseen how powerful you would become, perhaps she would have chosen you to be her champion instead of turning her lidless eye in my direction.</string>
<string name="48683">Come then, &lt;FirstName&gt; - deliver me to the fate I have brought upon myself.</string>
<string name="48684">I... I suppose that is true. You have the strength of your convictions, something I lost long ago.</string>
<string name="48685">Honor? I learned long ago there is no such thing. Honor is but a myth. Death, vengeance and despair - these are real.</string>
<string name="48686">Tell me, &lt;FirstName&gt; - how can you go on, knowing you fight for a city that is doomed to fall when the Old Ones return?</string>
<string name="48687">Let me live? You can do no such thing, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You serve Neverwinter, you have no choice but to end my existence.</string>
<string name="48688">Death might actually be a blessing for me, in any case. I grow so very weary with this life.</string>
<string name="48689">I have seen the future in my dreams, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Neverwinter will vanish in a blaze of flame when the Old Ones are reborn - it is inevitable.</string>
<string name="48690">I am at your mercy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Ask your questions and I will answer them.</string>
<string name="48691">Is the execution of my lover not justification enough for what I have become? They say I betrayed Neverwinter, but Neverwinter betrayed Fenthick first!</string>
<string name="48692">Hope? All hope within my heart perished with Fenthick. He was taken from me, the light of my life, and I was left alone in the empty darkness.</string>
<string name="48693">With Fenthick&apos;s death I lost more than a lover! He was a devoted servant of both Tyr and Neverwinter, and I saw how his devotion was repaid!</string>
<string name="48694">How could I believe in a god who allowed such an atrocity? How could I serve a city so mercilessly cruel? When Fenthick was executed I lost my lover, my faith, my loyalty - everything I believed in crumbled around me! </string>
<string name="48695">I know this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And yet, I would speak with you before you end my life. So you might understand why I did what I did.</string>
<string name="48696">Maugrim has the Word of Power in his room - through the door to the east. We knew you were coming, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That is why I am here rather than leading Luskan&apos;s army.</string>
<string name="48697">I was supposed to defend Maugrim from you. But in this, like in everything else, I have failed.</string>
<string name="48698">What can I tell you of the Queen of the Old Ones that you do not already know? She is ancient and cruel, powerful and cunning.</string>
<string name="48699">Even now her spectre has descended upon the city, inflaming the spirits of the Luskan army and drowning Neverwinter&apos;s defenders in hopeless despair.</string>
<string name="48700">The world we know will be consumed in the flames of Morag&apos;s return, until only the bitter ashes of sorrow and death remain.</string>
<string name="48701">I... I am simply telling you what happened, &lt;FirstName&gt;. How I... how I came to break my vows and betray all that I stood for.</string>
<string name="48702">Fenthick&apos;s death set in motion events that could not be stopped. In the end Morag will awaken the Old Ones and we are all doomed.</string>
<string name="48703">I have chosen a path of hatred and bloody vengeance, and from this path there is no escape. It is too late for me. It is too late for us all.</string>
<string name="48704">Perhaps... perhaps you are right. Perhaps, had I acted differently... but it is too late for me now, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="48705">Look around you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Look at the death and destruction I have brought to Neverwinter. I can never make up for this.</string>
<string name="48706">And I have been too long under Morag&apos;s power. The Queen has a... a hold on me. I could not stand with you against her, even if... even if I wanted to. I cannot help the city.</string>
<string name="48707">I could bring my information to Lord Nasher and Aarin Gend, true. But it would not be enough to turn the tide of the battle. Morag&apos;s power will bring victory to the Luskan troops.</string>
<string name="48708">Perhaps a few hundred lives could be saved, though the city would still fall. But what will that avail me? Lord Nasher would still have me executed for what I have done.</string>
<string name="48709">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you think I am a fool, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I know Lord Nasher too well to believe such tripe!</string>
<string name="48710">I should sacrifice myself for the sake of the people who demanded Fenthick&apos;s blood? Do you really believe me capable of so selfless an act, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="48711">Once I would have gladly sacrificed myself for this city. But I have changed, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am no longer the Aribeth you knew. Now I walk a different path.</string>
<string name="48712">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Your words are... wise, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps... perhaps I can set aside my hatred.</string>
<string name="48713">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; There... there is a part of me that still weeps when I see the destruction of Neverwinter. Perhaps... perhaps you are right, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="48714">If I... if I turn myself over to Lord Nasher for execution... Many lives may yet be saved. At least... at least then my own death would have some meaning.</string>
<string name="48715">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You are wasting your time, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am beyond your power to save.</string>
<string name="48716">You... you kept my ring? After my betrayal? After all the death and misery I have brought to you and the city? But... but why?</string>
<string name="48717">I... I am not who I once was, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I... I cannot... it would not be possible... I cannot go back. Not after what I have done.</string>
<string name="48718">Your words are... wise, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps... perhaps I can set aside my hatred.</string>
<string name="48719">There... there is a part of me that still weeps when I see the destruction of Neverwinter. Perhaps... perhaps you are right, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="48720">But you... you will have to trust me in this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Maugrim waits for you behind this door, you must face him now - time is of the essence. </string>
<string name="48721">Then... I shall leave Maugrim to you, and I... I shall deliver myself to Lord Nasher and tell him what I know of the Luskan troop movements.</string>
<string name="48722">If we are lucky, my information may help some of Neverwinter&apos;s citizens escape with their lives. And I... I will submit to Lord Nasher&apos;s judgment, whatever the consequences may be.</string>
<string name="48723">I am grateful to you for this, &lt;FirstName&gt;- this chance to... to do what is right. I wanted you to know that before I go, in case... in case Lord Nasher has me executed before you return.</string>
<string name="48724">Lady Aribeth? It has been a long time since anyone called me that. Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="48725">Your words are kind, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I am ready for whatever awaits.</string>
<string name="48726">No, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If I run away it will mean I have learned nothing. I am ready to accept the consequences of what I have done - whatever those consequences may be.</string>
<string name="48727">No! I... I dare not. I have served Morag for too long. She had a... a hold over me. I am afraid if I must face her or Maugrim I might once again fall under her sway.</string>
<string name="48728">I... I must go to Lord Nasher now, while my resolve is still strong. You must face Maugrim without me. Goodbye, &lt;FirstName&gt; - and good luck.</string>
<string name="48729">It is good to see you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. When I surrendered to Lord Nasher I was certain my execution would be swift.</string>
<string name="48730">I understand. There is still much that must be done if Morag is to be defeated. I wish you luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="48731">I have already given most of my information to Aarin Gend and Lord Nasher - Luskan battle plans and the location of their troops. But I will try to help you however I can.</string>
<string name="48732">The Old Ones are an ancient and evil race distantly related to the lizardmen of our own time. Morag was their queen during the height of their empire.</string>
<string name="48733">But the world changed and the North became a frozen waste, and Morag placed her people in a magical stasis within the Source Stone to await the time of their awakening.</string>
<string name="48734">More than this I cannot say. When I served Morag I cared little for the reasons behind the attack on Neverwinter. I only cared about revenge. But I am finally free of that burden.</string>
<string name="48735">The Source Stone is a great gem located in long forgotten chambers beneath Castle Never. Within this gem is an entire other world, a realm where Morag and her people await the time of the awakening.</string>
<string name="48736">I know the Words of Power were somehow connected with raising Morag and her people from their slumber, but beyond this there is little I can tell you.</string>
<string name="48737">As you know, there were four Words of Power. At first, Maugrim seemed to believe we would need to possess all four Words to awaken Morag.</string>
<string name="48738">However, as Morag&apos;s power grew she sent Maugrim a vision of a ritual that could begin the awakening with only one of the Words.</string>
<string name="48739">But the ritual was only partially successful. Morag was awakened - but she was still trapped within the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="48740">In time Morag&apos;s power will grow until she is able to release herself and her people from the Source Stone, but for now she is trapped inside. I wish I could tell you more, but that is all I know.</string>
<string name="48741">I... I suppose I should not be surprised by your anger. I make no effort to defend my actions, though I thought you, of all people, might not judge me so harshly.</string>
<string name="48742">I hope... I hope you will one day set aside your hate, as I have set aside mine. Perhaps then we can speak as we once did.</string>
<string name="48743">I am a prisoner and a fallen paladin. The powers Tyr once granted me are gone, as are the abilities Morag bestowed upon me.</string>
<string name="48744">And yet, for the first time since Fenthick&apos;s death, I am whole once more. I feel grief over what has happened, of course, and deep regret over what I have done. But I also feel a great calm.</string>
<string name="48745">I have you to thank for this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Without your intervention I would never have found this peace. </string>
<string name="48746">I am ready to meet my fate, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There is a great peace upon me now.</string>
<string name="48747">There are worse things than death. I know this now. And Nasher has not passed judgment upon me yet.</string>
<string name="48748">I am content with whatever fate awaits me, yet in his eyes I see reason to hope I might yet live. If Neverwinter should survive, perhaps Lord Nasher has other plans for me.</string>
<string name="48749">I may yet be given the chance to make amends for all I have done, &lt;FirstName&gt; - though I know I will never be able to fully atone for what I have done.</string>
<string name="48750">But it seems Lord Nasher has chosen to let me live... for now, at least. I am glad, if for no other reason than it gives me a chance to see you again.</string>
<string name="48751">I am at peace, &lt;FirstName&gt; - for the first time since Fenthick&apos;s death. And I have you to thank. You saved me.</string>
<string name="48752">I no longer fear my fate, &lt;FirstName&gt;. When Fenthick... when Fenthick was executed I thought I had lost everything. But now I see this is not true.</string>
<string name="48753">I have you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You were there when I was in my darkest hour, you were there when I needed you - but I was too blind to see.</string>
<string name="48754">But you never gave up on me. I have found myself again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And I finally see how... how special you are to me.</string>
<string name="48755">I understand, &lt;FirstName&gt; - you have every right to feel that way. I only wanted to tell you the truth that is within my own heart.</string>
<string name="48756">You have done more for me than you can ever know, and for this I will always have special feelings for you.</string>
<string name="48757">But I see this makes you uncomfortable, so we shall speak of this no more. Is there something else I might do for you?</string>
<string name="48758">They say it is better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all. I never used to believe that, &lt;FirstName&gt;.. until now.</string>
<string name="48759">I loved Fenthick with all my heart, and his memory will always be dear to me. But that does not mean I can never love another. Perhaps in time we might... if things had been different... </string>
<string name="48760">Lord Nasher has not passed judgment on me yet. I am content with whatever fate awaits, but in his eyes I see hope that I might live.</string>
<string name="48761">Should Neverwinter survive, he may chose another sentence for me. I may yet be given a chance to make some small amends for what I have done. There is yet hope for me... and for us.</string>
<string name="48762">Forgive me for speaking so frankly about this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My heart could not stay silent, but I should not have burdened you with this - not while you still must face Morag.</string>
<string name="48763">If fate is kind, perhaps we will be able to continue this once Morag is slain. But while she lives we must set our own feelings aside for the greater good.</string>
<string name="48764">Perhaps if I had learned this lesson long ago, tragedy could have been averted. Forgive me, but I will speak of my feelings for you no more. You must concentrate on the task at hand.</string>
<string name="48765">Please, &lt;FirstName&gt; - we have both made our feelings toward each other clear. But Morag still lives; now is not the time for this discussion.</string>
<string name="48766">This I cannot do, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Even if Lord Nasher chose to release me from this cell, I would have to refuse your request.</string>
<string name="48767">I served too long under the Queen of the Old Ones. She has a... a hold over me. A power I fear I might not be able to resist.</string>
<string name="48768">I will not put myself in the position where I might betray Neverwinter again. I have learned from my mistakes.</string>
<string name="48769">But I dare not accompany you, for fear I will fall once again under Morag&apos;s spell. Do you trust me enough to let me go, if I vow to surrender myself to Lord Nasher? Can you take that risk?</string>
<string name="48770">My fate is in Lord Nasher&apos;s hands now.</string>
<string name="48771">I see Morag was right, &lt;FullName&gt; - Aribeth was not strong enough to defeat you. But she has served her purpose.</string>
<string name="48772">You have come too late, the ritual is over, the awakening of the Old Ones has begun!</string>
<string name="48773">The Creator Race will be reborn - and you shall be the first to taste the power my Queen has given unto me!</string>
<string name="48774">Fools! I cannot be so easy slain!</string>
<string name="48775">I am reborn! The Queen of the Old Ones has made me immortal!</string>
<string name="48776">No - no, this cannot be! I am immortal! No!! NOOOO!!!</string>
<string name="48777">The golems, there&apos;s... *ungh* there&apos;s no defeating them... </string>
<string name="48778">His massive blade, it cut me right - *agh!* - right there... </string>
<string name="48779">I&apos;d like to get my hands on whoever&apos;s controlling it, I tell ya... </string>
<string name="48780">I need to see the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="48781">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="48782">Me need see stone.</string>
<string name="48783">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="48784">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="48785">What do you know about the Source Stone?</string>
<string name="48786">What you know &apos;bout Source Stone?</string>
<string name="48787">Where are the Words of Power?</string>
<string name="48788">Where be Power Words?</string>
<string name="48789">Who are you again?</string>
<string name="48790">Who you be again?</string>
<string name="48791">Don&apos;t you think it might be dangerous to unlock the secrets of the Source Stone?</string>
<string name="48792">You not think it dangerous to unlock secrets of stone?</string>
<string name="48793">How come nobody noticed this stone down here before?</string>
<string name="48794">This stone be here long time. How come no one see it &apos;til now?</string>
<string name="48795">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You feel the call of the ancient evil that dwells within the stone, Master Ford. Beware lest it consume you.</string>
<string name="48796">Tell me your theories.</string>
<string name="48797">Me want hear your theories.</string>
<string name="48798">I&apos;m not interested in your theories.</string>
<string name="48799">Me not interested in you theory.</string>
<string name="48800">Greetings, I am Master Ford, head archeologist of Neverwinter. Lord Nasher mentioned someone might be coming to investigate the Source Stone. &lt;FullName&gt;, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="48801">Feel free to speak to me again anytime, &lt;FullName&gt;. I&apos;m always eager to discuss the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="48802">I tried to pry some of its secrets from Haedraline - the lizard creature Lord Nasher has imprisoned in the dungeons. But she didn&apos;t seem to trust me.</string>
<string name="48803">Uh... yes. Yes, of course. Why should I be the only one allowed to see it? It isn&apos;t mine, after all. Go right in and take a look if you want.</string>
<string name="48804">Of course, I&apos;m happy to share my knowledge with you. I feel my theories on the secrets of the Source Stone are somewhat wasted on my students.</string>
<string name="48805">Goodness - you are a thick one, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="48806">The stone radiates a magical heat strong enough to keep the entire city warm even in this chill climate, yet gentle enough that you can actually go right up and touch the stone itself.</string>
<string name="48807">That is all we really know for certain. However, I have several theories based on my own examinations and extensive research into ancient manuscripts.</string>
<string name="48808">They&apos;re with the Source Stone. I thought they might be the key to unlocking it&apos;s secrets, but they didn&apos;t work. Perhaps something is missing.</string>
<string name="48809">Back again, &lt;FullName&gt;? Is there something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="48810">The Source Stone is truly a remarkable discovery, I must say. Fascinating. I&apos;ve been an archeologist for nearly half a century and I&apos;ve never come across anything like it before.</string>
<string name="48811">I doubt it will do you much good, however. There doesn&apos;t seem to be any way to unlock the secrets of the stone. I thought the Words of Power might be the key, but they haven&apos;t done anything so far.</string>
<string name="48812">Esmerelda thinks we shouldn&apos;t be tampering with the Source Stone. And Cletus is as ignorant as he is arrogant. I gave him some old texts to read to keep him out of my hair.</string>
<string name="48813">I am Master Ford, Neverwinter&apos;s foremost expert in ancient artifacts and historical treasures. In short, an archeologist.</string>
<string name="48814">When the Source Stone was discovered here beneath Castle Never, Lord Nasher wisely appointed me to investigate its secrets. What I have uncovered so far has been fascinating!</string>
<string name="48815">You sound like my assistant Esmerelda. She wants nothing to do with the stone. But I am well aware of the risks involved.</string>
<string name="48816">And yet... I cannot leave the stone alone. When awake it consumes my thoughts and at night it haunts my dreams. It calls to me... it *wants* me to unravel the mysteries contained within!</string>
<string name="48817">It was only after that lizard creature Haedraline told us of the Source Stone&apos;s existence that we began to search beneath the dungeons of Castle Never for hidden passages.</string>
<string name="48818">We found the secret door easily enough, then. It was almost too easy, considering nobody ever noticed it before. It&apos;s almost like the Source Stone itself *wants* to be found now. </string>
<string name="48819">My assistant Esmerelda said the same thing. I&apos;ll tell you what I told her - I&apos;m an experienced archeologist. I know what I&apos;m doing. Don&apos;t worry about me.</string>
<string name="48820">The Source Stone is surrounded by four pedestals. I placed a Word of Power on each pedestal, but of course there were only three Words.</string>
<string name="48821">I suspect there is a fourth Word that is necessary to unlock the Source Stone. Four pedestals, four Words of Power. Just a theory, of course, but a fairly logical conclusion.</string>
<string name="48822">Ah, well. Perhaps some other time, then. Is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="48823">My research indicates that there is an entire extra-planar realm within its gleaming crystalline surface; a nexus of many parallel worlds, a conduit linking alternate planes and universes with each other. </string>
<string name="48824">And something lives within the Source Stone as well. Of that I&apos;m certain. A powerful life force emanates from the stone - probably from the inhabitants of the extra-planar realm. </string>
<string name="48825">That lizard creature Haedraline could probably tell you more, if she wanted to. But when I tried to speak to her she refused to answer my questions. I don&apos;t think she trusts me.</string>
<string name="48826">I need to see the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="48827">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="48828">Me need see stone.</string>
<string name="48829">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="48830">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="48831">What do you know about the Source Stone?</string>
<string name="48832">What you know &apos;bout Source Stone?</string>
<string name="48833">Where are the Words of Power?</string>
<string name="48834">Where be Power Words?</string>
<string name="48835">Who are you?</string>
<string name="48836">Who you be?</string>
<string name="48837">Who is Master Ford and where can I find him?</string>
<string name="48838">Who be Master Ford and where me find him?</string>
<string name="48839">I don&apos;t like this. I don&apos;t like this one bit. When I became an archeologist, this was not what I had in mind!</string>
<string name="48840">You should go speak to Master Ford. Maybe you can talk some sense into him and get him to give this all up.</string>
<string name="48841">Master Ford is messing with things he doesn&apos;t understand. Things like that Source Stone are best left to wizards, not professors and their students!</string>
<string name="48842">You&apos;ll have to see Master Ford about that. I don&apos;t know why anyone would want to see that thing, though. There&apos;s something evil about that stone - I can feel it!</string>
<string name="48843">Go ahead and ask your questions. I&apos;ll tell you whatever I know.</string>
<string name="48844">I see even the slow witted are bitten by the curiosity bug. Seems the search for knowledge is a curse none of us can escape.</string>
<string name="48845">I am Esmerelda, one of Master Ford&apos;s students. He has me concocting philters of crushed gems, as if he hopes that will give him some insight into the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="48846">He&apos;s a well-known archeologist. Well-known in his field, anyway. It&apos;s a rather small, tight-knit group. Most of them have died off, tampering with arcane treasures they&apos;ve unearthed.</string>
<string name="48847">Normally Master Ford has the sense not to mess with magic, but he&apos;s fascinated by the Source Stone. That&apos;s him over there by the door.</string>
<string name="48848">I know it&apos;s a thing of great power - and great evil! I wish we had never found it. There&apos;s something alive inside - that&apos;s what Master Ford says.</string>
<string name="48849">You&apos;d think that would make him more cautious, but he&apos;s behaving very strangely. It&apos;s like the stone has some strange hold over him.</string>
<string name="48850">I guess I shouldn&apos;t be surprised you&apos;ve never heard of him.</string>
<string name="48851">They&apos;re with the Source Stone. Master Ford thinks they might help unlock the secrets of what&apos;s inside. Personally, there are some secrets I prefer not to know.</string>
<string name="48852">But this stone isn&apos;t like normal gems. We have no idea what we&apos;re getting into here, and I don&apos;t like this one bit.</string>
<string name="48853">I need to see the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="48854">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="48855">Me need see stone.</string>
<string name="48856">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="48857">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="48858">What do you know about the Source Stone?</string>
<string name="48859">What you know &apos;bout Source Stone?</string>
<string name="48860">Where are the Words of Power?</string>
<string name="48861">Where be Power Words?</string>
<string name="48862">Who are you?</string>
<string name="48863">Who you be?</string>
<string name="48864">Who is Master Ford and where can I find him?</string>
<string name="48865">Who be Master Ford and where me find him?</string>
<string name="48866">Huh? What? Oh - you startled me. I was rather engrossed in these manuscripts Master Ford has me looking over. Fascinating reading. </string>
<string name="48867">Finally, I can return to these manuscripts. They&apos;re far more interesting than you, I must say.</string>
<string name="48868">These documents date from the time of the Creator Race, if you can believe that! Hopefully they&apos;ll give us some insight into the Source Stone we unearthed. </string>
<string name="48869">Yes, well - you&apos;ll have to speak to Master Ford about that. Now, is there something else or can I get back to my parchments and tomes?</string>
<string name="48870">(sigh) Master Ford always harps upon the value of sharing our knowledge with others, so I suppose I should answer your questions.</string>
<string name="48871">Goodness - you are a thick one, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="48872">I am Cletus, if you must know. Master Ford&apos;s most promising student. He even told me so himself.</string>
<string name="48873">Master Ford is only the most famous archeologist in all of Neverwinter! He&apos;s spent the better part of fifty years unearthing items of great historical significance!</string>
<string name="48874">But he&apos;s never unearthed anything like this before. I&apos;m honored he chose me to help him uncover the secrets of the Source Stone! That&apos;s him, over there by the door.</string>
<string name="48875">The stone contains immense power and radiates a widespread but gentle warmth throughout the whole city. That&apos;s the reason it&apos;s never winter in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="48876">Other than this we *know* very little. But Master Ford has several interesting theories. You should speak to him about them.</string>
<string name="48877">I shouldn&apos;t expect someone like you has ever heard of him. He&apos;s an academic. Do you know what that word means? A-ca-dem-ic?</string>
<string name="48878">They&apos;re with the Source Stone, of course. Master Ford feels their power is the key to unlocking the secrets within. Perhaps you should speak to him about this. </string>
<string name="48879">Though the true origin of gloves of this type is unknown, those sold in Waterdeep often claim to be functional replicas of a pair of gloves once used by Halaster Blackcloak to assist him in making the notorious traps of Undermountain.</string>
<string name="48880">Greater Gloves of the Artificer</string>
<string name="48881">Gauntlet of Fury</string>
<string name="48882">This single wrought iron gauntlet was wrought by a former student of Laeral Silverhand Arunsun who joined the Red Wizards of Thay when he turned to evil. 

An invisible but tangible field of force continuously surrounds the wearer, providing a bonus similar to a mage armor spell.

Once per day, the wearer can also cast a magic missile spell and a greater missile storm spell.</string>
<string name="48883">Gloves of Lightning</string>
<string name="48884">Once a personal &quot;interrogation tool&quot; of Rimardo Domine, an Overwizard of Luskan&apos;s Host Tower of the Arcane, these flexible leather gloves have since been circulated among powerful members of the pirate community.  

The gloves are covered with small copper rivets.  The wearer may use the gloves to throw a sharp electric jolt at a nearby target.</string>
<string name="48885">Gloves of the Balanced Hands</string>
<string name="48886">Used as a training aid by the rangers of the Moonwood when tutoring aspiring students, these fine leather gloves allow the wearer to fight as if already trained in two-weapon fighting and ambidexterity.</string>
<string name="48887">Brooch of Shielding</string>
<string name="48888">A simple gold brooch, such as might be used to fasten a cloak.</string>
<string name="48889">This appears to be a piece of simple gold jewelry used to fasten a cloak or cape. In addition to this mundane task, the Brooch of Shielding can be activated with a touch to place an invisible field of force around the wearer, granting extra protection and immunity to magic missiles.

A common defensive tool among wizards, these brooches commonly bear the symbol of Mystra or Azuth.</string>
<string name="48890">Dove&apos;s Harp</string>
<string name="48891">A hand-held harp.</string>
<string name="48892">This item&apos;s original name has been lost, and its current name derives from Dove Falconhand, who owns such a harp.  These masterwork harps have from twenty to thirty-six strings.  When it is played, the harp&apos;s music can cure listeners and cast a warm light. </string>
<string name="48893">Austruth Harp</string>
<string name="48894">A small but well-crafted hand-held harp.</string>
<string name="48895">A wise and powerful bard in the Moonshaes named Falataer created the first of these instruments, using them to test and reward the students of his bardic college.  Others have since copied the designs, keeping the name Falataer gave them to honor him.</string>
<string name="48896">Ollamh Harp</string>
<string name="48897">A wise and powerful bard in the Moonshaes named Falataer created the first of these instruments, using them to test and reward the students of his bardic college. Others have since copied the designs, keeping the name Falataer gave them to honor him.

This masterwork harp can be played to cast mass charm, mass haste, and summon monster VI each once per day.</string>
<string name="48898">Janthra&apos;s Harp</string>
<string name="48899">By playing this masterwork harp the harpist can envelop all creatures within 10 feet of the harp in an invisibility sphere.</string>
<string name="48900">Deck of Hazards</string>
<string name="48901">This deck of cards appears to be designed for some kind of game of chance. The cards are ornately decorated and made of unusually thick paper that seems highly resistant to damage. A palpable aura of magic and danger surrounds them. </string>
<string name="48902">The mages of the Empire of Netheril once played the card game of Hazard for idle amusement, building decks of slightly magical cards to use in friendly competition against each other. 

In the millennia since the fall of Netheril, however, the magic in the surviving decks has gradually steeped and intensified. Now, a Deck of Hazards produces many powerful effects both beneficial and baneful on those who take the risk of drawing cards from the deck.

An adventurer who is so fortunate -- or unfortunate, as the case may be -- to discover a Deck of Hazards may choose to draw one, two, or three cards. Once the decision has been made, however, it cannot be retracted. The specified number of cards will be drawn automatically, and then the deck will vanish forever. </string>
<string name="48903">Amulet of Undead Turning</string>
<string name="48904">These necklaces are occasionally distributed among the faithful by powerful temples, to protect them in holy missions against the undead. Necklaces of this type are usable only by non-evil clerics and paladins.  Amulets of this type are most commonly found in use among followers of Lathander, and these pendants often bear the symbol of the Morninglord.</string>
<string name="48905">Necklace of Fireballs</string>
<string name="48906">This appears to be nothing but a cheap medallion. </string>
<string name="48907">Once its true nature has been perceived, this necklace appears as a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer, who can easily hurl them over long distances.  When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it bursts into a magic fireball.  

Different spheres do different amounts of damage.  The more damage a sphere deals, the bigger it is.

Many such devices have been created by wizards across Faerun, and this particular device bears no distinguishing marks to identify its creator.</string>
<string name="48908">Scarab of Protection</string>
<string name="48909">This device appears to be a silver medallion in the shape of a dung beetle. It gives off a faint magical aura.</string>
<string name="48910">This slender silver chain bears a medallion in the shape of a dung beetle. 

The dung beetle was originally a holy creature associated with the Mulhorandi sun-god Ra due to its tendency to burrow a solar-disk-like circular hole in dung.  These creatures&apos; likenesses were often used for the holy protective charms known as scarabs.  Since Ra&apos;s demise in the Orcgate Wars, his successor Horus-Re grants these totems their protective powers.</string>
<string name="48911">Luckstone</string>
<string name="48912">This thin chain bears a small pendant of roughly polished agate.</string>
<string name="48913">This slender chain bears a luckstone pendant of rough polished agate. Such stones come from the halfling homeland, Lurien.  &quot;The luck of the hin&quot; is said to have rubbed off on the rocks and grants the luck to the bearers of such trinkets.</string>
<string name="48914">Arvoreen&apos;s Amulet of Aid</string>
<string name="48915">This item is a three-inch-diameter gold disk with the holy symbol of Arvoreen inlaid in platinum. It grants the wearer the ability to cast aid six times.  It cannot be used by an evil creature.</string>
<string name="48916">Amulet of the Harpers</string>
<string name="48917">The mysterious semi-secret society called the Harpers makes these amulets  for their senior members. The amulets are fashioned from silver that has been magically treated to give it the hardness of steel and grant the wearer several magical protections.</string>
<string name="48918">Lesser Ice Necklace of the Ulutiun</string>
<string name="48919">Several of these necklaces of magically hardened and preserved ice were created by a half-mad sorcerer who wandered among the Ulutiun tribes of the Great Glacier. 

The necklace mounts four transparent acorn-sized crystals.  The wearer can detach a crystal and hurl it at a distance.  When the crystal reaches the end of its trajectory, it explodes into a storm of ice storm.</string>
<string name="48920">Ring of Animal Friendship</string>
<string name="48921">Crafted of magically preserved twisted green twigs infused with the scent of edible berries, these rings are often employed by druids and rangers throughout the High Forest in pacifying the local wildlife.  Many have their twigs woven into subtle prayers to nature deities like Mielikki and Silvanus.</string>
<string name="48922">Ring of Hiding</string>
<string name="48923">This ring is actually a magic leather cord that ties around a finger.  It is tanned to be vaguely flesh-toned and is so subtle that it often goes unnoticed when worn.  Similarly, it allows the wearer to blend easily into the background to escape detection.

Though a common item among rogues and others who wish to go unnoticed, this item is rapidly becoming standard equipment among the Night Masks, according to the Westgate city watch.</string>
<string name="48924">Ring of Improved Evasion</string>
<string name="48925">This ring continually grants the wearer extreme nimbleness, allowing her to avoid damage as if she had the improved evasion ability. 

These rings have been used as training tools among the Red Wizards in an effort to lower the mortality rate among apprentice battle mages.</string>
<string name="48926">Ring of Force Shield</string>
<string name="48927">Made by the Harpell clan of wizards in Longsaddle, these simple iron bands generate a large shield-sized invisible wall of force that stays with the ring and can be wielded by the wearer as if it were a normal shield. This special creation, since it can be activated and deactivated at will, has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.</string>
<string name="48928">Ring of Freedom of Movement</string>
<string name="48929">This gold ring allows the wearer to act as if continually under the effect of a freedom of movement spell.  The name of Shaundakul is inscribed in flowing script on the inside of the band.</string>
<string name="48930">Aribeth&apos;s Ring</string>
<string name="48931">Once the family heirloom of an elven paladin of Tyr, this protective ring was lost with the fall of its owner in combat. </string>
<string name="48932">Bone Ring</string>
<string name="48933">Crafted by clerics of Myrkul, these rings are carved from stone or ivory as often as from bone, but are never made of metal. The rings grant their wearer immunity to energy drain and ability drain attacks.  </string>
<string name="48934">Commander&apos;s Ring</string>
<string name="48935">The war wizards of Cormyr forge these protective rings for use by the Cormyrian military. With the proper command word, a commander&apos;s ring can also cast the useful spells of knock and light.  </string>
<string name="48936">Ring of Disease Immunity</string>
<string name="48937">The wearers of these rings are immune to all types of infections and diseases.

Lacksun Zollan, a Cormyrian paladin of Ilmater, has travelled much of Faerun granting such rings to those he deems to be victims of priests of Talona.  As he has become fond of saying, he plans to break Talona&apos;s work &quot;one finger at a time.&quot;</string>
<string name="48938">Ring of Might</string>
<string name="48939">These rings are forged by clerics of Tyr to assist adherents. The wearer of such a ring of might gains great prowess at unarmed combat.</string>
<string name="48940">Ring of Nine Lives</string>
<string name="48941">This ancient Netherese ring is made of ivory and carved to resemble a snarling cat&apos;s face on one end.  It allows the wearer to cast a heal spell up to nine times.</string>
<string name="48942">Purple Dragon Ring</string>
<string name="48943">These rings are brass and engraved with the purple dragon symbol of the Obarskyr royal family. The Purple Dragons use these rings to protect the royal family from assassination attempts by poison.  Over 4,000 of these rings have been made.

<string name="48944">Ring of Spell Battle</string>
<string name="48945">This potent Netherese ring is typically made of gold and set with small spheres of silver. The ring aids the wearer in identifying spells being cast nearby. In the event of unwanted spell effects, the ring also allows the wearer to cast dispel magic once per day.</string>

<string name="48949">Except for your clothes, you look like Aribeth de Tylmarande!</string>
<string name="48950">You look like Aribeth! &apos;Cept you dress different.</string>
<string name="48951">She was a hero of our people, once. Until she fell and betrayed us to Morag.</string>
<string name="48952">She is a foul traitor in the service of Morag!</string>
<string name="48953">Aribeth used be nice lady. Then she become bad and serve Morag.</string>
<string name="48954">Aribeth be traitor who serve Morag!</string>
<string name="48955">You speak of many places I have never heard of.</string>
<string name="48956">How did you get here?</string>
<string name="48957">Why do you want to kill Morag?</string>
<string name="48958">I&apos;ve heard this tale before. I&apos;ll just kill you before you betray me.</string>
<string name="48959">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="48960">You say strange place names. Me not know them.</string>
<string name="48961">How you get here?</string>
<string name="48962">Why you want kill Morag?</string>
<string name="48963">Me hear this before. Me kill you before you turn on me like Aribeth done.</string>
<string name="48964">You remind me of Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48965">You remind me of Aribeth.</string>
<string name="48966">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="48967">Aribeth betrayed me - I can&apos;t take the same chance with you. You must die!</string>
<string name="48968">What you mean?</string>
<string name="48969">Aribeth be bad traitor. Me not take chance with you. You die now!</string>
<string name="48970">Save it. I don&apos;t trust you and you must die!</string>
<string name="48971">Save it. Me not trust you. You die now!</string>
<string name="48972">Failed? How have you failed?</string>
<string name="48973">What you mean? How you fail?</string>
<string name="48974">And you have come seeking vengeance.</string>
<string name="48975">And you want kill them for get even.</string>
<string name="48976"></string>

<string name="48978"></string>
<string name="48979"></string>
<string name="48980"></string>
<string name="48981">What is it that you must tell me?</string>
<string name="48982">What you got tell me that be so important?</string>
<string name="48983">I see by looking at you that you are not from my world of Azallah, but I thank you for your aid nonetheless.</string>
<string name="48984">Had you not intervened I fear I would have succumbed to the scaled raiders. My name is Asheera of the Shining Order, from the city of Sahaladar.</string>
<string name="48985">May the ocean foam froth red with the blood of the scaled raiders!</string>
<string name="48986">My garments are those of my people, though perhaps they look as strange to you as your own garb does to me.</string>
<string name="48987">Morag? That name is known to me - the queen of the scaled raiders! Her face has haunted my dreams, her voice hissing whispered promises of power to tempt me to turn against my people.</string>
<string name="48988">But I am of the Shining Order, sworn in service to Sahaladar, greatest of the floating cities on Azallah. I have sworn to destroy Morag and save my people.</string>
<string name="48989">As for the name Aribeth, I have no knowledge of her. Was she a companion of yours?</string>
<string name="48990">Wait - before you go there is something I must tell you. Please, you must listen - my time grows short!</string>
<string name="48991">All who dwell among the islands of Azallah know of Sahaladar, the foam kissed city above the sea. The spires of my home glimmer and sparkle like coral beneath the azure waters.</string>
<string name="48992">I am not Aribeth - I am Asheera. And yet, there are many worlds and planes of existence drawn together in this strange place.</string>
<string name="48993">It may be that the one you call Aribeth is my parallel in your world - or I am her parallel, if you prefer. Perhaps that is why we have been brought together.</string>
<string name="48994">Asheera, guardian of Sahaladar, is no traitor! Throughout the isles of Azallah my word is my bond, and none question my honor!</string>
<string name="48995">Damn your mistrust! I could have helped you defeat the scaled Queen, but now it is too late! The spell that binds me here fades, and my spirit cannot remain in this plane.</string>
<string name="48996">You say this Aribeth betrayed her faith, she was lost to Morag&apos;s evil. Perhaps we have met so that I may help you avenge her fall.</string>
<string name="48997">I am a true knight of the Shining Order of Sahaladar. Perhaps I have been brought here from Azallah to redeem the memory of Aribeth, that her soul may be cleansed of its sins by my actions.</string>
<string name="48998">In the depths beneath our floating island is the wondrous capital of the Kilm, the water breathers with whom we peacefully share our world.</string>
<string name="48999">After much searching the magicians of Sahaladar discovered a portal in my world - a gate leading to this pseudo-plane where many universes converge.</string>
<string name="49000">Six were chosen to come through the portal, though we knew we could not return. My companions have long since fallen.</string>
<string name="49001">When I joined the Shining Order, I swore a vow to defend Sahaladar. But now I have disgraced my vows and failed in my sworn duty.</string>
<string name="49002">The Old Ones seek to return to the world of their birth, but to do this they need slaves and resources gathered from other, weaker worlds.</string>
<string name="49003">Morag set the scaled raiders loose upon my homeworld. Azallah had never faced so terrible a foe; their savage cruelty was as alien as their appearance.</string>
<string name="49004">The scaled raiders stripped my defenseless world of its magical treasures and many of my people were sacrificed in bizarre rituals to feed the power of their queen.</string>
<string name="49005">Vengeance is but one reason I am here. My world was peaceful - and vulnerable. That is why we were among the first to suffer.</string>
<string name="49006">But as Morag&apos;s strength grows, more of the Old Ones awaken. Soon a conquering army of her minions will pour forth to reclaim their homeworld.</string>
<string name="49007">Then Morag will enslave world after world and all will know the suffering of Azallah. I came here to prevent this, but I have failed.</string>

<string name="49015">Slay the warm bloods! Destroy the slaves!</string>
<string name="49016">We are the masters, the Creators, the Old Ones. Long have we slept, and in our absence the lesser races have grown bold!</string>
<string name="49017">The time of awakening has come! The Creators shall rise again and unleash vengeance on the world that has forgotten us!</string>
<string name="49018">A storm of fire shall banish the endless winter! The city of the slaves shall be utterly consumed by the flames of our rebirth!</string>
<string name="49019">Haedraline and the Word Slaves have betrayed us, abandoning us to our exile within the Source Stone.</string>
<string name="49020">The slaves act as kings, building cities and nations and laying claim to that which is ours!</string>
<string name="49021">Hail, Morag! **hiss** Lead us to vengeance!</string>
<string name="49022">Death to the traitors! **hiss** Death to the Word Slaves!</string>
<string name="49023">The High Priests prepare the final rituals that will unlock the Source Stone and free us from our prison! Soon... </string>
<string name="49024">What is this? The slaves have dared enter our realm!</string>
<string name="49025">Tear down the cities! **hiss** Death to the warm bloods!</string>
<string name="49026">Your time is over, Morag. The Old Ones shall not rise again!</string>
<string name="49027">I bow to no one, Morag! </string>
<string name="49028">Time to die, Morag!</string>
<string name="49029">World not belong to lizards no more. Old Ones time be done!</string>
<string name="49030">Me not bow to no one, lizard girly!</string>
<string name="49031">You die now!</string>
<string name="49032">You are powerful - for a &lt;race&gt; slave. You have slain Maugrim, the prophet who heralded my coming.</string>
<string name="49033">My priests shield me from harm! Your attacks are useless, slave!</string>
<string name="49034">You have defeated Aribeth, the champion I chose from among the slave races. You have slaughtered many of my warriors and priests.</string>
<string name="49035">But now you face Morag, Queen of the Old Ones, High Priestess of the Creators! Kneel, slave, and I shall let you live!</string>
<string name="49036">I shall rip away your flesh and feast upon your soul!</string>
<string name="49037">No - I cannot die! I am Morag, Queen of the Creators! I am immortal! No! NOOO!!!!</string>
<string name="49038">Lord Nasher sent me to interrogate the prisoner.</string>
<string name="49039">Nasher send me. He want me ask prisoner stuff.</string>
<string name="49040">Just hold on there, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. This here&apos;s the prison, and it&apos;s for the prisoners, see? You better be speaking to me if you want to be speaking to them.</string>

<string name="49051">Tell those Arcane Brothers that they won&apos;t they won&apos;t lay their filthy hands on the castle. Not if I can help it at any rate... </string>

<string name="49064">There are people *dying* here! I have no time to answer questions, none at all!</string>

It details your escape from the slave pens of the Creator Race and describes how you organized other escaped slaves and set up an underground network to free your fellows from the bondage of the Old Ones.

Of particular interest is the last entry:

&quot;The revolution will fail. I know this - I can sense our doom is near. It&apos;s like I&apos;m caught in a trap, a terrible looping pattern repeated in a never ending cycle and there is no way to break out.

&quot;I had the dream again last night. I dreamt I was not a slave, but another person in another time, where the Old Ones no longer ruled. Sometimes the dream seems more real than this terrible nightmare.

&quot;But I know this world is real - the evidence is here in this notebook, written in my own words.&quot;</string>

<string name="49140">This is the journal of Maugrim Korothir. Most of the entries are gibberish - the diatribes and rantings of a diseased mind. But scattered amidst the insane ramblings are several lucid entries of particular interest:

&quot;The ancient scrolls were correct! It was a simple task to infiltrate Castle Never using disguise and illusion. Beneath the dungeons I discovered the secret chamber, and the mysterious stone within. It pulses with unfathomable power - I must return soon to try and unlock its secrets.&quot;

----------

&quot;My experiments unleashed one of the stone&apos;s magical defenses - a great plague that will destroy Neverwinter. As I lay dying at the epicenter of the terrible spell, my body ravaged by disease, she came to me in a vision promising life and power if I would but serve her. Morag, High Priestess of the Creator Race, Queen of the Old Ones. My Queen.&quot;

----------

&quot;Morag feasts upon the souls of the afflicted, devouring the very essence of their being as they succumb to the Wailing Death. And as my Queen&apos;s power grows, so does my own!&quot;

----------

&quot;Desther is dead, but Morag has promised me a far greater ally - the Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande herself! My Queen speaks to the young paladin through her dreams, feeding her hatred and bending her to our will! Soon she will be ours!&quot;

----------

&quot;The Neverwinter forces are routed, but Castle Never still stands and three of the Words of Power are beyond our reach. Morag grows impatient, she demands I perform the ritual of Awakening using the only Word we possess. I dare not defy my Queen.&quot;

----------

&quot;The ritual is done. The Old Ones will be reborn. The Creators will rule once more. The Awakening has begun. It is now only a matter of time.&quot;

<string name="49242">Have you heard those rumors about a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="49243">How do you like training here at the Academy?</string>
<string name="49244">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="49245">You hear stuff &apos;bout cure for plague?</string>
<string name="49246">You like training at Academy?</string>
<string name="49247">Sounds tough. How are you holding up?</string>
<string name="49248">Sound hard. You holding up good still?</string>
<string name="49249">Sounds like you&apos;ve got a crush on her.</string>
<string name="49250">It sound like you maybe love her.</string>
<string name="49251">Don&apos;t worry - I still want to get together.</string>
<string name="49252">You no worry - me still want see you later.</string>
<string name="49253">Actually, I can&apos;t get together with you later after all.</string>
<string name="49254">Me sorry. Me no can see you later.</string>
<string name="49255">Look, buddy - I came here to learn, not to get hit on by pathetic, lonely losers!</string>
<string name="49256">Flattery - I like it.</string>
<string name="49257">No offense, but I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="49258">Me like what you say.</string>
<string name="49259">Me here for training! Me not care &apos;bout this stuff!</string>
<string name="49260">You be sad little man. Me no want be friend with you!</string>
<string name="49261">Actually I&apos;m not seeing anyone right now.</string>
<string name="49262">That&apos;s really none of your business, Gilbert.</string>
<string name="49263">Me not seeing anyone right now.</string>
<string name="49264">That not be none of you business, Gilbert!</string>
<string name="49265">I&apos;d like that, Gilbert.</string>
<string name="49266">Sorry, but I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="49267">Uh... I&apos;m already going with somebody. Sorry, Gilbert.</string>
<string name="49268">Me like that, Gilbert.</string>
<string name="49269">Me not interested. Sorry.</string>
<string name="49270">Uh... me got date already. Sorry, Gilbert.</string>
<string name="49271">Hey, there. Say, aren&apos;t you &lt;FirstName&gt;? Sure... I&apos;ve seen you in some of our combat training classes. My name&apos;s Gilbert. </string>
<string name="49272">Hi there. Are you new here at the Academy? I don&apos;t recognize you from any of my combat training exercises. Oh, wait a minute... you&apos;re a &lt;class&gt;. </string>
<string name="49273">No wonder I haven&apos;t seen you around - I doubt the Academy has us studying the same things. My name is Gilbert, by the way.</string>
<string name="49274">Good to see you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Is there something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="49275">&lt;FullName&gt;? Right! I&apos;ve got a friend who just got accepted here at the Academy. He&apos;s a &lt;class&gt;, too. He mentioned your name once.</string>
<string name="49276">From what I hear, &lt;FirstName&gt;, your training at the Academy is almost done. All you have to do is prove yourself in the final &lt;class&gt; challenge and you&apos;re ready for graduation. </string>
<string name="49277">So from what I hear it sounds like you&apos;ve almost finished your training here at the Academy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You must be looking forward to graduating.</string>
<string name="49278">I envy you - I hear Lady Aribeth herself is here to hand out personal blessings to all the graduates in the south assembly hall. I&apos;d love to meet her myself, but I&apos;ve still got a ways to go on my training.</string>
<string name="49279">Well, I guess I&apos;ll just get back to my training then. I don&apos;t want Herban to chew me out for slacking on my drills.</string>
<string name="49280">I&apos;m sorry, my mistake - must be someone else who looks like you here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="49281">Uh, yeah... I already knew that, remember?</string>
<string name="49282">Sure - I could use a break from these drills, anyway. Herban&apos;s a slave driver! It&apos;ll be nice to talk with someone who isn&apos;t screaming at me all the time.</string>
<string name="49283">Are you kidding me? This is Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande! Defender of Tyr&apos;s faith, Champion of Neverwinter! She&apos;s a living legend.</string>
<string name="49284">Lord Nasher himself appointed her to oversee all city business dealing with the plague - and she didn&apos;t get that job because of her beauty. She earned it with her skill and determination.</string>
<string name="49285">They run us through the grinder here pretty good at the Academy. Up early in the morning with the rest of the soldiers, marching, martial drills, the obstacle course, more drills - it isn&apos;t easy.</string>
<string name="49286">And for some reason Herban&apos;s taken a personal interest in my progress. Talk about bad luck - every mistake I make he&apos;s there to let me hear about it. Damn, he can get loud!</string>
<string name="49287">But it&apos;s a lot easier in here than out on the streets, what with the plague and all. And it&apos;ll all be worth it in the end as long as Aribeth comes back to grant blessings when I graduate. </string>
<string name="49288">Ah, I complain but I think I&apos;m going to make it. But thanks for asking.</string>
<string name="49289">Aw, it&apos;s nothing serious. She&apos;s way out of my league - just a little hero worship.</string>
<string name="49290">She&apos;s beautiful, famous, smart, talented - what man wouldn&apos;t be attracted to her, right? But she&apos;s involved with someone, I hear. A cleric of Tyr named Fenthick. Lucky bastard.</string>
<string name="49291">Besides, Aribeth isn&apos;t the only beautiful woman here at the Academy - if you don&apos;t mind me saying so. </string>
<string name="49292">Terrible thing, isn&apos;t it? They&apos;ve got the entire city quarantined off, but everyday there&apos;s more bodies in the street. Terrible. But there&apos;s something I don&apos;t understand about the plague.</string>
<string name="49293">Nobody wants to admit it, but I think somebody unleashed this plague on purpose. I guess I can understand why the authorities don&apos;t want that kind of news to get out - there&apos;s enough panic in the streets as it is. </string>
<string name="49294">I heard something about creatures being brought to the Academy from Waterdeep to make a cure. I just hope it&apos;s true. That&apos;s probably why Lady Aribeth is here today. I hope she takes the time to tour the barracks - I&apos;d love to meet her.</string>
<string name="49295">Hey - welcome back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope you haven&apos;t changed your mind about tonight.</string>
<string name="49296">Where did it come from? Neverwinter&apos;s the only city that seems to be suffering. That&apos;s a little suspicious. And the Wailing Death is no ordinary illness - if it was, the priests could cure the afflicted. </string>
<string name="49297">Anyway, I hear Aribeth is involved with somebody. A priest named Fenthick. And how about you, if you don&apos;t mind me asking. Is there a special man in your life?</string>
<string name="49298">Besides, Aribeth may be attractive and all but I&apos;m more interested in a woman&apos;s inner beauty. Physical looks only go so deep - I&apos;m more interested in a woman with character. Like you.</string>
<string name="49299">I understand. The training here at the Academy isn&apos;t easy. We recruits don&apos;t have a lot of free time for things like relationships. Still, you can&apos;t blame a guy for trying. Is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="49300">I find that hard to believe - a fascinating woman like you without a man in her life.</string>
<string name="49301">I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t mean to be rude. I was just... I mean, I just wanted to know if you were seeing anyone. I figured a fascinating woman like you probably already has a boyfriend, is all.</string>
<string name="49302">I hope I&apos;m not being too forward but there&apos;s the big feast tonight in honor of all the Academy graduates. If you&apos;re not going with anyone, maybe we could go together.</string>
<string name="49303">Great! I&apos;m looking forward to it. Listen, I better get back to my drills. If I don&apos;t finish Harben might not let me go to the feast. Unless there was something else you needed?</string>
<string name="49304">I guess I&apos;ll see you later tonight, then. I&apos;m looking forward to it.</string>
<string name="49305">Wow! That was harsh! Okay, I get the message loud and clear. You&apos;re not interested. Thanks for crushing my spirit and will to live.</string>
<string name="49306">I should really get back to my drills. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="49307">I should have known. That&apos;s okay - it&apos;s kind of late notice. Is there something else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="49308">Is there something else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="49309">And how&apos;s your training going? If you&apos;re half as talented as you are beautiful, the Academy must be a snap for you.</string>
<string name="49310">And how&apos;s your training going? A woman as obviously talented as you must just be breezing through the training.</string>
<string name="49311">We&apos;re under attack! We have to protect the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="49312">You made it pretty clear how you feel about me. We&apos;ve got nothing more to say to each other.</string>
<string name="49313">So do I. I&apos;m really looking forward to it. Is there something else I can do for you, then?</string>
<string name="49314"></string>

<string name="49340">I need you to go over some of the tutorial again.</string>
<string name="49341">Me want you to go over some of that tutorial stuff again.</string>
<string name="49342">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="49343"></string>
<string name="49344"></string>
<string name="49345"></string>
<string name="49346"></string>
<string name="49347"></string>
<string name="49348"></string>
<string name="49349">Can you go over the quickbar stuff again?</string>
<string name="49350">Me want you to say that quickbar stuff again.</string>
<string name="49351">Ready.</string>
<string name="49352">Top Down Camera mode. The first one.</string>
<string name="49353">Chase Camera mode. The second one.</string>
<string name="49354">Driving Camera mode. The third one.</string>
<string name="49355">I like the camera the way it is.</string>
<string name="49356">Me happy with this camera angle.</string>
<string name="49357">Tell me about the different camera modes.</string>
<string name="49358">Tell me &apos;bout other camera stuff.</string>
<string name="49359">Hey there, I want to talk to you.</string>
<string name="49360">You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, right? I saw you talking to my brother, Pavel. My name is Bim. If you want, I can give you a short tutorial on adventuring.</string>
<string name="49361"></string>
<string name="49362">Right-click on me to bring up the menu, then select the attack icon on the right of the menu to punch me.</string>
<string name="49363">I want to talk to you again.</string>
<string name="49364">Okay, seems like you&apos;ve got the menu figured out. Remember, right-click on objects to bring up the menu. You can even right-click on yourself to access skills, feats and other special abilities.</string>
<string name="49365">Take a look at your quickbar at the bottom of the screen. &lt;StartAction&gt;THE QUICKBAR IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES IN THE GAME! YOU SHOULD LEARN TO USE YOUR QUICKBAR!&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="49366">You can change the abilities on your quickbar by right-clicking on the respective box and assigning a new ability to that function key by using the menu system. Remember - USE YOUR QUICKBAR! Now we&apos;ll move on to your character sheet, if you&apos;re ready.</string>
<string name="49367">Speak to me again before you leave the room.</string>
<string name="49368">We&apos;ve covered most of the basic controls, so now it&apos;s time to focus on how you rest. Resting is a very important part of the game.</string>
<string name="49369"></string>
<string name="49370"></string>
<string name="49371"></string>
<string name="49372"></string>
<string name="49373"></string>
<string name="49374"></string>
<string name="49375"></string>
<string name="49376"></string>
<string name="49377"></string>
<string name="49378"></string>
<string name="49379"></string>
<string name="49380"></string>
<string name="49381"></string>
<string name="49382"></string>
<string name="49383"></string>
<string name="49384"></string>
<string name="49385"></string>
<string name="49386"></string>
<string name="49387"></string>
<string name="49388">Remember to rest often. Resting heals you, it lets you prepare spells, and it restores any feats or special abilities you may have used up.</string>
<string name="49389">In order to rest, just left-click on the rest button below your portrait in the upper right corner of the screen. Once you&apos;re done resting come speak to me again.</string>
<string name="49390">Speak to me after you&apos;ve rested. In order to rest, just left-click on the rest button below your portrait in the upper right corner of the screen.</string>
<string name="49391"></string>
<string name="49392">Olgerd will help you get your equipment so you can complete your tests here at the Academy. Is there anything else you need?</string>
<string name="49393">Good luck with your training, &lt;FullName&gt;. The instructors at the Academy will be happy to give you more lessons on how to play the game, specific to your class.</string>
<string name="49394">Sure. What do you want me to cover?</string>
<string name="49395"></string>
<string name="49396"></string>
<string name="49397"></string>
<string name="49398"></string>
<string name="49399"></string>
<string name="49400"></string>
<string name="49401">Protect the Waterdhavian creatures! Don&apos;t let the attackers get them!</string>
<string name="49402"></string>
<string name="49403">You can pull up a second quickbar by holding down &quot;SHIFT&quot; on your keyboard. Hold &quot;SHIFT&quot; and press the corresponding function key to access the abilities of your &quot;SHIFT&quot; quickbar.</string>
<string name="49404">You can pull up a third quickbar by holding down &quot;CONTROL&quot; on your keyboard. Hold &quot;CONTROL&quot; and press the corresponding function key to access the abilities displayed on your &quot;CONTROL&quot; quickbar.</string>
<string name="49405">Another important part of the game is your character sheet, which can be accessed by pressing &quot;C&quot; on your keyboard or by clicking with your mouse on the character sheet icon beneath your character portrait.</string>
<string name="49406">Let&apos;s talk a little bit about camera control and viewpoints. There are three different camera styles you can use when playing Neverwinter Nights. I&apos;m setting you to the Top Down Camera mode to start this tutorial - that&apos;s the default setting for the game.</string>
<string name="49407">You&apos;re in Top Down Camera mode right now. To move around in this mode you use the mouse. Your character will run to any place you click on the screen.</string>
<string name="49408">Go ahead and move around in the Top Down camera mode to try it out. Come back and speak to me when you&apos;re ready to try the other camera modes.</string>
<string name="49409">Okay, you&apos;ve had a chance to test out the Top Down Camera mode. Now we&apos;ll let you try the Chase Camera mode.</string>
<string name="49410">You can rotate the camera left or right and zoom in or out using the arrow keys. You can also use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and if you hold the wheel you can use the mouse to rotate the camera.</string>
<string name="49411">Movement in the Chase Camera mode is the same as in the Top Down Camera mode. But in this mode the camera automatically rotates to follow you as you move around.</string>
<string name="49412">If you wish, you can still zoom in and out or rotate left and right manually using the arrow keys or the mouse wheel. I&apos;m switching you to the Chase Camera mode now.</string>
<string name="49413">Go ahead and move around in the Chase Camera mode to try it out. Come back and speak to me when you&apos;re ready to try the third camera mode.</string>
<string name="49414">Okay, you&apos;ve had a chance to test out the Chase Camera mode. Now we&apos;ll let you try the Driving Camera mode.</string>
<string name="49415">This one&apos;s a little different. You still control the camera using the arrow keys, but in Driving Camera mode, movement can also be controlled by the keyboard.</string>
<string name="49416">The &quot;W&quot; key moves you forward, the &quot;S&quot; key moves you backwards and &quot;A&quot; or &quot;D&quot; turns you left or right. You can also strafe left or right using the &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;E&quot; keys.</string>
<string name="49417">Go ahead and move around in the Driving Camera mode to try it out. Come back and speak to me when you&apos;re finished.</string>
<string name="49418">Okay, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You&apos;ve had a chance to try all three camera modes now. You can choose between them by selecting &quot;Controls&quot; from the &quot;Options&quot; menu.</string>
<string name="49419">But I&apos;ll set you up with whichever option you want right now. Just tell me which one you&apos;d prefer.</string>
<string name="49420">Done. Okay, now that you understand camera modes let&apos;s continue with the tutorial.</string>
<string name="49421">Okay, if you&apos;re happy with this camera mode then we&apos;ll just continue with the tutorial.</string>
<string name="49422">Ready.</string>
<string name="49423">Yes, I&apos;d like to get a tutorial on stores and see what you have for sale.</string>
<string name="49424">No, I&apos;m not interested in buying anything right now.</string>
<string name="49425">Yes, me want lesson on stores and me want see what you got in you store.</string>
<string name="49426">No, me not want buy nothing right now.</string>
<string name="49427">Yes.</string>
<string name="49428">No.</string>
<string name="49429">I want to see the Menagerie.</string>
<string name="49430">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="49431">Me want see you Me-nag-er-ie.</string>
<string name="49432">Me got questions me want ask.</string>
<string name="49433">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="49434">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="49435">Have you heard anything about a cure?</string>
<string name="49436">You know stuff &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="49437">You know stuff &apos;bout a cure?</string>
<string name="49438">Tell me about yourself, Ferdinand.</string>
<string name="49439">You talk &apos;bout you self, Ferdinand.</string>
<string name="49440"></string>
<string name="49441"></string>
<string name="49442"></string>
<string name="49443">Go on.</string>
<string name="49444">Could you repeat what you just said?</string>
<string name="49445">Me lost. Maybe you repeat what you say before?</string>
<string name="49446">Go on.</string>
<string name="49447">Sorry, could you repeat that one more time?</string>
<string name="49448">Me sorry. Me got lost. You say that again?</string>
<string name="49449">Got it. Go on.</string>
<string name="49450">Wait a minute, could you go over that again?</string>
<string name="49451">Me not get it. Could you tell me again?</string>
<string name="49452">I already know how to work my inventory.</string>
<string name="49453">Me already know how work inventory.</string>
<string name="49454">I don&apos;t need a tutorial on how to use the stores.</string>
<string name="49455">Me know how store work. You not need tell me.</string>
<string name="49456">The Menagerie? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="49457">Me-nag-er-ie? What that? What you talking &apos;bout?</string>
<string name="49458">Who are you again?</string>
<string name="49459">Who you be again?</string>
<string name="49460">I understand. Go on.</string>
<string name="49461">Me get it. Go on.</string>
<string name="49462">Could you repeat that?</string>
<string name="49463">Me need you say that again.</string>
<string name="49464">Come on over here and get your equipment.</string>
<string name="49465">Hello there, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Come to get yourself some supplies from old Olgerd, have you? Good idea. We can&apos;t have you wandering about the streets naked. Might give the Academy a bad name.</string>
<string name="49466">The city guard are already having enough trouble maintaining control as it is. Plague bodies piled a dozen deep in the gutters, the Wailing Death running unchecked through the districts... horrible, I say!</string>
<string name="49467">But you&apos;ve heard all this before, I&apos;m sure. And you need to get some equipment so you can continue your training. I guess it&apos;s time you learned how to access your inventory. Ready?</string>
<string name="49468"></string>
<string name="49469">The top section of the inventory shows equipped items. There are slots for your weapon, shield, armor, belts, capes, rings and other items.</string>
<string name="49470">The bottom section of your inventory shows items stored in your backpack. Notice the six tabs on the right hand side. Each tab opens up another page in your backpack&apos;s inventory.</string>
<string name="49471">To equip items, simply left-click and hold while dragging them to the appropriate section at the top of your inventory page. Or, you can right-click on an item and choose &quot;Equip&quot; from the menu.</string>
<string name="49472">If you right-click on an item in your inventory, you will see a menu with an &quot;Examine&quot; option at the top. Selecting this will allow you to learn more about the object.</string>
<string name="49473">When you examine magical items, the game will automatically check your Lore skill. If your skill is high enough, you will get a complete description of the properties and abilities of the object.</string>
<string name="49474">This might be a good time to teach you how to use stores in the game. I have some items here you might want to purchase. Since you&apos;re part of the Academy you get a special discount rate.</string>
<string name="49475">Are you interested in seeing my store? I&apos;ll give you a quick tutorial in how they work, too.</string>
<string name="49476">Before we enter the store, let me explain how it works. This is important, you&apos;re going to be using stores quite a bit during your adventures.</string>
<string name="49477">Fair enough. Still, let me explain how the stores work - you&apos;re going to need them at some time during your adventures.</string>
<string name="49478"></string>
<string name="49479">At the top of the store menu you&apos;ll see different tabs for the different types of equipment. Click on a tab and it will bring up the first page of the store menu with that type of equipment. </string>
<string name="49480">There are arrow buttons in the upper corners of the store menu for scrolling through the different inventory pages. On each page, passing the cursor over an item will display the name and cost at the bottom of the menu.</string>
<string name="49481">To buy something simply click and drag it from the store menu to your own inventory. This will purchase the item and automatically deduct the gold from your total.</string>
<string name="49482">Selling items works the same way. Just click and drag an item from your inventory to the store menu and the item will be sold.</string>
<string name="49483">To identify an item just click on the EXAMINE icon in the bottom left of the store menu then click on the item you need identified. This will bring up a menu with a picture of the item and an IDENTIFY button on the left. </string>
<string name="49484">Click the IDENTIFY button and a confirmation box will appear detailing the cost of the service.</string>
<string name="49485">To leave the store at anytime simply click your mouse on the X in the top right corner of the store menu.</string>
<string name="49486">That&apos;s about it as far as stores go. So, are you interested in seeing my inventory now?</string>
<string name="49487">Great - I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find my prices most reasonable. When we&apos;re done you&apos;ll find the door leading out of this room is unlocked.</string>
<string name="49488">As long as you&apos;re here at the Academy you&apos;re welcome to come back to buy any equipment you need. Now - let&apos;s take a look at my wares.</string>
<string name="49489">Okay, you must be eager to get on with your adventures. You&apos;ll find the door to the south is unlocked now.</string>
<string name="49490">Goodbye, then. Remember - you&apos;re always welcome to come back and view the Menagerie anytime you want. I always enjoy it when people take an interest in my little beasties.</string>
<string name="49491">Welcome back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Have you come to take a look at the Menagerie, or is there something else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="49492">Certainly. As long as you&apos;re here at the Academy you&apos;re free to view the Menagerie anytime you want. Don&apos;t worry, the monsters in there can&apos;t hurt you.</string>
<string name="49493">Ask your questions, &lt;FullName&gt;, and I&apos;ll do my best to answer.</string>
<string name="49494">I bet you do, my slow witted friend. Hopefully I can explain them so you can understand.</string>
<string name="49495">You have to stop the attackers from getting the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="49496">You actually want to know something about me? That&apos;s a twist. Most people just want to see the creatures in the Menagerie. They&apos;re far more interesting than I am.</string>
<string name="49497">When I was young I always knew I wanted to work with animals, but I didn&apos;t really want to live the life of a druid or a ranger. I didn&apos;t relish the idea of living out in the wild all by myself.</string>
<string name="49498">I worked for a while at the zoo in Neverwinter, tending the animals and such. That lead to an apprenticeship here at the Academy under the former Keeper of Exotic Creatures. When she retired I took over the job of running the Menagerie.</string>
<string name="49499">The Wailing Death is a grim topic, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Thousands have fallen to the illness, and not even the clerics can do anything about it.</string>
<string name="49500">Not one of the creatures in the Menagerie showed a single sign of the plague. Can&apos;t figure it out, but I&apos;m grateful. I&apos;d feel responsible if one of my beasties took sick.</string>
<string name="49501">I know there&apos;s a rumor going around the barracks about some strange creatures from Waterdeep being brought here to concoct a cure, but I don&apos;t believe it.</string>
<string name="49502">Although I have to admit, if you wanted to keep the arrival of any strange creatures secret you wouldn&apos;t store them in the Menagerie. That would be the first place people would think to look.</string>
<string name="49503"></string>
<string name="49504"></string>
<string name="49505"></string>
<string name="49506"></string>
<string name="49507"></string>
<string name="49508">Sure, I can tell you again.</string>
<string name="49509">Sure, I don&apos;t mind repeating myself.</string>
<string name="49510">Sure, this is important. I don&apos;t mind going over it again.</string>
<string name="49511">Something strange about this plague, though. It infects humans, dwarves, elves - all the races, in fact - but it doesn&apos;t seem to affect animals. That&apos;s very unusual.</string>
<string name="49512">Well then, I guess we don&apos;t need to go over it, do we?</string>
<string name="49513">Okay, I&apos;m not one to go prattling on when the listener already knows what I&apos;m saying. So, you want to see my inventory now?</string>
<string name="49514">Go ahead and do that now if you want. It won&apos;t interrupt our conversation.</string>
<string name="49515">If your Lore skill is too low to properly identify an item, you will not receive the fully detailed description when you examine it, and you cannot use or equip an item until it is identified. Stores can identify these items for you for a fee.</string>
<string name="49516">The Identify spell will temporarily increase your Lore skill to raise your chances of identifying items when you examine them. Do you understand what I have said about examining items?</string>
<string name="49517">Sure.</string>
<string name="49518">Not interested.</string>
<string name="49519">May I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="49520">Can me ask you stuff?</string>
<string name="49521">What can you tell me about the Wailing Death?</string>
<string name="49522">Do you know anything about a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="49523">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="49524">What you know &apos;bout Wailing Death?</string>
<string name="49525">What you know &apos;bout plague cure?</string>
<string name="49526">Tell me about Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="49527">You talk &apos;bout Aribeth, kay?</string>
<string name="49528">Where can I go to complete my training?</string>
<string name="49529">Where me go for finish me training?</string>
<string name="49530">Okay, I understand that.</string>
<string name="49531">Could you repeat that?</string>
<string name="49532">Even me understand that.</string>
<string name="49533">Me not get it.</string>
<string name="49534">Yes.</string>
<string name="49535">No.</string>
<string name="49536">Anything else?</string>
<string name="49537">You lost me.</string>
<string name="49538">Me got lost in that.</string>
<string name="49539">Hey, there. You&apos;re one of the students here at the Academy, aren&apos;t you? &lt;FirstName&gt;, unless I&apos;m mistaken.</string>
<string name="49540">I&apos;m Berna, an instructor here at the Academy. If you like I can give you a quick tutorial on how to use your map and journal.</string>
<string name="49541">Back again, &lt;FirstName&gt;? You want me to go over the tutorial on how to use your map and journal? </string>
<string name="49542">We&apos;re under attack! We have to slay the invaders!</string>
<string name="49543">Of course. We instructors are here to give guidance to the students, after all. How else will you complete your training?</string>
<string name="49544">Goodbye, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="49545">I know the quarantine of the city has done little to stop the affliction from spreading, though it has bred mistrust and fear among the people.</string>
<string name="49546">Lady Aribeth does her best to keep the peace, but the rumors are beginning to fly. People suspect some dark evil is behind the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="49547">Soon the panic may lead to open rebellion. I pray we of the Academy are not forced into battle against the citizens of Neverwinter. They are the very people we are supposed to protect!</string>
<string name="49548">So you have heard the rumors as well? You should focus on your studies and not idle gossip.</string>
<string name="49549">Lady Aribeth is no doubt seeking a cure, but there has been no official word. And spreading rumors about a cure being stored here at the Academy is dangerous.</string>
<string name="49550">It draws unwanted attention. The people are desperate for a cure - so desperate they might even attack the Academy itself if they feel we have one.</string>
<string name="49551">Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande is a Paladin of Tyr. She may be young, but she has already proven her courage and her devotion to both Neverwinter and Tyr. </string>
<string name="49552">Lord Nasher Alagondar himself has given Lady Aribeth the task of saving Neverwinter from the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="49553">She&apos;s actually here at the Academy right now, in the south assembly hall. Once you&apos;ve finished your training you can go to meet her.</string>
<string name="49554">Just head through the exit in the southwest corner of this room. The Academy training rooms are all in the hallway beyond.</string>
<string name="49555">Once you finish your training you can go meet Aribeth in the south assembly hall.</string>
<string name="49556">To use your journal, simply left-click on the Journal box beneath your character portrait or press the &quot;J&quot; key on your keyboard. Go ahead and do that now... it won&apos;t end our conversation.</string>
<string name="49557">This brings up your journal entries for the current chapter. Right now you should see two quests in your journal: &quot;Academy Training&quot; and &quot;Speaking to Berna.&quot;</string>
<string name="49558">Well, if you change your mind I&apos;ll be right here to help you out. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="49559">Go ahead and click on the &quot;Speaking to Berna&quot; entry to get the detailed description of that entry. You can click on an entry to bring up more details at any time.</string>
<string name="49560">Sure, I&apos;ll go over it one more time.</string>
<string name="49561">Okay, first make sure your journal is closed. Now, to use your map, left-click the MAP box beneath your character portrait or press &quot;M&quot; on your keyboard. The top of the map is always north.</string>
<string name="49562">Go ahead and do that now. Your location on the map is marked by an arrow, and the arrow points in the direction you are facing. Do you understand so far?</string>
<string name="49563">I&apos;ll go over it again.</string>
<string name="49564">The arrow keys on the top of the map let you zoom in or out. Maps will fill in as you explore an area. You can leave the map up to help guide you as you are adventuring.</string>
<string name="49565">You will also see that there are small pins tacked onto the map. These are your map notes; they mark important locations in an area. Simply move your mouse over one of the pins to read the notes. </string>
<string name="49566">You can add your own map notes by clicking the PIN in the upper left corner of the map screen, then clicking the area on the map where you wish to add the note.</string>
<string name="49567">That&apos;s it as far as the map and journal go. You can close your map now if you want. Just click the MAP icon below your character sheet or hit &quot;M&quot; on your keyboard.</string>
<string name="49568">I&apos;ll go over it one more time for you.</string>
<string name="49569">Come over here if you want to learn about your map and journal.</string>
<string name="49570">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="49571">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="49572">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="49573">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="49574">Me want ask you questions.</string>
<string name="49575">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="49576">Me want go now.</string>
<string name="49577">Sorry, recruit. The assembly chamber is reserved for Academy students who have completed their training. Lady Aribeth is in there granting blessings to all the graduates. </string>
<string name="49578">You can&apos;t go in until you finish your training.</string>
<string name="49579">You have to report to Herban to finish your combat training. Hurry up, he doesn&apos;t like to be kept waiting. Just go back down this hall and take the second door on your left.</string>
<string name="49580">You better go speak to Jaroo - he&apos;s the one who trains all you mage types. Just go back down this hall to the third door on your right.</string>
<string name="49581">You have to go to the temple and speak to Elynwyd to finish your training. Just head back down this hallway and take the first door on your left.</string>
<string name="49582">Judging by those shifty eyes, I think you need to speak to Ketta in the espionage room to complete your training. Just go back down this hall and take the first door on your right.</string>
<string name="49583">If you&apos;re looking to learn the ways of espionage and thieves, head back down this hall and take the first door on your right. If you want to study a bit about spellcasting, keep going to the third door on your right.</string>
<string name="49584">Sorry, not while I&apos;m on duty. Besides, you need to finish your training. You don&apos;t want to miss the chance to receive a blessing from Lady Aribeth herself, do you?</string>
<string name="49585">Goodbye, recruit. Good luck with your training.</string>
<string name="49586">Now that you&apos;ve finished your training, you can go on into the south assembly hall. Lady Aribeth is still granting blessings to all the Academy graduates.</string>
<string name="49587">Go on in to the assembly hall whenever you&apos;re ready.</string>
<string name="49588">Sorry, not while I&apos;m on duty. Besides, you should go on into the assembly chamber so you can get your blessing from Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="49589">We&apos;re under attack! Protect the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="49590">Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="49591">That&apos;s it? My training&apos;s over?</string>
<string name="49592">That all? Me training be over?</string>
<string name="49593">Can you answer some questions?</string>
<string name="49594">Me want you answer question.</string>
<string name="49595">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="49596">I&apos;m ready for the melee combat trial.</string>
<string name="49597">Me ready for melee combat trial.</string>
<string name="49598">I want to take the test with ranged and missile weapons.</string>
<string name="49599">Me want test with bows and slings and stuff.</string>
<string name="49600">Me want ask you question.</string>
<string name="49601">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="49602">We&apos;re under attack! Protect the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="49603">I guess congratulations are in order. You&apos;ve passed the combat trial and completed your Basic Training. Your days at the Academy are finally over.</string>
<string name="49604">Well done. I need to talk to you.</string>
<string name="49605">If you hurry you can join the other Academy graduates in the south assembly hall. Lady Aribeth is there bestowing blessings on everyone who has completed Basic Training.</string>
<string name="49606">So long then.</string>
<string name="49607">Keep in mind this is only the final stage of everything you have learned while you have been here at the Academy. This is a mere formality - you&apos;ve already proven yourself worthy of going out into the world.</string>
<string name="49608">Oh, come on. Surely you knew that Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, the famous Elven paladin of Tyr, was here at the Academy. Everybody&apos;s talking about it.</string>
<string name="49609">I hope I get a chance to meet her when my shift is over.</string>
<string name="49610">Sorry, not while I&apos;m on duty. Herban will bust my ass down three ranks if he catches me socializing at my post. Besides, I thought you&apos;d be more interested in celebrating the end of your tour.</string>
<string name="49611">You need to speak to Herban first. He&apos;s in charge here.</string>
<string name="49612">So Herban sent you over for your combat trial, did he? Well, my name is Dendy. I specialize in melee weapon combat. Are you ready to begin the final test?</string>
<string name="49613">Don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s nothing to it. You and I are going to spar. I&apos;ll be in parry mode the whole time, trying to deflect your attacks. All you have to do is hit me once to pass the test.</string>
<string name="49614">Or, if you prefer, all you have to do is use your weapon to destroy the target dummy next to me. The choice is up to you, either attack me or the dummy.</string>
<string name="49615">Then you should go talk to Hewwet on the other side of the room. He&apos;s the expert with ranged and missile weapons. I&apos;m only certified to test you in melee weapons.</string>
<string name="49616">Sorry, but I can&apos;t. Herban can be a real hard-ass, and I don&apos;t want to get into trouble for chatting while I&apos;m on duty. If you&apos;re not here to take the combat test I really can&apos;t talk to you.</string>
<string name="49617">Since I&apos;m not hostile, you&apos;ll have to right-click on me then select the attack icon from the menu if you want to attack me. You can begin whenever you&apos;re ready.</string>
<string name="49618">Well done, but you should continue your training elsewhere.</string>
<string name="49619">Go and talk to Hewwet to continue your test.</string>
<string name="49620">You&apos;ve passed the combat tests, but your training here at the Academy isn&apos;t over yet.</string>
<string name="49621">You have to go finish the &lt;class&gt; challenge before they&apos;ll let you graduate. I can&apos;t do anything more for you here. </string>
<string name="49622">Go and talk to Hewwet to continue your test.</string>
<string name="49623">Sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to interrupt.</string>
<string name="49624">Me sorry. Me not mean to interrupt.</string>
<string name="49625">I think I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="49626">What&apos;s your problem? I&apos;m just trying to be friendly.</string>
<string name="49627">Me go now.</string>
<string name="49628">Why you so mad? Me just want be talk at you.</string>
<string name="49629">Why do you want to meet Lady Aribeth so badly?</string>
<string name="49630">How&apos;s your training going?</string>
<string name="49631">I want to ask you a few questions.</string>
<string name="49632">Why you want meet Aribeth so bad?</string>
<string name="49633">How you training going?</string>
<string name="49634">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="49635">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="49636">Have you heard those rumors about a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="49637">How do you like training here at the Academy?</string>
<string name="49638">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="49639">You hear stuff &apos;bout cure for plague?</string>
<string name="49640">You like training at Academy?</string>
<string name="49641">I won&apos;t take much of your time. I promise.</string>
<string name="49642">Me speak at you quick. Me promise me not use much time.</string>
<string name="49643">You better answer my questions if you know what&apos;s good for you!</string>
<string name="49644">You answer me question or you be sorry!</string>
<string name="49645">Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m practicing my drills? You&apos;re a &lt;class&gt;. You should know how hard basic training is. So why are you bothering me? </string>
<string name="49646">Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m practicing my drills? The Academy might go easy on a &lt;class&gt; like you, but those of us training under Herban can&apos;t afford to waste our time chatting! </string>
<string name="49647">Back again? I&apos;m pretty busy here - what do you want this time?</string>
<string name="49648">Look, I&apos;m not trying to be rude. It&apos;s just that Herban doesn&apos;t like us taking breaks from our drills. It&apos;s a sign of weakness! </string>
<string name="49649">Okay, but make it quick. I need to finish my drills so I can attend the graduation ceremonies. I don&apos;t want to miss my chance to meet Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="49650">Then I&apos;ll get back to my drills.</string>
<string name="49651">Get on with it then. The sooner you ask, the sooner I can get back to my training.</string>
<string name="49652">Lady Aribeth represents everything the Academy stands for: skill and bravery and honor! She&apos;s the reason I joined the Academy in the first place.</string>
<string name="49653">She&apos;s young, but she&apos;s already proven her heroism a dozen times over. That&apos;s why Lord Nasher put her in charge of dealing with the plague.</string>
<string name="49654">It&apos;s not for the faint of heart, that&apos;s for sure! Rise at dawn, march for an hour and then an hour of drills. And that&apos;s just before breakfast! </string>
<string name="49655">Herban doesn&apos;t stand for weakness or failure. He drives the recruits hard, but these are tough times. Anyone who can&apos;t take it probably shouldn&apos;t be training at the Academy anyway.</string>
<string name="49656">The training is tough, but the rewards are worth it. Lady Aribeth herself is even here to congratulate the graduating recruits. The chance to meet her in person is inspiration enough for me.</string>
<string name="49657">I try not to think about it, to tell you the truth. I need to stay focused on my training. But since you brought it up, there&apos;s one thing I don&apos;t understand about the Wailing Death.</string>
<string name="49658">There&apos;s something unnatural about this plague, though it seems nobody wants to admit it. I guess they&apos;re afraid of panic in the streets. But you can&apos;t deny the facts. </string>
<string name="49659">I heard about Blackstaff and his cure. I don&apos;t like putting my faith in wizards, but I heard Lady Aribeth trusts him. She&apos;s at the Academy, you know. I hope I get a chance to meet her. </string>
<string name="49660">Where did it come from? Neverwinter&apos;s the only city that seems to be suffering. And why can&apos;t the priests cure it? </string>
<string name="49661">Defend the Waterdhavian creatures! Don&apos;t let them be taken!</string>
<string name="49662">You can&apos;t be serious, everybody knows fighting between recruits will get you kicked out of the Academy! Take your blustering threats somewhere else. I&apos;ve got to get back to my drills.</string>
<string name="49663">Pleased to meet you, Gilbert.</string>
<string name="49664">Hello, Gilbert. Me name be &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="49665">I think I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="49666">Sorry, you must have me confused with someone else.</string>

<string name="49687">Sounds like you&apos;ve got a crush on her.</string>
<string name="49688">It sound like you maybe love her.</string>

<string name="49690">You no worry - me still want see you later.</string>
<string name="49691">Actually, I can&apos;t get together with you later after all.</string>
<string name="49692">Me sorry. Me no can see you later.</string>

<string name="49694">Flattery? I like it.</string>

<string name="49699">Actually I&apos;m not seeing anyone right now.</string>
<string name="49700">That&apos;s really none of your business, Gilbert.</string>

<string name="49702">That not be none of you business, Gilbert!</string>
<string name="49703">I&apos;d like that, Gilbert.</string>
<string name="49704">Sorry, but I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="49705">Uh... I&apos;m already going with somebody. Sorry, Gilbert.</string>
<string name="49706">Me like that, Gilbert.</string>
<string name="49707">Me not interested. Sorry.</string>
<string name="49708">Uh... me got date already. Sorry, Gilbert.</string>
<string name="49709">Hey, there. Say, aren&apos;t you &lt;FirstName&gt;? Sure... I&apos;ve seen you in some of our combat training classes. My name&apos;s Gilbert. </string>
<string name="49710">Hi there. Are you new here at the Academy? I don&apos;t recognize you from any of my combat training exercises. Oh, wait a minute... you&apos;re a &lt;class&gt;. </string>
<string name="49711">No wonder I haven&apos;t seen you around, I doubt the Academy has us studying the same things. My name is Gilbert, by the way.</string>
<string name="49712">Good to see you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Is there something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="49713">&lt;FullName&gt;? Right! I&apos;ve got a friend who just got accepted here at the Academy. He&apos;s a &lt;class&gt;, too. He mentioned your name once.</string>
<string name="49714">From what I hear, &lt;FirstName&gt;, your training at the Academy is almost done. All you have to do is prove yourself in the final &lt;class&gt; challenge and you&apos;re ready for graduation. </string>
<string name="49715">So from what I hear it sounds like you&apos;ve almost finished your training here at the Academy, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You must be looking forward to graduating.</string>
<string name="49716">I envy you. I hear Lady Aribeth herself is here to hand out personal blessings to all the graduates in the south assembly hall. I&apos;d love to meet her myself, but I&apos;ve still got a ways to go on my training.</string>
<string name="49717">Well, I guess I&apos;ll just get back to my training then. I don&apos;t want Herban to chew me out for slacking on my drills.</string>
<string name="49718">I&apos;m sorry, my mistake - must be someone else who looks like you here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="49719">Uh, yeah... I already knew that, remember?</string>
<string name="49720">Sure - I could use a break from these drills, anyway. Herban&apos;s a slave driver! It&apos;ll be nice to talk with someone who isn&apos;t screaming at me all the time.</string>
<string name="49721">Are you kidding me? This is Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande! Defender of Tyr&apos;s faith, Champion of Neverwinter! She&apos;s a living legend.</string>
<string name="49722">Lord Nasher himself appointed her to oversee all city business dealing with the plague, and she didn&apos;t get that job because of her beauty. She earned it with her skill and determination.</string>
<string name="49723">They run us through the grinder pretty good at the Academy. Up early in the morning with the rest of the soldiers, marching, martial drills, the obstacle course, more drills... it isn&apos;t easy.</string>
<string name="49724">And, for some reason, Herban&apos;s taken a personal interest in my progress. Talk about bad luck. Every mistake I make, he&apos;s there to let me hear about it. Damn, he can get loud!</string>
<string name="49725">But it&apos;s a lot easier in here than out on the streets, what with the plague and all. And it&apos;ll all be worth it in the end as long as Aribeth comes back to grant blessings when I graduate. </string>
<string name="49726">Ah, I complain but I think I&apos;m going to make it. But thanks for asking.</string>
<string name="49727">Aw, it&apos;s nothing serious. Just a little hero worship. She&apos;s way out of my league.</string>
<string name="49728">She&apos;s beautiful, famous, smart, talented. What man wouldn&apos;t be attracted to her, right? But she&apos;s involved with someone, I hear. A cleric of Tyr named Fenthick. Lucky bastard.</string>
<string name="49729">Besides, Aribeth isn&apos;t the only beautiful woman here at the Academy - if you don&apos;t mind me saying so. </string>
<string name="49730">Terrible thing, isn&apos;t it? They&apos;ve got the entire city under quarantine, but every day there are more bodies in the street. Terrible.</string>
<string name="49731">But I doubt even the people of Luskan would be cruel enough to unleash the Wailing Death on us. I think all these conspiracy theories are just scared people looking for someone to blame.</string>
<string name="49732">I heard something about creatures being brought to the Academy from Waterdeep to make a cure. I just hope it&apos;s true. That&apos;s probably why Lady Aribeth is here today. I hope she takes the time to tour the barracks, I&apos;d love to meet her.</string>
<string name="49733">Hey - welcome back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope you haven&apos;t changed your mind about tonight.</string>
<string name="49734">And if the plague wasn&apos;t bad enough, there&apos;s all those rumors going around. You know, people saying the enemies of Neverwinter are behind the whole thing. A lot of people are blaming the town of Luskan.</string>
<string name="49735">Anyway, I hear Aribeth is involved with somebody. A priest named Fenthick. And how about you, if you don&apos;t mind me asking. Is there a special man in your life?</string>
<string name="49736">Besides, Aribeth may be attractive and all but I&apos;m more interested in a woman&apos;s inner beauty. Physical looks only go so deep - I&apos;m more interested in a woman with character. Like you.</string>
<string name="49737">I understand. The training here at the Academy isn&apos;t easy. We recruits don&apos;t have a lot of free time for things like relationships. Still, you can&apos;t blame a guy for trying. Is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="49738">I find that hard to believe - a fascinating woman like you without a man in her life.</string>
<string name="49739">I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t mean to be rude. I was just... I mean, I just wanted to know if you were seeing anyone. I figured a fascinating woman like you probably already has a boyfriend, is all.</string>
<string name="49740">I hope I&apos;m not being too forward but there&apos;s the big feast tonight in honor of all the Academy graduates. If you&apos;re not going with anyone, maybe we could go together.</string>
<string name="49741">Great! I&apos;m looking forward to it. Listen, I better get back to my drills. If I don&apos;t finish Herban might not let me go to the feast. Unless there was something else you needed?</string>
<string name="49742">I guess I&apos;ll see you later tonight, then. I&apos;m looking forward to it.</string>
<string name="49743">Wow! That was harsh! Okay, I get the message loud and clear. You&apos;re not interested. Thanks for crushing my spirit and will to live.</string>
<string name="49744">I should really get back to me drills. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="49745">I should have known. That&apos;s okay - it&apos;s kind of late notice. Is there something else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="49746">Is there something else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="49747">And how&apos;s your training going? If you&apos;re half as talented as you are beautiful, the Academy must be a snap for you.</string>
<string name="49748">And how&apos;s your training going? A woman as obviously talented as you must just be breezing through the training.</string>
<string name="49749">We&apos;re under attack! We have to protect the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="49750">You made it pretty clear how you feel about me. We&apos;ve got nothing more to say to each other.</string>
<string name="49751">So do I. I&apos;m really looking forward to it. Is there something else I can do for you, then?</string>
<string name="49752">I want to try the combat drills, Sir!</string>
<string name="49753">I don&apos;t want to try the combat drills, Sir!</string>
<string name="49754">Me want do combat drills, Sir!</string>
<string name="49755">Me no want do combat drills, Sir!</string>
<string name="49756">Sir! I&apos;m ready, Sir!</string>
<string name="49757">Sir, no Sir! I&apos;m not ready yet, Sir!</string>
<string name="49758">Sir! Me ready, Sir!</string>
<string name="49759">Sir, me not ready, Sir!</string>
<string name="49760">All right, let&apos;s get this over with.</string>
<string name="49761">What&apos;s with all the shouting? Is this supposed to inspire me or something?</string>
<string name="49762">Okay, me do it. Hurry up.</string>
<string name="49763">Why you be so mean?</string>
<string name="49764">I don&apos;t have time for this nonsense.</string>
<string name="49765">Me not got time for this.</string>
<string name="49766">I&apos;m ready to continue my training, Sir!</string>
<string name="49767">I want to ask you some questions, Sir.</string>
<string name="49768">Me ready for continue training, Sir!</string>
<string name="49769">Me want ask you questions, Sir.</string>
<string name="49770">I think I&apos;ll be going now, Sir.</string>
<string name="49771">Me want go now, Sir.</string>
<string name="49772">Sir! Yes, Sir!</string>
<string name="49773">Sir! No, Sir! Please repeat the information, Sir!</string>
<string name="49774">Sir, no, Sir! Me need you repeat, Sir!</string>
<string name="49775">Yeah, yeah, I get it, already.</string>
<string name="49776">Yeah, yeah, me get it already.</string>
<string name="49777">Sir! Yes, Sir!</string>
<string name="49778">Sir! Please repeat, Sir!</string>
<string name="49779">I got it. Let&apos;s move this show along.</string>
<string name="49780">Me got it. Hurry and finish talk. You boring.</string>
<string name="49781">Sir! Yes, Sir!</string>
<string name="49782">Sir! Please repeat, Sir</string>
<string name="49783">Oh, it&apos;s clear. Real loud and real clear. On a side note, what&apos;s up with your breath?</string>
<string name="49784">You clear. You also loud and have stinky breath.</string>
<string name="49785">I think I&apos;ll pass.</string>
<string name="49786">Me pass.</string>
<string name="49787">I&apos;m tired of calling you &quot;Sir.&quot; How about we compromise and I call you &quot;Shirley?&quot;</string>
<string name="49788">Me not want call you Sir no more. Me want call you Shirley.</string>
<string name="49789">Sir! Yes, Sir!</string>
<string name="49790">Sir! Please repeat, Sir!</string>
<string name="49791">Yeah, yeah. I&apos;ve got it. No need to shout and holler.</string>
<string name="49792">Me got it. You not need shout so much.</string>
<string name="49793">I already know everything I need to about combat!</string>
<string name="49794">Me already know what me need &apos;bout combat!</string>
<string name="49795">Not interested.</string>
<string name="49796">Sir! I wish to hear your combat tutorial, Sir!</string>
<string name="49797">Sir! Me want hear you tutorial!</string>
<string name="49798">Get your ass over here now, recruit!</string>
<string name="49799">It&apos;s about time you showed up, &lt;FirstName&gt;! My name is Herban, but as far as your worthless hide is concerned you can just call me &quot;Sir!&quot;</string>
<string name="49800">Whenever you want to use a feat or special attack on an enemy, right-click on your opponent to bring up the menu. Then, left-click on the Special Attack icon in the lower right corner of the menu.</string>
<string name="49801">This opens up a second menu with any feats or special attacks you might have. Just left-click on the attack or feat you want to use. </string>
<string name="49802">When parrying, you do not attack but you are able to make an opposed check to deflect or dodge any incoming attacks that would otherwise hit you. </string>
<string name="49803">Each round, you can parry one successful enemy attack for each attack you would normally get. If your roll succeeds by ten or greater, you will make a free counterattack at no penalty.</string>
<string name="49804">You aren&apos;t really a fighter type so you aren&apos;t required to participate in combat drills. They are open to anyone, however, and if you pass the combat test it will complete your basic training, but I&apos;d recommend you go study under your specialized trainer instead.</string>
<string name="49805">I think you might be more suited to taking on one of the other tests to complete your training, but if you really want to tackle the combat trials you have that right, recruit!</string>
<string name="49806">I figured as much. You&apos;re no warrior. Go test your skills on one of the other tests and trials here at the Academy! You&apos;re dismissed, recruit!</string>
<string name="49807">It&apos;s my job to teach you raw recruits some tips on combat technique so you maggots don&apos;t get gutted out there in the real world!</string>
<string name="49808">Well, recruit, don&apos;t just stand there with that dopey expression on your face! What&apos;s it going to be? Are you ready to begin your combat training or aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="49809">Wrong answer, recruit! Everybody needs to learn how to handle themselves in a fight! So you better get ready for this training in a hurry!</string>
<string name="49810">Maybe you think you don&apos;t need this kind of training, is that it? When you&apos;re staring down the point of some orc&apos;s crooked blade you&apos;ll wish you hadn&apos;t been such a smart ass! </string>
<string name="49811">Get out of here and don&apos;t come back until you&apos;re ready to learn, recruit!</string>
<string name="49812">You address me as &quot;Sir&quot; when you open your mouth, maggot! If this plague hadn&apos;t made us so desperate for recruits, I&apos;d boot your worthless ass out of here for that type of attitude!</string>
<string name="49813">But I&apos;m stuck with you and I don&apos;t have time to break your spirit and teach you proper respect and discipline. We don&apos;t have to like each other, but you will listen to what I have to say! </string>
<string name="49814">This information might save your life sometime, recruit, so listen up:</string>
<string name="49815">That&apos;s what I like to hear, recruit! With that attitude you might actually make something of yourself in this world!</string>
<string name="49816">On the special attacks menu, you will also see the Parry icon located at the very top in the 12 o&apos;clock position. Left-click on this icon whenever you want to enter parry mode.</string>
<string name="49817">Go speak to my assistants. Corporal Dendy at the southeast end of the room can test you in melee weapons. Then, for your test in ranged combat and missile weapons, speak to Corporal Hewwet over near the west wall.</string>
<string name="49818">Since you&apos;re a paladin I better show you how to use your special abilities. Just right-click on yourself to bring up the menu, then left-click on the special abilities icon on the left of the menu.</string>
<string name="49819">This will bring up the menu to access all your class-specific special abilities. Left-click on an ability to activate it or bring up a menu of class-specific abilities. That clear?</string>
<string name="49820">I see you&apos;re a barbarian. I better show you how to use your rage ability. Just right-click on yourself to bring up the menu, then left-click on the special abilities icon on the left of the menu.</string>
<string name="49821">This will bring up the menu to access all your class-specific special abilities. Left-click on the rage icon to activate your special ability. That clear, recruit?</string>
<string name="49822">You&apos;re a ranger, so you automatically get the dual-wield feat. As long as you wear only light armor you can use two weapons as if you had the ambidexterity and two-weapon fighting feats.</string>
<string name="49823">Remember, you lose your special dual-wield abilities if you wear medium or heavy armor. That clear, recruit?</string>
<string name="49824">You&apos;re a monk, so I better show you how to use your flurry of blows special ability.</string>
<string name="49825">Right-click on your target to bring up the menu, then left-click on the special attacks icon on the lower right of the menu to bring up your special attack menu. From there click the upper left icon.</string>
<string name="49826">This brings up the &quot;More Special Attacks&quot; menu. Finally, left-click on the Flurry of Blows icon located on the left of the menu. That clear, recruit?</string>
<string name="49827">I&apos;ve done my part, the rest is up to you, recruit. Time to prove yourself by facing one of the Academy&apos;s combat tests.</string>
<string name="49828">Back again, recruit? What do you want this time? And you better address me as &quot;Sir&quot; or this conversation is over!</string>
<string name="49829">Then quit bothering me! I don&apos;t have time to be holding the hand of every kid who comes through the Academy. We&apos;re here to train you maggots, not babysit you!</string>
<string name="49830">Oh, you recruits are always full of questions, aren&apos;t you? Was the plague really started by an enemy of Neverwinter, Sir? Are the Waterdhavian creatures really here at the Academy, Sir?</string>
<string name="49831">Well, you better forget about those questions and focus on the here and now, recruit! Your ass belongs to the Academy until you step out those doors! The outside world is nothing to you. Do you hear me? NOTHING!</string>
<string name="49832">You&apos;ve passed the combat trials, recruit. There&apos;s nothing more we can teach you here. You&apos;ve completed your Basic Training - time to reap the rewards!</string>
<string name="49833">Just head out into the hall and go to the south end. The guard there will let you into the assembly hall with the rest of the graduating recruits.</string>
<string name="49834">Damn it, recruit! Go find those Waterdhavian creatures and protect them!</string>
<string name="49835">You follow me so far, recruit?</string>
<string name="49836">You got a real attitude problem, &lt;boy/girl&gt;! But your smart mouth isn&apos;t going to be my problem much longer! So listen up and let&apos;s get this lesson over with!</string>
<string name="49837">Are you trying to tell me you haven&apos;t heard one damn word I&apos;ve said, recruit? This is for your benefit, maggot, so listen up this time!</string>
<string name="49838">Are we clear so far, recruit?</string>
<string name="49839">When a giant is ripping your lips off for talking back, recruit, just remember that somewhere I&apos;ll be smiling! Now quit goofing off and stay sharp!</string>
<string name="49840">What&apos;s the matter, recruit? You got nothing between your ears to stop my words from going in one side and out the other? Pay attention this time, maggot!</string>
<string name="49841">Is this a joke, &lt;boy/girl&gt;? Or do you just love the sound of my soothing voice? Listen close this time, recruit!</string>
<string name="49842">You know what, funny &lt;boy/girl&gt;? You ain&apos;t my problem anymore!</string>
<string name="49843">You think that&apos;s funny, recruit? Well, I left my sense of humor dangling on the point of a blood encrusted Luskan spear thirty years ago, so don&apos;t waste your jokes on me!</string>
<string name="49844">Get out of my face, recruit! I&apos;m sick of your wiseass ways!</string>
<string name="49845">To return to normal combat mode, simply left-click on your foe. Have you got that figured out, recruit? Can we move on to the next lesson?</string>
<string name="49846">Your weapon isn&apos;t just for killing, recruit. Sometimes it has other uses, like opening a chest or locked door.</string>
<string name="49847">If you find a lock you can&apos;t get past, right-click on the door or chest, then select the &quot;Bash&quot; icon from the menu. You can even do this with missile weapons.</string>
<string name="49848">The stronger you are, the easier it is to bash open a lock. Just remember that not all locks can be opened by force.</string>
<string name="49849">Are you really this stupid, recruit, or are you just trying to make my life a living hell? Listen up and I&apos;ll go over it again!</string>
<string name="49850">If I don&apos;t shout, recruit, it might not get through that thick layer of dung covering your brain! Now listen up for the next lesson!</string>
<string name="49851">Is that so, recruit? For the sake of your worthless hide, I hope that&apos;s true. </string>
<string name="49852">But I&apos;m going to give you one last chance to change your mind and listen to my tutorial on basic combat techniques.</string>
<string name="49853">You&apos;ve done the combat drills, recruit! But you&apos;re a &lt;class&gt;, not a soldier! There&apos;s nothing more we can teach you here.</string>
<string name="49854">If you want to graduate from the Academy you&apos;ll have to prove yourself by completing the &lt;class&gt; challenge. </string>
<string name="49855">Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="49856">That&apos;s it? My training&apos;s over?</string>
<string name="49857">That all? Me training be over?</string>
<string name="49858">Can you answer some questions?</string>
<string name="49859">Me want you answer question.</string>
<string name="49860">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="49861">I&apos;m ready for the ranged and missile weapon combat trial.</string>
<string name="49862">Me ready for bow and sling and stuff combat trial.</string>
<string name="49863">I want to take the test with melee weapons.</string>
<string name="49864">Me want test with swords and clubs and stuff.</string>
<string name="49865">Me want ask you question.</string>
<string name="49866">Can I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="49867">We&apos;re under attack! Protect the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="49868">I guess congratulations are in order. You&apos;ve passed the combat trial and completed your Basic Training. Your days at the Academy are finally over.</string>
<string name="49869">Nice shot! I need to talk to you.</string>
<string name="49870">If you hurry you can join the other Academy graduates in the south assembly hall. Lady Aribeth is there bestowing blessings on everyone who has completed Basic Training.</string>
<string name="49871">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="49872">Keep in mind this is only the final stage of everything you have learned while you have been here at the Academy. This is a mere formality, you&apos;ve already proven yourself worthy of going out into the world.</string>
<string name="49873">You&apos;re kidding, right? Everyone knows that Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, the famous Elven paladin of Tyr, is here at the Academy. Everybody&apos;s talking about it.</string>
<string name="49874">I hope I get a chance to meet her when my shift is over.</string>
<string name="49875">Sorry, not while I&apos;m on duty. Herban has rules against us chatting at our posts. He wants us to stay focused on our work. Besides, I thought you&apos;d be more interested in celebrating the end of your tour.</string>
<string name="49876">You need to speak to Herban first. He&apos;s in charge here.</string>
<string name="49877">So Herban sent you over for your combat trial, did he? Well, my name is Hewwet. I specialize in ranged and missile weapon combat. Are you ready to begin the final test?</string>
<string name="49878">Don&apos;t worry, there&apos;s nothing to it. All you have to do is hit the target at the end of the hall with a missile weapon. You can grab a missile weapon from the weapon rack here beside me.</string>
<string name="49879">Fire away whenever you&apos;re ready. I&apos;ll let you know if you hit the target.</string>
<string name="49880">Then you should go talk to Dendy on the other side of the room. He&apos;s the expert with melee weapons. I&apos;m only certified to test you in missile and ranged weapons.</string>
<string name="49881">Sorry, but I can&apos;t. Herban demoted the last guy caught socializing at his post. Harsh but fair, I say. If you&apos;re not here to take the combat test I really can&apos;t talk to you.</string>
<string name="49882">That shot was taken too close to the target. It doesn&apos;t count. Move back and try again.</string>
<string name="49883">Not bad. But since you are a &lt;class&gt;, you should be training elsewhere.</string>
<string name="49884">You&apos;ve completed my part of the test. Go speak with Dendy for the second part.</string>
<string name="49885">You&apos;ve passed the combat tests, but your training here at the Academy isn&apos;t over yet.</string>
<string name="49886">You have to go finish the &lt;class&gt; challenge before they&apos;ll let you graduate. I can&apos;t do anything more for you here.</string>
<string name="49887">Nice Shot. You&apos;ve completed my part of the test. Go speak with Dendy for the second part.</string>
<string name="49888">Pleased to meet you, Chandra.</string>
<string name="49889">Hello, Chandra. Me name be &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>

<string name="49917">Me sorry. Me no can see you later.</string>
<string name="49918">I came to the Academy to learn, Chandra, not to get hit on by desperate, lonely sorceresses.</string>
<string name="49919">Normally I object to flattery, but only a fool dismisses compliments from a beautiful woman.</string>
<string name="49920">No offense, but I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="49921">Me like nice words from pretty woman.</string>

<string name="49932">Me not interested. Sorry.</string>
<string name="49933">Uh... me got date already. Sorry, Chandra.</string>
<string name="49934">Hello there. You are &lt;FirstName&gt;, aren&apos;t you? We were in the same arcane theory class I believe. My name is Chandra. </string>
<string name="49935">I do not recognize you from any of my classes. You must be new here at the Academy. Unless... of course, how could I have not noticed? You are a &lt;class&gt;, not a mage. </string>
<string name="49936">No wonder your face is not familiar; I highly doubt the Academy has us following the same curriculum. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Chandra.</string>
<string name="49937">Hello again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Is there something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="49938">&lt;FullName&gt;? Oh yes, I have a friend who recently enrolled here at the Academy. He is also a &lt;class&gt;. I believe he has mentioned your name to me before.</string>
<string name="49939">From what I hear, &lt;FirstName&gt;, your training at the Academy is almost done. You have only to prove yourself in the final &lt;class&gt; challenge and you will be ready for graduation. </string>
<string name="49940">I&apos;ve heard your study here at the Academy is almost complete, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You must be looking forward to graduating.</string>
<string name="49941">I envy you. I hear Lady Aribeth herself is here to hand out personal blessings to all the graduates in the south assembly hall. I hope she returns for my own graduation. I would love to meet her.</string>
<string name="49942">I suppose I will resume my studies then. Jaroo has given me a number of incantations to prepare.</string>
<string name="49943">I do apologize. There must be someone else who looks like you here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="49944">Uh... yes. I already recognized you, remember?</string>
<string name="49945">Certainly. Jaroo always says that asking questions is the most important step in seeking answers. </string>
<string name="49946">Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande is an inspiration to all the citizens of Neverwinter, especially those of us here at the Academy.</string>
<string name="49947">She is everything I wish to be, intelligent, powerful and beautiful. Someday I hope to be as loved and respected as she, though some might say that is a foolish and silly dream.</string>
<string name="49948">I could ask for no finer instructor than Jaroo. He is both patient and well versed in the arcane arts.</string>
<string name="49949">To be sure the lessons are difficult and the workload is often great. I have spent many nights burning countless candles as I study my tomes. </string>
<string name="49950">But success comes to those who persevere. One need only look to Lady Aribeth to see a shining example of that. I do hope I get a chance to meet her before she leaves.</string>
<string name="49951">The work is difficult, but Jaroo is quick to aid any who stumble in their pursuit of the ancient knowledge. He is a fine instructor.</string>
<string name="49952">You flatter me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Most people laugh at me when I dare compare myself to Lady Aribeth, even though we are both of noble blood.</string>
<string name="49953">Perhaps someday I will be as famous as she, but I fear that day is a long way off. I shall thank you for the compliment nevertheless. Is there something else you wish to know?</string>
<string name="49954">You are kind not to scoff at my dream. Often men who are as handsome as you harbor a bitter, mean spirit to compensate. I am glad to see you are of a gentle, compassionate nature.</string>
<string name="49955">I know little enough about it. My family were nobles of the Blacklake district and the Wailing Death has yet to touch that section of the city, thanks to the quarantine.</string>
<string name="49956">Perhaps they are right in their suspicions of the plague&apos;s origins, but it is not right to blame all wizards for this terrible tragedy. In their ignorance they judge us when they do not even know us.</string>
<string name="49957">Thankfully, Lady Aribeth herself is not prejudiced against wizards, or she may have refused Blackstaff&apos;s offer of aid. I hope I get a chance to meet her before she leaves the Academy.</string>
<string name="49958">Hello again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope you haven&apos;t changed your mind about our date tonight.</string>
<string name="49959">I do know that there are those who blame the plague on foul necromancy, even here in the Academy. Their eyes burn with hatred whenever they look upon my mage&apos;s cloak.</string>
<string name="49960">You are kind not to scoff at my words. The woman in your life is very lucky... or dare I believe one of such noble and gentle spirit is still unattached?</string>
<string name="49961">You are kind not to scoff at my words. I am ashamed to admit this, but I assumed by your rough appearance that you were something of a beast. But I see now you have a true and gentle heart.</string>
<string name="49962">I understand. Many men, even other mages, are intimidated by a woman who commands the powers of magic. Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="49963">That is a shame. In these troubled times no one should be alone - particularly a man as kind and understanding as you obviously are.</string>
<string name="49964">Forgive me, I am not trying to pry. But in these troubled times no one should be alone - particularly a man as kind and understanding as you obviously are.</string>
<string name="49965">We might exchange coy flirtations all day, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I am a woman who prefers action. There is a feast tonight in honor of the Academy graduates. Perhaps you would accompany me to the festival? </string>
<string name="49966">As would I. Jaroo wants me to prepare these cantrips for tomorrow, I should resume my studies so I am free for tonight. Unless there was something else you needed?</string>
<string name="49967">I shall see you later tonight then. I hear the graduation feast is spectacular, I am looking forward to our evening together.</string>
<string name="49968">I see. I thought there was a mutual attraction between us. Obviously I was mistaken. Rest assured I will trouble you no longer with such foolishness.</string>
<string name="49969">Excuse me now, please. I really must return to my studies. I have a number of cantrips to master before the morrow.</string>
<string name="49970">I am not surprised. As they say, the good men are all taken. Rest assured there are no hard feelings. Is there something else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="49971">Is there something else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="49972">And how is your training going? If you are half as talented as you are handsome you must surely be at the head of all your classes.</string>
<string name="49973">And how is your training going? Surely a man as talented as you must have no difficulty mastering all the challenges the Academy presents.</string>
<string name="49974"> We have to protect the Waterdhavian creatures!</string>
<string name="49975">You left little doubt as to how you feel about me. I have nothing further to say to you.</string>
<string name="49976">Some men, even other mages, are intimidated by a woman who wields powerful magic. I am glad to learn you are not so insecure. Is there something else I can do for you, then?</string>
<string name="49977">I hope the rumors are true. If Khelben Arunsun really has discovered a cure, then perhaps those who blame the plague on sorcery will begin to treat us mages with respect instead of contempt and fear. </string>
<string name="49978">I would like to receive a lesson in casting spells.</string>
<string name="49979">Me want learn how cast spells.</string>
<string name="49980">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="49981">Me want ask you questions.</string>
<string name="49982">I am ready for the Mage&apos;s Challenge.</string>
<string name="49983">Me ready for Mage Challenge.</string>
<string name="49984">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="49985">Show me.</string>
<string name="49986">Don&apos;t bother.</string>
<string name="49987">Could you go over the details of the Mage&apos;s Challenge again?</string>
<string name="49988">Me need you explain Mage Challenge again.</string>
<string name="49989">What can you tell me about the plague?</string>
<string name="49990">What&apos;s this I hear about a cure for the plague?</string>
<string name="49991">What you know &apos;bout plague?</string>
<string name="49992">Me want know &apos;bout cure.</string>
<string name="49993">What can you tell me about Lady Aribeth?</string>
<string name="49994">What you know &apos;bout Lady Aribeth.</string>
<string name="49995">Go on.</string>
<string name="49996">Sorry, could you repeat that?</string>
<string name="49997">Me sorry. You say again, please.</string>
<string name="49998">Okay. Go on.</string>
<string name="49999">Could you repeat that stuff about resting?</string>
