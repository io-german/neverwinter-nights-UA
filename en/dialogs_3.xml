<resources><string name="0">Thank you.</string>
<string name="1">Me says thank you.</string>
<string name="2">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come on... I helped you out more than that.</string>
<string name="3">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me says you can do better. More money, yuh?</string>
<string name="4">I didn&apos;t help you for chump-change. Do you want to get hurt?</string>
<string name="5">You make me mad. I needs more gold!</string>
<string name="6">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; And when all of those Neverwintans starve so you can get some extra gold... </string>
<string name="8">Me guesses me can&apos;t makes you budge?</string>
<string name="9">You look like someone with some sense to them. Why don&apos;t you go talk that chump into getting me the marble, so I can ship off to Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="10">You believe that chump? I got a chance to ship some marble into Waterdeep - that&apos;s some good gold in that deal! And he&apos;s throwing morality at me.</string>
<string name="11">You look like the kind of &lt;lad/lass&gt; I need - nice and gruff. Why don&apos;t you scare some sense into the dock-master, so I can get my marble and leave for Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="12">Have a nice chat with ol&apos; Prichev there? He fill your head with moralistic nonsense? I hope you&apos;re not fool enough to believe it all.</string>
<string name="13">Well, looks like I get to ship off to Waterdeep. Wouldn&apos;t be right not to give you a small cut. So here, take this.</string>
<string name="14">Yes. Goodbye - and let us all hope that ends more heroically than it has started.</string>
<string name="15">Captain Mung, you can call me. And I own the boat that&apos;ll bring any goods from Port Llast to points beyond - points beyond that *I* choose.</string>
<string name="16">Especially not when my choice is risking my life, or getting some marble to Waterdeep for a real pay-day. I&apos;m talking good money!</string>
<string name="17">Thank you. I won&apos;t hold you to any promises, but if you can get him to give me the good shipment, I&apos;d be thankful.</string>
<string name="18">What? You&apos;re taking his side? I&apos;m not risking my life, or my men&apos;s life. Don&apos;t believe that the plague is cured.</string>
<string name="19">You can&apos;t tell me what to do! Who are you?! You do not tell me what to do!! That&apos;s it, I&apos;m leaving. Forget about Port Llast. I don&apos;t need either shipment.</string>
<string name="20">Time for me to get on to work. I&apos;m heading off to Waterdeep, and I ain&apos;t got much time to show for the work to do.</string>
<string name="21">But that no good dock-master is making my life miserable. Tell me, would you be shipping into Neverwinter when you could be off to Waterdeep?</string>
<string name="22">That bum wants me to go to Neverwinter, but they got plague there. And I&apos;m not risking my life to deliver some food and supplies.</string>
<string name="23">Argue with someone else, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I&apos;m not interested. And I&apos;m not going in there. It&apos;s not worth what I&apos;d be making.</string>
<string name="24">Pay? You&apos;d pay me to go to Neverwinter? Is it that important to you? Well, all right. I&apos;m a businessman. What&apos;s your offer?</string>
<string name="25">Well, that&apos;s a fair offer, I suppose. Fine, I&apos;ll take it. I always wanted to do the right thing anyway. Just needed a push. Nice doing business... </string>
<string name="26">Yeah, you do that. You make sure he tells you the truth of this, and none of those pulling-my-heartstring lies.</string>
<string name="27">Bah. If you got any sense in you, you&apos;ll talk to that dock-master and give him a piece of my mind, before I strangle him!</string>
<string name="28">Ah, thank you. It&apos;ll be a nice pay-day to get at the end of this next voyage, thanks to you. And now, it&apos;s time to say farewell.</string>
<string name="29">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; What the heck - I suppose I&apos;m feeling generous. You&apos;ve gotten me a nice reward, after all. Here, take this then.</string>
<string name="30">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but I&apos;m taking every last coin I can get. I&apos;m not trying to make money so that I can give it away.</string>
<string name="31">I should have known better than to think this could be done out of kindness. Profit is always the reasoning behind things, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="32">Here, take this money. At least I can be contented in the knowledge that the shipment will make it to Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="33">Yes, goodbye. Pleasure to have met you, so says my gold purse. Ha ha!</string>
<string name="34">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; 100 gold? And all I have to do is dump some food off in Neverwinter? All right. I&apos;ll do it. Nice doing business... </string>
<string name="35">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, 100 gold is a nice offer, but it&apos;s not quite enough to make me want to risk a quick and ugly death.</string>
<string name="36">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; 50 gold? All right. It doesn&apos;t cover the difference, but if it means that much to you... nice doing business with you.</string>
<string name="37">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry. While 50 gold is a nice start, it&apos;s not enough. Maybe you got some more in that purse of yours?</string>
<string name="38">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You had to put it like that, didn&apos;t you. Fine. I&apos;ll take the shipment. But you just leave me alone, now, all right? I got work to do.</string>
<string name="39">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Ain&apos;t nothing you can say that ol&apos; dock-master hasn&apos;t already tried, so beat off will you? Scram!</string>
<string name="40">Hey, you get that chump to open up the port yet? I ain&apos;t going nowhere without that marble. And I&apos;m going straight in to Waterdeep for a pay-day!</string>
<string name="41">You back again? I&apos;m telling you, arguing with that fool dock-master Prichev is driving me insane. Why don&apos;t you go do something about this argument?</string>
<string name="42">Nope.</string>
<string name="43">I done told you already that I ain&apos;t taking any goods. I&apos;m packing up and leaving this place. Now, get gone!</string>
<string name="44">Stop bothering me so much, will ya? I got to get them goods packed up for Neverwinter, and time is tight.</string>
<string name="45">Stop bothering me so much, will ya? I got to get them goods packed up for Neverwinter, and time is tight.</string>
<string name="46">Who are you?</string>
<string name="47">What&apos;s going on between you and that other guy?</string>
<string name="48">Who you be?</string>
<string name="49">Why you is arguing with guy, yuh?</string>
<string name="50">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="51">I&apos;ll speak with the captain about taking the Neverwintan shipment.</string>
<string name="52">Isn&apos;t there some compromise that can be worked out?</string>
<string name="53">I spoke with the captain.</string>
<string name="54">Me will go and gets his agreement, again.</string>
<string name="55">Me think you be too demanding. You make bargain?</string>
<string name="56">Me spoke to captain. Me makes deal.</string>
<string name="57">Nevermind. I&apos;ll talk to him again.</string>
<string name="58">I agree with him. You should give him the Waterdhavian shipment.</string>
<string name="59">Listen, how about you give the captain the Waterdhavian shipment?</string>
<string name="60">Me thinks you gives Waterdhavian shipment to captain.</string>
<string name="61">Go on. I want to hear this.</string>
<string name="62">You tells me, yuh? Me listens.</string>
<string name="63">Sorry - this doesn&apos;t sound interesting. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="64">Me not cares. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="65">Isn&apos;t there some compromise that can be worked out?</string>
<string name="66">Nevermind. I&apos;ll talk to him again.</string>
<string name="67">I agree with him. You should give him the Waterdhavian shipment.</string>
<string name="68">Isn&apos;t there some compromise that can be worked out?</string>
<string name="69">I understand now. I&apos;ll speak with him.</string>
<string name="70">Oh, me get it. Me talk to him now.</string>
<string name="71">That&apos;s easy for you to say. You get paid either way.</string>
<string name="72">He do what good for him. You win either way, yeah? No fair.</string>
<string name="73">Give up that shipment, or I&apos;ll kill you and hand it to him myself.</string>
<string name="74">Me gives you gold, yeah? Changes mind?</string>
<string name="75">Perhaps some gold would change your mind?</string>
<string name="76">Me can kill you and take shipment if you no do it.</string>
<string name="77">No one asked you to. Just tell me your decision.</string>
<string name="78">That &apos;cause you stupid. Now, what choice you make?</string>
<string name="79">Thank you. Helping Neverwinter was the right thing.</string>
<string name="80">Me say thank you.</string>
<string name="81">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That&apos;s not a thank you. But a little more would be.</string>
<string name="82">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me feels more thank&apos;d if you gives more gold, yuh?</string>
<string name="83">You can give me more, or I can go talk to the captain again.</string>
<string name="84">Me goes talk captain, change things. Or more money, yeah?</string>
<string name="85">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="86">Look, I don&apos;t mean to be rude - arguing with Captain Mung is draining. So you&apos;ll excuse me if I can&apos;t talk, all right? I&apos;ve got supplies to move.</string>
<string name="87">Aw - what do you want? I&apos;m telling you, this ain&apos;t the best of days so far. Captain Mung won&apos;t stop arguing with me.</string>
<string name="88">Hey, I&apos;m not in the mood to talk right now. I have food and supplies to move, and I&apos;m stuck arguing with Captain Mung. This is *not* a good day.</string>
<string name="89">Look, I saw you speaking with Captain Mung. I&apos;m sure he told you some lies about me. At least let me tell you my side before you proclaim anything, will you?</string>
<string name="90">I don&apos;t even know what happened, but I got a bunch of goods that are making their way out to Neverwinter now. Let me thank you for it with this.</string>
<string name="91">Yes. Goodbye. Now, back to trying to convince a money-hungry pig to do something charitable.</string>
<string name="92">What does it matter to you, huh? Ahh... I&apos;m sorry. The name&apos;s Prichev - and I&apos;m a little pressed for time right now if you can&apos;t tell.</string>
<string name="93">Good Captain Mung&apos;s only got room for one shipment. Of course, he wants the money from the valuable shipment - but the people of Neverwinter *need* this relief shipment.</string>
<string name="94">Thank you. I won&apos;t hold you to any promises, but if you can get him to change his mind, well... it would be the right thing.</string>
<string name="95">Yes, and what did he say? Will he take the Neverwintan shipment after all? To think of those desperate souls. Please tell me you talked some sense into him. </string>
<string name="96">Are you serious? Do you not understand what the situation is? Port Llast has come together to help Neverwinter&apos;s citizens - that shipment needs to be made.</string>
<string name="97">I wish there was, but really - this is black and white. The people of Port Llast have worked hard to help Neverwinter. I want that effort to be carried out.</string>
<string name="98">What? No! I won&apos;t give up the Waterdhavian shipment. That relief package needs to get to Neverwinter right away. I have to ship it now.</string>
<string name="99">I can&apos;t believe it. Well, I guess money is more important to everyone these days. What a shameful day. I hope it&apos;s worth it to you.</string>
<string name="100">What?! I should have known I couldn&apos;t trust you. Things get a little too risky for you, and suddenly the agreed-upon price isn&apos;t good enough.</string>
<string name="101">Hey pal - business is business. I do you a favor and you do one right back for me, all right? And this has nothing to do with risk.</string>
<string name="102">Besides, if I started doing things out of the kindness of my heart, I wouldn&apos;t be in business now would I? I do as I -</string>
<string name="103">I give out the jobs, and you take them. I need this shipped to Neverwinter. If you want work, you&apos;ll take this package.</string>
<string name="104">Well, if the difference is between a wealthy shipment to Waterdeep, and a trip into that plague-ridden town - count me out.</string>
<string name="105">How am I supposed to reason with you? The plague has been cured! And those citizens are desperate. Put yourself in their shoes!</string>
<string name="106">I don&apos;t trust what people say about a plague that can kill you. I&apos;m staying away. I&apos;m not bringing that shipment to Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="107">Hey, I don&apos;t mean to be burdening you with my troubles, but... well, I sure could use an ear. And who knows - maybe you can help?</string>
<string name="108">I&apos;ve got two shipments - one going to Waterdeep, and one to Neverwinter. The Waterdhavian shipment is worth more, but the Neverwintan package is for relief - put together by the citizens of Port Llast.</string>
<string name="109">Great - just great. The captain&apos;s gone. Now, neither shipment is going out. Thanks for your *help,* okay? Sickening, that&apos;s what this is.</string>
<string name="110">I wish there was, but really - this is black and white. The people of Port Llast have worked hard to help Neverwinter. I want that effort to be carried out.</string>
<string name="111">This will help their lives immensely. I understand the value of money, but it&apos;s not everything, you understand. This is for the good!</string>
<string name="112">You would - threaten me - over this? For someone else&apos;s profit? I don&apos;t understand.</string>
<string name="113">Surely you can find a better use of your gold than ensuring another&apos;s profit? Take your bribes elsewhere, won&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="114">I don&apos;t care for your arguments or accusations. I&apos;m not thinking business - I&apos;m thinking aid. If you cannot help me, leave this matter alone.</string>
<string name="115">I know I might seem tense, but - it is the situation that does this to me. Please, speak to him. I trust you will do well.</string>
<string name="116">Now, is there something else? I have a shipment to get to Neverwinter, and apparently no boat to take it there. If you&apos;ll excuse me?</string>
<string name="117">Though you sicken me - fine, I will release the shipment. Now, do not speak with me further.</string>
<string name="118">I understand. This really isn&apos;t your business anyhow. I apologize for attempting to pull you into it.</string>
<string name="119">And this day, this act of kindness - ah, my faith in humanity is strong. Thank you, kind &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Thank you.</string>
<string name="120">Well, in the end, it&apos;s been a good day. Port Llast came together, and we got some aid out to Neverwinter. Good people do exist, after all.</string>
<string name="121">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes, I suppose it would. You have done well, and I am in good spirits. Fine, take this extra gold to go with my thanks.</string>
<string name="122">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Port Llast has spent much already, just to prepare these goods. To ask more would be too much. I must ask you to withdraw your request.</string>
<string name="123">I should have known better than to think this could be done out of kindness. Profit is always the reasoning behind things, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="124">Here, take this money. At least I can be contented in the knowledge that the shipment will make it to Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="125">Yes, goodbye. Let us part ways knowing that a good deed has been done.</string>
<string name="126">It seems to me that you&apos;re working toward a mediation. And while normally I&apos;d agree with that, I don&apos;t believe this issue is one for mediation.</string>
<string name="127">Did you want to talk about something else? I&apos;m sorry if I seem distracted - I just can&apos;t get over the argument I&apos;m having with Captain Mung.</string>
<string name="128">I can&apos;t believe it. Well, I guess money is more important to everyone these days. What a shameful day. I hope it&apos;s worth it to you.</string>
<string name="129">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="130">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="131">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="132">I need information about Port Llast.</string>
<string name="133">Urth? Who&apos;s that?</string>
<string name="134">Do you know anything about the surrounding region?</string>
<string name="135">What you know of Port Llast?</string>
<string name="136">What you mean Urth? Who that?</string>
<string name="137">What you know happen outside Port Llast?</string>
<string name="138">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there anyone else that could help me? A local, maybe?</string>
<string name="139">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s okay to tell me. I want to help.</string>
<string name="140">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Who are the Eisenfeldts? Where do they live?</string>
<string name="141">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You trusts me, yes? Me help.</string>
<string name="142">I just need some directions.</string>
<string name="143">Me need help with directions? You can, yes?</string>
<string name="144">Is there an inn nearby?</string>
<string name="145">Is there a temple in town?</string>
<string name="146">I need to buy some equipment.</string>
<string name="147">Are there any rangers or druids within town?</string>
<string name="148">Me tired. Me wants sleep, yuh?</string>
<string name="149">Me look for holy place. Me needs temple, yuh?</string>
<string name="150">Me needs new stuff to buy.</string>
<string name="151">Where me hire people - help me fight?</string>
<string name="152">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="153">Me asks something else. Okay?</string>
<string name="154">Yes, I am an adventurer.</string>
<string name="155">Me yes - is adventurer &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="156">I need to hire some adventurers.</string>
<string name="157">Me wonders if Port Llast got rangers or druids?</string>
<string name="158">Tell me about Ander.</string>
<string name="159">Who Ander be?</string>
<string name="160">There are werewolves in Port Llast?</string>
<string name="161">You gots werewolfs at Port Llast?</string>
<string name="162">Do you know anything about this knight?</string>
<string name="163">Who knight be? You know?</string>
<string name="164">You shouldn&apos;t get so excited about adventuring. It&apos;s a rough life.</string>
<string name="165">You want being adventurer? Too rough for anyone. Bad stuff.</string>
<string name="166">Who? Me? I&apos;m no adventurer.</string>
<string name="167">Me not adventurer - no how, no way!</string>
<string name="168">Does your pop not like adventurers?</string>
<string name="169">What pop got against me adventuring people?</string>
<string name="170">Let me ask something else.</string>
<string name="171">Me gots other question.</string>
<string name="172">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Whiny&quot; Shaldrissa? Who&apos;s that?</string>
<string name="173">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; What you says &quot;whiny&quot; Shaldrissa? Who she?</string>
<string name="174">Where might I find Ander?</string>
<string name="175">Me maybe talk to Ander?</string>
<string name="176">Are you an adventurer or something?</string>
<string name="177">You&apos;re a nice person. Do you want to play a game sometime?</string>
<string name="178">Bye, bye stranger. You&apos;re a pretty nice &lt;mister/missus&gt;, after all.</string>
<string name="179">Bye... </string>
<string name="180">Um... I guess I can answer a question for you. What did you want to know? Hey, is this about Urth? I don&apos;t want to get him into trouble.</string>
<string name="181">Ah - what kind of stuff were you wanting to ask me about?</string>
<string name="182">I - guess so. Um. I guess.</string>
<string name="183">Ummm... I don&apos;t really know what - most people just go to Neurik when they got a question about local stuff. He&apos;s at the Tyrran temple.</string>
<string name="184">Urth is my friend. He lives on the Eisenfeldt farm. But... I don&apos;t know. He&apos;s been weird lately. I shouldn&apos;t say anything else.</string>
<string name="185">Ummm... you could probably talk to Neurik. He&apos;s at the Tyrran Temple, but he pretty much knows all sorts of stuff. Maybe he can help.</string>
<string name="186">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t see him much anymore. I saw him the other day and he ran away from me. He&apos;s kind of scary now.</string>
<string name="187">Can we talk about something else? Did you have another question?</string>
<string name="188">They&apos;re our neighbors. All of the Port Llast farms are south of town. I&apos;m sure you can go over and talk to them, maybe.</string>
<string name="189">Yeah? What do you want? My folks ain&apos;t want me talking to no adventurers. You&apos;re an adventurer, right?</string>
<string name="190">Are you an adventurer? You look kind of... I don&apos;t know - are you one?</string>
<string name="191">Sure. What are you looking for? I&apos;ve been living here my whole entire life. I know where everything is.</string>
<string name="192">Um... okay, I guess.</string>
<string name="193">Yeah. You&apos;ll probably want to go to the Alliance Arms, by the north gate into town. There&apos;s lots of people like you there.</string>
<string name="194">Yeah - Neurik runs the Tyrran temple and looks after all of us - at least as much as he can. The temple&apos;s by the north gate.</string>
<string name="195">You can buy swords and everything at the Cracked Anvil - it&apos;s on the west side of town. My pop says it&apos;s all a waste of money, though. No offense, &lt;mister/missus&gt;.</string>
<string name="196">Yeah, there&apos;s one in the northeast part of town - in a grove. You could probably talk to him if you wanted to.</string>
<string name="197">Do you want to know where anything else is?</string>
<string name="198">I think I saw Urth yesterday.</string>
<string name="199">And then the big werewolf came and ate up all of the little ones! Grrrrr!</string>
<string name="200">I bet you&apos;re still in love with Jimmy, aren&apos;t you.</string>
<string name="201">Really? Was he - was he all right?</string>
<string name="202">I don&apos;t know. I called out his name and he ran away from me. He jumped the wall.</string>
<string name="203">You couldn&apos;t catch him? You were always the faster one.</string>
<string name="204">He was running fast and he leapt over that wall like nothin&apos;. Something&apos;s different with him. I don&apos;t know if I wanted to catch him.</string>
<string name="205">I don&apos;t want you playing with me. You&apos;re not nice.</string>
<string name="206">You&apos;re just scared of the werewolves is all. You&apos;re just a baby!</string>
<string name="207">Am not!</string>
<string name="208">Am too!</string>
<string name="209">Yuck! Boys are so gross!</string>
<string name="210">Then why do you spend all day watching them?</string>
<string name="211">So we can tattle on them when they do something Mother says they shouldn&apos;t. Isn&apos;t it obvious?</string>
<string name="212">We get lots of adventurers in Port Llast now-a-days. Pop says they all come from Neverwinter, &apos;cause they want to live here instead.</string>
<string name="213">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Pop says I shouldn&apos;t talk about people behind their back. I shouldn&apos;t say anything more.</string>
<string name="214">Ander might be able to help you, too. He&apos;s so neat! He worked with a knight to hunt werewolves!</string>
<string name="215">You could probably ask the guys at the barracks. They all come and go and know stuff like that. It&apos;s the place just south of the Tyrran temple.</string>
<string name="216">If you go to the barracks just south of the temple and the inn, you can find some people like you there. Maybe one will let you hire them?</string>
<string name="217">That&apos;s what my pop&apos;s always saying. He says to get my head out of the clouds, and that Port Llast has good soil or crops.</string>
<string name="218">Ander&apos;s one of my friends. He got recruited to go on an adventure to get werewolves with that knight!</string>
<string name="219">I want to be an adventurer, but pop says that it&apos;s a waste of time - um, no offense, &lt;mister/missus&gt;.</string>
<string name="220">No, my pop says there aren&apos;t. But that knight came in and took and Ander and some others and made them go hunt some.</string>
<string name="221">No. He came in like you and hired some people and went away. I think his name was Karathis.</string>
<string name="222">I don&apos;t know. He says not to talk to them. I guess it&apos;s because we&apos;re farmers. He doesn&apos;t like fighting.</string>
<string name="223">We get lots of adventurers in Port Llast now-a-days. Pop says they all come from Neverwinter, &apos;cause they want to live here instead.</string>
<string name="224">I want to be an adventurer myself, some day. Pop says that&apos;s a waste of time, but I always like talking to the adventurers who come through here.</string>
<string name="225">Ummm... okay.</string>
<string name="226">Umm... you mean like off of the farm? My pop doesn&apos;t let me go too far. He says there&apos;s criminals or something outside of town. Of course, whiny Shaldrissa swoons over all of them.</string>
<string name="227">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, she&apos;s just some girl. She&apos;s the mayor&apos;s daughter, and she&apos;s always talking about wanting to leave town.</string>
<string name="228">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Aw, I shouldn&apos;t have said &quot;whiny&quot; - I didn&apos;t mean nothing by it. Pop says not to talk about others behind their backs. Sorry.</string>
<string name="229">I guess I think it would be fun to go adventuring, too, but she&apos;s just someone who won&apos;t stop talking about it. My dad says she&apos;s got her head in the wrong place.</string>
<string name="230">Oh, he spends his time at the Alliance Arms Inn. You can find him there if you want to talk to him.</string>
<string name="231">If you&apos;re looking for magic supplies, you should go to Eltoora Sarptyl&apos;s! You can find her on the hill at the north end of town.</string>
<string name="232">Go wash up, son. You&apos;ve got the smell of the sea on you.</string>
<string name="233">In a minute, ma.</string>
<string name="234">We&apos;ve got guests here, hon. Go make yourself presentable.</string>
<string name="235">I&apos;m perfectly presentable as I am, mother.</string>
<string name="236">And you&apos;ll make a perfectly presentable spinster someday, too, so go put on a nice blouse.</string>
<string name="237">You&apos;re impossible, mother!</string>
<string name="238">Are you ready for your sewing lessons, dear?</string>
<string name="239">There&apos;s not enough light. I&apos;ll just end up stitching myself to my dress again.</string>
<string name="240">All right, but tomorrow afternoon I want you home to work on it.</string>
<string name="241">You&apos;ve been playing Soldiers and Thieves again, haven&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="242">Billy made me do it... </string>
<string name="243">Well then, you&apos;re going to have to make Billy not do it, aren&apos;t you... ?</string>
<string name="244">Yes&apos;m.</string>
<string name="245">Hullo, Missus. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="246">Did my husband finally bring in the plow?</string>
<string name="247">Not the plow itself but he talked to me about it. He&apos;ll bring it in tomorrow, he said.</string>
<string name="248">All right. Well here are some beets and onions to pay for it when he comes in, then.</string>
<string name="249">Well that will make a fine soup, then.</string>
<string name="250">Excuse me, I don&apos;t have time to talk, &lt;mister/missus&gt;.</string>
<string name="251">Don&apos;t you be pesterin&apos; the likes of me, now.</string>
<string name="252">Nice to see people of quality in our town. Welcome to Port Llast!</string>
<string name="253">Can I ask who you are?</string>
<string name="254">Have you dug your grave, lycanthrope? It&apos;s time to die.</string>
<string name="255">Neurik gave me these silver charms. I think they can help you.</string>
<string name="256">Who you be? Me wants to know.</string>
<string name="257">Me kill you, wolfy... </string>
<string name="258">Wait, me help! Me have silver charms from healer-man.</string>
<string name="259">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Don&apos;t be shy, handsome - it won&apos;t hurt you.</string>
<string name="260">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Nonsense. Neurik made it and, if you can&apos;t trust him, you can&apos;t trust anyone.</string>
<string name="261">Look, kid. Take it or I *will* kill you. It&apos;s that simple.</string>
<string name="262">All right, kid, dig your grave.</string>
<string name="263">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Grrrr... You so handsome when you angry, wolfy.</string>
<string name="264">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Neurik good man. He no hurt you.</string>
<string name="265">You no take potion thingy, me kill you, yuh? So take it.</string>
<string name="266">Grrr... That&apos;s it, me hurt you now... </string>
<string name="267">Why you no have ring?</string>
<string name="268">Why don&apos;t you have your ring?</string>
<string name="269">Tell me how you became a werewolf.</string>
<string name="270">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ve been sent to end the werewolf menace. If you give me your ring, I&apos;ll leave and no one will come searching for you in the future.</string>
<string name="271">Look, sit tight, okay? I&apos;ll see if I can find help for you.</string>
<string name="272">You stay here, yuh? Me come back later. Helps you?</string>
<string name="273">Uh, wha&apos; happen to you?</string>
<string name="274">I won&apos;t kill you. I promise.</string>
<string name="275">Do you know where I can find Urth?</string>
<string name="276">What came of Ander? Where is he now?</string>
<string name="277">Would you know where would I find Geth?</string>
<string name="278">Where is Karathis now?</string>
<string name="279">Where me is finding Urth now?</string>
<string name="280">Where Ander went? You says he make away.</string>
<string name="281">Where Geth be now? You know?</string>
<string name="282">Where Karathis be now?</string>
<string name="283">Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
<string name="284">We talk &apos;bout another thing.</string>
<string name="285">Grrrr. Get out of my cave... </string>
<string name="286">Yuck, this place smells horrible! I&apos;m going to get some fresh air, all right?</string>
<string name="287">Grrrr... I died when I became this - beast. This battle can only end my misery.</string>
<string name="288">Grrrr... silver? You&apos;re trying to kill me, aren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="289">I am Bran, from Port Llast - at one time normal, not afflicted with this... grrr... lycanthropic disease. Why don&apos;t you take your sneering self away from here?</string>
<string name="290">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; No one&apos;s called me handsome before... grrrr. Give me one of those charms, then. I ain&apos;t scared of it... </string>
<string name="291">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Exactly - I can&apos;t trust anyone. Grrrr... Now back off.</string>
<string name="292">Grrrr, you think I&apos;m scared of death... give me the charm, then, and I&apos;ll prove it to you.</string>
<string name="293">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Grrr... Neurik&apos;s been good to me since I was a baby, hasn&apos;t he... all right, give me one of those charms... </string>
<string name="294">Grrrrr... if you&apos;re looking for my ring, I don&apos;t have it.</string>
<string name="295">Some adventurers came by. They told me if I gave it to them, people would stop searching for me. I guess they lied.</string>
<string name="296">It - It worked, I can feel it. Thank you so much. Here, take my ring and bring it to Neurik so he knows I&apos;m all right!</string>
<string name="297">My adventuring ring? Grrrr. You mean you won&apos;t kill me if I just give it to you?</string>
<string name="298">Grrrr... take it back to Neurik, then, and tell him I&apos;m dead or cured or something. Just leave me and my cave alone, all right?</string>
<string name="299">Grrr... if you insist... </string>
<string name="300">The battle, of course, didn&apos;t fare as we expected. Karathis became a werewolf, or was killed. I don&apos;t know. Or care. The rest of us fled. Only Ander escaped becoming a werewolf.</string>
<string name="301">It - It worked, I can feel it! I never thought I would be normal again, but - you proved me wrong!</string>
<string name="302">I came out here on an expedition with Sir Karathis and some friends, Urth, Ander and Geth. We were hunting a - grrr - werewolf.</string>
<string name="303">Urth was running back to Port Llast. I tried to stop him, but - I just didn&apos;t want to see anyone from Port Llast hurt.</string>
<string name="304">Ander escaped, but I&apos;m not sure where he is. It is likely he returned to Port Llast. If I were healthy, that is where I would be.</string>
<string name="305">Geth? No... I don&apos;t know where he got to, if he managed to get anywhere that is.</string>
<string name="306">I don&apos;t know where Karathis is, but I would hunt him down if I did. He ruined my life. This isn&apos;t even a life. Not anymore.</string>
<string name="307">Please! I am myself again! Don&apos;t kill me!</string>
<string name="308">Grrr - Please! - Grrrrr - Can&apos;t control... Myself!</string>
<string name="309">I need to get out of this place.</string>
<string name="310">What did you want to talk about?</string>
<string name="311">Go away. We don&apos;t want you bringin&apos; trouble on this house.</string>
<string name="312">Don&apos;t you go near those stairs... </string>
<string name="313">Oh, Urth, there&apos;s someone coming up! You look - presentable, don&apos;t you my boy?</string>
<string name="314">If you want to blather at me, you&apos;d best do it from outside where I can&apos;t hear you.</string>
<string name="315">Thank you, good &lt;sir/madam&gt;! We treated you so poorly but you have been so kind... </string>
<string name="316">Our boy Urth is himself again! &apos;Tis like having him back from the very grave!</string>
<string name="317">You heard the missus. Now move on.</string>
<string name="318">They&apos;re rickety an&apos; - an&apos; it&apos;s a danger to climb them, you hear? </string>
<string name="319">Damn it, woman, grab yer weapon and pray we won&apos;t be needin&apos; it.</string>
<string name="320">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Actually, I could use another 100 gold.</string>
<string name="321">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Actually, I could use another 50 gold.</string>
<string name="322">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Actually, I could use another 25 gold.</string>
<string name="323">That&apos;s more than enough. May the gods bless you.</string>
<string name="324">Nice try. Give me everything you&apos;ve got or your precious boy gets it.</string>
<string name="325">Ooh, you too kind. You take care, yuh?</string>
<string name="326">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; But me need big heap more gold, yuh?</string>
<string name="327">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; But me need little pile more gold, yuh?</string>
<string name="328">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; But me need just teeny bit more gold, yuh?</string>
<string name="329">No, you give me big heap more gold or me kill Urth-boy!</string>
<string name="330">All right, then, nevermind.</string>
<string name="331">Oh. Uh, me go now, then... </string>
<string name="332">I&apos;m warning you - If you be lookin&apos; for our boy Urth, he ain&apos;t here.</string>
<string name="333">You&apos;ve done the three of us a fine favor, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, and I&apos;d like you to have somethin&apos; that&apos;s been in our family awhile.</string>
<string name="334">&apos;Twas my great grandfather&apos;s sickle, but it always seemed too beautiful to use for simple harvest work.</string>
<string name="335">A chest of 300 gold. &apos;Twas my inheritance but I&apos;ve been too scared to spend it. Now&apos;s as good a time to be rid of it as any.</string>
<string name="336">A chest of 150 gold. &apos;Twas part of my inheritance but I&apos;ve been too scared to spend it. Now&apos;s as good a time to be rid of it as any.</string>
<string name="337">May the winds be ever at your back, my friend.</string>
<string name="338">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Of course, good &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s not easy being an adventurer, as Urth learned almost too late.</string>
<string name="339">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Of what use are your deeds if we all starve over the winter? I&apos;m sorry, that&apos;s too much for me to give.</string>
<string name="340">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Of course, good &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s not easy being an adventurer, as Urth learned almost too late.</string>
<string name="341">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Of course, good &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s not easy being an adventurer, as Urth learned almost too late.</string>
<string name="342">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Of what use are your deeds if we all starve over the winter? I&apos;m sorry, that&apos;s too much for me to give.</string>
<string name="343">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Of what use are your deeds if we all starve over the winter? I&apos;m sorry, that&apos;s too much for me to give.</string>
<string name="344">Why, may the weather rot you, &lt;FullName&gt;! We&apos;ll starve the winter, rest assured, but here be your devil&apos;s gold.</string>
<string name="345">Aye, this has become a happy home again.</string>
<string name="346">Don&apos;t you hurt our boy!</string>
<string name="347">Get out of here, you dirty scoundrel.</string>
<string name="348">Who are you?</string>
<string name="349">I&apos;m here to kill you, Geth. Are you ready?</string>
<string name="350">I have silver charms - from Neurik.</string>
<string name="351">Me says you tell me your name.</string>
<string name="352">Me kills you, Geth. Now!</string>
<string name="353">Me gots silver charms. They works, yuh!</string>
<string name="354">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; If you want to change the future, you must do it yourself.</string>
<string name="355">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This charm comes from Neurik. It is safe.</string>
<string name="356">Take the charm, or I&apos;ll see you dead myself.</string>
<string name="357">I don&apos;t care. I&apos;m killing you now.</string>
<string name="358">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Neurik give charm. Is good!</string>
<string name="359">You gets charm, or me kills you!</string>
<string name="360">Grrr... me kills you now!</string>
<string name="361">What means you? Me not knowing.</string>
<string name="362">Huh? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="363">How did you become like this?</string>
<string name="364">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ve been sent to end the werewolf menace. If you give me your ring, I will leave and no one will come searching for you in the future.</string>
<string name="365">I&apos;ll try to find some help for you. Stay here.</string>
<string name="366">You stays here. Me goes to get help, then come back, okay?</string>
<string name="367">What makes you become werewolf?</string>
<string name="368">Do you know where I can find any of them?</string>
<string name="369">Where me find these people? You know.</string>
<string name="370">Excuse me. I will leave.</string>
<string name="371">Me sorry. Me go now.</string>
<string name="372">What are you doing here? Why have you come? I do not wish to be bothered.</string>
<string name="373">I am overjoyed. I am human again! Thank you, stranger, thank you. I am forever indebted!</string>
<string name="374">I do not fear death - not as a beast as I am now. If you come for death, then I shall make sure you have it.</string>
<string name="375">Silver? I might be despondent about my future, but I do not wish it prematurely ended, either.</string>
<string name="376">Geth - at one time a normal man, and not a horrific beast - who hails from Port Llast. Why do you care?</string>
<string name="377">I suppose you&apos;re right. If I sit here and do nothing, then nothing will change, right? Fine, give me your silver charm.</string>
<string name="378">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Karathis told me that I would be safe at his side, and look at me now. No, I think I&apos;ll pass on your offer.</string>
<string name="379">Well, if those are my choices, then I suppose I will take the charm. Death this way or death that way - what does it matter?</string>
<string name="380">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I felt a - flicker of hope. Could it be truth, then? Fine, give me the charm and we will see what happens.</string>
<string name="381">I should have known better. To think, I believed these intrusions would end with the gift of a ring.</string>
<string name="382">An adventurer visited me, and told me that if I gave up my ring these intrusions would end. Yet here you are, likely looking for that ring.</string>
<string name="383">I - am human again! Is this a joke? A dream that I will wake from? Let it be truth! Oh, take my ring, and bring it to Neurik.</string>
<string name="384">Fine, take it. I need it not. It will not change the course of my life.</string>
<string name="385">As if I have any interest in going elsewhere. But you wouldn&apos;t understand. Fine, farewell - just leave me alone.</string>
<string name="386">It sounded fun, but this is how it ended. Everyone ran. We all became werewolves except for Ander. As far as I know, he wasn&apos;t caught.</string>
<string name="387">Karathis brought me out here with some of my friends: Urth, Bran and Ander. He wanted us to help him kill a werewolf.</string>
<string name="388">No, I don&apos;t. And I grow weary of this conversation. Perhaps we can put it to an end, yes?</string>
<string name="389">Thank you... </string>
<string name="390">Stop hurting me! I will no longer attack you!</string>
<string name="391">Grrr - Please! - Grrrrr - Can&apos;t control... Myself!</string>
<string name="392">I really must go.</string>
<string name="393">I&apos;ve come to talk, nothing more.</string>
<string name="394">You failed the boys of Port Llast. Prepare to die.</string>
<string name="395">Neurik gave me these silver charms. I think I can help... </string>
<string name="396">Me talk, yuh? Dat all.</string>
<string name="397">Me kill you, wolfy... </string>
<string name="398">Wait, me help! Me have silver charm thingies from healer-man.</string>
<string name="399">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This is magic, representative of Tyr&apos;s justice.</string>
<string name="400">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; If it was normal silver, perhaps, but this bears Neurik&apos;s holy blessing.</string>
<string name="401">I offer you a choice, Karathis - Take it or I kill you.</string>
<string name="402">Enough about cures and poisons, then - let us fight as warriors!</string>
<string name="403">All right, no charm then... at least for now.</string>
<string name="404">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; But dis be blessed silver of da healer-priest.</string>
<string name="405">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; But dis be special silver - it from Neurik.</string>
<string name="406">You no take silver charm thingy, me kill you, yuh? So take it.</string>
<string name="407">Grrr, no more words, wolfy! We fight now.</string>
<string name="408">Uh, wha&apos; happen to you?</string>
<string name="409">Can you tell me what happened?</string>
<string name="410">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Help me fake your death and you can go free.</string>
<string name="411">Stay here, Sir Karathis. Perhaps I can help you yet.</string>
<string name="412">You stay here, yuh? Me come back later. Help you?</string>
<string name="413">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Seriously - I don&apos;t know what happened.</string>
<string name="414">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me really isn&apos;t knowing this.</string>
<string name="415">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you know the identity of the Black Wolf?</string>
<string name="416">You have come to put down the dread Sir Karathis, have you?</string>
<string name="417">Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I must return to my order and seek penance for taking on the shape of my enemy. Read my journal well and act upon it.</string>
<string name="418">If you come here out of honor, then let us fight with honor, for that I have not lost... </string>
<string name="419">You come to me with silver? Do you not remember that I was a werewolf hunter? That silver would be poison to me now.</string>
<string name="420">What do you want?!</string>
<string name="421">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Justice, you say? If it slays the wicked and cures the righteous, then I shall gladly use this charm. I know my heart! </string>
<string name="422">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Don&apos;t mock me with your lies... </string>
<string name="423">Then I shall use your filthy charm. I am a servant of my god, however, and it is by his hand that I shall make miracles of your base attempts!</string>
<string name="424">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Holy-charmed silver, is it? If it slays the wicked and cures the righteous, than I shall use this charm. I know my heart!</string>
<string name="425">Either kill me or cure me. It&apos;s the only way you&apos;ll ever know.</string>
<string name="426">With what? An army or a cure?</string>
<string name="427">There, that should be proof enough of my innocence. Take this journal I have penned and give it to Neurik. It tells the truth of what has happened.</string>
<string name="428">A deceiver made me what I am today! I may look like the Black Wolf, but I shan&apos;t become like him! Take your offers elsewhere.</string>
<string name="429">And would you believe me when I told the truth? Don&apos;t mark me for a fool.</string>
<string name="430">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmm... well, not to judge, but I do find that fairly believable coming from you. Fine, I will recount the sad tale.</string>
<string name="431">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; As believable as that sounds coming from you, I&apos;ll ask you to excuse me from your mockeries.</string>
<string name="432">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Though my mind rebels, my heart knows the better - you are being... sincere. Aren&apos;t you? Fine. I will recount the sad tale.</string>
<string name="433">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; As believable as that sounds coming from you, I&apos;ll ask you to excuse me from your mockeries.</string>
<string name="434">I have been hunting werewolves for most of my adventuring career, and was in fact knighted for this duty I have placed upon myself.</string>
<string name="435">But I was to face my greatest challenge with the Black Wolf. I brought four young men of Port Llast - Urth, Bran, Geth, and Ander - to help me.</string>
<string name="436">But with tragic irony, I was afflicted with lycanthropy, and I cursed them to the same in turn, all save the youngest, Ander. It has been a dark day ever since.</string>
<string name="437">I believe that I do, but I would keep that secret as my own - perhaps I might use it as a key to restore my humanity.</string>
<string name="438">I have regained control. You need no longer attack me!</string>
<string name="439">Grrr - Please! - Grrrrr - Can&apos;t control... Myself!</string>
<string name="440">I have no time to talk right now.</string>
<string name="441">Who are you? My name is &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="442">We must speak of the werewolves.</string>
<string name="443">Who you be? Me is &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="444">We gots to talk &apos;bout werewolves.</string>
<string name="445">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="446">Perhaps you need some assistance?</string>
<string name="447">I need some directions for town.</string>
<string name="448">Me cans helps you, maybe?</string>
<string name="449">Me needs directions in town.</string>
<string name="450">Can you point me in the direction of an inn?</string>
<string name="451">Is there a temple available?</string>
<string name="452">I&apos;ll need someplace to buy equipment.</string>
<string name="453">Let me ask about something else.</string>
<string name="454">Me need inn to go to.</string>
<string name="455">Me cannot find temple. Where one be?</string>
<string name="456">Me needs buy stuff like weapon and armor.</string>
<string name="457">Me think of different thing to ask.</string>
<string name="458">Tell me what you would have me do.</string>
<string name="459">Me not knowing what me is doing to help. You say now?</string>
<string name="460">Who is this Ander you mention?</string>
<string name="461">Where can I get the weapons to fight werewolves?</string>
<string name="462">I will do this for you.</string>
<string name="463">Me wonders who Ander is.</string>
<string name="464">Me need special weapons fighting werewolves, yeah?</string>
<string name="465">Me can do this.</string>
<string name="466">I have some more questions about this job.</string>
<string name="467">Me got some questions &apos;bout job.</string>
<string name="468">Who is this Ander you mention?</string>
<string name="469">Where can I get the weapons to fight werewolves?</string>
<string name="470">Where will I find these afflicted boys?</string>
<string name="471">Me wonders who Ander is.</string>
<string name="472">Me need special weapons fighting werewolves, yeah?</string>
<string name="473">Me not know where to start looking for werewolves.</string>
<string name="474">I&apos;ve some questions about the boys you wish cured.</string>
<string name="475">Me gots questions about boys you wants to cure.</string>
<string name="476">Remind me what you needed help with...</string>
<string name="477">You reminds me what job you was wanting me do, yuh?</string>
<string name="478">I found Urth. Here is his ring.</string>
<string name="479"></string>
<string name="480"></string>
<string name="481"></string>
<string name="482"></string>
<string name="483"></string>
<string name="484"></string>
<string name="485"></string>
<string name="486"></string>
<string name="487"></string>
<string name="488"></string>
<string name="489"></string>
<string name="490"></string>
<string name="491">What services does Tyr provide?</string>
<string name="492">Me wanting know what Tyr gives me.</string>
<string name="493">I&apos;d like to make a purchase from the temple.</string>
<string name="494">Me wants to buy stuff from temple.</string>
<string name="495">Can you tell me anything about Bran?</string>
<string name="496">What do you know of Geth?</string>
<string name="497">Where might I find Urth?</string>
<string name="498">Do you know where Sir Karathis is?</string>
<string name="499">Could I speak with his family?</string>
<string name="500">I know the true identity of the Black Wolf, Neurik. It is Alhelor.</string>
<string name="501">Me knows who Black Wolf be. It be Alhelor!</string>
<string name="502">I will do as you ask.</string>
<string name="503">Me will do as you asks.</string>
<string name="504">Will there be a reward for this task, too?</string>
<string name="505">Me can gets more gold, yeah?</string>
<string name="506">I cannot accept this job now.</string>
<string name="507">Me not take this job, no.</string>
<string name="508">What exactly am I to do, again?</string>
<string name="509">Me not remembers... what me to do, again?</string>
<string name="510">Alhelor is dead. I have his tooth, here.</string>
<string name="511">Me gots Alhelor tooth, yuh? He be dead.</string>
<string name="512">Alhelor yet lives, so far as I know.</string>
<string name="513">Alhelor still alive, so far as me knows.</string>
<string name="514">Thank you for this. Farewell.</string>
<string name="515">Bye bye. Thanks you, mister.</string>
<string name="516">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Port Llast can thank me better than this, aye?</string>
<string name="517">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Port Llast spends more to thank me than this, yuh?</string>
<string name="518">I killed Alhelor. Give me more gold, or you&apos;re next.</string>
<string name="519">Me wants more gold. Me can kills you next like Alhelor!</string>
<string name="520">I found Bran. Here is his ring.</string>
<string name="521">I found Geth. Here is his ring.</string>
<string name="522">I found all three of them. Here are their rings.</string>
<string name="523">Me finds all three. Here is rings for you.</string>
<string name="524">Me finds Urth. See, here his ring.</string>
<string name="525">Me finds Bran. See, here his ring.</string>
<string name="526">Me finds Geth. See, here his ring.</string>
<string name="527">Me looks for Bran. You know stuff?</string>
<string name="528">Me maybe gets clues for where Geth is?</string>
<string name="529">Where Urth be? You know?</string>
<string name="530">Where me should look for Sir Karathis, you think?</string>
<string name="531">I&apos;ve had some success in finding the boys, actually.</string>
<string name="532">Me finds out stuff about werewolf boys, yuh.</string>
<string name="533">Why must I use a magical portal to enter your temple?</string>
<string name="534">Let me ask about something else.</string>
<string name="535">Me can ask other thing now?</string>
<string name="536">Let&apos;s talk about something different.</string>
<string name="537">Me changes subject now, yuh?</string>
<string name="538">Let me ask about something else.</string>
<string name="539">Me ask different thing now.</string>
<string name="540">Let me ask about something different.</string>
<string name="541">Me asks different question instead, okay?</string>
<string name="542"></string>
<string name="543"></string>
<string name="544">I will find them for you.</string>
<string name="545">Me finds kids. Worry not!</string>
<string name="546"></string>
<string name="547"></string>
<string name="548">I&apos;ve not yet found Karathis or the Black Wolf.</string>
<string name="549">Me no find Karathis or Black Wolfie yet.</string>
<string name="550">Tell me more about Karathis and this Black Wolf.</string>
<string name="551">You tells me more &apos;bout Karathis and Black Wolf.</string>
<string name="552">What has been happening in Port Llast?</string>
<string name="553">What happens in town?</string>
<string name="554">Why me need use magic portal thing to enter temple?</string>
<string name="555">That makes sense.</string>
<string name="556">Oh. Okay.</string>
<string name="557">Welcome to the Tyrran Temple - tell me, are you here for Tyr&apos;s services, or perhaps the Lady Luck herself has guided you to us during these dark days?</string>
<string name="558">I see that luck has brought you back into the wings, and back to Tyr&apos;s services - perhaps to give us a second chance at asking for your help?</string>
<string name="559">It&apos;s a miracle of luck to have you returned to us. After losing brave Sir Karathis to the Black Wolf, we can&apos;t help but be overly concerned with your welfare. </string>
<string name="560">Welcome back, my &lt;brother/sister&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s my pleasure, as always, to welcome you to Tyr&apos;s temple, now that things are as they belong in Port Llast.</string>
<string name="561">Walk with luck gracing your every move, then. It&apos;s always a treasure to have this place graced by such capable heroes. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="562">A good day to you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. A very good day, indeed.</string>
<string name="563">Oh, pardon my manners, good &lt;brother/sister&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am Neurik, the priest in charge of this Tyrran temple for good Port Llast.</string>
<string name="564">And though it pains me to trouble you, I ask a favor of you if I might. As I alluded to, these are dark days. Days that call for a hero.</string>
<string name="565">A grim topic, though I find I can think of little else. Have you been successful?</string>
<string name="566">I believe I can help you find your way about the town, certainly.</string>
<string name="567">The Alliance Arms Inn is likely the best around. You can find it near the north gate into town.</string>
<string name="568">Well, funny that you should ask that, being as that we&apos;re in a temple. Sorry, it was a joke... ah, those who seek out Tyr&apos;s services are never turned aside.</string>
<string name="569">Then I suggest you take advantage of Haljal&apos;s wares at the Cracked Anvil. He takes great pride in the quality of his craftsmanship.</string>
<string name="570">Well... I&apos;m hesitant to suggest the task because of the danger involved, but it&apos;s very important. You can be certain that I&apos;ll compensate you for the risk, should that matter to you.</string>
<string name="571">I think you mean to say that... Well, far be it from me to correct you. I&apos;m... Oh, let me just answer your question.</string>
<string name="572">Let me tell you how this started. A short time ago, a foul beast settled into the area of the town. At first, few of us knew of its presence. Indeed, Port Llast has known few troubles for many years.</string>
<string name="573">Ander is a youth who goes out of his way to help others. They&apos;re so naive and trusting at that age... </string>
<string name="574">I have silver charms here which may yet drive the curse from their blood. You must subdue the beasts first, however, and convince them to use the charms... if you can. And then the Black Wolf, himself, must be dealt with. As I said... a terrible but vital task.</string>
<string name="575">Now, please, tell me that you&apos;ill follow through on this quest. Tell me that you&apos;ll find where the boys have gone and free them from the curse... however you are able.</string>
<string name="576">I hope that it will come to such bloodletting only as a last resort. These are innocent lads under a curse. There is a peddler who came to town after hearing of our plight... his name is Alhelor.</string>
<string name="577">You&apos;ll find him at the Alliance Arms Inn. He can provide you with silvered arrows, as well as access to some belladonna. But please, use them only if you must.</string>
<string name="578">You don&apos;t know how relieved I am here to hear that. Here, take the silver charms. Hopefully they can be used to cure all three boys and Sir Karathis, should he still live.</string>
<string name="579">Each of the boys wears a ring. They should give them up freely if cured. Bring them back to me, and then I&apos;ll know their situations are resolved.</string>
<string name="580">Those children - the town prays for them, we all do. I hope you will be their savior. And may Tyr be at your side.</string>
<string name="581">I&apos;m certain of it. What I&apos;ve told you would be much for anyone to absorb. What would you wish to know, &lt;brother/sister&gt;?</string>
<string name="582">Ander is a youth who goes out of his way to help others. They&apos;re so naive and trusting at that age... </string>
<string name="583">Please: tell me that you&apos;ll only use them as a last resort - these are real people, that can be saved, not mere beasts. But... not to tempt fate, you should speak with Alhelor.</string>
<string name="584">The four of them - Bran, Geth, Urth, and Sir Karathis - are scattered about, and usually only to be found at night. Finding them will be difficult.</string>
<string name="585">As I told you before, Port Llast is under siege by a foul werewolf known as the Black Wolf. He has corrupted our children, and a brave knight. We need your help.</string>
<string name="586">Praise be to Tyr, you have done very well, indeed! We are all indebted to you for this: the boy&apos;s curse ended without the loss of an innocent life.</string>
<string name="587"></string>
<string name="588"></string>
<string name="589">I am glad to hear that. I do not wish to detain you further. I will remain here in the case that you need the assistance of Tyr, or perhaps a helpful word or two.</string>
<string name="590"></string>
<string name="591"></string>
<string name="592"></string>
<string name="593">Of course, of course - do not let me keep you waiting. Tyr will wash his luck over you this day!</string>
<string name="594">Why, my &lt;brother/sister&gt;, I can tell you right now that all that you need can be provided to you by Tyr. Let me get into specifics.</string>
<string name="595">If you need anything that could be of use to one of the devoted order, well let me say right now, my &lt;brother/sister&gt;: you are in the right place.</string>
<string name="596">Karathis took with him four of Port Llast&apos;s younger lads to aid his task but, unfortunately, the Black Wolf was merciless. He overcame the knight and attacked the four boys... and only young Ander managed to return to us unharmed.</string>
<string name="597">I&apos;ve heard that he was last spotted in the Charwood area, though where, specifically, I could not say. Please don&apos;t let that dissuade you from looking. I&apos;m sure luck will be on your side.</string>
<string name="598">I know for fact that Geth traveled to the Neverwinter Wood. You know, he enjoyed being around people. I&apos;d look for campgrounds or villages within the woods. He&apos;s sure to be close by.</string>
<string name="599">Urth, I&apos;m afraid, could be anywhere. His family has been so very fearful for him and his whereabouts. To be unable to do something for their pain....</string>
<string name="600">Sir Karathis is a brave knight. Faced with his own corruption, I&apos;m sure he would flee to the ends of the world. Perhaps if you can save the children, they will know where he might be.</string>
<string name="601">Is there anything more about the boys you want to ask? I feel so helpless... perhaps I didn&apos;t know them as well as I would&apos;ve liked. If only I knew better where they might have gone...</string>
<string name="602">You&apos;ll find him at the Alliance Arms Inn. He can provide you with silvered arrows, as well as access to some belladonna. But please, use them only if you must.</string>
<string name="603">All the boys have now been accounted for. It is a relief to see that some measure of peace has been restored at last. Your heroism has served us well, &lt;brother/sister&gt;. Take this reward, and my thanks.</string>
<string name="604">Here is your reward, as promised. Unfortunately there are still the other children who must be found quickly. Might you have news of them, as well?</string>
<string name="605">Yes, of course, the Eisenfeldts. Their farm is on the south end of Port Llast. Perhaps something they say will assist your search.</string>
<string name="606">Do you speak truly? Alhelor? But he - if that is the case, I... almost cannot bring myself to say this. But, he needs to be... destroyed. The curse of the Black Wolf must be ended so it will never be spread to innocents again.</string>
<string name="607">I wish I need not ask it of you, but would you seek out Alhelor and do what must be done? Please, &lt;brother/sister&gt;... do this and bring me his tooth so that I will know once and for all that the danger is over.</string>
<string name="608">I see. The curse has taken the life of the young lad, has it? Sad though the loss might be, you have done what was asked of you and cannot be faulted. We are all grateful.</string>
<string name="609">I wish you would say otherwise, though it is wrong for me to do so... should you change your mind I&apos;ll be here, and so will your reward. I hope you&apos;ll reconsider.</string>
<string name="610">I know I can trust you. Your efforts have been... far beyond anything we could have hoped for. End it quickly, &lt;brother/sister&gt;. Let Tyr guide your hand in the name of justice.</string>
<string name="611">It goes without saying that I would reward you for the task... but only if you return with a tooth of the beast. I must be sure that the deed is done.</string>
<string name="612"></string>
<string name="613">&lt;Brother/Sister&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt; - how... how do things progress? Is Alhelor - the Black Wolf - dead? I don&apos;t think a single soul within Port Llast has stopped to take breath.</string>
<string name="614">I can only hope that your appearance here suggests that you have heard our pleading, and that you intend to end Alhelor where we could not. Tell me, is my hope proven true?</string>
<string name="615">Putting an end to all this... to this curse that has plagued us in the form of the Black Wolf. I do not know why this creature has chosen to live amongst us as Alhelor, but his evil must be stopped.</string>
<string name="616">How many have died, or had their lives destroyed because of him? Geth, Bran, Urth... as well as the noble knight, Sir Karathis. I will permit this to go no further... find Alhelor and end his life, I beg you!</string>
<string name="617">It has been a dark day for Port Llast, but you have reminded us that the sun rises yet again. For the champion of Port Llast, here is a token of our gratitude.</string>
<string name="618">I know I don&apos;t have to worry about your success with this; you&apos;re a strong and noble &lt;man/woman&gt;. Find Alhelor and bring me his tooth... I am eager to see this grim tale done with.</string>
<string name="619">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh? Ah... of course, of course. Here, I had some gold bundled aside, but it would be better spent going into your pockets. Forgive us for withholding this paltry sum.</string>
<string name="620">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The people of Port Llast can only give so much. To ask more of them would be... please, be content with what you have.</string>
<string name="621">Port Llast is indebted to you &lt;brother/sister&gt; &lt;FirstName&gt; - our brave champion. Travel safely, and know that our thoughts are with you on this journey of yours.</string>
<string name="622">Here, take this. It is something I had bundled aside for other purposes. Don&apos;t argue, just take it and be appeased. We would not anger our brave champion.</string>
<string name="623">A shining, valued member of the community is now lost to us; our thoughts must be with Bran at his passing. Still, do not let our sadness affect your resolve. You&apos;ve done well.</string>
<string name="624">It&apos;s always sad to see someone part from this world, especially when that someone, Geth, was such a fine young man. The world will be safer for your heroism, however.</string>
<string name="625">Oh! The children&apos;s blood has stained these rings. They are... dead? Forgive me if I... thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;... you have done only as you were told.</string>
<string name="626">It&apos;s said that if but one life can be spared, then we have all been touched with luck. Port Llast will give its love to young Urth, both in remembrance, and to honor your deeds.</string>
<string name="627">It&apos;s said that if but one life can be spared, then we have all been touched with luck. Port Llast will give it&apos;s love to young Geth, both in remembrance, and to honor your deeds.</string>
<string name="628">It&apos;s said that if but one life can be spared, then we have all been touched with luck. Port Llast will give it&apos;s love to young Bran, both in remembrance, and to honor your deeds.</string>
<string name="629">Any day that is touched with death must be a sad one, as it is for Urth. Truly, however. we are blessed to have witnessed two lives kept from that same death by your able hands.</string>
<string name="630">Any day that is touched with death must be a sad one, as it is for Bran. Truly, however. we are blessed to have witnessed two lives kept from that same death by your able hands.</string>
<string name="631">Any day that is touched with death must be a sad one, as it is for Geth. Truly, however. we are blessed to have witnessed two lives kept from that same death by your able hands.</string>
<string name="632">What wondrous luck has been shown to Port Llast! What a wondrous hero to come to our aid! You have survived, and brought the children from death with you!</string>
<string name="633">You needn&apos;t worry about Bran. His situation has already been handled. I thought you might have known that already... </string>
<string name="634">Thankfully, Geth&apos;s situation is one that has already been resolved. You need not spend your time worrying about his matter any further.</string>
<string name="635">Urth has, mercifully, already been taken care of. You&apos;ll not have to spend any time looking into his situation.</string>
<string name="636"></string>
<string name="637">The trouble was from no pack of wolves, however... it came from a creature much more powerful and cunning: a werewolf. The famous hunter, Sir Karathis, was sent for with orders to slay this &quot;Black Wolf&quot; as we came to call it.</string>
<string name="638"></string>
<string name="639"></string>
<string name="640">Or perhaps you need assistance before you can attempt this daunting task. If there is anything Tyr can do to assist our brave champion, you need only let me know.</string>
<string name="641"></string>
<string name="642">Truly! I had little doubt that you would do well. Oh, Port Llast is lucky indeed to have you in its midst.</string>
<string name="643">According to Ander, the three other boys were wounded but had managed to flee. I fear that this means the curse of the werewolf will have been passed onto them. If the boys are not found and cured or... or killed... we could very well be facing even more danger than from the Black Wolf alone.</string>
<string name="644">If you care to speak with him, you&apos;ll find him at the Alliance Arms Inn. Mind, however, that he&apos;s probably still shaken up from his experiences.</string>
<string name="645">If you care to speak with him, you&apos;ll find him at the Alliance Arms Inn. Mind, however, that he&apos;s probably still shaken up from his experiences.</string>
<string name="646">Praise be to Tyr! You have done very well, indeed. We are all indebted to you for this: a life restored and a threat pushed aside.</string>
<string name="647">Praise be to Tyr! You have done very well, indeed. We are all indebted to you for this: a life restored and a threat pushed aside.</string>
<string name="648">If only all of this were over with. Sir Karathis remains at large... as does the Black Wolf, himself. The task yet remains to track them both, &lt;brother/sister&gt;. You will, of course, be rewarded once again when that is done, I assure you.</string>
<string name="649">Slowly, however, we became aware. Several of our citizens disappeared without any trace... and always on the night of a full moon. Wolf prints were found, the howling was constant... we thought the town besieged.</string>
<string name="650">If you need curative scrolls or potions of different sorts, they are the steel of the finest priests...</string>
<string name="651">And though it pains me to trouble you with my persistence, persist I must if I am to find a hero. Have you considered what we spoke of earlier? Of how you might be of assistance to us?</string>
<string name="652">My &lt;brother/sister&gt;, you&apos;ve returned! You have been more successful, already, than we have right to hope for, but hope we do. Now, what word do you bring?</string>
<string name="653"></string>
<string name="654">Have you a need, then, my &lt;brother/sister&gt;? I shall help however I am able.</string>
<string name="655"></string>
<string name="656"></string>
<string name="657"></string>
<string name="658">My &lt;brother/sister&gt;! Word has come to us that you have found the knight, Sir Karathis. Tell me, how did this meeting go? What have you learned?</string>
<string name="659">Port Llast is seeing its mysteries resolved - the werewolf forms of Urth, Bran, and Geth are no longer. But still - there&apos;s no news on Karathis or the Black Wolf. Is there anything you know, my &lt;brother/sister&gt;?</string>
<string name="660">I have no fear that you will do well in this endeavour. Time might not be on our side, but luck is. I know it.</string>
<string name="661">Allow me to explain this to you in better detail, my &lt;brother/sister&gt;. Karathis is the brave knight who sought to slay the Black Wolf, a fierce werewolf who was the bane of Port Llast.</string>
<string name="662">Sir Karathis brought along several of the local young men to aid in his quest, but they were all defeated and afflicted with the werewolf&apos;s curse. Only Ander escaped this fate and fled home to spread its news.</string>
<string name="663">Fortunately, the curse that has afflicted the lads has finally been ended. There has still been no word of Sir Karathis or the Black Wolf, however. Where either might be found I have little idea.</string>
<string name="664">If you find out anything at all, my &lt;brother/sister&gt;, bring the news to me and we will go forward from there.</string>
<string name="665">Truly, I speak this story gladly! Why, Port Llast has recently been graced with the most glorious of luck in this regard. Unfortunately, the story begins in tragedy.</string>
<string name="666">The scourge of Port Llast, the fierce werewolf known only as the Black Wolf, was hunted down by brave Sir Karathis and several of the local young men.</string>
<string name="667">Though their adventure turned sour with all but Ander transformed into werewolves, new heroes came and saved the day, as it were.</string>
<string name="668">The youths found their werewolf forms destroyed, as did Sir Karathis. In the end, Port Llast&apos;s own Alhelor was unmasked as the Black Wolf!</string>
<string name="669">Luckily, Alhelor, the &quot;Black Wolf,&quot; was slain, bringing Port Llast to peace once more. I tell you, my &lt;brother/sister&gt;, luck has been on our side!</string>
<string name="670">I know it may seem strange to you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, but the temple within Port Llast was actually destroyed during the Time of Troubles, when the gods themselves walked the face of Faerun.</string>
<string name="671">We had retreated to a cave far from the town, hidden well enough that we could carry on our Lord Tyr&apos;s orders in safety. For our efforts he blessed us with the portal that still connects us to the town and consecrated this new place.</string>
<string name="672">We are no longer in danger in Port Llast, of course, but this hidden temple still serves us well. At the very least it is a safe haven should trouble ever arise again.</string>
<string name="673">Why all this deceit, &quot;Black Wolf?&quot; What was in it for you?</string>
<string name="674">Trickery! Prepare to die, Black Wolf!</string>
<string name="675">Care to barter for your life, betrayer?</string>
<string name="676">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; If you&apos;re the Black Wolf, why did you run that store?</string>
<string name="677">Black Wolf is big liar! How come?</string>
<string name="678">Me no kill you. We make deal, yuh?</string>
<string name="679">You die now, Black Wolf!</string>
<string name="680">That sounds fair.</string>
<string name="681">Sorry, I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="682">Yuh, that sound good.</string>
<string name="683">Ha! Me change mind, wolfy... </string>
<string name="684">Can I buy some anti-lycanthropic goods from you?</string>
<string name="685">Me wants buying some anti - um... anti... goods.</string>
<string name="686">I would like to ask you a few questions.</string>
<string name="687">Me wants ask some stuff, yeah.</string>
<string name="688">Anti-lycanthropic goods? Is that what you sell here?</string>
<string name="689">What means you an-ti-ly-can... um... ? You sell that?</string>
<string name="690">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="691">Why are you so dedicated to eradicating werewolves?</string>
<string name="692">Why you want all werewolves slain?</string>
<string name="693">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; But why would you focus on werewolves alone?</string>
<string name="694">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;d know if your goods worked well with a free sample.</string>
<string name="695">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me gets one free, see if goods is okay?</string>
<string name="696">Have you any jobs that I might perform?</string>
<string name="697">Me wonders if you can hire me for stuff.</string>
<string name="698">Perhaps you could help me with directions.</string>
<string name="699">Me is needing for directions to place.</string>
<string name="700">Do you know of any rumors in town?</string>
<string name="701">You listens for rumors? </string>
<string name="702">Can I ask about that expedition? About Sir Karathis?</string>
<string name="703">Me wants knowing about Ander and werewolf and Sir Karathis.</string>
<string name="704">Neurik sent me here to get some equipment.</string>
<string name="705">Me comes from Neurik to get wolfies.</string>
<string name="706">Let me ask about something different.</string>
<string name="707">Me wants asking different thing.</string>
<string name="708">Can you remind me of this?</string>
<string name="709">Me needs remembering again.</string>
<string name="710">Tell me what you know of this Black Wolf.</string>
<string name="711">What you knows about Blacks Wolf?</string>
<string name="712">Don&apos;t worry, young Ander, this will work out yet. Everything happens for a reason, it does.</string>
<string name="713">Thanks so much for helping me, Alhelor.</string>
<string name="714">Alhelor, Port Llast&apos;s only Anti-Lycanthropic Merchant, at your service! Come one, come all - defend yourself against the legend of the Black Wolf! Ha!</string>
<string name="715">Mind the place, will you Ander? I am an old man, grown tired, and I should go home to catch my rest.</string>
<string name="716">You have a keen nose to have tracked me here. I suppose I should welcome you to my den... </string>
<string name="717">I am heading home for a bite to eat. Feel free to join me if you wish.</string>
<string name="718">It was required to throw the trail away from me. A stranger, come from out of town to offer assistance? What better disguise than this? Plus it gave me the chance to develop a slow resistance to wolfbane.</string>
<string name="719">We wolves are predators. It was simply time to hunt the hunter and pin my crimes upon my prey. I had played possum with Karathis long enough... </string>
<string name="720">You show cunning. I like that... a simple tooth to prove my death and we both walk out of here alive?</string>
<string name="721">As always, it is a pleasure doing business with you.</string>
<string name="722">More questions, then? Curiosity killed the cat, remember... </string>
<string name="723">I am an old and cunning wolf, my friend - not one to die so easily.</string>
<string name="724">Ah, the questions of fools. Do you not realize who you face?</string>
<string name="725">Craft but no conscience, will but no wit... You are an interesting one, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="726">If you have come to prove the death of the Black Wolf, I have already lost one tooth to the cause and do not care to lose another.</string>
<string name="727">Why, yes. The best that you&apos;ll find for slaying werewolves, such as the Black Wolf. The more werewolves that are slain, the closer we come to realizing their eradication.</string>
<string name="728">Anti-lycanthropic. That just means that my goods will put an end to any werewolf that you come across... Like the mighty Black Wolf, for instance.</string>
<string name="729">Why shouldn&apos;t I be? Are they not destructive, unnatural beasts? Do they not corrupt human beings with their disease? This Black Wolf, alone, has been a terrible scourge to Port Llast.</string>
<string name="730">Need I explain my every action to you? These creatures are formidable beasts... and the common people must be armed to fight them! Making a profit is the least of my worries.</string>
<string name="731">Beyond that, you don&apos;t need to know, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I have given you my reason, and now you will give me my peace.</string>
<string name="732">Of course, let me show you what I have.</string>
<string name="733">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; There&apos;s no reason for you to doubt the quality of my goods but, if it pleases you, take this. I guarantee you&apos;ll be back for more.</string>
<string name="734">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry, but this is a business and my reputation is impeccable. If you&apos;re going to hunt werewolves, you&apos;ll need to buy the supplies.</string>
<string name="735">Yes, of course. But let us not take up too much time with talk, for business has been quite strong, lately. Everyone&apos;s worried about the Black Wolf!</string>
<string name="736">Truly, there&apos;s a rumor alive within these very walls. We&apos;ve the young Ander, here. He and his band traveled out with the brave fool Sir Karathis to slay the Black Wolf.</string>
<string name="737">But of that expedition, only Ander here lives to tell the tale. The rest are cursed to howl forever at the moon!</string>
<string name="738">You would be better off asking young Ander. He could tell you first-hand what I could only collect from discussions.</string>
<string name="739">Ah, good of Neurik that. You can never be too prepared when going up against werewolves. Would you like to buy something?</string>
<string name="740">Aside from that which I have already told you of regarding the werewolves and young Ander here? No, nothing new.</string>
<string name="741">Jobs are scare to come by. I have enough work for myself and Ander, here, but little else to dole out to those in need. For that, I am sorry.</string>
<string name="742"></string>
<string name="743">I have not lived within Port Llast for very long... I came here only once I heard the tales of the Black Wolf, after all.</string>
<string name="744">Perhaps young Ander can help you find what you need, yes?</string>
<string name="745">Yes, and farewell to you. Keep to yourself and you&apos;ll be safer for it.</string>
<string name="746">Ahhh, now that is a story, indeed. The Black Wolf is a legend in these parts: a powerful werewolf who has been about for many years, stealing children and slaying lone travelers.</string>
<string name="747">He is a legend no longer, however. Ander, here, is the sole survivor of a band of hunters who encountered the Black Wolf in the flesh... and lost!</string>
<string name="748">I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="749">Me is wanting ask questions from you.</string>
<string name="750">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="751">Why did Karathis insist on going in alone?</string>
<string name="752">Do you know where the others might be?</string>
<string name="753">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; What can you tell me of Alhelor?</string>
<string name="754">What&apos;s going on in Port Llast?</string>
<string name="755">Why Karathis go in first without friends?</string>
<string name="756">Me looks for other boys.</string>
<string name="757">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me talks with Alhelor. What you knows?</string>
<string name="758">What stuff happen in Port Llast?</string>
<string name="759">Why did Karathis need your help then?</string>
<string name="760">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Are you sure the beast was Karathis?</string>
<string name="761">Why Karathis wants you and friends coming?</string>
<string name="762">You know where Urth could be?</string>
<string name="763">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;Ask where the werewolf&apos;s den is.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="764">How about Bran? Where would he go?</string>
<string name="765">What did he say?</string>
<string name="766">What says he to you?</string>
<string name="767">Can you tell me about your experience with the Black Wolf?</string>
<string name="768">Me wants to know what happen &apos;tween Black Wolf and you.</string>
<string name="769">Let me ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="770">Me changes subject, ask other stuffs.</string>
<string name="771">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="772">Can me gets told where places is?</string>
<string name="773">I need to find a temple.</string>
<string name="774">Is there someplace I can buy equipment?</string>
<string name="775">Me wants temple.</string>
<string name="776">Me runs low on supplies. Me can buy?</string>
<string name="777">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="778">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="779">Maybe you can tell me where to look for Geth?</string>
<string name="780">What about Sir Karathis? Where would he be?</string>
<string name="781">I spoke with Neurik. He said I should see you.</string>
<string name="782">Me gets told by Neurik to talks with you.</string>
<string name="783">Who is Alhelor?</string>
<string name="784">Who this Alhelor?</string>
<string name="785">Neurik? Alhelor? Sleeping troubles? Did I miss something?</string>
<string name="786">Neurik? Alhelor? Sleeping troubles? Me not understand.</string>
<string name="787"></string>
<string name="788"></string>
<string name="789">Who are you?</string>
<string name="790">Who you be?</string>
<string name="791">Where was the Black Wolf&apos;s cave again?</string>
<string name="792">Me ask where Black Wolf cave is, yuh?</string>
<string name="793">You knows where Urth is?</string>
<string name="794">Maybe Bran? Where he be?</string>
<string name="795">Um... Geth? You know where is?</string>
<string name="796">Me looks for Sir Karathis? Where he go?</string>
<string name="797">Hello, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Is there something the matter? Did you have something to ask of me?</string>
<string name="798">You know, it wasn&apos;t really a bother to talk to you. Enjoy Port Llast, stranger. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="799">I hope you enjoy your time in Port Llast. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="800">Oh well. Bye, stranger.</string>
<string name="801"></string>
<string name="802">I guess so. What did you want to ask?</string>
<string name="803">He was too worried about us, and he thought it was his duty. I don&apos;t think I could have gone in alone, or even with him. I don&apos;t think I could ever go back to that cave, either.</string>
<string name="804">You mean Urth, Bran and Geth? I know places that they liked to go before - I haven&apos;t been able to look yet... I want to, but I... can&apos;t.</string>
<string name="805">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The only thing I can think is something he said right after I got back from the cave. It wasn&apos;t bad, just seemed out of place.</string>
<string name="806">Um... I don&apos;t know. The stuff with the Black Wolf has got everyone talking, I guess.</string>
<string name="807">He said he would keep me safe from werewolves so long as I helped him to sell his stuff. I don&apos;t think it means anything, though.</string>
<string name="808">Was there anything else?</string>
<string name="809">He was afraid that the Black Wolf would try to escape. He wanted us to keep it from running away... we didn&apos;t know what to do when he went in and came out a beast... </string>
<string name="810">I&apos;m sorry if - did you need something else?</string>
<string name="811">I - I think it was. It was dressed up like Karathis, and even looked like him in the face. He looks like he was in pain, and confused... </string>
<string name="812">I&apos;m not sure that I&apos;ll ever forget that image for so long as I live... </string>
<string name="813">His family might know. I want to ask them myself, but... I&apos;m too ashamed to speak to them. I don&apos;t know what happened to Urth, and I think they likely hate me.</string>
<string name="814">Did you... want to ask about something else?</string>
<string name="815">Go north toward Luskan until you reach the Green Griffon Inn. The den is nearby, due east of it in fact.</string>
<string name="816">I&apos;ll never forget that location for the rest of my life, and I likely will never visit it again, either.</string>
<string name="817">Not long after we set up camp, Karathis came out but as a werewolf. I was so scared! I can still see his face so clearly... I couldn&apos;t help but run. We all ran. I&apos;m the only one that... got away. The rest are probably beasts now, too. Or dead.</string>
<string name="818">What are you trying to find?</string>
<string name="819">All right. What did you want to ask?</string>
<string name="820">Are you looking to find something within Port Llast? I pretty much know where everything is. I&apos;ve lived here all my life.</string>
<string name="821">Tyr&apos;s temple is in the northwest side of town, not too far from the northern gates.</string>
<string name="822">We have the Cracked Anvil which sells equipment. You can find it just down the road, almost directly east of this inn.</string>
<string name="823">I... I suppose there&apos;s no harm in talking about it, if Neurik says it&apos;s okay. He said that I should try to forget about it... stop thinking about it so much. I don&apos;t know. I try. Sometimes I feel kind of normal, and then - </string>
<string name="824">Karathis wanted some help, so me and some friends volunteered: Bran, Geth, and Urth. We didn&apos;t think there was any real wolf, anyway, and Karathis&apos; coin was good. Together, we... began the hunt for the Black Wolf.</string>
<string name="825">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I really don&apos;t like to talk to people behind their backs. I&apos;m sorry. But Alhelor is a nice guy. He&apos;s been supportive of me.</string>
<string name="826">Bran liked the mysteriousness of Charwood. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he&apos;s there now. If you find him, tell him I said hello... that I&apos;m still thinkin&apos; about him.</string>
<string name="827">Geth was the one that talked me into doing this... he always dragged me out to the Neverwinter Wood and we&apos;d pretend we were heroes. Maybe he went there.</string>
<string name="828">I guess you could look at that werewolf&apos;s den? I don&apos;t really know. He wasn&apos;t from around here, so he might have left for anywhere.</string>
<string name="829">Oh. He said it was okay to tell you about the Black Wolf, I guess? Do you want to hear about that, then?</string>
<string name="830">If you&apos;re looking for Alhelor, he went home to get some rest. Maybe I could answer a question for you?</string>
<string name="831">It&apos;s finally over. Neurik says that Alhelor is dead, but I know I&apos;ll still have trouble falling asleep at night. Did you want me for something?</string>
<string name="832">Oh, I&apos;m sorry. He&apos;s a peddler... he&apos;s usually here, but he said he was tired and went home early. He lives near the pond of water at the town&apos;s center. It&apos;s a fairly small house. Modest, you know?</string>
<string name="833">Maybe you can stop in tomorrow? We sell the best collection of werewolf remedies around. Well, we&apos;re the only ones selling stuff like that... but we&apos;re the best!</string>
<string name="834">Oh, I&apos;m sorry. I thought... oh, nevermind. It&apos;s a long story and it&apos;s all wrapped up now. Needless to say, we won&apos;t have to worry about werewolves any more around here now that Alhelor&apos;s gone.</string>
<string name="835">Not long after we set up camp, Karathis came out but as a werewolf now. I was so scared! Even now I can see his face so clearly. I couldn&apos;t help but run. We all ran. But only I...</string>
<string name="836">I&apos;m sorry... it&apos;s hard to think back on... the others, Karathis... how they became werewolves. But they were all cured, at least. Alhelor, of all people, was the Black Wolf. I trusted him!</string>
<string name="837">But now he&apos;s dead. I just don&apos;t know anymore... the people of Port Llast have been nice, but I just need time, I guess, to get over everything.</string>
<string name="838">Not long after we set up camp, Karathis came out, but as a werewolf. I was so scared! Even now I can see his face so clearly. I couldn&apos;t help but run. We all ran. But only I...</string>
<string name="839">I&apos;m sorry... it&apos;s hard to think back on... the others, Karathis... how they became werewolves. They were all cured, at least. And now we can only hope that the Black Wolf doesn&apos;t strike back in anger.</string>
<string name="840">Maybe Alhelor would know more. He ran this &quot;werewolf-killing&quot; shop, but he was tired and went home early today. He lives on the west side of town, in the smaller home north of the river.</string>
<string name="841">I heard that Bran was cured already. I wanted to talked to him about it, I still do... I just... </string>
<string name="842">Geth was in the Neverwinter Wood. I&apos;m not sure where he is now. Either way, it&apos;s okay because he&apos;s been cured already. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve heard, anyway.</string>
<string name="843">I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t mean to waste your time with this, but Urth has been cured already.</string>
<string name="844">My name is Ander, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I help Alhelor here when he has need of it.</string>
<string name="845">You don&apos;t remember me? Oh, maybe not... my name is Ander and I help Alhelor sell his werewolf remedies.</string>
<string name="846">My name&apos;s Ander. I had no idea Alhelor was really the Black Wolf all that time... how evil! Thankfully he&apos;s gone, now and it&apos;s all over.</string>
<string name="847">And he does a fine job of it, too. You just talk to me if you need anything to fight a werewolf like the one that shook up ol&apos; Ander here.</string>
<string name="848">We found wolf tracks and followed them to a cave. Karathis went in while we set up camp. It&apos;s just outside of Luskan, that cave... in the hills east of the Green Griffon.</string>
<string name="849">It was a cave just outside of Luskan, in the hills east of the Green Griffon.</string>
<string name="850">All I can see are those eyes looking out from the cave, and there&apos;s that feeling of knowing something is wrong - total fear. Anyway... Karathis was a werewolf hunter, and he came here to hunt the Black Wolf! That&apos;s what we call Port Llast&apos;s werewolf.</string>
<string name="851">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Back off... somehow I think that you intend to claim my findings as your own.</string>
<string name="852">I am, and proud of it.</string>
<string name="853">Aribeth? Yeah!</string>
<string name="854">And you are... ?</string>
<string name="855">Who you?</string>
<string name="856">What have you uncovered?</string>
<string name="857">I don&apos;t want to talk to you.</string>
<string name="858">Go &apos;way.</string>
<string name="859">What&apos;s happening around here?</string>
<string name="860">Why don&apos;t you join me?</string>
<string name="861">Leave me be, stranger.</string>
<string name="862">What happen in town?</string>
<string name="863">Me no talk to you.</string>
<string name="864">You join me, Darktongue?</string>
<string name="865">Where do you suspect that cult is based?</string>
<string name="866">Where you think cult is?</string>
<string name="867">So what makes you think that the cult is involved?</string>
<string name="868">What you finds out?</string>
<string name="869">Why you think cult involved?</string>
<string name="870">I&apos;ll be sure to check it out.</string>
<string name="871">Me go see what happenin&apos;.</string>
<string name="872">I have another question.</string>
<string name="873">Me gots other question.</string>
<string name="874">I have nothing to tell you.</string>
<string name="875">Me got nothin&apos; to tell.</string>
<string name="876">I suspect that the cult may be based in Luskan.</string>
<string name="877">Me thinks cult in Luskan.</string>
<string name="878">I have explored the caves that you mentioned. There was a cult member there who was stirring up trouble.</string>
<string name="879">Me look at caves you talk about. There cult guy there. He cause trouble.</string>
<string name="880">You there! Any progress? If only this knee o&apos; mine weren&apos;t banged, I&apos;d be out wit&apos; ye!</string>
<string name="881">Now then &lt;boy/girl&gt;, no need to get sassy. I&apos;m just stirring up leads, as you should be... touchy, ain&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="882">Heh. Time to go to Luskan: A hero&apos;s welcome and not a drop of sweat to get &apos;er... </string>
<string name="883">This ain&apos;t personal, friend, but it&apos;s the end just the same. It&apos;s time ol&apos; Darktongue got hisself some glory... let&apos;s finish it!</string>
<string name="884">That&apos;s all of them, aye.</string>
<string name="885">Oy! You there... you&apos;re from Neverwinter, ain&apos;t ye? Working for Aribeth?</string>
<string name="886">I thought so, you &apos;ad the cure for Wailing all sewed up! Sure, I should have expected you!</string>
<string name="887">I thought so, though the stories did not mention you were... special.</string>
<string name="888">Name&apos;s Darktongue. Darktongue Breakbone. I&apos;ve been out here since you cured the Wailing, looking for signs a&apos; where it came from.</string>
<string name="889">I heard what you been told, I&apos;m sure... there were a cult behind the plague an&apos; they be somewhere in the North. I ain&apos;t sure where, exactly, but I have me suspicions.</string>
<string name="890">Long as I&apos;ve been recuperatin&apos; here, with me ale, that lad Ander across the Inn won&apos;t let up with his wolf-man talk. He&apos;s daft, y&apos;see. Thinks there&apos;s wolf-men all around.</string>
<string name="891">Join ye? Well that&apos;s a right flatterin&apos; offer. But with this bum knee o&apos; mine I&apos;m laid up a while. Tell you what, though: I&apos;m always happy to share information. If ye find anything, tell me all about it. Two heads&apos;re better than one, eh?</string>
<string name="892">I ain&apos;t dabblin&apos; in local gossip! I&apos;m here for the quest, you hear?</string>
<string name="893">As you will.</string>
<string name="894">Along the North Road and I&apos;ll tell you why. There&apos;s a network of caves up there, used to be a few goblins there but now there are hundreds and worse things as well.</string>
<string name="895">I went up there to check it out myself. Seems like there&apos;s orcs, bugbears, and goblins crawling all over the hills. </string>
<string name="896">That&apos;s how I got me knee hurt, too. Bastard goblins ambushed me before I could find out what was going on.</string>
<string name="897">Two reasons. First, the beasts started to gather just when the plague hit Neverwinter. Second, there was a man leading the goblins who attacked me. That ain&apos;t a typical thing.</string>
<string name="898">Maybe the man was a cultist. Maybe not. Either way, my gut is tellin&apos; me that the picture ain&apos;t right.</string>
<string name="899">What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="900">Listen, then. If you find anything, you tell me. Two heads are better than one and all that. We adventurers need to stick together to find those bastards and punish &apos;em! Best o&apos; luck to you! I wish my knee was healed up so I could come with!</string>
<string name="901">Well, keep at it. We need to punish the ones who unleashed the plague on poor Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="902">Luskan, eh? Hmm, I&apos;ll have to think about that. You get back to your searchin&apos; friend. Luskan... </string>
<string name="903">Just as I thought! See, you gotta trust ol&apos; Darktongue. I&apos;ll send you down the right path every time. Did you find where the cult was based?</string>
<string name="904">I should shtick you with a shtake &apos;n shee if you&apos;re a werewolf... or ish that for mummys? (sigh) I need another beer.</string>
<string name="905">Ma alwaysh told me that being an adventurer wash a foolish game. Look at you - you sheem fit to keel over. (hic) Whoa! Almosht losht my balance.</string>
<string name="906">I shaid, a shailor&apos;s life is the life for me - ho eyo he hum, ho eye he hum.</string>
<string name="907">You know, don&apos;t be taking thish the wrong way, but people like you and me were made for the sailor&apos;s life. I&apos;m telling you. No thinking required, if you - (hic) - catch my drift.</string>
<string name="908">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; What gem are you talking about?</string>
<string name="909">Make you beautiful? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="910">I have something that might make you beautiful again.</string>
<string name="911">I&apos;m looking for some missing druids.</string>
<string name="912">I have other things I need to do.</string>
<string name="913">Make you purty? What you mean?</string>
<string name="914">Me look for missin&apos; folk.</string>
<string name="915">Me have somethin&apos; to make you purty, yuh?</string>
<string name="916">Uh, yuh, me go now.</string>
<string name="917">No, a potion of nymph&apos;s tears.</string>
<string name="918">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; No, a magic mirror. Anyone who peers into it is made beautiful.</string>
<string name="919">Sorry, I was mistaken, Setara.</string>
<string name="920">No, me have potion of purtiness for you.</string>
<string name="921">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; No, me have magic mirror. It make you purty, see?</string>
<string name="922">Uh, me goof up. Sorry.</string>
<string name="923">Setara, you had mentioned a gem.</string>
<string name="924">Setara, I&apos;m still looking for those druids.</string>
<string name="925">All right, take care of yourself.</string>
<string name="926">Uh, you talk &apos;bout gem... </string>
<string name="927">Uh, me still look for missin&apos; folk.</string>
<string name="928">Me go if that okay.</string>
<string name="929">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Shed a tear? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="930">Yes, yes, Setara has a gem, it needs a scepter, yes? But no, you&apos;ll not have it until you make Setara beautiful again, yes, only then, yes?</string>
<string name="931">Yes, it&apos;s ruby red like lips, it is, yes. It belongs to a scepter, yes, that sends its wielder home, yes? Very valuable to those who know its worth.</string>
<string name="932">But you&apos;ll not have it until Setara has her beauty back, yes?</string>
<string name="933">Yes, Setara was a pretty lass once, before the world made white her hair and rough her skin and more sharp her features, yes.</string>
<string name="934">Yes, Setara has two confined, entwined. They were so beautiful, Setara had to study them, savor what she&apos;s lost, yes? Yes... </string>
<string name="935">But you&apos;ll not have them until Setara has her beauty back, yes?</string>
<string name="936">Yes? Something for Setara the Forest Witch? Is it flowers, yes?</string>
<string name="937">Yes, you would do that for Setara? Yes, yes, so much better than flowers, yes? Yes, Setara drinks it now.</string>
<string name="938">Yes, it happens. I can feel it, I can feel beauty! Setara is a simple forest girl again, no more a witch, heehee!</string>
<string name="939">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes, yes, it&apos;s true. So much better than flowers. I look into it and I see Setara the forest girl again!</string>
<string name="940">No more witch, no more dying skin, nor more warts and moles and hair on my lip. Oh my mirror, my precious mirror, heehee!</string>
<string name="941">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes, Setara sees through your looking glass lies! There is punishment for those who deceive the Forest Witch, yes? </string>
<string name="942">Yes, yes, you toy with Setara, you play games with her dreams, yes? The Forest Witch has survived the cruelties before.</string>
<string name="943">Yes, yes, you toy with Setara, you play games with her dreams, yes? The Forest Witch has survived the cruelties before.</string>
<string name="944">Setara is pretty, so pretty, nevermore a Forest Witch, never ever anymore.</string>
<string name="945">Yes, a gem, it&apos;s so pretty, so pretty, nevermore a Forest Witch... Take it, leave Setara to her prettiness.</string>
<string name="946">Yes, they were pretty too but not so pretty as Setara, nevermore a Forest Witch, never ever anymore... There, their door is open now, yes?</string>
<string name="947">Setara is pretty, so pretty, nevermore a Forest Witch, never ever anymore.</string>
<string name="948">Oh, for a tear shed for us, perhaps we&apos;d be pretty again.</string>
<string name="949">A tear, from a beautiful creature... Yes, we like the nymph very much. For her to cry for us, we&apos;d be well-represented again.</string>
<string name="950">Actually, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?</string>
<string name="951">All right, lout, go on up to her room.</string>
<string name="952">Uh, me have questions for you.</string>
<string name="953">Okay, you go then, yuh?</string>
<string name="954">What&apos;s the biggest orc you&apos;ve ever seen?</string>
<string name="955">How many quarts are in a gallon?</string>
<string name="956">What&apos;s your name? I never caught it.</string>
<string name="957">Umm... Oh! Why is water blue, yuh?</string>
<string name="958">Uh... Yuh, how long do dragons live?</string>
<string name="959">Duh, what your name, anyway?</string>
<string name="960">Shove off. Me talkin&apos; to lady, yuh?</string>
<string name="961">Why they always water down me ale?</string>
<string name="962">Huh, you tink she like me?</string>
<string name="963">Yuh, tanks.</string>
<string name="964">Okay, but make it fast, yuh? Me have girly-girl to see.</string>
<string name="965">Uh... Me no know... Look, me in hurry, yuh?</string>
<string name="966">That&apos;s it, go away. You just wastes me time.</string>
<string name="967">Greedy thief!</string>
<string name="968">Yeah, I&apos;ve been killing orcs all day long.</string>
<string name="969">Look, m&apos;lady, I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m not worthy of your interest.</string>
<string name="970">Are you trying to pick me up? That&apos;s so pathetic!</string>
<string name="971">Yuh. Me kill orcs all day. Big army.</string>
<string name="972">Look, me too stupid for you. Me sorry.</string>
<string name="973">Haha! You so desperate, it funny!</string>
<string name="974">Maybe later.</string>
<string name="975">Me go now, yuh?</string>
<string name="976">You mean more orcs, right?</string>
<string name="977">Huh, more orcs?</string>
<string name="978">That might be nice... Your room or mine?</string>
<string name="979">Oh, me see what you doing now. You want romp, yuh?</string>
<string name="980">Hard day?</string>
<string name="981">Yuh. Me kill orcs all day. Big army.</string>
<string name="982">Interested in a hard night?</string>
<string name="983">Huh, more orcs?</string>
<string name="984">If you&apos;d like... </string>
<string name="985">Uh, me need more ale, first... Gimme a moment.</string>
<string name="986">Oh, me see what you doing now! You want romp, yuh?</string>
<string name="987">Wench, get this man his ale.</string>
<string name="988">The gods made you smart, did they?</string>
<string name="989">Come up to my room, then, and waste your wit on me there.</string>
<string name="990">Yuh. Yuh, me do that.</string>
<string name="991">Someone stole my Onyx gem last night.</string>
<string name="992">I assure you, Madam, we run a very safe establishment.</string>
<string name="993">I&apos;m checking out and you won&apos;t have my business again.</string>
<string name="994">Yes, Miss Zamithra. If there&apos;s anything else we can... ah, forget it. I didn&apos;t like her anyway.</string>
<string name="995">Hi handsome... Hard day?</string>
<string name="996">Interested in a hard night?</string>
<string name="997">If you&apos;d like... </string>
<string name="998">Come up to my room, then, and waste your wit on me there. I&apos;ll leave the door unlocked.</string>
<string name="999">The gods made you smart, did they?</string>
<string name="1000">You know what, chump? You&apos;re right. Why waste my time?</string>
<string name="1001">Did you hear that, my women? This man&apos;s all mouth and no metal... Rise up and brawl, women! Rise up and brawl!</string>
<string name="1002">I&apos;m on the prowl, &lt;man/woman&gt;. Stay out of the way.</string>
<string name="1003">Keep your hands where they belong, &lt;Lad/Lass&gt;... </string>
<string name="1004">Thieves and robbers! How dare you rob me of my things!</string>
<string name="1005">I&apos;m not in the mood for talk right now. Perhaps later.</string>
<string name="1006">What can I purchase here?</string>
<string name="1007">Let me see what I can buy.</string>
<string name="1008">I have some questions about the surrounding region.</string>
<string name="1009">You sell stuff, yuh? What me can get?</string>
<string name="1010">Me buy stuff now. Me can see?</string>
<string name="1011">Me not want buy right now. Me got question &apos;bout region.</string>
<string name="1012">I&apos;ve got what I need. See you around, Haljal.</string>
<string name="1013">Have you heard any news from Charwood?</string>
<string name="1014">Have you heard any news from the Neverwinter Wood?</string>
<string name="1015">Have you heard any news from Luskan?</string>
<string name="1016">What you hear from Char-wood?</string>
<string name="1017">What you hear from Neverwinter Wood?</string>
<string name="1018">What you hear from Luss-kan?</string>
<string name="1019">Uh... me go now.</string>
<string name="1020">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Know someone who might have gone there recently?</string>
<string name="1021">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Can&apos;t you just tell me without mentioning names?</string>
<string name="1022">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You tells me. Not says merchant name, yuh?</string>
<string name="1023">Welcome to the Cracked Anvil. I&apos;m Haljal Throndor, and I reckon you&apos;re here to dither and bargain me right out of business, aren&apos;t ye, stranger?</string>
<string name="1024">Well, our selection of goods run the gamut, being as that we&apos;re the general store for the good town of Port Llast. As well, my smith over there can show you a wider selection of weapons if you wish. Why don&apos;t you take a look yourself?</string>
<string name="1025">Not a problem, mate. Not a problem at all. If you want to see a wider selection of arms and armor than those that I have here, be sure to check with my smith. </string>
<string name="1026">Uh... okay! Moving right along!</string>
<string name="1027">Sometimes I hear stories about an area, sometimes I don&apos;t. Though when I do, it&apos;s usually about a place like the Neverwinter Wood, Charwood, or even Luskan sometimes.</string>
<string name="1028">Oh, of course, of course. Well, we won&apos;t talk about buying and selling for a moment then, all right?</string>
<string name="1029">Be stopping back again, good &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Your business is always welcome.</string>
<string name="1030">Aye, see you around, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="1031">Yes, yes. Be off with you. Another time, another time.</string>
<string name="1032">Aye, the place has always been strange but some adventurers came through recently with a tale that was stranger yet.</string>
<string name="1033">From the sounds of it, all those souls have been put to rest now, one way or another.</string>
<string name="1034">To be true, there hasn&apos;t been much coming from Charwood in quite some time. Perhaps it&apos;s for the better, too. I hear tell it&apos;s a spooky place.</string>
<string name="1035">Apparently the townsfolk have been but phantoms for some time now, all reliving some past horror.</string>
<string name="1036">An adventuring group stopped by to re-equip and mentioned that someone had poisoned the Spirit of the Wood out that way.</string>
<string name="1037">Not a peep coming out of them woods, so far as I were to say, though I haven&apos;t spoken with many who&apos;d been through there.</string>
<string name="1038">They didn&apos;t say how the trouble got resolved, just that it&apos;s all been dealt with one way or another.</string>
<string name="1039">Aye - word is that there were a great conflict betwixt the High Captains therein, and much disruption to the trade routes.</string>
<string name="1040">With the gates to the city sealed, there&apos;s not much word to be had, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="1041">Some adventurer or another were for traveling within the securities of the High Captains, and ended it with bloodshed.</string>
<string name="1042">&apos;Course, there still be word of a Host Tower of Arcane that need be looked into there in Luskan. Perhaps some work for ye?</string>
<string name="1043">A brave hero like yourself might be finding a way to exploit that situation to his own benefit, and resolve the problems therein at the time.</string>
<string name="1044">Actually, Ballard goes out that way now and then. You might want to talk to him. He&apos;s in the northwest section of Port Llast. You&apos;ll find him in a small grove of trees.</string>
<string name="1045">Well, I heard word from a merchant friend about... well, what am I saying? I wouldn&apos;t want to get my friend in trouble, repeating tales meant for my ears alone.
</string>
<string name="1046">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ah. Well... I guess so. I guess I can tell ye. Ye be a trustworthy sort, right?</string>
<string name="1047">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry, but my friend is one I cannot risk hurting. Not for a situation such as this would be, at any rate.</string>
<string name="1048">Aye. Word is that there were a great conflict betwixt the High Captains therein, and much disruption to the trade routes.</string>
<string name="1049">What would you give me to spare your life?</string>
<string name="1050">I&apos;ve made a decision. It&apos;s time to die.</string>
<string name="1051">I have no interest in this anymore. I&apos;m leaving.</string>
<string name="1052">What you give me if me let you live?</string>
<string name="1053">No thanks. Me here to kill you.</string>
<string name="1054">Uh, me go now.</string>
<string name="1055">That sounds like a deal.</string>
<string name="1056">Yuh, okay. Fair deal, then.</string>
<string name="1057">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1058">Me not know who you is.</string>
<string name="1059">No deals. I&apos;m here for your death.</string>
<string name="1060">Me not here for talk, but for death. Your death!</string>
<string name="1061">What&apos;s this about bounty hunters?</string>
<string name="1062">Delilah! You criminal. Me hear about you. </string>
<string name="1063">Delilah! You&apos;re one of the escaped convicts I&apos;ve been told about.</string>
<string name="1064">Me not knows what means by bounty hunter.</string>
<string name="1065">Fine. Tell me of your efforts.</string>
<string name="1066">Okay. Me listens. You talk.</string>
<string name="1067">I&apos;ll let you go if you make it worthwhile to me.</string>
<string name="1068">Me could let you go if me gets something.</string>
<string name="1069">Sounds like you understand. Now, let&apos;s fight.</string>
<string name="1070">Me thinks you got it. We fight now?</string>
<string name="1071">No. I want the truth, or I kill you.</string>
<string name="1072">Me hears full story, or me kills you.</string>
<string name="1073">Uh, yeah... okay. I&apos;ll leave you alone.</string>
<string name="1074">Me not care. Me leave. You stay living.</string>
<string name="1075">I cannot let you leave until I know the full story.</string>
<string name="1076">Me wants hearing full story!</string>
<string name="1077">Your past? Freedom? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="1078">You&apos;re free now. How did you manage to escape?</string>
<string name="1079">You free now. How you escape?</string>
<string name="1080">I think I&apos;ve heard enough, convict. Time to die.</string>
<string name="1081">Me hears enough, criminals. You die now.</string>
<string name="1082">Who were the other inmates?</string>
<string name="1083">Go on.</string>
<string name="1084">Me want to hear more.</string>
<string name="1085">You&apos;re nothing but a common criminal. Time for you to die.</string>
<string name="1086">You criminal. You die now. </string>
<string name="1087">Who were other inmates? Please tell me.</string>
<string name="1088">I&apos;ve heard enough of this. Time to die. </string>
<string name="1089">Hmm... me hears enough. Time to die. </string>
<string name="1090">What you means of past and freedom?</string>
<string name="1091">I&apos;m not here to talk. It&apos;s time for you to die.</string>
<string name="1092">Me not want talking. You die now.</string>
<string name="1093">I&apos;m done talking. It&apos;s time for you to die.</string>
<string name="1094">Me done talking. You die now!</string>
<string name="1095">What are you getting at?</string>
<string name="1096">What you mean?</string>
<string name="1097">Well it has been a long time, and you&apos;re definitely not sore on the eyes. </string>
<string name="1098">It has been long time. You are pretty girl. </string>
<string name="1099">What do you want me to do?</string>
<string name="1100">What you want me do?</string>
<string name="1101">Okay.</string>
<string name="1102">All right! All right. I surrender! Let us... stop this fight. I... cannot win.</string>
<string name="1103">You&apos;ve beaten me. I cannot defeat you, try as I might - though fighting you was not my desire. And now I would only ask that you show mercy and let me leave, defeated.</string>
<string name="1104">One thing that I can give you is knowledge. Surely, I am not the only criminal whom you have an interest in. I know where Wyven is headed.</string>
<string name="1105">If I let you have it, you can collect and still fulfill your sense of duty. I&apos;ll miss my ear, but not the damned prison tattoo.</string>
<string name="1106">All right. One swift cut of the blade and - Augh!... </string>
<string name="1107">As for... Wyvern... Yesgar told me... that he grew up in the Neverwinter Wood. Says the animals there... will protect him.</string>
<string name="1108">Now, if you don&apos;t mind... I&apos;ve got some bleeding to staunch.</string>
<string name="1109">Fine, I see I will never have any rest from the likes of you. Come at me, then, and end this!</string>
<string name="1110">You would... just leave? I don&apos;t even know what to say. Somehow, &quot;thank you&quot; doesn&apos;t seem fitting to me. Perhaps &quot;farewell&quot; will do the trick.</string>
<string name="1111">An intruder! Die, fool!</string>
<string name="1112">Haha! Oh my, all of this fighting and you don&apos;t even have a reason to kill me. And here I thought you were a bounty hunter.</string>
<string name="1113">Then again, perhaps you are. Either way, my name is Delilah. I&apos;d say it&apos;s a pleasure to make your acquaintance, but I&apos;m sure you understand the truth.</string>
<string name="1114">So you know about me. It appears that, try as I might, I cannot escape my past and I will never have freedom.</string>
<string name="1115">Truly, you do not know? Well, far be it from me to tip my hand too early! And rightly said, I wouldn&apos;t worry over it if I were you.</string>
<string name="1116">Do you even know who I am? Do you even care? No, I can see that you don&apos;t. Come at me, then, and end this!</string>
<string name="1117">Are you serious? Will you not even allow me the chance to explain myself? Will you not even allow me the chance to live on?</string>
<string name="1118">Do you understand the effort it has taken for me to get to this point, to have lived even this long? And you would come and slay me with no consideration?</string>
<string name="1119">Now, whatever the reasons that brought about our conflict, let us put them to the side and continue on our merry way. Sound fair?</string>
<string name="1120">Well, that seems rather blunt. But who am I to quibble? And who knows? Perhaps you&apos;ll see my story delivered to a bard, if you aren&apos;t one yourself.</string>
<string name="1121">I was locked away in prison many years ago. I will not defend my past, and yes, I understand what I did was despicable.</string>
<string name="1122">Not that I really cared. I did it, it helped me to get by... So I escaped prison.</string>
<string name="1123">Perhaps, if I could, I&apos;d go back to my old life, perhaps I&apos;d start over anew. To me, it matters little. Just to be free from that prison, so I thought, would be the difference.</string>
<string name="1124">Truly, you are a curious one. You seek to know every detail, it seems! </string>
<string name="1125">In prison I met up with some other inmates. A half-breed led them by the name of Yesgar. Like me, they were looking for a way out.</string>
<string name="1126">The others were named Stirge, Zor, and the prissy Wyvern. We all had our tasks. I was to deal with the guards. </string>
<string name="1127">We all escaped without a hitch. We escaped the most secure prison in all of Waterdeep! Even if you decide to kill me where I stand, I will be remembered for that. </string>
<string name="1128">Surely by now you can have no further questions. So tell me, have you made a decision as to what you will do with me?</string>
<string name="1129">You won&apos;t find me so easy to kill!</string>
<string name="1130">Perhaps you feel a kinship with me sister. It often seems like this is a man&apos;s world. No matter, let me continue with my story. </string>
<string name="1131">Perhaps there is something else you desire about me, besides my pretty little head. No matter, let me continue with my story. </string>
<string name="1132">You must be weary from all your travels. There are certain skills I possess that you might find quite invigorating. </string>
<string name="1133">Come now, you know what I&apos;m getting at. We&apos;re already here in my bedroom... </string>
<string name="1134">I knew you&apos;d come around. There&apos;s nothing stopping us, we could start right now. </string>
<string name="1135">Here, let me help you get out of all your gear.</string>
<string name="1136">Now it&apos;s time for some fun. </string>
<string name="1137">But not the kind that you expected fool! Now you die!</string>
<string name="1138">Another thing is the bounty on my head. I&apos;m sure that the bounty notices specify that only my ear needs to be brought back. </string>
<string name="1139">Haven&apos;t you caused me enough trouble?</string>
<string name="1140">Sign up for what?</string>
<string name="1141">I&apos;m not here to apprentice for anything.</string>
<string name="1142">Bite your tongue, old man.</string>
<string name="1143">Are you sure? I&apos;d really like to sign up.</string>
<string name="1144">Er... signs for what?</string>
<string name="1145">Me not here to apprentice.</string>
<string name="1146">You bites tongue, old man!</string>
<string name="1147">Is you sure? Me really wants to sign up.</string>
<string name="1148">What kind of guild is this?</string>
<string name="1149">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1150">I&apos;d like to ask some questions.</string>
<string name="1151">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="1152">I&apos;ll be going.</string>
<string name="1153">Who you?</string>
<string name="1154">You says this place is guild?</string>
<string name="1155">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="1156">Me need directions.</string>

<string name="1159">Pleased to meet you. My name is &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>

<string name="1161">Me &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1162">Me be pleased to meet you. Me name &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="1163">You no needs know who me is.</string>
<string name="1164">What&apos;s the problem?</string>
<string name="1165">If the reward&apos;s right.</string>
<string name="1166">No, I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="1167">What is problem?</string>
<string name="1168">If me gets coin enough, sure.</string>
<string name="1169">No, me have no interest.</string>
<string name="1170">Can you train me?</string>
<string name="1171">Do you sell arms and armor, then?</string>
<string name="1172">Can I hire one of your mercenaries?</string>
<string name="1173">Let me ask you something else.</string>
<string name="1174">You train me maybe?</string>
<string name="1175">You sells weapons and stuff?</string>
<string name="1176">Can me hires a mercenary from you?</string>

<string name="1195">I have some questions about the bounties.</string>

<string name="1204">No, not interested.</string>

<string name="1225">Thank you, that would be fine.</string>
<string name="1226">Me okays with that.</string>
<string name="1227">I was glad to rid the world of the vermin. I need no reward.</string>
<string name="1228">Me happy to kills bad guy. Me need nothin&apos; for it.</string>
<string name="1229">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Surely the town&apos;s safety is worth more than that.</string>
<string name="1230">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Town safe, now. That&apos;s worth more golds, maybe?</string>
<string name="1231">Add more gold to that, or loose convicts will be the least of your problems... </string>
<string name="1232">You adds more gold, or me be worse than bad guys!</string>
<string name="1233">No, not yet.</string>
<string name="1234">Not yet me don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="1235">Not yet, no.</string>
<string name="1236">Me no find them yet, no.</string>
<string name="1237">What bounties are you talking about?</string>
<string name="1238">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1239">Who you?</string>
<string name="1240">Uh... me know of no bounties.</string>
<string name="1241">Why don&apos;t you and your men get her back?</string>
<string name="1242">Do you know where she&apos;s being held?</string>
<string name="1243">And what might my reward be for doing that?</string>
<string name="1244">Very well. I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="1245">No. Not interested.</string>
<string name="1246">Why you and soldier guys not go gets her?</string>
<string name="1247">You knows where daughter is?</string>
<string name="1248">What I gets if me saves her?</string>
<string name="1249">What about bounties? Me has ear.</string>
<string name="1250">Okay, me do it.</string>
<string name="1251">No. Me have no interest.</string>
<string name="1252">Tell me what happened again.</string>
<string name="1253">Where do I find her?</string>
<string name="1254">I&apos;m sorry, Kendrack... but Shaldrissa died. I tried my best.</string>
<string name="1255">No, she&apos;s dead. Them&apos;s the breaks.</string>
<string name="1256">I&apos;ll go look for her now.</string>
<string name="1257">Find her yourself. I have other problems.</string>
<string name="1258">You tells me what happen again.</string>
<string name="1259">Where does me find her?</string>
<string name="1260">Me sorry, Kendrack... but Shaldrissa dead. Me try hard.</string>
<string name="1261">Nope, she dead. Is bad luck, me guesses.</string>
<string name="1262">Me go looks for her now.</string>
<string name="1263">You finds her. Me have big problems of me own.</string>
<string name="1264">Eh? I suppose you&apos;re here to sign up, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, are ye? I&apos;ve no time for a new apprentice, however, so off ye go.</string>
<string name="1265">For the bloody mercenary guild, of course. Isn&apos;t that why ye&apos;ve come? Hmmm... unless ye&apos;re not here for training.</string>
<string name="1266">Hah! Ye&apos;ve got a bit o&apos; venom, I&apos;ll grant ye that. It won&apos;t get ye into the guild any quicker, though.</string>
<string name="1267">Aye? Young wits like yerself who want t&apos; join the guild are a copper fer a dozen, these days... though ye does looks in good shape, there.</string>
<string name="1268">Nay? Then what&apos;s a young wit like yerself come to the guild for? Ye on official business?</string>
<string name="1269">Aye, aye... but I&apos;ve enough lackwits about to fill the guild&apos;s roster, I don&apos;t need another. Hmmm... though ye do look in fine enough shape fer it.</string>
<string name="1270">Wait... now I&apos;ve placed ye. Ye&apos;re one o&apos; the folk who came with the Lady Aribeth, aren&apos;t ye? From Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="1271">My apologies, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. We get so many strangers comin&apos; through town these days, after all. Something I can do for ye?</string>
<string name="1272">Me name be Kendrack, head of the guild, here, and mayor of Port Llast. Also known as the First Captain. Yer name be, then... ?</string>
<string name="1273">This be the mercenary guild. Here I train fighters to hone their skills, and we see to hiring them out.</string>
<string name="1274">Aye, I&apos;m sure I can tell ye what ye need to know.</string>
<string name="1275">I know Port Llast well. Ask away.</string>
<string name="1276">Aye, goodbye.</string>
<string name="1277">Farewell to ye, then.</string>
<string name="1278">I wish ye the best o&apos; luck on yer quest, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="1279">Aye. Ye does know what a guild is, I hope? I train mercenaries here, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, an&apos; then we see that they gets hired out.</string>
<string name="1280">Aye, I think I recall the Lady mentioning ye now. She said ye be a hero, in fact... which makes me doubly glad ye&apos;re here.</string>
<string name="1281">Aye... the Lady mentioned ye. She said ye be a hero... though I find that a bit hard t&apos; imagine. I be glad ye&apos;re here, however.</string>
<string name="1282">The mysterious type, are ye? No need... I seem to recall the Lady mentioning ye. A hero, she said, an&apos; perhaps I should be glad ye&apos;re here.</string>
<string name="1283">Mayhap not, friend, but I seem to recall the Lady mentioning ye. A hero, she said. I be doubly glad to meet ye, then.</string>
<string name="1284">I have a problem someone competent like yerself might be able to help with... an&apos; there&apos;s coin in it for ye, to boot. Might ye be interested?</string>
<string name="1285">In such a short time, it would benefit ye little, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. An&apos; besides, as I already said, the guild be full.</string>
<string name="1286">Nay. If ye wishes such, go an&apos; speak to Haljal at the Cracked Anvil. He would have all ye need, I assure ye.</string>
<string name="1287">Aye, if ye wish. Ye would need to speak to them yerself, however. They decide for themselves an&apos; sets their own prices, after all.</string>
<string name="1288">Aye, of course.</string>
<string name="1289">Aye. The Alliance Arms is a fine inn, and ye&apos;ll find other adventurers like yerself there, this time o&apos; year.</string>
<string name="1290">Haljal at the Cracked Anvil should have just about everything ye need, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="1291">The only temple in town is Tyr&apos;s, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Your Lady Aribeth be there, as is Father Neurik.</string>
<string name="1292">Aye, if ye wish. Them Cloakwizards have built an enclave here... &apos;tis a strange place, but Eltoora caters to wizardly folk.</string>
<string name="1293">There be one off in the Neverwinter Wood, aye. Ye may wish to speak to Ballard about it... ye&apos;ll find him at his little grove just outside o&apos; town.</string>
<string name="1294">Take the road north, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. They say the gates be closed tight due to the sickness in Neverwinter, however... an&apos; they&apos;ll not let ye in.</string>
<string name="1295">Do ye need t&apos; find something else?</string>
<string name="1296">Only that it be over, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. A mighty relief that news was, as well... folk were terrified that the plague would spread to town.</string>
<string name="1297">Aye, we be getting reports of all kinds o&apos; strangeness in the region. Monsters rampagin&apos;, bandits traveling about at will, that sort o&apos; thing.</string>
<string name="1298">It is most strange. I suppose maybe it&apos;s to be expected, though... neither Neverwinter nor Luskan has the manpower for patrols right now, aye?</string>
<string name="1299">If ye&apos;re askin&apos; about odd things in Port Llast, hmmm... maybe ye should speak to Nuirek at the temple. I hear the cleric has grave worries as o&apos; late.</string>
<string name="1300">That be too bad. &apos;Tis a bit of a worry for me that I&apos;d like t&apos; see resolved soon. Let me know if ye change yer mind, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="1301">I received word from Waterdeep not long ago that a group o&apos; criminals escaped from the Bulwark prison. Dangerous bunch, killers all.</string>
<string name="1302">According to the word, the group be split up to avoid capture... but all of them be in this region. That makes me nervous, it does.</string>
<string name="1303">Each o&apos; them has a sizeable bounty for their left ear, marked with the seal of the Bulwark, to prove that they be dead.</string>
<string name="1304">&apos;Tis too dangerous a task to set me own men to it... but perhaps ye might be up to the challenge. What does ye think, &lt;lad/lass&gt;?</string>
<string name="1305">There be five criminals escaped, and a bounty of 300 gold pieces exists for each of them.</string>
<string name="1306">Not all be men, in fact... but all be quite deadly. If ye finds them, be careful. At least they be separated, now, and not all together.</string>
<string name="1307">Aye. They be not wanted alive, any longer. The seal of the prison on their ear identifies them... and it be easier than carryin&apos; the body.</string>
<string name="1308">T&apos;is a relief to hear that, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. If left free an&apos; alive, these criminals would become a problem, I am sure. I hope ye finds them all.</string>
<string name="1309">The five be named as follows: Zor, the Stirge, Wyvern, Delilah and Yesgar.</string>
<string name="1310">I&apos;m sure ye do. What do ye need t&apos; know?</string>
<string name="1311">Zor be a minotaur, so he should stick out wherever he goes. He be strong and a fierce warrior... but is a wee bit simple in the head.</string>
<string name="1312">I am told that he has many friends still in Luskan. It may be that he will be there, or at least attempting to enter the city.</string>
<string name="1313">The Stirge be a strange one. A gnome thief, it is said, who believes himself t&apos; be the smartest man alive.</string>
<string name="1314">The gnome were sighted last in the wildlands along the South Road, though he could be anywhere there.</string>
<string name="1315">The Wyvern is an elven man, a renowned bandit who is familiar with the ways of the wood. He be deceptive and cunning, and skilled with the bow.</string>
<string name="1316">The elf has not been sighted, but I have little doubt he be hidden within the Neverwinter Wood. Best search for him there.</string>
<string name="1317">A female halfling who is known to be cruel and wicked. She be an assassin who comes out of Luskan.</string>
<string name="1318">I hear the city be closed up tight, however, so I doubt she&apos;ll be there. Last word I have of that one is that she was spotted east of town, and then all but vanished.</string>
<string name="1319">Yesgar be a fierce half-orc murderer, and it were he that masterminded the escape of all of these criminals.</string>
<string name="1320">Of all the ones that have escaped, &apos;tis Yesgar who has remained the most elusive. I have not a clue where he might be... though he will not stray far.</string>
<string name="1321">Aye? Ye found one of the convicts? Which ear do ye have there?</string>
<string name="1322">Aye. &apos;Tis indeed the markings that the men of the Bulwark told me of. Congratulations, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, ye&apos;ve done a service fer us all.</string>
<string name="1323">I&apos;d be pleased to offer ye the bounty for it, then.</string>
<string name="1324">Ye&apos;ve certainly earned it. Have ye any o&apos; the other ears?</string>
<string name="1325">Well, I hope ye finds them bastards soon. Something else I can do for ye, &lt;lad/lass&gt;?</string>
<string name="1326">That is... very commendable of ye, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I see the Lady&apos;s tale of yer heroism is no fable. I will pass along word t&apos; the Bulwark... ye has our sincere thanks.</string>
<string name="1327">Might ye have another of them ears in yer pack?</string>
<string name="1328">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Ye be right. Me coffers be small, but I will add what I can for yer reward... ye did earn it.</string>
<string name="1329">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Aye, I wish I could, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. The gold the Bulwark sent to me is all I can spare, however.</string>
<string name="1330">Don&apos;t ye even be thinkin&apos; of threatenin&apos; me here, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I&apos;ll add a bit onto the bounty because ye deserved it... but don&apos;t ye start any trouble.</string>
<string name="1331">Aye, &lt;lad/lass&gt;? Something I can do for ye? Has ye business with the guild?</string>
<string name="1332">&apos;Tis good to see ye again, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Have ye had any luck tracking down the bounties?</string>
<string name="1333">Greetings. Ye&apos;re one o&apos; the heroes Lady Aribeth brought here along with &lt;CUSTOM1007&gt;, aye? Have ye had any luck with the bounties?</string>
<string name="1334">Ah... I would have assumed that &lt;CUSTOM1007&gt; would have told ye about it. Are ye not together?</string>
<string name="1335">I received word from Waterdeep not long ago that a group o&apos; five criminals escaped from the Bulwark prison. They be called Zor, the Stirge, Wyvern, Delilah and Yesgar. Dangerous bunch, killers all.</string>
<string name="1336">According to the word, the group be split up to avoid capture... but all of them be in this region. &lt;CUSTOM1007&gt; agreed to hunt them.</string>
<string name="1337">&apos;Tis a fair bounty for their left ears, proof o&apos; their death. If ye has questions about it, I can certainly answer them.</string>
<string name="1338">My name be Kendrack, head o&apos; the guild, here, an&apos; head of the town. Mayor, if ye will. &apos;Tis I who told &lt;CUSTOM1007&gt; of the bounties.</string>
<string name="1339">Thank the gods you&apos;ve come! While ye were gone from Port Llast, that fiend of a half-orc, Yesgar, kidnapped my Shaldrissa!</string>
<string name="1340">He demanded a ransom for her return, and it was paid! But still he did not return her! Please, I beg of ye... get my Shaldrissa back! She is my only child!</string>
<string name="1341">I... I could not endanger my daughter, and I would not trust me men to do it, if the truth be told. You, however, are a powerful &lt;man/woman&gt; who has done so much... I would trust you. You may be her only hope!</string>
<string name="1342">Aye, I do. The old Port Llast mines are to the north o&apos; town, near the Green Griffon Inn. He holds her there, I am sure of it.</string>
<string name="1343">It is a treacherous place, and easy to defend, which is why I dare not approach. I can only hope ye have the skills I don&apos;t.</string>
<string name="1344">Reward? Ye can keep the ransom, if he has it. Just get her back safe, I beg ye!</string>
<string name="1345">The gods have mercy! Here... allow me to give ye the bounty money. At least it be good to know Yesgar has none of the other killers with him in this.</string>
<string name="1346">I... I suppose I cannot blame ye. It is very dangerous. Here be rest of the bounty for the ears.</string>
<string name="1347">I beg ye to change yer mind and find her. Shaldrissa is hot-headed and impetuous because she is young... she doesn&apos;t deserve this fate at the hands of a murderer.</string>
<string name="1348">I should have known ye would not do it. Not enough gold for ye, is it? Here... take the ear bounty, if that&apos;s all ye care about.</string>
<string name="1349">Go to the old mines by the Green Griffon Inn to the north of town, then. They are locked and you shall need this key. Hurry, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, hurry!</string>
<string name="1350">What is the word? Have you found my daughter? Is she safe?!</string>
<string name="1351">Get away from me! Some hero ye are... my Shaldrissa lies dead because of ye!</string>
<string name="1352">Leave me be, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. We have nothing to talk about.</string>
<string name="1353">Shaldrissa is safe and returned! I cannot thank ye enough! Ye truly are the hero the Lady told me of!</string>
<string name="1354">I wish ye good luck, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Hopefully ye finds what ye&apos;re searching for.</string>
<string name="1355">The last of those escaped convicts, that murderous half-orc Yesgar... he has kidnapped my only daughter, Shaldrissa.</string>
<string name="1356">I already paid the ransom he demanded... but still he has not returned her. I fear for her life! Please, I beg ye to save her!</string>
<string name="1357">I be sure she&apos;s held at the old mines. Ye can find them north of town, near the Green Griffon Inn.</string>
<string name="1358">Please hurry!</string>
<string name="1359">Go on, then. Leave the poor lass to die, heartless wretch!</string>
<string name="1360">Dead? But... but how can she be... dead?</string>
<string name="1361">She... is... dead?</string>
<string name="1362">Ye killed her yerself, no doubt! Bah! I cannot believe I trusted ye! My Shaldrissa... dead!!</string>
<string name="1363">She... I thank ye for attempting the rescue, anyway, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I suppose it could not be helped. Now, please... leave me be... </string>
<string name="1364">And ye stand there, not caring a whit about it. No doubt ye killed her yerself! Go on, get out! Out! I don&apos;t need to lay eyes on ye further!</string>
<string name="1365">I... I can scarce believe it. And ye throw it in my face, uncaring. Go, then, and leave me be. I do not want to see ye.</string>
<string name="1366">The girl is shaken, but otherwise she is all right. Perhaps this will serve to curb her desire for adventure, now, aye?</string>
<string name="1367">I wish I had more to reward ye with. If ye found the ransom, please do keep it... and as for whatever quest the Lady put ye on, I wish ye the best of luck.</string>
<string name="1368">Now please! You must help me find my daughter!</string>
<string name="1369">Here, take the bounty for Yesgar.</string>
<string name="1370">Stirge? You&apos;re one of the escaped criminals with a huge bounty on his head!</string>
<string name="1371">Stirge? You have huge bounty on head. Me want that money.</string>
<string name="1372">A baby killer? In that case, I&apos;ll have to kill you.</string>
<string name="1373">Baby killer? Okay, me kill you den.</string>
<string name="1374">Do you say that to everyone?</string>
<string name="1375">Me wonders if you always say such stuff.</string>
<string name="1376">Wait. What were you even a prisoner for?</string>
<string name="1377">Why you was prisoner?</string>
<string name="1378">Okay, how did you get out?</string>
<string name="1379">Me asks how you get out?</string>
<string name="1380">I&apos;m done talking to a baby killer. Defend yourself!</string>
<string name="1381">Me done yapping to baby killer! Die!</string>
<string name="1382">So you went to the other inmates?</string>
<string name="1383">What kind of talent?</string>
<string name="1384">And what did you contribute?</string>
<string name="1385">Your escape hasn&apos;t been a success yet.</string>
<string name="1386">So now what?</string>
<string name="1387">All right, let&apos;s play.</string>
<string name="1388">Can you give me an example of how to play?</string>

<string name="1466">Why me listen, gnome?</string>
<string name="1467">You gets help from other inmates?</string>
<string name="1468">What kinds of talent they got?</string>
<string name="1469">What your role in escape?</string>
<string name="1470">You still trying to escape. No success yet?</string>
<string name="1471">Me wonders what now?</string>
<string name="1472">Stirge? You&apos;re one of the escaped criminals with a huge bounty on his head!</string>
<string name="1473">Stirge? You have huge bounty on head. Me want that money.</string>
<string name="1474">Why would you tell this to a stranger?</string>
<string name="1475">Me wonders why you tell such stuff to stranger?</string>
<string name="1476">You are correct, my friend. But tell me, before you decide to kill me, isn&apos;t there the slightest bit of curiosity in you? Four convicts, locked away in Waterdeep&apos;s most inescapable prison... yet here we are!</string>
<string name="1477">Not so fast! After all, it isn&apos;t my death that you want, but rather the proof of my death. If you had read the bounties posted the length of the Sword Coast, you&apos;d know that you need only my tattooed ear as proof. </string>
<string name="1478">Of course! Always say the most unexpected things because it puts the enemy off balance.</string>
<string name="1479">Do you want to know how I got out of prison? Because I&apos;d love to tell you. It really tells you something about teamwork these days!</string>
<string name="1480">I thought we got past the introduction phase already... remember, I say &apos;Greetings, I am Stirge the baby killer&apos; while you stared with vacant eyes. Can we move on now?</string>
<string name="1481">I was just about to tell you. Glad to see that flicker of impatience in the air between your ears. </string>
<string name="1482">I found myself in prison, rather unfortunately. I wanted to get out so I can go back to doing what I do best.</string>
<string name="1483">I realized that escaping this Waterdhavian prison was said to be impossible, so I knew I would need help achieving the impossible.</string>
<string name="1484">Yes, indeed. Aren&apos;t we a quick study? Someone woke up refreshed this day! So yes, I worked out a relationship with Zor, Delilah, Wyvern, and Yesgar.</string>
<string name="1485">I knew they would all be interested in escaping, and unlike the others, had the talent to do so.</string>
<string name="1486">The only kind of talent! The kind that works together. Zor was a big brute! He could pull down gates or smash through doors!</string>
<string name="1487">Delilah&apos;s poisons helped us to &quot;incapacitate&quot; many of the guards within the prison. And Wyvern was able to call to the animals to further our escape.</string>
<string name="1488">He used them to deliver messages, create distractions, and even to help us shake off the guards from our trail. It was very exciting!</string>
<string name="1489">Me? I helped to put it all together. Mine were the brains that put the plan together, and got us all working in unison... Well, me and Yesgar but he&apos;s just the figurehead, there to inspire loyalty.</string>
<string name="1490">Oh, but it has! No one ever escaped from that prison! We were the first. We made it out the door. We can get caught now, after the fact, but it doesn&apos;t change anything. We escaped.</string>
<string name="1491">Now, we play a game. You beat me at it, and I cut off my ear and give it to you, because that&apos;s all you really want, isn&apos;t it? The bounty you&apos;ll get from my ear.</string>
<string name="1492">If you win I&apos;ll tell you where Delilah is and give you my valuable ear. If not we will settle this with blades. </string>
<string name="1493">I hope you are worthy of the challenge. Let us begin. </string>
<string name="1494">Let&apos;s see... Let&apos;s start easy. My word is Darkness.</string>
<string name="1495">Sorry, Light is the opposite of Darkness.</string>
<string name="1496">You lose. That means I shall neither bargain for my ear nor offer clues about the cold Delilah. On your guard!</string>
<string name="1497">Wind blows through the Darkness but does not defeat it.</string>
<string name="1498">No, the Shadow is part of the Darkness but does not defeat it.</string>
<string name="1499">Rock? Gosh, I don&apos;t even know how you came up with that one but it definitely doesn&apos;t defeat Darkness.</string>
<string name="1500">Nay, the Fog may settle in the cool belly of Darkness but it does not defeat it.</string>
<string name="1501">Yes, nothing like a warm Fire to hold back the Darkness. In that case, my new word is Water.</string>
<string name="1502">Ah yes, the Candle holds back the Darkness, if just a little bit. My new word, then, is Wind.</string>
<string name="1503">The Sun shines through the Wind but does not defeat it.</string>
<string name="1504">Aha! A well-built Wall shall keep the Wind from any home. In that case, my next word shall be War, which topples many Walls.</string>
<string name="1505">But Peace is the opposite of War, I&apos;m afraid, and therefore does not qualify. </string>
<string name="1506">If anything, it is War that defeats the Armies, not Armies that defeat the War.</string>
<string name="1507">Ah, even in the outer planes, the demons and Angels make constant War. Noble as they may be, they have not defeated War itself.</string>
<string name="1508">Rock? I won&apos;t even hazard a guess as to what you&apos;re trying to say with that.</string>
<string name="1509">Nay, as long as warriors revel in the slaughter, Joy shall not defeat War.</string>
<string name="1510">Aye, only true Goodness of the heart, shown equally to all the world, is sufficient to defeat War. My new word is Evil.</string>
<string name="1511">Wait! What have I done? I spoke the opposite! Fie, I have lost at my own game!</string>
<string name="1512">Come, let me tell you of Delilah, then, and tear off this offending ear that I might buy my life.</string>
<string name="1513">Okay, while I - ow - cut this, let me tell you what I know of - ow - Delilah.</string>
<string name="1514">She&apos;s a poisoner, so watch her - ow - blade. Yesgar got her hired onto some caravan that passes east of town so she could lay low there for a while.</string>
<string name="1515">How true! The Sun&apos;s bright orb, while it creates Darkness by its shadows, also defeats it with its glare. My new word, then, is Clouds.</string>
<string name="1516">Interesting. If Darkness is a metaphor for unhappiness, then Joy certainly defeats it. My new word, then, is Tragedy.</string>
<string name="1517">Ah, Summer is a time of few Clouds but it does not defeat them.</string>
<string name="1518">Aye, the Wind can tear apart the Clouds. But what can beat the Wind? I think I stand defeated, my friend.</string>
<string name="1519">Lightning is the angry daughter of her mother Cloud. While tempestuous, she does not destroy the one who birthed her.</string>
<string name="1520">We just established that the Cloud defeats the Sun. If so, what you suggest cannot be true.</string>
<string name="1521">Rain is born of Cloud but, in its falling, it does not negate its mother.</string>
<string name="1522">Rocks and Clouds have very little to do with each other, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="1523">Clouds often form at Sea so, surely if the Sea creates them, it cannot be said to defeat them also.</string>
<string name="1524">Aye, even on a Cloudy day, one can tell the difference between day and night. Daylight surely is the victor there.</string>
<string name="1525">My new word, then, shall be Nightfall - But wait! The two, in truth, are opposites and I have lost at my own game!</string>
<string name="1526">A Ship may use the Wind to fill its sails but the Ship does not defeat it.</string>
<string name="1527">A Bird may fly upon the Wind but the Bird does not defeat it.</string>
<string name="1528">Ah, a ship at Anchor drifts not with the vagrant Wind. In that case, my new word shall be Rust.</string>
<string name="1529">How true. All the Wind in the world cannot keep a falling Rock aloft. In that case, my new word is Frost for it shatters even boulders.</string>
<string name="1530">Nay, the Sky looks down upon the Winds but does not defeat them.</string>
<string name="1531">Indeed, Friendship is a tie that binds but that has little bearing on the Wind.</string>
<string name="1532">Really? How quaint!</string>
<string name="1533">But it is Water that helps the Rust corrode.</string>
<string name="1534">Ah, but the passage of Time simply causes more things to fall to Rust.</string>
<string name="1535">Lightning conducts through metal, be it Rusted or no, but it does not keep the Rust from continuing its slow corruption.</string>
<string name="1536">Aye, Fire can heat the Rusted rod but it cannot stop that Rusting once it starts.</string>
<string name="1537">How wise. Aye, &apos;tis Oil that soaks through to the core of Rust and binds it to its source. But I grow tired of this game.</string>
<string name="1538">Why does everyone always want to answer Rock!? A Rock may remove Rust&apos;s larger flakes but it does not cut short its progress.</string>
<string name="1539">Nay. By the time the Summer comes, the Frost has already long since been defeated.</string>
<string name="1540">Far from it. Delicate Flowers are oft laid low by morning Frost.</string>
<string name="1541">Ah, a well-tended Fire shall destroy the Frost about it. My new word, then, is Water.</string>
<string name="1542">Hmm. I believe we just established that Frost defeats Rock. How do you propose that Rock might take its revenge?</string>
<string name="1543">Nay, Ants hide themselves from the Frost for they know it means their death.</string>
<string name="1544">Ah, Mittens may keep the Frost&apos;s bite from your fingers but they will not stop the Frost itself.</string>
<string name="1545">Nay, for Laughing at Tragedy does not make the situation any less tragic than before.</string>
<string name="1546">Aha! Comedy is the opposite of Tragedy!</string>
<string name="1547">Ah, how wise. Only through Grieving can Tragedy be overcome and life continue on renewed.</string>
<string name="1548">Alas, I know not what might defeat Grieving. I do believe you have defeated me this day.</string>
<string name="1549">The Sun shines down on Tragedy without compassion. I&apos;m afraid it does not defeat it.</string>
<string name="1550">Nay, many respond to Tragedy with Vengeance but Vengeance simply begets another Tragedy and so the cycle does repeat.</string>
<string name="1551">You are clearly a fool, my friend, though it would be a Tragedy if a falling Rock were not to put you out of your misery right now... </string>
<string name="1552">If Tragedy defeats Joy, as we have just established, then Joy cannot defeat Tragedy.</string>
<string name="1553">True, Justice can right a wrong and heal the wounds left by Tragedy. In that case, my new word is Zealotry.</string>
<string name="1554">True, Compassion from his enemies can calm the Zealot and rid him of his zeal. But I grow tired of this game.</string>
<string name="1555">Nay, &apos;tis Faith itself that creates the greatest Zealots. Do not paladins take zealous action on the basis of their beliefs?</string>
<string name="1556">Nay, &apos;tis Force that breeds Zealotry all the more. Make a martyr of a single man and a hundred of his followers rise up in his place.</string>
<string name="1557">Ah, some are not Destined to be Zealots but others are. Destiny is impartial in this matter.</string>
<string name="1558">You&apos;ve been wanting to say that for some time, haven&apos;t you... It&apos;s wrong, you do realize that? *Sigh.*</string>
<string name="1559">Nay, an Educated Zealot is simply a more articulate one. Education does not negate the Zealotry itself.</string>
<string name="1560">Well I might say Darkness. If you said Light, you&apos;d lose because that&apos;s its opposite. You could say Candle, though, to which I could say Wind.</string>
<string name="1561">Nay, the Cold may freeze the Water but the Water is still there come spring. It has simply changed its form, not been defeated.</string>
<string name="1562">The Sky looks down upon the still Waters with little care.</string>
<string name="1563">Very true indeed. The Sun can dry up the Water, leaving only salt behind. My new word, then, is Clouds.</string>
<string name="1564">Nay, Life was born in Water, consumes Water, and excretes Water. If one could defeat the other, they would not have lived so long together.</string>
<string name="1565">The Wind may form ripples upon the Water, or even crashing waves. While it whips the Water into a greater frenzy, it does not defeat it.</string>
<string name="1566">In truth, this one is in close balance but, with time and patience, it is actually the Water that wears the Rock.</string>
<string name="1567">Even more so than ourselves, a Fish requires Water for it to live. Why should the Fish defeat the Water and thereby go without?</string>
<string name="1568">Aye, the Dam stops the flow of raging Waters and thus defeats it. But, as a Flood can overtake the Dam, Flood shall be my newest word.</string>
<string name="1569">Ah, but Flood and Drought be opposites!</string>
<string name="1570">Aha, a Ship can ride out the Flood and thus defeat it... But I grow weary of this game.</string>
<string name="1571">Ah, Fish may revel in the Flood or die from all the silt that it upturns. But little can they do to stop it.</string>
<string name="1572">Haha, cry all you want. Tears will simply trickle toward the Flood and add to it their salt. </string>
<string name="1573">Ah, a Flood can tear even Boulders from their place and roll them along for miles.</string>
<string name="1574">Ah, the fates and sages may predict a Flood or cataclysm but Destiny, herself, will not avert it.</string>
<string name="1575">My good &lt;boy/girl&gt;, I have a reason for everything. After all, it isn&apos;t my death that you want, but rather the proof of my death. If you had read the bounties closely my friend, you&apos;d know that you need only my tattooed ear as proof. </string>
<string name="1576">Surely you are interested in finding out how I, Stirge the baby killer, escaped from the most secure prison in Waterdeep. </string>
<string name="1577">Surely you have thought that there was more to it than this... five inmates escaping the Waterdeep&apos;s most inescapable prison... aren&apos;t you curious how we did it?</string>
<string name="1578">If you&apos;d spare my life and listen to what I have to say, I&apos;d be willing to cut my ear from my head and give it to you as proof. </string>
<string name="1579">There is no other choice but for me to concede. </string>
<string name="1580">That&apos;s all I know. If it&apos;s all right with you, I&apos;m going to take my leave of you now.</string>
<string name="1581">If that were not enough, I&apos;d also be willing to tell you where to find some of other escaped prisoners. They are as dastardly as I, and are worth the same reward. Come now; listen to what I have to say. </string>
<string name="1582">If you&apos;d spare my life and listen to what I have to say, I&apos;d be willing to cut my ear from my head and give it to you as proof. </string>
<string name="1583">If that were not enough, I&apos;d also be willing to tell you where to find some of my companions. They are as guilty as I, and are worth the same reward. Come now; listen to what I have to say. </string>
<string name="1584">Ah, a worthy opponent! Greetings, I am Stirge the baby-killer, recently escaped from hard time in Waterdeep! My four fellow prisoners and I are now among the most wanted criminals along the Sword Coast. </string>
<string name="1585">Why shouldn&apos;t I tell you? It&apos;s important that you realize I&apos;m not some simple farmer bumbling about a rotted out tree stump! I am Stirge the baby killer!</string>
<string name="1586">You are correct my friend. I am one of the only living beings to have escaped Waterdeep&apos;s most secure prison. But before you do anything rash, please hear me out. </string>
<string name="1587">The game we&apos;ll play is the oldest game of all. I will give you a word and you must respond to it with another word that can defeat the original without being its opposite.</string>
<string name="1588">Please, leave me be.</string>
<string name="1589">No deals. I&apos;m here for your death.</string>
<string name="1590">Me not here for talk, but for death. Your death!</string>
<string name="1591">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1592">Me not know who you is.</string>
<string name="1593">Why did you ambush me?</string>
<string name="1594">Why attacks me?</string>
<string name="1595">I intend to claim the bounty on you.</string>
<string name="1596">Me wants kill Wyvern for bounty!</string>
<string name="1597">Actually, I don&apos;t care to know who you are. Let us fight!</string>
<string name="1598">Me not care. Me just want fighting.</string>
<string name="1599">Why were you originally imprisoned?</string>
<string name="1600">Why you gets in prison in first place?</string>
<string name="1601">Why should I listen to anything that you say?</string>
<string name="1602">Me wonders why you think me need hears this.</string>
<string name="1603">I want your ear, Wyvern.</string>
<string name="1604">Me just wants ear.</string>
<string name="1605">Enough talk, Wyvern. It&apos;s time for you to die.</string>
<string name="1606">Stop talking! Me kills you! Now!</string>
<string name="1607">How did you escape?</string>
<string name="1608">You don&apos;t wish to die and you want to make a deal?</string>
<string name="1609">You want live? Make deal?</string>
<string name="1610">That&apos;s nice, but I&apos;m here for the bounty.</string>
<string name="1611">Me just wants bounty. Me not care about all this.</string>
<string name="1612">So be it. I agree.</string>
<string name="1613">Me likes deal. Me says sound good.</string>
<string name="1614">Agreed, but only if you help me find the other escapees.</string>
<string name="1615">Me does this if you lets me know where other criminal is.</string>
<string name="1616">No deal, you disgusting murderer! I&apos;ll kill you now!</string>
<string name="1617">You sick murderer. Me kill now.</string>
<string name="1618">How you is escaping?</string>
<string name="1619">What do you propose?</string>
<string name="1620">You want make deal?</string>
<string name="1621">Go on.</string>
<string name="1622">What happened?</string>
<string name="1623">You were captured?</string>
<string name="1624">Your crimes sicken me! Die!</string>
<string name="1625">You bad bad man! Die!</string>
<string name="1626">You have kept your end of the bargain. Go into the wilderness and never return. </string>
<string name="1627">Okay now. You go now and no come back.</string>
<string name="1628">I think I&apos;ve decided to kill you anyway.</string>
<string name="1629">Me not care. Me kill you anyway.</string>
<string name="1630">I surrender!</string>
<string name="1631">You have made short work of my creatures. &apos;Twould not be wise to let you do the same to me.</string>
<string name="1632">Ha! It seems another fool has taken my bait! Kill them all, my creatures!</string>
<string name="1633">If it must be this way, I shall not fall easily! Die!</string>
<string name="1634">Please, you must help me!</string>
<string name="1635">I have already lost a fellow ranger to the animals in this place. He lies just down the southern path.</string>
<string name="1636">Wyvern, formerly a &apos;guest&apos; of the Bulwark Prison in Waterdeep, at your service.</string>
<string name="1637">It was nothing personal. I thought that you might be a bounty hunter looking to kill me or take me back to that hellish dungeon.</string>
<string name="1638">I would sooner kill myself then go back to that horrible prison! For ten years I felt not the sun on my face nor heard the call of wild. I am a ranger and for me, it was truly hell.</string>
<string name="1639">Now I am free and back where I belong. I want nothing more than to be left alone and never again shall the rank stench of so-called civilization assail my senses.</string>
<string name="1640">I was born in a forest to the east. My father was a ranger of some renown and he taught me to love the forest and all of the creatures within it. Life was idyllic, though it did not last.</string>
<string name="1641">There is a bounty on myself and the four who escaped with me. Hear me out and perhaps you may profit from it.</string>
<string name="1642">I escaped with the aid of other inmates Yesgar, Stirge, Zor, and Delilah. Typically, they were not the type I would associate with, but I was desperate to escape.</string>
<string name="1643">I could not stand being in that cell, locked away from nature. I don&apos;t regret my actions and did not deserve to be caged.</string>
<string name="1644">Indeed! This need not end in battle. Perhaps you&apos;ll allow me to make a suggestion? The bounty is for my ear.</string>
<string name="1645">I&apos;ll give you my ear if you&apos;ll allow me to leave. Tell them I&apos;m dead, and let me become a recluse. I&apos;ll go into the wild and never return.</string>
<string name="1646">Here, this arrow tip be sharp enough... Szzhgah, that stings... There, a single ear. Don&apos;t spend it all in one place.</string>
<string name="1647">Then I&apos;ll get it over with. This arrow tip be sharp enough... Szzhgah, that stings... There, take the ear and claim your bounty.</string>
<string name="1648">As for my partners, I barely spoke to most of them. However, I do know that Zor is an idiot and has likely drowned himself in an ale barrel at the Green Griffon Inn. It was to be his first stop.</string>
<string name="1649">Now, if you don&apos;t mind, I&apos;ve got a poultice to prepare for where my ear used to be.</string>
<string name="1650">I will not be returned to that prison. If I am to die, it will be right here, amidst the trees. Come kill me, if you can!</string>
<string name="1651">I do not wish to die. The bounty requires only that you bring back my ear. I can also assist you in finding one of the other escapees.</string>
<string name="1652">Men came to the forest. Human mercenaries on leave from their employ with the lord of the human lands west of the forest. They burned part of the forest, slaughtered the animals for sport, and crucified my father on a tree when he came to speak with them.</string>
<string name="1653">When my father did not return, my mother went to search for him. I found her dead at the foot of the tree where my father hung. She had been... brutalized before they killed her. </string>
<string name="1654">My father still lived and had watched, helpless, as my mother was killed. He died in my arms and I swore vengeance. </string>
<string name="1655">I hunted them down. One by one I found them and killed them. I killed their families. I killed their dogs and their horses, stupid beasts that remained loyal to these men despite what they had done.</string>
<string name="1656">When the human lord brought his forces against me, I disappeared into the woods and picked the men off with arrows until the survivors were so afraid of the forest, they called it haunted.</string>
<string name="1657">I was betrayed by one of my own. A ranger who they hired from the west. He tracked me down and would not listen to reason. He talked of innocents killed and vengeance gone too far. He did not understand.</string>
<string name="1658">I was captured and taken to the prison. There was no trial and only through the intervention of the ranger was I not killed outright. </string>
<string name="1659">But that was many years ago and the rage has long since faded. My father was avenged and I only wish to travel the wilds and never see another settlement again.</string>
<string name="1660">I thank you for my life. Farewell.</string>
<string name="1661">You have what you want, just leave me be.</string>
<string name="1662">I&apos;ll let you go if you can help me find the others.</string>
<string name="1663">Then here&apos;s the end. Let&apos;s fight.</string>
<string name="1664">There is honor in what you have done. Killing you would be a shame. You should leave this area though.</string>
<string name="1665">Me lets you go if me gets help finding others.</string>
<string name="1666">Me makes story end then. Me kills you.</string>
<string name="1667">You have honor, so be bad to kill. You leave area now and be safe.</string>
<string name="1668">Me confused. Who you be?</string>
<string name="1669">Me gots time. Me listen and think on what to do.</string>
<string name="1670">Zor? You&apos;re one of the criminals with a huge price on his head!</string>
<string name="1671">Zor! You have huge price on head. You criminal.</string>
<string name="1672">Sounds fair so far. I&apos;ll think about it. What&apos;s your story?</string>
<string name="1673">I understand... and I&apos;ll listen.</string>
<string name="1674">Okay. Me listens. You talk.</string>
<string name="1675">It&apos;s not that complicated, Zor. This is to the death.</string>
<string name="1676">Me not like think so much. We just fight, yeah?</string>
<string name="1677">Sounds like a good life, so far.</string>
<string name="1678">So what happened in prison?</string>
<string name="1679">What happen in prison?</string>
<string name="1680">I think I&apos;ve heard enough, convict. Time for you to die.</string>
<string name="1681">Me hears enough, criminals. You die!</string>
<string name="1682">What about the others you mentioned?</string>
<string name="1683">What happened then?</string>
<string name="1684">What come next?</string>
<string name="1685">I&apos;ve heard enough, criminal. Time for you to die.</string>
<string name="1686">You talks too much. Time for you to die.</string>
<string name="1687">What about others? You tell me.</string>
<string name="1688">I&apos;ve heard enough of this convict. Time for you to die!</string>
<string name="1689">Me hears enough, criminal. You die!</string>
<string name="1690">Me think this all good thing.</string>
<string name="1691">Stop dragging this out. It&apos;s time for you to die, criminal.</string>
<string name="1692">Me not want talking. You criminal. You die!</string>
<string name="1693">I&apos;m lost. Who are you?</string>
<string name="1694">Fine, I can accept that. Just tell me your story.</string>
<string name="1695">Me think sound fair. You tell story.</string>
<string name="1696">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Ha! Why, Stirge told me how to find *you!*</string>
<string name="1697">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Ha! Stirge tells me how finding *you!*</string>
<string name="1698">No help from you means no deal from me.</string>
<string name="1699">Me not gets help, me not makes no deals.</string>
<string name="1700">Forget it. Let&apos;s just fight.</string>
<string name="1701">Me not care about this. We just fight.</string>
<string name="1702">Wait! We stop fighting now! Me sees you brave warrior. Me wants talk moment before we fights more.</string>
<string name="1703">You strong opponent! Me impressed! Me say name is Zor! Me tell you story, yeah? You spreads my word, maybe, before you kill me?</string>
<string name="1704">Me know where Stirge is, &apos;cause Stirge like to brag lots. We not like Stirge, so me will tell you where he hidden. Stirge go to south road close to Charwood.</string>
<string name="1705">You not under-estimate him, though. He small, but smart. Now, for us: we should fight. Me want to see if me can defeat you. </string>
<string name="1706">Me see you same as all other bounty hunter. Fine, we fight. Me show you me not die easy! Me die with pride!</string>
<string name="1707">Me see noble warrior spirit inside you. Me thank you for not making fight with Zor go beyond. Me know you see strong warrior, too. Me say farewell.</string>
<string name="1708">Why you break into my room! You be bounty hunter! Me end you life here!</string>
<string name="1709">Me is fierce warrior of minotaur peoples! Me is strongest warrior of all, and proves self in combat after combat. Then, me becomes gladiator for moneys.</string>
<string name="1710">Yes me criminal. Me have big price on head. But me respect you, me want chance to tell you story of me life. Then we fight.</string>
<string name="1711">Me think it good, too, at first! But me gets tricked! Me fights and wins, every time, and makes people mad.</string>
<string name="1712">Me not is realizing me trying make people happy. Me just think me should fight and win. Not wanting lose to weak opponent.</string>
<string name="1713">Me told to lose, make other people lots of money. Me not lose, me kill other fighter. Me sent to prison for this. </string>
<string name="1714">In prison, me meet new friends, friends who no trick me. Me friends named Stirge and Delilah and Wyvern and Yesgar.</string>
<string name="1715">Yesgar great man! Yesgar have orc blood. He plan how to escape big prison. He need me for strength. </string>
<string name="1716">Delilah use poison on guards and Wyvern trick guard dogs. Wyvern really good with dogs. </string>
<string name="1717">Stirge make maps of prison. Me not like Stirge. He call me lots of names. </string>
<string name="1718">After escape we split up. Yesgar say we harder to find that way. Now me see bounty hunter everywhere. Me kills all, but you is tough. Me not killing you. Me want to make deal.</string>

<string name="1720">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Stirge does? Me thought... fine! Me tells you where Stirge is, but you listen first, okay?</string>
<string name="1721">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Me not believes you. Me knows Stirge never tells where me is. Me not know how you find me, but Stirge not it.</string>
<string name="1722">Hmm... me not wanting die like this. Me tell you story, and if you listen, me reconsider telling you thing. Okay? We still fight if you is wanting.</string>
<string name="1723">Then we is fight. Me gots respect, but me not die easy. You come, we die glorious - maybe together! Ha! Come fight!</string>
<string name="1724">If you kill me, me worth big reward. Me want you to get reward, not some weak bounty hunter. </string>
<string name="1725">What kind of wares do you sell here?</string>
<string name="1726">Can I see your merchandise?</string>
<string name="1727">I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="1728">What you sell? You sell wares?</string>
<string name="1729">Me want to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="1730">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="1731">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1732">Have you heard anything about werewolves near Port Llast?</string>
<string name="1733">I&apos;m looking for work. Do you know of any?</string>
<string name="1734">I need some directions, actually.</string>
<string name="1735">You knows of werewolves, yeah? In Port Llast?</string>

<string name="1747">Me not gots reagent.</string>
<string name="1748">What is a reagent?</string>
<string name="1749">Me not know. What is reagent?</string>

<string name="1761">What would I have exciting news about?</string>
<string name="1762">Me not know what you say. Exciting what?</string>
<string name="1763">Can you remind me about that job?</string>
<string name="1764">Me needs reminder what me agreed to.</string>
<string name="1765">I have one of the tomes you seek.</string>
<string name="1766">Me gots tome. You want, still?</string>
<string name="1767">Can you remind me about that tome-recovery job?</string>

<string name="1774">I have another tome to offer.</string>
<string name="1775">Me gots more tome for you.</string>
<string name="1776">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Surely you can provide me with more than that.</string>
<string name="1777">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me can get more golds, huh?</string>
<string name="1778">Should I beat more money out of you?</string>
<string name="1779">Me can beat more gold from you, yes?</string>
<string name="1780">I&apos;d rather not part with the tomes just yet.</string>
<string name="1781">Me thinks me keep tomes for now.</string>
<string name="1782">Yes, I think that would help.</string>
<string name="1783">Me wants refreshment, yes. Tell again, please.</string>
<string name="1784">Where could the Tome of Fire be?</string>
<string name="1785">Do you know where the Tome of Ice is?</string>
<string name="1786">I need more information about the Tome of Life.</string>
<string name="1787">Help me find the Tome of Death.</string>
<string name="1788">Do you know where the Tome of Resonance is?</string>
<string name="1789">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; I would need a lab.</string>
<string name="1790">Me gets Tome of Fire if me knows where is.</string>
<string name="1791">Me want to knows where Ice Tome is.</string>
<string name="1792">Where you thinks Life Tome is?</string>
<string name="1793">Where me find Tome of Death?</string>
<string name="1794">Where me look for Res&apos;nance Tome?</string>
<string name="1795">Who is the Arcane Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="1796">What be this brother thingy?</string>
<string name="1797">Where is his tomb?</string>
<string name="1798">Where me find grave?</string>
<string name="1799">Where might I find Saer Bodkin?</string>
<string name="1800">Saer Bodkin be where?</string>
<string name="1801">&lt;StartAction&gt;Offer skeleton&apos;s knuckle reagent.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="1802">Welcome to the shop, as I like to say. I am Eltoora Sarptyl, and not a finer collection of wares are you apt to find.</string>
<string name="1803">Why, I sell only the finest assortment of magical goods. Truly, you will find no better collection than mine.</string>
<string name="1804">Yes, this will do quite well. Come, let us take a look at what we have to offer you then, shall we?</string>
<string name="1805">What I sell? Hmm... do you always speak like that? Pardon me, I shouldn&apos;t be rude but my curiosity got the better of me.</string>
<string name="1806">You may as well spill the question, and I&apos;ll see if I can figure out an answer for you.</string>
<string name="1807">Well, okay then... we&apos;ll toss aside everything else, shall we?</string>
<string name="1808">I wish you a good &lt;quarterday&gt;, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Please come back again.</string>
<string name="1809">A good &lt;quarterday&gt;, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Come again.</string>
<string name="1810">Yes, yes. Goodbye. Come again.</string>
<string name="1811">Yes, I have heard something. A knight - was it Sir Karathis? He was looking for someone to help him slay a werewolf, I think.</string>
<string name="1812">To be honest, that may have happened a few days ago or more; I pay little attention to such things. Is there something else?</string>
<string name="1813">Well, well, well. I do indeed have a task for you. How do you feel about recovering some old tomes for me?</string>
<string name="1814">Scattered about the region are the Five Tomes of Ancient Imaskar. I want you to find these tomes, and return them here to me.</string>
<string name="1815">Well then, let me see what I can do to explain this to you, okay?</string>
<string name="1816">Well, I&apos;m sure you can find someone else to help you out there... Unless you&apos;re looking to know where I keep a chair or somesuch.</string>
<string name="1817">Alas, I don&apos;t show my rare and valuable goods to just anyone who is curious. To look at the goods, you must give me a magical reagent. Do you have anything that might interest me?</string>
<string name="1818">Which reagent do you have?</string>
<string name="1819">I could have sworn I told you about a job already, and that you agreed to do it. Do you want a refresher?</string>
<string name="1820">Well, hello. Have you exciting news for me, or is this just a routine visit? Either way, I&apos;m pleased to see you again.</string>
<string name="1821">Why, the tomes of course! Have you found any? You do remember agreeing to look for me, don&apos;t you? I still remember offering a lot of gold for their return.</string>
<string name="1822">That is most excellent news. Please, let me see what you have. Oh, this is so very exciting!</string>
<string name="1823">Well, the Tome of Fire! That will be a nice addition to my collection. Thank you very much, and now for your reward.</string>
<string name="1824">Ah, the Tome of Ice. Another fine work to add to my collection. I thank you for this.</string>
<string name="1825">Oh, this shall be an exciting tome to page through, I would say. This makes me happy indeed. And for you...</string>
<string name="1826">Well, what an exquisite book. I&apos;ve always thought death was such a beautiful, misunderstood thing. This book shall serve as my center piece.</string>
<string name="1827">Well, well, the Tome of Resonance. Though I hoped otherwise, I felt certain I would never see it amongst my collection. You have my admiration, and appreciation.</string>
<string name="1828">This should keep you quite happy indeed, I would think. Don&apos;t you? Now, tell me what else I might do for you.</string>
<string name="1829">Truly? Of course, of course. Don&apos;t let my appreciation stand in the way of new additions. Let me see what you have.</string>
<string name="1830">Well, that&apos;s more than fair. If you want anything for that tome, however, just come back to me.</string>
<string name="1831">The five tomes that I want you to find are the tomes of Resonance, Life, Death, Ice, and Fire.</string>
<string name="1832">The Tome of Fire has been a tricky one for me to locate. My scrying attempts reveal that it is far to the south, but I cannot see where specifically.</string>
<string name="1833">It would make sense that the tome was within the Charwood. Though I know not why, that realm resists my scrying. If it were anywhere else, I think I could locate it.</string>
<string name="1834">Do you require more information about the five Tomes of Ancient Imaskar?</string>
<string name="1835">Near here but to the south, you&apos;ll find a tower. Within that tower, you shall find the Tome of Ice.</string>
<string name="1836">Of course, the owner of the tower is a powerful wizard in his own right, and you should be cautious in your approach.</string>
<string name="1837">This tome was in the possession of Brother Toras, a member of the Arcane Brotherhood. I had planned to buy it from him, but he died before I had the chance.</string>
<string name="1838">I checked around when I heard he was dead, but it wasn&apos;t amongst his personal possessions. The only place I haven&apos;t searched yet is his tomb; I simply haven&apos;t had the time.</string>
<string name="1839">Like the Tome of Fire, my scrying tells me that the Tome of Death has followed the long, dark road into the Charwood.</string>
<string name="1840">If only I could see more, but the region is impervious to my efforts.</string>
<string name="1841">My scrying has shown that it was originally taken east into the Neverwinter Woods.</string>
<string name="1842">Perhaps if you go to the Neverwinter Woods, a clue or two will reveal itself.</string>
<string name="1843">The best way that I can explain their purpose, with brevity, is to compare them to recipe books. These books explain the crafting of magical items.</string>
<string name="1844">If you return these books to me, I&apos;ll allow you to use them to make your own creations. If this does not interest you, I will of course also offer a suitable reward.</string>
<string name="1845">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The tomes are rare indeed. Fine, I will give what I can, but do not ask for more.</string>
<string name="1846">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The tomes might be rare, but I cannot afford to give away all that I have for them. Be happy with what I have given you.</string>
<string name="1847">That&apos;ll teach me to underestimate someone. You have proven most useful, indeed. Well, what else do you have?</string>
<string name="1848">There&apos;s no need to be threatening me. And while I&apos;m not sure you realize the risk in doing so, if it means that much to you... </string>
<string name="1849">Here is some more gold. Do not expect me to be so kind again. Now, do we have further business, or were you leaving?</string>
<string name="1850">I&apos;ve warned you about threatening me before. Truly you are foolish to press your luck, but not foolish enough to be rewarded with further coins.</string>
<string name="1851">Count your blessings that I do not have the guard summoned. Now, do we have anything more to discuss?</string>
<string name="1852">Well, I&apos;d rather not let you take a look at my goods if it&apos;s all the same. My shop, my rules, if you&apos;ll excuse me for saying so.</string>
<string name="1853">Well then, I suppose you&apos;ll have to trek out and find some then, won&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="1854">A reagent is an ingredient, if you will, that allows one to cast advanced magic. I&apos;m always looking for good stuff, but here&apos;s a specific list.</string>
<string name="1855">Find me a fire beetle&apos;s belly, a bodak&apos;s tooth, a rakshasa&apos;s eye, a slaad&apos;s tongue, a skeleton&apos;s knuckle, some quartz crystal, fenberries, fairy dust or the silk glands of an ettercap. I&apos;ll be satisfied with any of those things.</string>
<string name="1856">Then you shall have use of my own. Why not speak with Saer Bodkin about this. He might even provide you with some ideas of what you might make.</string>
<string name="1857">Come now, you can&apos;t be serious. You don&apos;t know of the Arcane Brotherhood? They are located in Luskan, and they are the true power in that city.</string>
<string name="1858">Their ruthless tactics are infamous, and the only thing that has stopped them from major expansion is the constant in-fighting and bickering they do.</string>
<string name="1859">Being wealthy and powerful, I would imagine he had his own mausoleum outside the city walls of Luskan.</string>
<string name="1860">Just be careful. Brother Toras was a powerful wizard and might have some deadly traps or guardians protecting his tomb from grave robbers.</string>
<string name="1861">Why, he&apos;s right through the portal behind me. Don&apos;t worry about popping in on him, as he enjoys the company.</string>
<string name="1862">If you can do this, then I will reward you far beyond the value of the books. Of that, you can be certain.</string>
<string name="1863">Tell me about item creation. How does the Tome of Imaskar work?</string>
<string name="1864">I need to purchase some reagents.</string>
<string name="1865">Eltoora gave me the wardstone to her treasury. Where is it?</string>
<string name="1866">It&apos;s time for me to leave.</string>
<string name="1867">Me need ree-ay-jents... </string>
<string name="1868">Me make use of Imaskar book, yuh?</string>
<string name="1869">Okay, me done here.</string>
<string name="1870">Eltoora give me magic rock for treasure... </string>
<string name="1871">Saer Bodkin? Who are you?</string>
<string name="1872">Me not know what &quot;Say Bumpkin&quot; is. You tell?</string>
<string name="1873">Can I ask you about something?</string>
<string name="1874">Me asks question about other thing, yuh?</string>
<string name="1875">Secrets, secrets, secrets! Mistress Eltoora says I should help you and so I do, hmm?</string>
<string name="1876">Secrets, secrets! Saer Bodkin can help you, hmm?</string>
<string name="1877">Ah, a friendly face! So much nicer than Mistress Eltoora&apos;s! But that&apos;s a secret between us, hmm? She&apos;s so nice, too!</string>
<string name="1878">It&apos;s mathematical! One and one makes two, or something new perhaps! Place your goods into the box, and then see what comes out. Just be careful of what you place within.</string>
<string name="1879">Sorry, someone else is using it right now, hmm? Wait in line, wait in line.</string>
<string name="1880">For use with the Tome, hmm? I might have other things you&apos;d like as well, yes.</string>
<string name="1881">You want to know about Kermit, Mistress Eltoora&apos;s potted plant of holding, hmm? If you have the wardstone she should open quite happily for you... </string>
<string name="1882">We are here to serve, hmm?</string>
<string name="1883">You and magic strikes me as a scary proposition, hmm? But perhaps you have the dragon&apos;s blood in you, though, yes.</string>
<string name="1884">Here comes trouble, so they say. Luckily I am but the scribe, safe within my bubble, hmm?</string>
<string name="1885">No, no, no, you misunderstand! The stone is not your treasure, hmm? It&apos;s simply a key. But, to the point... </string>
<string name="1886">Nothing can I do for you until you get the books, hmm? Go on, go on, I have no time to talk of them. Eltoora will tell you all, yes?</string>
<string name="1887">The goods you want within, that will bring the most without, hmm? Stick with skeleton knuckles, fen berries, quartz crystals, fire beetles&apos; bellies, and ettercap silk glands.</string>
<string name="1888">So, tell me then, what can Saer Bodkin do for you? Are you here for reagents, or something else entirely? Ooh, do tell!</string>
<string name="1889">It&apos;s Saer Bodkin, you understand. It&apos;s a name, just like yours - whatever it might be, though ridicule it I will not, hmm?</string>
<string name="1890">I&apos;m Eltoora Sarptyl&apos;s assistant. I help her out with whatever wizardly duties she needs me for, hmm? In return, I can access all of her magic.</string>
<string name="1891">Eh? What are you talking about now? I&apos;m not a one to care about what goes on about the world, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re implying.</string>
<string name="1892">And I&apos;d thank you kindly to take your questions elsewhere, hmm! Yes? Ask me questions, or buy some reagents now, will you? Not being rude, am I?</string>
<string name="1893">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1894">I&apos;m here to kill you. That&apos;s the only way.</string>
<string name="1895">I have some silver charms. Will you use one?</string>
<string name="1896">Me musts know who you be, yuh?</string>
<string name="1897">Me gots to kill you. No offense, huh?</string>
<string name="1898">Me gots silver charms. Fix you up, all good!</string>
<string name="1899">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; These are cures. They&apos;ll restore you.</string>
<string name="1900">I&apos;m here to kill you or cure you. You pick which I do.</string>
<string name="1901">Prepare yourself for death then.</string>
<string name="1902">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You want get fixed, yuh? Take this.</string>
<string name="1903">Me kill or cure you. You picks, yuh?</string>
<string name="1904">Me kill you, stop this plague, yuh.</string>
<string name="1905">Who you gives ring to?</string>
<string name="1906">You gave your ring away? To whom?</string>
<string name="1907">How did you ever become a werewolf?</string>
<string name="1908">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ve been sent to end the werewolf menace. If you give me your ring, I will leave and no one will come searching for you in the future.</string>
<string name="1909">I&apos;ll go find help for you. Just stay here.</string>
<string name="1910">Me gets help, yuh? You stays here!</string>
<string name="1911">Uh, wha&apos; happen to you?</string>
<string name="1912">Just give me your ring.</string>
<string name="1913">What happened to Bran?</string>
<string name="1914">Did Ander survive? Where is he now?</string>
<string name="1915">Is Geth all right? Do you know where I could find him?</string>
<string name="1916">Where is Sir Karathis now?</string>
<string name="1917">What happens to Bran, yuh?</string>
<string name="1918">Where Ander went? He okay?</string>
<string name="1919">Is Geth still alive? Can you help me find him?</string>
<string name="1920">Where Sir Karathis be?</string>
<string name="1921">Let us speak of something else.</string>
<string name="1922">We talk &apos;bout something else.</string>
<string name="1923">Why have you come here? My parents told you to leave, didn&apos;t they? Did they also tell you how horrible this is? Can&apos;t you just leave me alone?</string>
<string name="1924">Now that this ordeal is over, I think I need a vacation. A long one. Farewell and thank you!</string>
<string name="1925">Death can be no worse than the fate I am living. Kill me, if you must, but do not be surprised when I fight back!</string>
<string name="1926">Why not just kill me outright? Why ask me to do it myself?</string>
<string name="1927">My name is Urth, and I&apos;ve been infected with lycanthropy. That&apos;s why I&apos;m hiding here, so no one has to see - this.</string>
<string name="1928">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Cures? To be honest, I&apos;d rather die with hope than without. Give me your charm.</string>
<string name="1929">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Look, just leave me alone, will you!?</string>
<string name="1930">Though I always thought that I&apos;d rather die fighting, I&apos;m tired of fighting. Fine, give me your charm, and I shall die with hope.</string>
<string name="1931">Have you come for my ring? You&apos;re too late. Someone else has it. I gave it away already.</string>
<string name="1932">I gave it to some adventurer. I was told that people would stop bothering me this way. My death could be faked, and then no one would care about me anymore.</string>
<string name="1933">It - It worked, I can feel it. Thank you so much. Here, take my ring and bring it to Neurik so he knows I&apos;m all right!</string>
<string name="1934">You&apos;ll tell everyone that I&apos;m dead? Maybe then people would leave me alone, stop looking for me or making fun of me. My parents could have a normal life.</string>
<string name="1935">Fine, here it is. You should probably give it to Neurik. Tell him that I&apos;m dead. Maybe this can all go away.</string>
<string name="1936">Where else would I go? I&apos;m surprised my parents even let me come back... </string>
<string name="1937">Sir Karathis lost in battle to the werewolf, and, as a werewolf he hunted us down. He couldn&apos;t help it. I don&apos;t blame him.</string>
<string name="1938">Sir Karathis rounded up myself, Geth, Bran and Ander to help him hunt a werewolf. I was very excited for the adventure, and eager to join.</string>
<string name="1939">Bran? I don&apos;t know... I know he was poisoned like me, and became a werewolf. But other than that?</string>
<string name="1940">Ander may have escaped, he may not have. I never saw him again.</string>
<string name="1941">Geth? I didn&apos;t see where he went, but if I were to guess, we used to play just outside Luskan, by the Green Griffon Inn.</string>
<string name="1942">I don&apos;t even care about Karathis. I don&apos;t blame him, either. But I have no interest in that matter. I just feel - numb, about it.</string>
<string name="1943">Don&apos;t hurt me anymore! The wolf spirit is gone!</string>
<string name="1944">Grrr - Please! - Grrrrr - Can&apos;t control... Myself!</string>
<string name="1945">I need to go.</string>
<string name="1946">What did you want to talk about?</string>
<string name="1947">That&apos;s why I&apos;m here: I&apos;ve seeds that need planting.</string>
<string name="1948">I need to go now.</string>
<string name="1949">Me have seeds to plant, yuh?</string>
<string name="1950">Yuh, me go now.</string>
<string name="1951">How about if I give you some extra gold then?</string>
<string name="1952">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; What if the druids helped tend your farm?</string>
<string name="1953">This tree is getting planted even if its roots have to feed on your corpse.</string>
<string name="1954">What if me gives you extra gold?</string>
<string name="1955">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me gets druids to help you care farm?</string>
<string name="1956">Me plant tree, even if over your dead body, yuh?</string>
<string name="1957">Fair enough, just thought I&apos;d ask.</string>
<string name="1958">Sorry, me just askin&apos;... </string>
<string name="1959">Here, 300 gold, then. That&apos;s six good years.</string>
<string name="1960">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; How does 200 gold sound?</string>
<string name="1961">Sorry, I don&apos;t think I have enough gold right now.</string>
<string name="1962">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Uh, 200 gold good?</string>
<string name="1963">Here, 300 gold. That like... um... two years worth?</string>
<string name="1964">Uh, me no have enough gold right now.</string>
<string name="1965">Who are you?</string>
<string name="1966">Who you be?</string>
<string name="1967">What do you do here?</string>
<string name="1968">What you does here?</string>
<string name="1969">I was sent here by Archdruid Aawill.</string>
<string name="1970">Me gets sent here by Archdruid Aawill.</string>
<string name="1971">This isn&apos;t your land, though.</string>
<string name="1972">What kind of work do you have to do?</string>
<string name="1973">Me wonders what you got doing?</string>
<string name="1974">Me doesn&apos;t thinking this you land.</string>
<string name="1975">Where does your property end?</string>
<string name="1976">Where you property ended at?</string>
<string name="1977">I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="1978">Me never knowed that, no.</string>
<string name="1979">I&apos;m sorry, but there&apos;s some worry that the forest is suffering.</string>
<string name="1980">Me sorry. Me just hear others worry about forest.</string>
<string name="1981">Listen buddy, I&apos;m planting these seeds to protect the forest.</string>
<string name="1982">Me sent protecting forest. Me needs planting seeds!</string>
<string name="1983">Now how did that tree get there? That thing&apos;s going to wither my crops with its shade... </string>
<string name="1984">Howdy, stranger. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="1985">Why them&apos;s be forest seeds. I run a farm, not an orchard, &lt;lad/lass&gt;! Why are you wanting for planting them seeds on my land, anyways?</string>
<string name="1986">Yeah, well... you get a move on, then, all right?</string>
<string name="1987">Well, it depends on what kind of deal you&apos;re offering. I might pull in 50 gold a season, but then where am I next season?</string>
<string name="1988">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; All right, if it means that much to you that you&apos;d dip into your own pocket like that... you can plant your trees here and I won&apos;t come closer.</string>
<string name="1989">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m afraid not, pal. This here is good soil and it would take more than that to make me leave it.</string>
<string name="1990">All right, if it means that much to you that you&apos;d dip into your own pocket like that... you can plant your trees here and I won&apos;t come closer.</string>
<string name="1991">Harrumph. That&apos;s what I thought. Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;ve got work to do. Like I said, I can&apos;t sit here all &lt;quarterday&gt; talking. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="1992">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, so long as I ain&apos;t need to be paying them anything. Shoot, they can come over here and do some quick magic, I&apos;m sure we&apos;d both be benefiting.</string>
<string name="1993">All right. I guess it won&apos;t pay for me to be thinking on this too long. You can plant your seeds here. You just make sure them druids come through, or I go back to chopping.</string>
<string name="1994">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; And who&apos;s saying that I even need the help? Well, doesn&apos;t this just beat all? You come here from out of the who knows where trying to plant them seeds of yours.</string>
<string name="1995">Whoah, calm down, Nelly... I don&apos;t take kindly to threats. I suggest you back off now before you get yourself into trouble.</string>
<string name="1996">Aye, that tree ain&apos;t so bad after all. It&apos;s got some bees nestin&apos; in it and they spread the pollen about quite nicely.</string>
<string name="1997">Why, I think I might even get into a little bit of the honey business on the side... </string>
<string name="1998">O&apos;Deel&apos;s my name, since you&apos;re asking. And it&apos;s a pleasure to make your meeting, I&apos;m sure. Now, you&apos;ll excuse me if I don&apos;t set to talking, what with the work I got.</string>
<string name="1999">Well, what do you think? This is my farm, and I&apos;ve got work to do. That forest is getting closer and closer to my fields, and it&apos;s got my outer crop at risk.</string>
<string name="2000">Look, it seems you&apos;re here to start trouble, and I don&apos;t want none of it. I avoid them druids, &apos;cause more often than not, they got a problem with me.</string>
<string name="2001">Tell you the truth, I just want to be left alone. I&apos;m a simple man and I ain&apos;t got much problem with no one. All right? So if you&apos;ll leave me alone...</string>
<string name="2002">Why are you coming out here trying to start trouble about this being my land or not? I take care of this land, and I ain&apos;t never seen you before.</string>
<string name="2003">Well, what do you think? I got farming to do. This land ain&apos;t going to get tilled and seeded without me putting that effort in.</string>
<string name="2004">Well, I&apos;m not sure that matters to you, does it? Why are you asking so many questions like that?</string>
<string name="2005">Yeah, well, now you do. And you&apos;ll excuse me if I don&apos;t sit here all &lt;quarterday&gt; telling you how I live my life. I&apos;ve work to do.</string>
<string name="2006">Why? For me cutting down some trees? Well, I&apos;ll tell you I need to cut them trees down to let me get that sun in here.</string>
<string name="2007">I ain&apos;t having the time to tend my crops so close to the woods myself, to make up for what the sun ain&apos;t doing.</string>
<string name="2008">Well, you might protect the forest, but you&apos;ll drive me out of business. Well, I&apos;ll tell you I need to cut them trees down to let me get that sun in here.</string>
<string name="2009">And without the care of extra hours or the sun shining down without the trees blocking it, I ain&apos;t making enough money to keep afloat.</string>
<string name="2010">I&apos;m sorry if you see me stretching my farm out as bad news to them druids, but this is about putting food on the table for me.</string>
<string name="2011">Well, I see mathematicals ain&apos;t your strong point, but that&apos;s all right. I can see you got a good heart to you.</string>
<string name="2012">This money should keep me afloat awhiles if I stay smart with it, so... you got my word that I ain&apos;t going to chop at the forest no more.</string>
<string name="2013">Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;ve got work to do... just not around here any more. Like I said, I can&apos;t sit here talking all &lt;quarterday&gt;. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2014">Burn, burn, burrrrn! This forest is unclean and only through Kossuth&apos;s righteous flames can it be made pure! Burrrrrrrn!</string>
<string name="2015">I am Viirda, priest of Kossuth the Firelord. Do not molest me as I must remain vigilant for new growth in this already despoiled Wood... </string>
<string name="2016">Yes. My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;. What do you need?</string>
<string name="2017">I might be. Why do you ask?</string>
<string name="2018">Not right now thanks. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2019">Yes. Me be &lt;FirstName&gt;. How me help you?</string>
<string name="2020">Maybe. Why you ask?</string>
<string name="2021">No. Me leave now, bye.</string>
<string name="2022">I don&apos;t like attacking animals, so what am I supposed to do about it?</string>
<string name="2023">What can I do to be of assistance?</string>
<string name="2024">That doesn&apos;t really interest me right now.</string>
<string name="2025">Me no like hurt animals. What me do about it?</string>
<string name="2026">What you want me for?</string>
<string name="2027">Me no interested in that.</string>
<string name="2028">I guess I should go check it out then.</string>
<string name="2029">Where is the Neverwinter Wood from here?</string>
<string name="2030">Are they offering a reward?</string>
<string name="2031">I&apos;m really not interested. Thanks anyway.</string>
<string name="2032">Me go see what me can do there.</string>
<string name="2033">Where be Wood from here?</string>
<string name="2034">They gonna pay me?</string>
<string name="2035">Me not want to do that. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="2036">What were you needing help with again?</string>
<string name="2037">Where is the Neverwinter Wood?</string>
<string name="2038">Nothing, sorry. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2039">What you need help with?</string>
<string name="2040">Where be Neverwinter Wood?</string>
<string name="2041">Nothing. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="2042">I don&apos;t need any supplies, thanks.</string>
<string name="2043">Me no need nature supplies.</string>
<string name="2044">I would like to see your wares.</string>
<string name="2045">Me want see you wares.</string>
<string name="2046">Hello there &lt;lad/lass&gt;. My name is Ballard. I am a ranger and I am looking for someone interested in a dangerous mission. Might you be interested?</string>
<string name="2047">Welcome back. What can I do for you now?</string>
<string name="2048">Well friend, it&apos;s not just what I need; there are many lives at stake.</string>
<string name="2049">There has been trouble over in the Neverwinter Wood of late. It started with travelers bringing back tales of normally peaceful animals attacking them for no reason. </string>
<string name="2050">People&apos;s lives are at stake. I hope you change your mind.</string>
<string name="2051">There is a grove of druids that are trying to find out what is wrong. The leader is Aawill. He sent three of his best druids into the Wood in search of clues, but nobody has heard from them in a while.</string>
<string name="2052">Then farmers and woodcutters began to disappear. The animals have been attacking everyone, even the rangers and druids that are there to help the forest. I fear that without assistance, whole villages near the Wood might be destroyed.</string>
<string name="2053">It is possible that the druids have returned in my absence, but Aawill could still use your assistance in preserving the Wood. If you are brave enough, seek Aawill in the grove near the forest&apos;s edge.</string>
<string name="2054">I hope to hear from you again, when the forest is returned to its natural state. In the meantime, should you need any nature related supplies, I would be happy to show you my wares.</string>
<string name="2055">The Wood is to the east of here. Be sure you stop by the grove before you enter the forest proper. Aawill might have some more information for you.</string>
<string name="2056">Well, that&apos;s not really up to me to say, but I&apos;ve never known Aawill to be stingy when it came to rewarding other people&apos;s assistance.</string>
<string name="2057">My friend! You have returned victorious. It gladdens my heart to know that there are heroes like you in the world.</string>
<string name="2058">Then Mielikki speed your way &lt;brother/sister&gt;.</string>
<string name="2059">Of course.</string>
<string name="2060">Greetings, Sir. My name is &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="2061">Who are you?</string>
<string name="2062">Hello, sir. Me is &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="2063">What your name?</string>
<string name="2064">I&apos;ll be going.</string>
<string name="2065">Me go now.</string>
<string name="2066">You look familiar, somehow... </string>
<string name="2067">Mmmm... me recognizes you, maybe... </string>
<string name="2068">I wonder if I could ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="2069">I have some questions for you.</string>
<string name="2070"></string>
<string name="2071">Me want ask something.</string>
<string name="2072">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lore]&lt;/Start&gt; Elaith Craulnober. I&apos;ve heard that name before.</string>
<string name="2073">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lore]&lt;/Start&gt; Elaith Craulnober. Me hears that name befores.</string>
<string name="2074"></string>
<string name="2075">I&apos;m looking for information on the people that started the plague.</string>
<string name="2076">Me look for people who starts plague.</string>
<string name="2077">Evermeet is closed to you? Why is that?</string>
<string name="2078">Why Evermeet be closed? You kicked out?</string>
<string name="2079"></string>
<string name="2080">Do you know of anything odd in the area?</string>
<string name="2081">You know &apos;bout weird stuff &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="2082">Please continue.</string>
<string name="2083">I hope this story has a point to it.</string>
<string name="2084">Me still listening.</string>
<string name="2085">Me get bored.</string>
<string name="2086">What is this &apos;Evermeet&apos; you mention?</string>
<string name="2087">You say something &apos;bout &quot;Evermeet.&quot; What that?</string>
<string name="2088">So what do you intend to do?</string>
<string name="2089">So what you do?</string>
<string name="2090">I don&apos;t really trust you, Elaith.</string>
<string name="2091">Me no trust you.</string>
<string name="2092">What kind of reward are we talking here?</string>
<string name="2093">What reward if me do it?</string>
<string name="2094">Very well, Elaith. I shall help you recover the gems.</string>
<string name="2095">Okay... me get gems for you.</string>
<string name="2096">I am not interested in this.</string>
<string name="2097">Me no care about stupid gems.</string>
<string name="2098">Perhaps I could help?</string>
<string name="2099">Maybe me helps?</string>
<string name="2100">I might help... for the right price.</string>
<string name="2101">I coulds help... if price good.</string>
<string name="2102">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I could get the job done, I assure you.</string>
<string name="2103">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me could gets it done, me knows.</string>
<string name="2104">Fine. Do it yourself, then.</string>
<string name="2105">Okays. You do it, then.</string>
<string name="2106">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;d expect some kind of payment up front if you want me to do this. </string>
<string name="2107">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Okays, but me want coins now, not laters!</string>
<string name="2108">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Nice story. Unless you want me blabbing it all over town, however, I want some coin up front.</string>
<string name="2109">Might you have any equipment I could purchase?</string>
<string name="2110">Maybe you haves stuff I buy?</string>
<string name="2111">Retired? A real loss to the profession, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="2112">Right. You don&apos;t look like you&apos;re retired.</string>
<string name="2113">You retire for true, or you just pretendy retire?</string>
<string name="2114">Oh, nevermind then.</string>
<string name="2115">Okays, no mind then.</string>
<string name="2116">I&apos;ll take a look.</string>
<string name="2117">Me takes peek.</string>
<string name="2118">No, that&apos;s okay.</string>
<string name="2119">Could I buy some equipment from you?</string>
<string name="2120">Me buys stuff from you?</string>
<string name="2121">I have been thinking about your offer... </string>
<string name="2122">Me be thinking &apos;bout offer... </string>
<string name="2123">Tell me who currently has these gems again.</string>
<string name="2124">Say where me finds gems again.</string>
<string name="2125">I do have one of the gems right here.</string>
<string name="2126">Me has gem right here.</string>
<string name="2127">I have the last gem.</string>
<string name="2128">Me has last gem.</string>
<string name="2129">No, I&apos;ll be going.</string>
<string name="2130">No, me go now.</string>
<string name="2131">Here, Elaith. Take the gem.</string>
<string name="2132">Here, you takes it.</string>
<string name="2133">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; These gems were difficult to acquire. I think I deserve more than you&apos;re paying me. </string>
<string name="2134">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Gems was hard to gets. Me deserves more than you pays.</string>
<string name="2135">I have the feeling you&apos;re shafting me. Pay more or no deal!</string>
<string name="2136">You cheats me, me knows it! You no gets gem!</string>
<string name="2137">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Threaten]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;d be a shame if anything happened to your daughter, Elaith. </string>
<string name="2138">Fine. Take the gem.</string>
<string name="2139">I&apos;m not frightened of you. You get nothing!</string>
<string name="2140">Fine. You takes gem.</string>
<string name="2141">Me not scared! You gets nothing!</string>
<string name="2142">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lore]&lt;/Start&gt; Elaith Craulnober. I&apos;ve heard that name before.</string>
<string name="2143">Might you have any equipment I could purchase?</string>
<string name="2144">Maybe you haves stuff I buy?</string>
<string name="2145">Retired? A real loss to the profession, I&apos;m sure.</string>
<string name="2146">Right. You don&apos;t look like you&apos;re retired.</string>
<string name="2147">You retire for true, or you just pretendy retire?</string>
<string name="2148">Oh, nevermind then.</string>
<string name="2149">Okays, no mind then.</string>
<string name="2150">I&apos;ll take a look.</string>
<string name="2151">Me takes peek.</string>
<string name="2152">No, that&apos;s okay.</string>
<string name="2153">Greetings, my good &lt;lord/lady&gt;. It is rare we see new faces come to drink with us at the Alliance Inn.</string>
<string name="2154">Good day to you, then. Perhaps we shall speak again.</string>
<string name="2155">Alas, I am no Sir, though you are kind to assume so, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My name is Elaith Craulnober... although a simple Elaith will certainly do.</string>
<string name="2156">Your words are a bit forward and brusque - some might even say uncouth. My name is Elaith Craulnober, if you must know.</string>
<string name="2157">I was going to invite you to share a drink, but nevermind.</string>
<string name="2158">At times like this I do so wish I could return to Evermeet, where grace and courtly manners were the custom, rather than the exception. Alas, that way is closed to me now.</string>
<string name="2159">I would be happy to answer any questions from one such as yourself, friend.</string>
<string name="2160">You demand answers without so much as a please? Your lack of manners is sure to leave me in a foul mood. I suppose I should not be so picky about my company, however, in a small place such as this.</string>
<string name="2161">I see you are rather dim, my friend. Very well, I will try to speak slowly and use small words in our conversation.</string>
<string name="2162">Ask me what you will.</string>
<string name="2163"></string>
<string name="2164">I know nothing about the plague - and if you insinuate I am somehow involved I resent the implication. I have only just arrived from Waterdeep, if that makes any difference to you.</string>
<string name="2165">I cannot tell you where to look, my slow-witted friend. I have only just come from Waterdeep, so my knowledge of the plague is limited. But perhaps I can be more helpful on your next question.</string>
<string name="2166">I was not kicked out of Evermeet! Well, perhaps I was... though I would have found a more diplomatic way to describe the situation. </string>
<string name="2167">Obviously, I am one of the elven folk and Evermeet is my ancestral home. I was born there, but left long ago. The way back is closed to me because I have not always been the best of men, you see. Smuggling, thievery - I have my sins, I admit.</string>
<string name="2168">I am no longer the reckless youth I once was, however. I have retired from my illegal activities and am now simply weary and seeking peace.</string>
<string name="2169">My heart longs to return to Evermeet, to show its beauty to my daughter. She has never even seen the homeland of her own people, you see, and I have promised to take her there one day... though that may prove an impossible task.</string>
<string name="2170">I was born in our ancestral home... the last of a proud family. I left it long ago, however, and the way back has been closed to me since because of who I became. I have not always been the best of men in my time, I freely admit it.</string>
<string name="2171">I cannot say that I do. I have frequented Port Llast often in the past, but this time I have only just arrived from Waterdeep. If there are things afoot, I have yet to hear of them.</string>
<string name="2172">That is certainly an odd way to begin a conversation. I would have expected you to introduce yourself, at the very least. I am known as Elaith Craulnober.</string>
<string name="2173">Ah, yes. A smuggler and ruthless adventurer out of Waterdeep? Perhaps you&apos;ve heard of my little encounter with the Knights of the Shield?</string>
<string name="2174">It is of no matter. You heard tales only of the man I once was. I am no longer he, even if you choose not to believe me.</string>
<string name="2175">Surely you jest. You are kin and you do not know of the elven homeland? It has been our refuge and the center of elven life since Queen Amlaruil moved the court there.</string>
<string name="2176">Evermeet is an island that has become the home and refuge of the elven folk since Queen Amlaruil moved the court there. I am surprised you have not heard of it.</string>
<string name="2177">It is a wondrous and beautiful place, if you have never seen it. I, myself, have not gazed upon its forests for a very long time now. As I said, however, Evermeet is closed to the likes of Elaith Craulnober.</string>
<string name="2178">Once I might have cut you down for a comment like that. I would ask you kindly not to tempt me.</string>
<string name="2179">Do not interrupt me with rudeness. I will, however, keep my tale short to accomodate your attention span.</string>
<string name="2180">The one way I may have to return home is through the construction of a ceremonial scepter, gifted to an official in Leuthilspar. It is a bribe, of sorts, but an old and cultural one... and the requirements are very specific.</string>
<string name="2181">The scepter must be adorned with five separate gems cut by an elven master craftsman. Difficult to find in Faerun, to say the least.</string>
<string name="2182">Two of the gems I have. The final three I have tracked to this area, but sadly their owners are loathe to part with them for any price.</string>
<string name="2183">Without them, I cannot complete the scepter and neither I nor my daughter will ever return to Evermeet. A fitting fate for me, perhaps, but cruelly unfair to her.</string>
<string name="2184">I intend to get those gems, with or without the owner&apos;s permission. I will not give up on my quest now, not when I am so close.</string>
<string name="2185">I may just have to hire someone to get them for me, by whatever means necessary. Hmmm... in fact, you seem like someone who might have the skills I need.</string>
<string name="2186">I may just have to hire someone to get them for me, by whatever means necessary. Underhanded, perhaps, but I have few options left.</string>
<string name="2187">What do you say? Might you be interested in a task that requires stealth and guile? I would reward you well for success.</string>
<string name="2188">Hmmm. To get the task done would require someone with skill at stealth and guile. I am not positive you are the &lt;man/woman&gt; for the job.</string>
<string name="2189">Perhaps I shall, at that. Good day to you.</string>
<string name="2190">I meant no offense, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I&apos;ve sent enough to their deaths, as of late... I&apos;ll not be held responsible for another.</string>
<string name="2191">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps you could, at that. Will you help me recover these gems, then? I can offer an excellent reward should you be successful.</string>
<string name="2192">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Thank you for the offer. No offense to you, however, but I&apos;ve sent enough people to their deaths. I&apos;ll not be held responsible for another.</string>
<string name="2193">If you do know of someone who has the skills I seek, however, do send them my way.</string>
<string name="2194">I suppose such mistrust is understandable. I know my hope is a faint one, and I would have given up long ago if not for the promise I made to my daughter.</string>
<string name="2195">If you do not do this for my sake, please do it for hers. I have lain the truth before you, there is nothing more I can do or say to prove my intentions. Accept or reject this as you will. </string>
<string name="2196">I have no illusions, acquiring these gems is no simple task. If it were, I would have done so myself already. But you seem a capable sort. Perhaps you can succeed where I cannot.</string>
<string name="2197">I can offer you this: 200 gold pieces for each of the gems that you return to me. If you bring all three, I will add an additional 400 gold as well as a magic item that I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find a use for.</string>
<string name="2198">That is more than the tiny gems would be worth elsewhere if you were to attempt to sell them on your own, I assure you.</string>
<string name="2199">You threaten to expose me? I see now you are cunning. Very well, I will give you 100 gold pieces to buy your silence, though not a single coin more!</string>
<string name="2200">It is a small enough price to pay, if paid only once. You get nothing more until I see those gems, however.</string>
<string name="2201">Eloquent as ever, my pedestrian-witted friend. Such agitation can boil the brain, though in your case it would hardly matter.</string>
<string name="2202">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Here, take these 100 gold pieces and calm yourself. I have a soft spot for simpletons, and would not have you become so worked up you hurt yourself accidentally.</string>
<string name="2203">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Say or do what you will, I make no payment until the goods are delivered to me. I have spent far too long as a smuggler to do otherwise.</string>
<string name="2204">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Nobody else has taken up my offer yet. Until I have someone who has agreed to this mission, I am more desperate then I would like. Very well - you win.</string>
<string name="2205">Here - 100 gold pieces. That is all I am willing to give you up front. When you bring me the gems, I will reward you further.</string>
<string name="2206">Good. I was beginning to think I would encounter nobody willing and capable of doing this for me.</string>
<string name="2207">Let me tell you exactly what you must search for. The three gems are small, the size of a fingernail, but elegantly carved and with many delicate facets. They are light-hued, but will have something vaguely dark in their center.</string>
<string name="2208">(sigh) As you wish. Should you change your mind or perhaps know another more willing, do send them my way.</string>
<string name="2209">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Certainly not. I have already paid an advance for this very task. Refuse or accept, as you wish... I will pay nothing further.</string>
<string name="2210">One of the gems is in the possession of Wanev, a local wizard. I suspect the gem is secreted away in his tower, which can be found in the grasslands between Port Llast and Charwood. The tower gates are magically locked and I do not know how they can be opened.</string>
<string name="2211">Another gem is held by a fierce warrior woman named Zamithra who passed through several days ago. I believe she said she was bound for Luskan, but she certainly could have been lying.</string>
<string name="2212">The third, I have learned, is held by Setara, a witch who dwells within the Neverwinter Wood to the east of here. Contacting her has proven to be quite difficult.</string>
<string name="2213">I am in the middle of a drink, but please - stay. I will not have it said Elaith Craulnober has become rude in his later years. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="2214">It is true, I was once an agent for the black market. However, I have long since retired from that profession.</string>
<string name="2215">I trust that is all?</string>
<string name="2216">I assure you, my thick-skulled friend, I am well and truly retired.</string>
<string name="2217">Was that an insult? I&apos;m not even sure, so I&apos;ll let it pass. However, to answer your question, I am retired.</string>
<string name="2218">But you have to understand, there&apos;s retired and then there&apos;s &apos;retired.&apos; Truth is, I may have a few items left over from my heyday that I&apos;m still looking to unload. Nothing much, but maybe you&apos;d like to take a look.</string>
<string name="2219">Excellent - I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find my goods of top quality and bottom price.</string>
<string name="2220"></string>
<string name="2221">For you? Certainly. I do not have much, but I assure you it is all of good quality.</string>
<string name="2222">Oh? Have you changed your mind? Will you get the gems that I need?</string>
<string name="2223">How do you do, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? Have you had any luck acquiring the gems? Or is there something else you need?</string>
<string name="2224">I see. Best of luck to you, then.</string>
<string name="2225">I wish I had more information to go on. Hopefully, however, this shall prove enough. I wish you the best of luck.</string>
<string name="2226">Ah, yes... the gem that the wizard refused to give up to me. Does the fool still live? No, no... do not answer that. I would truly prefer not to know. Were he intelligent, he would have made the deal I offered.</string>
<string name="2227">Here are the 200 gold pieces I promised. Might you have another of the gems on you? Or shall I have to wait?</string>
<string name="2228">Ah... the final gem - how glorious! As agreed, I have your 400 gold pieces and the item I promised you right here.</string>
<string name="2229">I see. That is the gem that the warrior woman possessed, indeed. She refused to deal with me, but had no problem with you... or you with her.</string>
<string name="2230">Ah, good. The witch-woman gave it up, did she? I won&apos;t ask what you had to give her in return.</string>
<string name="2231">And let me take the gem off your hands. Ahhh, it will be good to return home.</string>
<string name="2232">And let me take the gem off your hands. Ahhh, it will be good to return home.</string>
<string name="2233">And let me take the gem off your hands. Ahhh, it will be good to return home.</string>
<string name="2234">I shall not deprive you of your reward, my friend. Here it is.</string>
<string name="2235">I do not take kindly to people reneging on deals. People who have crossed me in the past would warn you to choose your next words carefully. At least, they would warn you if any were still alive.</string>
<string name="2236">Pitiful. You are such an idiot you do not even understand I could have you killed with but a word. You are truly a sad and pathetic creature.</string>
<string name="2237">My patience is at an end. Let&apos;s see if you can back up your bravado and stop me from taking what&apos;s mine!</string>
<string name="2238">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You dare threaten my daughter? I should cut you down where you stand... but I cannot take the risk. Very well, I give in to your demands.</string>
<string name="2239">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; An empty threat! My daughter is safe from the likes of you as I always look after the ones I love. Your bluff has been called. I suggest you give me the gem... now.</string>
<string name="2240">Here, then... 700 gold pieces and the item. Though you are robbing me, that is all I have.</string>
<string name="2241">You will find me as unyielding as a stone wall. I have made my offer, you will not find a better. I suggest you take it.</string>
<string name="2242">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Very well, I understand your point well enough. I was a smuggler once, after all. I will throw in a further 300 gold pieces.</string>
<string name="2243">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Save your breath for you will find me as unyielding as a stone wall. I have made my offer, you will not find a better. I suggest you take it.</string>
<string name="2244">You have done as I asked and delivered the gems to me, though your attitude at the last was unwelcome. Most unwelcome and very unpleasant.</string>
<string name="2245">Such attitudes are the reason I wish to take my daughter from these lands. In Evermeet, she will not have to worry about people of your ilk destroying her innocence.</string>
<string name="2246">Farewell, then. I doubt we shall meet again.</string>
<string name="2247">I cannot thank you enough for delivering the gems to me. Now I can at last take my daughter to Evermeet, as I promised. I cannot wait to show her Corellon&apos;s Grove.</string>
<string name="2248">Farewell to you, friend. Perhaps we shall meet again someday.</string>
<string name="2249">I must be on my way, now.</string>
<string name="2250">Here... I have acquired a key that I was told will open Wanev&apos;s cottage here in Port Llast. It&apos;s near the eastern gate and may have some information that will allow access to the tower. Wanev has not been in the cottage for some time but still, I bid you caution. </string>
<string name="2251">Ah, yes. A smuggler and ruthless adventurer out of Waterdeep? Perhaps you&apos;ve heard of my little encounter with the Knights of the Shield?</string>
<string name="2252">It is of no matter. You heard tales only of the man I once was. I am no longer he, even if you choose not to believe me.</string>
<string name="2253">It is true, I was once an agent for the black market. However, I have long since retired from that profession.</string>
<string name="2254">But you have to understand, there&apos;s retired and then there&apos;s &apos;retired.&apos; Truth is, I may have a few items left over from my heyday that I&apos;m still looking to unload. Nothing much, but maybe you&apos;d like to take a look.</string>
<string name="2255">Excellent - I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find my goods of top quality and bottom price.</string>
<string name="2256">Was that an insult? I&apos;m not even sure, so I&apos;ll let it pass. However, to answer your question, I am retired.</string>
<string name="2257">It&apos;s true I used to keep a few spare items on me to sell for old time&apos;s sake. But those days are long gone. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="2258">I assure you, my thick-skulled friend, I am well and truly retired.</string>
<string name="2259">Something else you wished to ask, then?</string>
<string name="2260">This house has a musky, unpleasant odor, though the source is not apparent.</string>
<string name="2261">You must be one of Lady Aribeth&apos;s stalwart heroes! I hope you find that cult!</string>
<string name="2262">Excuse me, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I haven&apos;t the time to speak right now.</string>
<string name="2263">Move along, &lt;boy/girl&gt;. Ain&apos;t got time for you.</string>
<string name="2264">A bit underdressed for the weather, don&apos;t you think?</string>
<string name="2265">Ah! My eyes! Please be decent enough to dress yourself!</string>
<string name="2266">&apos;Tis nice undercothes you&apos;ve got there.</string>
<string name="2267">You seem more than a bit bloodied, &lt;mister/missus&gt;.</string>
<string name="2268">You are heavily wounded, &lt;mister/missus&gt;! Get ye to a temple!</string>
<string name="2269">Ouch! You look like a dressed animal with all of those wounds!</string>
<string name="2270">Dropped on yer head as a child? I&apos;ve known folks like that.</string>
<string name="2271">&apos;Tis a slow day and I&apos;ve a slow &lt;man/woman&gt; to spend it with.</string>
<string name="2272">Must be a hard life to be so stupi... uh, nevermind.</string>
<string name="2273">Put your weapon away, &lt;master/mistress&gt;! I mean you no harm!</string>
<string name="2274">Please don&apos;t wave your weapon about. It makes me nervous!</string>
<string name="2275">Do you have to keep your weapon drawn? </string>
<string name="2276">Hello, holy one!</string>
<string name="2277">Fresh from a temple be ye?</string>
<string name="2278">Must be nice to be one of those who are blessed by the gods.</string>
<string name="2279">I don&apos;t like to mix with you wizard types.</string>
<string name="2280">Just keep walking, wizard. I don&apos;t wanna get turned into a toad!</string>
<string name="2281">Can&apos;t ye wizards leave us normal folks alone?</string>
<string name="2282">You be a mighty fine woman! Do you like peasants?</string>
<string name="2283">You be a right pretty lass!</string>
<string name="2284">Wish my wife looked more like you. (sigh) Don&apos;t tell her I said that.</string>
<string name="2285">What a fine hunk of man I&apos;ve got here!</string>
<string name="2286">I wish my husband looked more like you!</string>
<string name="2287">Hello, handsome!</string>
<string name="2288">Nice to see good people like yourself in Port Llast.</string>
<string name="2289">You seem to be a true hero, &lt;sir/madam&gt;!</string>
<string name="2290">How are you, &lt;mister/missus&gt;?</string>
<string name="2291">Been a good year on the farm! Hope the weather holds.</string>
<string name="2292">I don&apos;t want any trouble. Just leave me alone.</string>
<string name="2293">It&apos;s people like you who give adventuring a bad name.</string>
<string name="2294">I work on a farm and I never expected to see someone who is dirtier than me!</string>
<string name="2295">Quite the smell you&apos;ve got there, barbarian. Moose droppings? </string>
<string name="2296">Keep away from my children, barbarian!</string>
<string name="2297">You be one of those &lt;race&gt; critters that I&apos;ve heard about?</string>
<string name="2298">How do you do, &lt;race&gt; one?</string>
<string name="2299">Good day to you, &lt;race&gt; one.</string>
<string name="2300">North to Green Griffon Inn</string>
<string name="2301">East to Neverwinter Wood</string>
<string name="2302">South to Charwood</string>
<string name="2303">Mmmm, you looks good. You should date Flarg.</string>
<string name="2304">Who&apos;s that? Is you my brother? Uh, guess not.</string>
<string name="2305">Urrgh. Me back hurts much.</string>
<string name="2306">Flarg do this. Flarg do that. Why Flarg do all work?</string>
<string name="2307">Flarg&apos;s pay sucks. Want more copper.</string>
<string name="2308">Whip Flarg? Someday Flarg whip them all.</string>
<string name="2309">You no call Flarg stupid!</string>
<string name="2310">Lift and pull. Pull and lift. Flarg gettin&apos; tired!</string>
<string name="2311">Flarg gots blisters on his blisters! Me need vacation!</string>
<string name="2312">Flarg no understand why me got lousy job.</string>
<string name="2313">What do you charge for a room?</string>
<string name="2314">What pay for room?</string>
<string name="2315">May I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="2316">Me questions ask you?</string>
<string name="2317">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2318">That&apos;ll do.</string>
<string name="2319">You no make fun or arms get ripped off!</string>
<string name="2320">Save stupid jokes and tell what me pay.</string>
<string name="2321">Has there been anything odd going on around here?</string>
<string name="2322">Do you know where I might find some work in town?</string>
<string name="2323">Perhaps you could give me some directions?</string>
<string name="2324">Where me get job?</string>
<string name="2325">Bad stuff happen &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="2326">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="2327">What do you know about the plague?</string>
<string name="2328">But the plague is over, why dwell on the past?</string>
<string name="2329">Werewolves? Where did you hear about werewolves?</string>
<string name="2330">Well, that doesn&apos;t interest me. Can I ask you some other questions?</string>
<string name="2331">Nature? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="2332">What a wonderful little theory. Why don&apos;t we get back to something a little more interesting?</string>
<string name="2333">Well, I suppose I will go talk to Ander then. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2334">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there anyone else I should talk to about the werewolves?</string>
<string name="2335">Maybe I should talk to him, but first could you answer another question?</string>
<string name="2336">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; What? You can tell me. I won&apos;t repeat anything, I swear.</string>
<string name="2337">I guess I&apos;ll go talk to them.</string>
<string name="2338">I suspect you are overly paranoid. I&apos;d better talk to Alhelor now.</string>
<string name="2339">That&apos;s interesting. Maybe I could ask you a few more questions?</string>
<string name="2340">Whatever. Maybe you could answer a few more questions though?</string>
<string name="2341">Where can I find some supplies?</string>
<string name="2342">This place is called Port Llast. I assume that means there are docks around here somewhere.</string>
<string name="2343">What do you mean by that?</string>
<string name="2344">All right. I have a few more questions for you.</string>
<string name="2345">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2346">I don&apos;t suppose so. Could you answer another question?</string>
<string name="2347">Okay, maybe you could answer another question?</string>
<string name="2348">Okay. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2349">All right, I will do that. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2350">Okay, but first I would like to ask you another question.</string>
<string name="2351">I will do that. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2352">I might, but first I have another question.</string>
<string name="2353">That sounds good. See you later.</string>
<string name="2354">Maybe, but first another question.</string>
<string name="2355">Where werewolf?</string>
<string name="2356">Crazy trees?</string>
<string name="2357">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Who else knows werewolf?</string>
<string name="2358">Okay, me go talk Ander now.</string>
<string name="2359">Me want more questions.</string>
<string name="2360">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; What me no nevermind?</string>
<string name="2361">Me be okay. Me be tough customer. Bye.</string>
<string name="2362">Me no worry. Me have more questions.</string>
<string name="2363">Me done here. Bye.</string>
<string name="2364">Me want more questions.</string>
<string name="2365">Ballard. A duck?</string>
<string name="2366">Okay, but first you answer more questions.</string>
<string name="2367">Okay, me go find Ballard.</string>
<string name="2368">Oh, okay. Now you answer another question.</string>
<string name="2369">You help me find places?</string>
<string name="2370">That&apos;s all I need thank you.</string>
<string name="2371">Could you answer another question?</string>
<string name="2372">Where me get good stuff?</string>
<string name="2373">Why this place called Port Llast? You have docks here?</string>
<string name="2374">Okay, me go.</string>
<string name="2375">Now you answer more questions.</string>
<string name="2376">Why not be safe?</string>
<string name="2377">Me have more questions.</string>
<string name="2378">Me not scared of werewolf! Now answer new question.</string>
<string name="2379">Good day to you. Always a pleasure to see a fellow &lt;Race&gt; here at the Alliance Arms Inn. How can I be of service to you my friend?</string>
<string name="2380">Oh grand, another barbarian. I guess I can allow you to stay, but do try to be careful with the furniture. You do know what furniture is... oh forget it. How can I help you?</string>
<string name="2381">Servants of the gods are awarded special treatment here at the Alliance Arms Inn. How may I be of service to you, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;?</string>
<string name="2382">Welcome! The Alliance Arms Inn is fortunate indeed to be visited by such heroic folk as yourself &lt;lord/lady&gt;. How may a humble innkeep be of service to you?</string>
<string name="2383">Welcome to the Alliance Arms Inn. It is a pleasure to serve a hero at my humble establishment. Is there anything I can get for you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="2384">What do you want? Even if you are a hero I still expect you to conduct yourself properly if you want to stay here. I have a reputation to uphold. </string>
<string name="2385">Only 5 gold pieces for a quality room. I assure you, it will be a peaceful sleep after a hard day.</string>
<string name="2386">Well, you certainly look much more relaxed. Ready to get back to another day of adventuring I&apos;m sure. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="2387">My, my, we do have a delightful way of speaking, don&apos;t we? I do hope you know how to use the chamber pot. I hate having to change soiled sheets.</string>
<string name="2388">Ah... yes, so sorry &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="2389">Your pardon.</string>
<string name="2390">(sigh) Just don&apos;t waste too much of my time. I am very busy, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="2391">I&apos;ll do my best &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="2392">There has been trouble throughout the north this past while. Between plagues and werewolves a man can hardly step foot outside his inn.</string>
<string name="2393">It&apos;s over, of course, but I don&apos;t know that the effects have entirely passed. Looters and bandits are always a problem, but nature also seems to feel the repercussions of something that severe.</string>
<string name="2394">I&apos;ve been hearing about strange things from Neverwinter Wood. Of course that might just be completely unrelated.</string>
<string name="2395">It&apos;s just that there is this ranger, Ballard, who was talking about it here the other day. He seemed to be quite disturbed.</string>
<string name="2396">If you want to know more I would ask Ballard. He&apos;s camped in a grove of trees to the north east of the inn.</string>
<string name="2397">Hmm, as you wish.</string>
<string name="2398">It may be over, but there are some who suggest that the effects might be more wide-spread than just making people sick.</string>
<string name="2399">Nature itself is still feeling the effects.</string>
<string name="2400">It&apos;s all they&apos;re talking about in here. Some knight came along and convinced some boys to go hunting werewolves, but then it turned out... </string>
<string name="2401">Actually it would probably be better to get the information first-hand. Ander is a survivor of the whole thing. He&apos;s in here this &lt;quarterday&gt; and he can tell the tale better than I can.</string>
<string name="2402">Well, there is Alhelor. He seems to know a lot about werewolves. He also has some special equipment to sell to werewolf hunters. You could talk to him, I suppose. Although... no, nevermind.</string>
<string name="2403">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, I hate to say anything, but there is something a little odd about Alhelor. He just puts me on edge. I doubt it is anything serious. Just my nerves I suspect.</string>
<string name="2404">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No. I refuse to gossip about a customer. Talk to him and see for yourself.</string>
<string name="2405">Certainly &lt;sir/madam&gt;. What would you like to know about?</string>
<string name="2406">If you really need to know, I suppose.</string>
<string name="2407">For normal supplies I would suggest the Cracked Anvil to the southeast. </string>
<string name="2408">Yes &lt;sir/madam&gt;. The docks are located just west of here. They are fairly safe, at least as safe as things can be in these times.</string>
<string name="2409">One can never feel truly safe when there are werewolves running around.</string>
<string name="2410">Some work for an adventurous soul? Well there is that elf over there. He calls himself &quot;The Serpent&quot; and has been inquiring about adventurers for a couple of days.</string>
<string name="2411">I&apos;m not sure what he wants, but it might be worth your while to check it out. He certainly seems to have no lack of gold.</string>
<string name="2412">Haven&apos;t had enough yet? You should speak to Mayor Kendrack. He usually has a worry or two that need taking care of.</string>
<string name="2413">Sorry, I haven&apos;t heard of anything lately.</string>
<string name="2414">I wonder what kind of job you might be able to handle without bungling? Oh well, let me see.</string>
<string name="2415">Bad stuff. Well, there is the stew we served last night, but I don&apos;t suppose that&apos;s exactly what you meant.</string>
<string name="2416">We&apos;ve been plagued by werewolves near town and I hear that the Neverwinter Wood has things that are even worse.</string>
<string name="2417">I&apos;m not sure where it is now, but you could talk to Ander. He was there when it all happened. He&apos;s here in the tavern this &lt;quarterday&gt;.</string>
<string name="2418">You could talk to Alhelor, he has stuff to kill werewolves. Just be... no, nevermind.</string>
<string name="2419">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, it&apos;s silly, but he is a little odd. It&apos;s probably nothing.</string>
<string name="2420">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I shouldn&apos;t have said anything. Do you need anything else?</string>
<string name="2421">I doubt that I could explain it to you. Perhaps you should go talk to Ballard. He is camped out in the grove of trees to the northeast.</string>
<string name="2422">That would be a mallard. Ballard is a ranger.</string>
<string name="2423">Ugh, I shiver to think of the difficulty that you will have when trying to think up questions.</string>
<string name="2424">I suppose if I use very small words, you might be able to follow my directions.</string>
<string name="2425">If you are looking for magical supplies you could try looking up Eltoora in the northeast part of town.</string>
<string name="2426">Feel free to spend lots of money here at the Alliance Arms Inn, where paying customers are always welcome.</string>
<string name="2427">I&apos;ll bet a cup of wine would help you come up with more questions. Give it some thought.</string>
<string name="2428">When you&apos;re done, come back and have a nice spiced cider, to help you relax after a stressful day.</string>
<string name="2429">Don&apos;t forget to try our special selection of ales before you leave town.</string>
<string name="2430">With a head like a rock, no doubt. Well, good luck and don&apos;t run up any large tabs.</string>
<string name="2431">Don&apos;t forget, the Alliance Arms Inn has one of the best selections of imported ale this side of Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="2432">Remember, you can get a good rest here at the Alliance Arms Inn. Camping causes cramping!</string>
<string name="2433">Well, that&apos;ll teach me to open my mouth, now won&apos;t it.</string>
<string name="2434">Oh, in the name of Umberlee, put some clothes on &lt;man/woman&gt;!</string>
<string name="2435">Now that&apos;s the kinda thing that makes a man pay attention to a pretty thing like you.</string>
<string name="2436">You look like you&apos;ve been digested by a dragon and came out the other end! Find a healer &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="2437">Did you get caught between the dock and a ship? You&apos;re bleeding all over the place.</string>
<string name="2438">Hey &lt;lad/lass&gt;, are ya lost or something?</string>
<string name="2439">Oh how I wish I was out on the briney blue ocean again.</string>
<string name="2440">I hate being in port. The smell of townsfolk makes me sick.</string>
<string name="2441">Nothing like the smell of fish guts and the gentle slap of waves against the dock to make one feel at home.</string>
<string name="2442">I would love to chat, but I don&apos;t have the time to explain everything to ya.</string>
<string name="2443">Might be a bit of a storm rollin&apos; in off the ocean tonight.</string>
<string name="2444">I miss the roll and pitch of the gentle waves. Back to sea for me.</string>
<string name="2445">Hope I can get a pint or two of ale while I&apos;m in port.</string>
<string name="2446">How do you know my name?</string>
<string name="2447">How you know me name?</string>
<string name="2448">Hunt down who?</string>
<string name="2449">Who you hunt down?</string>
<string name="2450">I can&apos;t talk right now.</string>
<string name="2451">Me no talk right now.</string>
<string name="2452">Who are we searching for?</string>
<string name="2453">Who we search?</string>
<string name="2454">I&apos;ll do my best.</string>
<string name="2455">Me try hard.</string>
<string name="2456">I have no interest in finding this cult.</string>
<string name="2457">Me not care &apos;bout no cult.</string>
<string name="2458">None of your business, soldier. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2459">You mind you own business, guy!</string>
<string name="2460">You&apos;re right. We should track them down. I&apos;ll do my best.</string>
<string name="2461">You right. Me try get cult. Me try hard.</string>
<string name="2462">Hello, &lt;FullName&gt;, Hero of Neverwinter! I am Barax, formerly a soldier of Neverwinter, now I intend to hunt down the bastards who did this to us!</string>
<string name="2463">Everyone in Neverwinter knows your name. You were one of the people who saved us from the plague and I suspect that you&apos;ll help just as much in the search for the bastards who started it.</string>
<string name="2464">The cult of course! This mysterious organization that unleashed the plague on Neverwinter and killed so many innocent people. A hero like you is just what we need to find them.</string>
<string name="2465">Don&apos;t let me keep you busy. I&apos;m sure that you&apos;ll want to talk to Aribeth. We have to report all of our findings to her, after all. Best of luck with the search!</string>
<string name="2466">I&apos;m sure that it will be more than enough. A lot of innocent people were killed and this cult owes us a debt that can only be repaid in blood. Give &apos;em hell for all of us, &lt;FirstName&gt;! </string>
<string name="2467">What!? These bastards unleashed a plague upon our city that killed countless innocent people! We have a chance to find them and you say you don&apos;t care?!</string>
<string name="2468">I have nothing else to say to you. I thought that you were a hero.</string>
<string name="2469">Greetings, &lt;FullName&gt;. I hope you find the cult soon. They must be punished!</string>
<string name="2470">Excuse me, &lt;man/woman&gt;. I don&apos;t wish to speak with someone who is so uncaring about the innocents who suffered through the plague.</string>
<string name="2471">I heard that you tracked down the cult in Luskan. Give &apos;em hell for all of us, &lt;FullName&gt;!</string>
<string name="2472">Many innocent people died because of the plague. The cult must pay!</string>
<string name="2473">I hope that you find this cult and kill them all!</string>
<string name="2474">At last, a true hero to help us punish these cultists! They&apos;ll wish they never met you, &lt;FullName&gt;!</string>
<string name="2475">I had friends who died to the Wailing and I intend to kill any cultists I find... slowly.</string>
<string name="2476">The cultists will rue the day they messed with Neverwinter!</string>
<string name="2477">After so much pain and suffering in Neverwinter, I am consumed with thoughts of revenge. The cult will be destroyed!</string>
<string name="2478">It&apos;s a pleasure to meet you.</string>
<string name="2479">Me think nice to meet you.</string>
<string name="2480">On your way, girl. I haven&apos;t the time to waste on the likes of you.</string>

<string name="2520">I&apos;m getting ahead of myself. You must excuse me, I&apos;m just so excited to meet you!</string>
<string name="2521">Welcome to Port Llast! I trust you had a safe journey from Neverwinter. My name is Larana and Lady Aribeth has given me the honor of greeting you upon your arrival.</string>
<string name="2522">Let me say again how much I look up to you! We&apos;ve all heard of the heroic deeds you performed in Neverwinter and how you saved so many lives from that terrible plague.</string>
<string name="2523">Oh, I am sorry, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I certainly don&apos;t want to waste the time of someone who has great deeds to perform. It is just such a pleasure to meet you.</string>
<string name="2524">I wish not to be a bother, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I realize that you have important things to do. It&apos;s just such a pleasure to meet you!</string>
<string name="2525">I know that you must be anxious to speak with Lady Aribeth and begin the search for the cult. She is anxious to speak with you too!</string>
<string name="2526">You can find Lady Aribeth and her associate, Aarin Gend, in the next room, near the exit of this building. Please go and see her right away.</string>

<string name="2552"></string>
<string name="2553">Greetings, Hero of Neverwinter! Please pause for a moment and speak with me.</string>
<string name="2554">Hello, again &lt;FirstName&gt;! If you have not yet spoken to Aribeth, you should.</string>
<string name="2555">This area smells strongly of wolf but has signs of human activity. Whatever lives here is not currently at home.</string>
<string name="2556">You must be one of the adventurers from Neverwinter! Welcome to Port Llast!</string>
<string name="2557">How are you today, &lt;mister/missus&gt;?</string>
<string name="2558">Move along. I don&apos;t have time to mix with your type.</string>
<string name="2559">Citizen! Put some clothes on!</string>
<string name="2560">Listen, &lt;mister/missus&gt;, I would appreciate it if you&apos;d dress like decent folk while in Port Llast.</string>
<string name="2561">I don&apos;t know how things are where you come from, but here in Port Llast, we don&apos;t dress like courtesans. Put some decent clothes on!</string>
<string name="2562">Been through a war there, friend? I suggest you head to the temple and get some healing.</string>
<string name="2563">Gods, &lt;man/woman&gt;, you&apos;re bleeding like a stuck pig! </string>
<string name="2564">I&apos;ve not seen wounds like that on anyone who was still walking. You&apos;d best get some healing while you still can.</string>
<string name="2565">Hmm, idiots parade today? Must have missed the notice.</string>
<string name="2566">Jaw looks a bit slack, friend. Need a drool cloth?</string>
<string name="2567">Don&apos;t think too hard. Your brain&apos;s liable to liquefy even further.</string>
<string name="2568">Please put your weapons away when within the town limits, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="2569">Hey! Don&apos;t go waving your weapons around in this town! I&apos;ve got my eye on you!</string>
<string name="2570">Keep your weapons sheathed in Port Llast. I don&apos;t want to have to jail you.</string>
<string name="2571">Ah, a holy &lt;man/woman&gt;. Welcome to Port Llast!</string>
<string name="2572">A good &lt;day/night&gt; to you, your grace. Looking for a temple?</string>
<string name="2573">Just doing my job. Don&apos;t bring the wrath of your god down upon me!</string>
<string name="2574">One of them wizardly people, huh? Watch where you put them spells.</string>
<string name="2575">If you&apos;re looking for magical supplies, there&apos;s a wizard enclave up on the hill.</string>
<string name="2576">Heh, heh. I bet you have a BIG tower, mage.</string>
<string name="2577">Hey honey, you&apos;re looking great!</string>
<string name="2578">Such a pretty lass! Do you like soldiers?</string>
<string name="2579">Aren&apos;t you a sight for sore eyes! </string>
<string name="2580">I hope you enjoy your time in Port Llast. Would that we had more visitors like you here.</string>
<string name="2581">Hello to you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! Please enjoy all that Port Llast has to offer!</string>
<string name="2582">Hello.</string>
<string name="2583">Nice weather we&apos;ve been having, eh?</string>
<string name="2584">Must you stay in Port Llast? Maybe you&apos;d find Luskan more to your liking.</string>
<string name="2585">Stand away, citizen!</string>
<string name="2586">Greetings, my barbarous friend.</string>
<string name="2587">No raging allowed in town, friend. </string>
<string name="2588">Ever wash your clothes, barbarian?</string>
<string name="2589">Sometimes I feel like the humans are being crowded out with all of you &lt;race&gt; type people wandering in and out.</string>
<string name="2590">Move along, &lt;race&gt; scum. I don&apos;t like to mix with the likes of you. </string>
<string name="2591">Good &lt;quarterday&gt; to you. Don&apos;t you have someplace to go other than Port Llast?</string>
<string name="2592">It seems that a small underground complex has been built beneath the cottage.</string>
<string name="2593">I didn&apos;t think it was such a bad place. What&apos;s your name anyways?</string>
<string name="2594">Well you certainly have this place pegged. What&apos;s your name?</string>
<string name="2595">Me think you wrong. This place okay. What name you have?</string>
<string name="2596">You right, this place suck big. What name you have?</string>
<string name="2597">My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;. Could you answer some questions?</string>
<string name="2598">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;, but you may call me &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is a pleasure to meet a beautiful, young woman such as yourself.</string>
<string name="2599">Me name &lt;FirstName&gt;. You answer me questions?</string>
<string name="2600">Me name &lt;FullName&gt;, but you call me &lt;FirstName&gt;. I glad meet you. You pretty!</string>
<string name="2601">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="2602">What is it that you hate about this town so much?</string>
<string name="2603">I think you just bring out the best in me.</string>
<string name="2604">Me want ask you question.</string>
<string name="2605">Me not know why town bad for you.</string>
<string name="2606">Me feel like you make me be best I can.</string>
<string name="2607">I&apos;m not sure I like where this is going. Why don&apos;t you answer some questions for me?</string>
<string name="2608">That is very interesting. What else does a woman like you need?</string>
<string name="2609">Me not like where this lead. Me want ask question.</string>
<string name="2610">Me not sure what you saying. Why you stand so close?</string>
<string name="2611">Me listen, you tell more.</string>
<string name="2612">Um, I&apos;m going to have to think about that. First I need you to answer some questions.</string>
<string name="2613">I don&apos;t think so. I can&apos;t be worrying about protecting you while in the middle of a fight.</string>
<string name="2614">Perhaps we could talk more about this in the morning, when we wake up?</string>
<string name="2615">I would love to have you along. Why don&apos;t you go get your weapons and armor and meet me out front?</string>
<string name="2616">Me not sure. You answer questions first.</string>
<string name="2617">Me not want you &apos;round. You get in way. Bye.</string>
<string name="2618">Maybe we go bed now, talk in morning.</string>
<string name="2619">Me think that great idea. You get weapons and armor and we meet out front.</string>
<string name="2620">1000 gold? Are you out of your mind? I&apos;m not giving you that much!</string>
<string name="2621">I think 200 gold would probably be enough to get you started.</string>
<string name="2622">Okay, 1000 gold sounds reasonable.</string>
<string name="2623">1000? Me no give you so much!</string>
<string name="2624">That too much. Me give 200 gold, no more.</string>
<string name="2625">Okay, me give you 1000 gold.</string>
<string name="2626">What are you buying? A golden chariot? Forget that!</string>
<string name="2627">Well, I suppose I could give you 2000 gold.</string>
<string name="2628">You be nuts! Me no give you so much.</string>
<string name="2629">Okay, me guess you get 2000 gold.</string>
<string name="2630">I think I&apos;ve had enough of this. Have a good life.</string>
<string name="2631">Me had &apos;nough. Could buy trained warrior for less.</string>
<string name="2632">Well I certainly wouldn&apos;t want to bore you. Why don&apos;t we go talk about this somewhere more private?</string>
<string name="2633">Me want us be alone.</string>
<string name="2634">Have you heard anything about a cult working in the area?</string>
<string name="2635">Is there anything unusual going on in town?</string>
<string name="2636">Do you know where I can find a job?</string>
<string name="2637">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="2638">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="2639">What you know &apos;bout cult or stuff like that?</string>
<string name="2640">What odd stuff in town?</string>

<string name="2646">You got that right. Me never back down to no one.</string>
<string name="2647">That depends on who I&apos;m killing. I prefer &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="2648">Young girl, my name is &lt;FullName&gt;. A little less youthful exuberance, please.</string>
<string name="2649">You don&apos;t need to know my name.</string>

<string name="2654">What? Sleep on the ground, in the rain? Or live minutes away from death? </string>
<string name="2655">Okay, you are just too young and excitable. I think you should go away now.</string>
<string name="2656">What? You want be cold or near death most of time?</string>

<string name="2660">What wrong with town?</string>
<string name="2661">Want questions answered now.</string>

<string name="2664">Is there anything unusual going on in town?</string>
<string name="2665">Are there any jobs available?</string>

<string name="2673">Be content with your nice safe life and quit your whining.</string>
<string name="2674">I&apos;m not having an eager young puppy tripping me up in the middle of combat. You find your own way in life.</string>
<string name="2675">Why you tell me?</string>
<string name="2676">I&apos;m not sure. Maybe you should answer some questions for me first.</string>
<string name="2677">That&apos;s not a bad idea. Why don&apos;t you go get your weapons and armor and meet me back here in a few minutes.</string>

<string name="2683">Okay. I&apos;ll give you the money.</string>
<string name="2684">1000 gold? No chance. You be crazy.</string>

<string name="2688">2000? Okay.</string>
<string name="2689">All right you foolish, greedy child, you can just forget the whole thing.</string>
<string name="2690">You be too greedy. Me no want you no more.</string>
<string name="2691">You be happy you be alive. Much danger out in world.</string>
<string name="2692">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2693">Well hello sir. I don&apos;t recognize you. You must be new in these parts.</string>
<string name="2694">What is an adventurous fellow like you doing in a crap-town like this?</string>
<string name="2695">Why hello my lady! You must be one of the new adventurers in town.</string>
<string name="2696">I am so excited to see that a woman of determined personality can get ahead in this world.</string>
<string name="2697">You just haven&apos;t gotten to know it yet. Once you spend some time here, you&apos;ll really hate it. </string>
<string name="2698">My name is Shaldrissa. What&apos;s yours?</string>
<string name="2699">A man of taste and distinction! How wonderful to meet you.</string>
<string name="2700">I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. I know pretty much everything that goes on in town, not that there is much to know.</string>
<string name="2701">My, a gentleman with manners. That is a rare find in a dump like this.</string>
<string name="2702">Are you kidding? This is just a small town, with small-minded people. If I have to stay here I&apos;ll end up a grumpy old maid with nothing to enjoy in life.</string>
<string name="2703">A young woman with a sharp mind needs adventure... and a powerful man to protect her.</string>
<string name="2704">A woman like me needs comforting, desire, wealth and power. I can&apos;t believe I am being so open with you.</string>
<string name="2705">You make my head spin, I... I feel overwhelmed just being so close to you. </string>
<string name="2706">So what do you think? Would you have room for a determined young woman to follow and... assist you?</string>
<string name="2707">Oh, I can&apos;t do that here. If you take me with you and get me away from this place, then I&apos;m sure we could arrange something.</string>
<string name="2708">No? You good for nothing jerk! Get away from me then. I never want to see your face again!</string>
<string name="2709">Weapons and armor? I don&apos;t have any. Could you lend me 1000 gold so that I could get some?</string>
<string name="2710">200 gold? Are you kidding? You want me to dress like an urchin on the street? Get serious. I need 1000 gold to make a good start as an adventurer.</string>
<string name="2711">Actually, that probably won&apos;t cover all the stuff I&apos;m going to need. Better make that 2000.</string>
<string name="2712">Of course that won&apos;t cover all of my debts. 3000 ought to do the trick though.</string>
<string name="2713">Oh, you dear simple man. I am really so glad I met you.</string>
<string name="2714">Really? I guess I was hoping to bring out the worst in you. This town bores me with its niceness.</string>
<string name="2715">Mmm. Why don&apos;t we get to know each other a little more first?</string>
<string name="2716">I told you I never want to see you again. Go away.</string>
<string name="2717">A cult? Hah! I wish something so exciting happened in Port Llast. I am SO bored!</string>
<string name="2718">In this town? I just told you, nothing ever happens here!</string>
<string name="2719">Why would you want a job here in town. I guess if you must know, my father is Mayor Kendrack and I do know about one job offer.</string>
<string name="2720">There was a prison break in Waterdeep and my father is offering a huge reward for anyone who can hunt down the escaped criminals.</string>
<string name="2721">I only tell you about this because taking the job will help us... I mean you escape the boring clutches of this town.</string>
<string name="2722">If you go north, south, or east you can get out of town. If you get on a boat and go west, you can also get out of town. Those are really all the directions you need.</string>
<string name="2723">My name is Shaldrissa. What do they call a bold adventuress like you?</string>
<string name="2724">Hey! That&apos;s not fair. I told you my name.</string>
<string name="2725">Oh, I get it. All right, I guess I will try to remember that. You sure are wise. I wish I could live like you do.</string>
<string name="2726">All of it! I just want to be away from this boring, dead-end town.</string>
<string name="2727">How rude! I don&apos;t want you to speak to me ever again!</string>
<string name="2728">Oh, I so agree. It is marvelous to meet someone with such a deep understanding of the problems in life.</string>
<string name="2729">It is so exciting the way you talk. Not like anyone in this town. They are all just so boring.</string>
<string name="2730">Oh, I know I get carried away. It&apos;s just that this town is so dull and stifling, it is exciting to meet someone interesting like you.</string>
<string name="2731">Are you kidding? This is a dead zone. There is nothing to do here. I can hardly wake up without yawning from boredom.</string>
<string name="2732">I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. I know pretty much everything that goes on in town, not that there is much to know.</string>
<string name="2733">Neverwinter? That would be somewhere not in town! Plague or not, I think it must be better than here.</string>
<string name="2734">In this town? I just told you, nothing ever happens here!</string>
<string name="2735">Why would you want a job here in town. I guess if you must know, my father is Mayor Kendrack and I do know about one job offer.</string>
<string name="2736">There was a prison break in Waterdeep and my father is offering a huge reward for anyone who can hunt down the escaped criminals.</string>
<string name="2737">I only tell you about this because taking the job will help us... I mean you escape the boring clutches of this town.</string>
<string name="2738">If you go north, south, or east you can get out of town. If you get on a boat and go west, you can also get out of town. Those are really all the directions you need.</string>
<string name="2739">And I am sure you have experienced it all before. Don&apos;t you see, that&apos;s the opportunity I want.</string>
<string name="2740">You could take me with you! You could be my mentor and I your loyal pupil. We could become famous together. </string>
<string name="2741">No? You bitch! I&apos;m never talking to you again.</string>
<string name="2742">Oh dear. I don&apos;t have anything like that. I know, you give me 1000 gold so that I can run and buy some supplies.</string>
<string name="2743">You want me to dress like a street urchin? I don&apos;t think so. 1000 gold is only fair.</string>
<string name="2744">Actually, that won&apos;t really be enough. How about 2000?</string>
<string name="2745">Of course that won&apos;t cover my debts here, so we had better make it 3000.</string>
<string name="2746">I must go meet someone.</string>
<string name="2747">(sigh) Goodbye, then.</string>
<string name="2748">I haven&apos;t spared your life! Die, scum!</string>
<string name="2749">Why should I not kill you?</string>
<string name="2750">You beg, but me still kill you! You die now!</string>
<string name="2751">You answer me question, me let you live... maybe.</string>
<string name="2752">Don&apos;t try to lie to me! Shaldrissa is an innocent girl!</string>
<string name="2753">Really. Tell me more.</string>
<string name="2754">You may go, but I need your ear to claim the reward. The prison tattoo will be proof that I&apos;ve killed you.</string>
<string name="2755">You run away now but first give me tattoo ear for proof you dead.</string>
<string name="2756">I think I&apos;ve decided to kill you after all.</string>
<string name="2757">Me want kill you after all.</string>
<string name="2758">Come on now, you don&apos;t expect me to believe that load of dung.</string>
<string name="2759">Me get mad! You not telling truth!</string>
<string name="2760">Fine. I want any money that you have. Right now!</string>
<string name="2761">Okay, me want all your money. Right now!</string>
<string name="2762">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me the truth right now you lying dog!</string>
<string name="2763">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me truth now, or die!</string>
<string name="2764">Okay. I believe you. </string>
<string name="2765">Okay. Me believe you. </string>
<string name="2766">If you have no money, you&apos;re no use to me. Prepare to die!</string>
<string name="2767">You have no treasure, then you no use to me. </string>
<string name="2768">You&apos;re holding out on me! Come clean or I&apos;ll slit your throat!</string>
<string name="2769">You know more! You tell or me set you on fire!</string>
<string name="2770">Shaldrissa? What sort of secrets does she have?</string>
<string name="2771">I don&apos;t care about any secrets. I want the money!</string>
<string name="2772">Shaldrissa? Tell me about Shaldrissa.</string>
<string name="2773">Me not care about Shaldrissa. Me want money!</string>
<string name="2774">Then what use can you be to me?</string>
<string name="2775">Then what you do for me?</string>
<string name="2776">Foolish hero! Yesgar will smash you!</string>
<string name="2777">Yesgar is glad that you spare his life.</string>
<string name="2778">Yesgar not dead yet, puny &lt;race&gt; runt!</string>
<string name="2779">Yesgar will tell you secret about young girl Shaldrissa. Then you let Yesgar live?</string>
<string name="2780">Wait! Spare Yesgar&apos;s life!</string>
<string name="2781">You are a kind and merciful &lt;man/woman&gt;! Life is better than ear. Wait... (slice) AH! That smarts.</string>
<string name="2782">Yesgar meet Shaldrissa when hiding out at Inn in Port Llast. She smitten with Yesgar&apos;s manly physique. She manipulate Yesgar into kidnapping her. </string>
<string name="2783">Yesgar tell truth! Shaldrissa want me to run away with her! She to blame, not Yesgar! She want money!</string>
<string name="2784">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Okay, don&apos;t hurt Yesgar! Me get Shaldrissa drunk. She so drunk she agree to all Yesgar&apos;s wants. Heh. She quite a feisty girl. </string>
<string name="2785">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Me tell truth! Now let Yesgar go!</string>
<string name="2786">Yesgar doesn&apos;t have any money to give. Yesgar is an outlaw.</string>
<string name="2787">Don&apos;t kill Yesgar! Yesgar was lying. There is a chest behind Yesgar. In it is a key. </string>
<string name="2788">The key will open iron door at south of dungeon. That is where Yesgar has treasure. Can Yesgar go now?</string>
<string name="2789">Don&apos;t kill Yesgar! Yesgar was lying. There is a chest behind Yesgar. In it is a key. </string>
<string name="2790">Shaldrissa not so pure-hearted. Yesgar not kidnap her, she run away with Yesgar! Her idea!</string>
<string name="2791">Good. Yesgar always tell truth. Can Yesgar go now?</string>
<string name="2792">Yesgar bother you no more.</string>
<string name="2793">Take the ear, Yesgar won&apos;t bother you again. </string>
<string name="2794"></string>
<string name="2795">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="2796">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="2797">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2798">What&apos;s going on around here?</string>
<string name="2799">Who&apos;s in charge around here?</string>
<string name="2800">You tell me what happening here.</string>
<string name="2801">Who boss &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="2802">Who are you?</string>
<string name="2803">Who you?</string>
<string name="2804">Excuse me?</string>
<string name="2805">Would you mind making sense for a moment?</string>
<string name="2806">What?</string>
<string name="2807">You explain better. Me no understand.</string>
<string name="2808">You were attacked by trolls?</string>
<string name="2809">Tell me about the attack.</string>
<string name="2810">You fight trolls?</string>
<string name="2811">You tell me &apos;bout trolls.</string>
<string name="2812">Why don&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="2813">Don&apos;t you want to get revenge?</string>
<string name="2814">Why you not go?</string>
<string name="2815">You no want trolls killed?</string>
<string name="2816">So why don&apos;t you go back to Waterdeep?</string>
<string name="2817">Why you not leave?</string>
<string name="2818">Where is this Jax?</string>
<string name="2819">Where Jax be?</string>
<string name="2820">Are there others around here?</string>
<string name="2821">There be others here?</string>
<string name="2822">Who is Lenton?</string>
<string name="2823">Where is this Jax?</string>
<string name="2824">Who be Lenton?</string>
<string name="2825">Thanks for your time. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2826">Okay. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="2827">Who is this Lenton?</string>
<string name="2828">Who be Lenton?</string>
<string name="2829">What were you searching for?</string>
<string name="2830">What you search for?</string>
<string name="2831">Is there anyone else I can talk to?</string>
<string name="2832">Anyone else me talk to?</string>
<string name="2833">Why is he upset?</string>
<string name="2834">Why he upset?</string>
<string name="2835">Is there anyone else?</string>
<string name="2836">There be anyone else?</string>
<string name="2837">Is there anybody, besides Lenton and Jax, to talk to around here?</string>
<string name="2838">There be some to talk to, other than Lenton and Jax?</string>
<string name="2839">Greetings my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I was just getting packed up in the hopes of leaving soon. How may I assist you?</string>
<string name="2840">Hello. I was just packing up in the hopes of leaving soon. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="2841">What do you want? I was just packing up in the hopes of leaving soon, so don&apos;t waste my time.</string>
<string name="2842">Farewell. I hope we can all leave here soon.</string>
<string name="2843">All right. Farewell.</string>
<string name="2844">Don&apos;t bother me anymore.</string>
<string name="2845">I will do my best to be helpful.</string>
<string name="2846">I guess. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="2847">Well, we were on an archeological expedition with Jax, but since the trolls attacked we have mostly cowered around here.</string>
<string name="2848">I guess you could say Jax is. But then again he isn&apos;t.</string>
<string name="2849">Sorry, I just mean that ever since we were attacked by the trolls, nobody really listens to anybody.</string>
<string name="2850">I am an archeologist, working with Jax. At least I was until the expedition was halted by the trolls.</string>
<string name="2851">We were exploring the cave systems in this region, when a large group of trolls jumped us. Several of my closest friends died in those caves. I just want to go back to Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="2852">Of course I do, but I&apos;m realistic. I can&apos;t afford to pay some hero to go slaughter those beasts. I just want to get out of here before the trolls decide to come out of the caves.</string>
<string name="2853">No, if you want to hear about revenge, I suggest you go talk to Lenton. He&apos;s around here somewhere.</string>
<string name="2854">I can&apos;t afford the trip by myself and Jax won&apos;t leave. He&apos;s still hoping for reinforcements from Waterdeep to show up, or for an adventurer to hire.</string>
<string name="2855">Lenton should be around here somewhere. You could try talking to him.</string>
<string name="2856">Lenton is a very angry archeologist. People always expect archeologists to be timid, little old men and women. But not Lenton. I guess he has a good reason for wanting revenge on the trolls. You&apos;ll have to ask him about it though.</string>
<string name="2857">Take care. I sure hope we get to leave soon.</string>
<string name="2858">Revat is a guard. Not too bright. He&apos;s really upset, but then, everybody is upset. You could talk to him, maybe you could help him even.</string>
<string name="2859">He&apos;s right around here. Look for a forgetful old guy and you&apos;ve found him.</string>
<string name="2860">We were searching for evidence of an ancient race. But you should really talk to Jax about that.</string>
<string name="2861">I would really rather you talked to him about that. He should be somewhere right around here.</string>
<string name="2862">Not really. Everybody else was either killed by the trolls, or ran away.</string>
<string name="2863">You&apos;re Revat&apos;s Momma right? I am here to rescue you.</string>
<string name="2864">You can stop worrying. I&apos;m here to rescue you.</string>
<string name="2865">You are free to go, but not with me. You can leave on your own.</string>
<string name="2866">Just stay right there and don&apos;t move. I&apos;ll be back.</string>
<string name="2867">You Revat&apos;s Momma? Me here save you.</string>
<string name="2868">You be happy. Me free you.</string>
<string name="2869">You be free, but no follow me.</string>
<string name="2870">You don&apos;t move. I&apos;ll be back.</string>
<string name="2871">Sorry, he never said your name.</string>
<string name="2872">Since I am here to rescue you, you might want to be more polite.</string>
<string name="2873">Him never tell me you name.</string>
<string name="2874">You be nice, since me free you.</string>
<string name="2875">So how am I supposed to help you?</string>
<string name="2876">What do you expect me to do about it?</string>
<string name="2877">So what me do to help?</string>
<string name="2878">What you think me can do to fix you mistake?</string>
<string name="2879">Are you always this miserable?</string>
<string name="2880">So why didn&apos;t they kill you, or eat you?</string>
<string name="2881">Why they not kill and eat you?</string>
<string name="2882">You always so grumpy?</string>
<string name="2883">The others were attacked by the trolls and ogres, right?</string>
<string name="2884">So what did you do?</string>
<string name="2885">Them attacked by trolls &apos;n&apos; ogres?</string>
<string name="2886">What you do then?</string>
<string name="2887">Could you explain what happened to you again?</string>
<string name="2888">You can come with me now.</string>
<string name="2889">You&apos;re just not worth rescuing. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2890">How you get here again?</string>
<string name="2891">Me go now, you follow.</string>
<string name="2892">Me not want to rescue you. Bye.</string>
<string name="2893">I am clearing the trolls and ogres out of these caves. Who are you and why are you here?</string>
<string name="2894">Me kill bad trolls &apos;n&apos; ugly ogres. Who you and why you here?</string>
<string name="2895">So what happened?</string>
<string name="2896">Is this story going to take much longer?</string>
<string name="2897">That bad. What next?</string>
<string name="2898">You get to point soon.</string>
<string name="2899">A goddess? Why do you think that?</string>
<string name="2900">Somebody&apos;s going senile, I think.</string>
<string name="2901">Why them think you goddess?</string>
<string name="2902">You go crazy, maybe?</string>
<string name="2903">Where would I find your son?</string>
<string name="2904">I&apos;m busy now, but maybe later.</string>
<string name="2905">Where me find you son?</string>
<string name="2906">Me busy. Maybe me do later.</string>
<string name="2907">Okay. Where would I find your son.</string>
<string name="2908">Sorry. Maybe someone else will come along.</string>
<string name="2909">Okay. Where me find son?</string>
<string name="2910">Me gotta go. Bye.</string>
<string name="2911">How will it do that?</string>
<string name="2912">All right, here&apos;s the ring.</string>
<string name="2913">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I think I&apos;ll keep the ring.</string>
<string name="2914">How it do that?</string>
<string name="2915">Okay, here be you ring.</string>
<string name="2916">Me not want give you ring. Me keep.</string>
<string name="2917">No. I will keep it and you will die. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2918">Nope. Me keep. Bye.</string>
<string name="2919">What do you mean &apos;kind of&apos; a prisoner?</string>
<string name="2920">Well, the trolls guarding you are dead, so you can go.</string>
<string name="2921">What you mean by that?</string>
<string name="2922">Them trolls be dead. You free now.</string>
<string name="2923">Eh... you look like a pretty &lt;boy/girl&gt;. What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="2924">Eh... you don&apos;t look much like one of those ugly trolls. What are you doing here? </string>
<string name="2925">Eh... You might not be green, but you sure look a fair bit like those ugly trolls. What do you want?</string>
<string name="2926">It&apos;s about time you ended that spell. Er... sorry. Old habit.</string>
<string name="2927">Well, thank you again for the assistance, even if it was a bit slow. Try to stay safe.</string>
<string name="2928">You be good. Come visit us in Waterdeep and I&apos;ll bake you some cookies.</string>
<string name="2929">My name is Janis. Hope you can learn that better than my boy.</string>
<string name="2930">Not too bright are you? I just hope you have more manners than those slobbering trolls.</string>
<string name="2931">You haven&apos;t saved me yet. I&apos;ll thank you when you have.</string>
<string name="2932">So now I get to the worst part. Even though you have killed all of the trolls and ogres, I can&apos;t get free. I don&apos;t know how long the spell will last, but I&apos;m going to die if I don&apos;t get out of here soon.</string>
<string name="2933">I need you to go find my son.</string>
<string name="2934">I need you to find Revat. He has a ring that was his father&apos;s. The ring has a one-time cancellation spell on it. I created it to protect Revat from spellcasters who might seek to harm me by harming my child.</string>
<string name="2935">Are you telling me what to do? You&apos;re just lucky I didn&apos;t plan on going anywhere else for the day. Don&apos;t be too long though.</string>
<string name="2936">I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s not that easy. </string>
<string name="2937">I see that you have the ring from Revat. If you would just touch me with the ring, it should negate the spell.</string>
<string name="2938">You&apos;re back, huh? You certainly took your sweet time. Well?</string>
<string name="2939">Only when I&apos;ve gone without food or water for a couple of days.</string>
<string name="2940">Why don&apos;t I just tell you the whole story? It&apos;s easier to explain that way. You see, I am a mage of no small accomplishment, but I also am fascinated by archeology.</string>
<string name="2941">I was with a troop of archeologists and we were exploring these caves. I became interested in an unusual pattern on the cave walls and accidentally became separated from the others. Then I heard the screams.</string>
<string name="2942">Don&apos;t interrupt. No respect for your elders, that&apos;s the problem with your generation.</string>
<string name="2943">Figured that out all by yourself, eh? </string>
<string name="2944">Then the largest troll I have ever seen came back into the cave. He seemed surprised to see me, which was all that saved me. He started to hoot and shout to the others, then came bounding across the floor. </string>
<string name="2945">Oh sure. Leave an old woman to die of thirst and starvation. My painful death is on you!</string>
<string name="2946">I began to cast a spell, but the sight of the blood on his claws caused me to slip in the incantation. I had meant to encase him in Otiluke&apos;s Resilient Sphere, a very rare, but useful spell.</string>
<string name="2947">Have a little patience. I&apos;m almost done.</string>
<string name="2948">The spell sucked back on me and trapped me in a form-fitting, impenetrable force field. I couldn&apos;t move, but the trolls couldn&apos;t hurt me either. They were so impressed, I think they thought I was a goddess.</string>
<string name="2949">Watch your tongue young &lt;man/woman&gt;. There is no excuse for being disrespectful to your elders.</string>
<string name="2950">There is enough room in this &apos;shell&apos; for me to talk. When I could talk, but they couldn&apos;t hurt me, they started bowing down and bringing me gifts. Not that I could accept them, but they brought them anyway.</string>
<string name="2951">We had some outbuildings on the surface near here. He would have stayed there worrying about me. You had better go quickly; the thirst is starting to get to me.</string>
<string name="2952">I will surely be dead later. Please, I know I was short-tempered with you, but don&apos;t let me die. I beg you.</string>
<string name="2953">My death is on your soul. You have doomed me.</string>
<string name="2954">Oh, thank you. That feels better. Well? What are you standing around, wasting time for? Don&apos;t you have other things you should be doing?</string>
<string name="2955">The ring has a one-time cancellation spell on it. I created it to protect Revat from spellcasters who might seek to harm me by harming my child.</string>
<string name="2956">Oh, please don&apos;t do that! I will die without it. I beg you.</string>
<string name="2957">My name is Janis and I was a prisoner of those monsters. Well, kind of a prisoner.</string>
<string name="2958">Actually, it&apos;s not quite that easy.</string>
<string name="2959">Don&apos;t strain yourself trying to think it through.</string>
<string name="2960">By the time I got back to where they were, everyone had either been killed, or had fled. I was very concerned for my son Revat. He is a little slow of mind. In a quick glimpse I noticed that his body wasn&apos;t on the ground.</string>
<string name="2961">You seem rather nervous. What&apos;s your name?</string>
<string name="2962">I don&apos;t look like who?</string>
<string name="2963">Who you be?</string>
<string name="2964">Me not look like who?</string>
<string name="2965">I am &lt;FirstName&gt;. What creatures are you talking about?</string>
<string name="2966">My name is &lt;FullName&gt; and I am interested in hearing more about these creatures.</string>
<string name="2967">Nevermind my name, what are these creatures you are looking for?</string>
<string name="2968">Me be &lt;FirstName&gt;. What creatures you hunt?</string>
<string name="2969">Me name be &lt;FullName&gt; and me want know more about creatures.</string>
<string name="2970">You not need know name. You tell me about creatures.</string>
<string name="2971">Maybe we should start with introductions.</string>
<string name="2972">Trolls? Tell me more!</string>
<string name="2973">Trolls. You tell me &apos;bout trolls.</string>
<string name="2974">So you are looking for dead things?</string>
<string name="2975">You mean you want find dead thing?</string>
<string name="2976">Trolls? Ogres? Tell me more about them.</string>
<string name="2977">Tell me more about this creator race.</string>
<string name="2978">What kind of treasure are you suggesting?</string>
<string name="2979">I think I&apos;ve heard enough. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2980">Me want know about trolls.</string>
<string name="2981">What more you know about creator race?</string>
<string name="2982">Treasure? Me want hear more &apos;bout treasure.</string>
<string name="2983">Me grow bored. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="2984">What you need for to prove?</string>
<string name="2985">I could help you look for this ancient tome.</string>
<string name="2986">I&apos;m not really interested.</string>
<string name="2987">I help you get tome.</string>
<string name="2988">Me not care for books. Me find other things to do.</string>
<string name="2989">What were you looking for again?</string>
<string name="2990">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I want to help you find that book. How much will you pay me?</string>
<string name="2991">This wouldn&apos;t happen to be the book you are looking for, would it?</string>
<string name="2992">You say what you looking for again?</string>
<string name="2993">Me want look for book. How much you pay?</string>
<string name="2994">Maybe this be book you want?</string>
<string name="2995">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="2996">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You wouldn&apos;t believe the hell I had to go through to get this. Surely you could afford a little more.</string>
<string name="2997">You better fork over more than that or you&apos;ll get to experience all the pain I suffered recovering the darn thing.</string>
<string name="2998">Certainly, that sounds fine by me.</string>
<string name="2999">Not a chance. Finders keepers you know.</string>
<string name="3000">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me work hard to find. Me want more.</string>
<string name="3001">Me show you how much it hurt to find &apos;less you give me more!</string>
<string name="3002">That seem fair.</string>
<string name="3003">No selling! Me keeping book. Finders keepers.</string>
<string name="3004">All right. 750 gold pieces it is.</string>
<string name="3005">Okay. 750 gp.</string>
<string name="3006">I don&apos;t think so. I can get a better price from someone else, I think.</string>
<string name="3007">Nope, me sell for more to someone else.</string>
<string name="3008">That sounds better. Hand over the gold.</string>
<string name="3009">Nope, I&apos;m keeping it.</string>
<string name="3010">That be better. Here you book.</string>
<string name="3011">Nope, me keep.</string>
<string name="3012">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; All right. I hate to part with it for only 500 gp, though... </string>
<string name="3013">I guess I need the 500 gold more than the book.</string>
<string name="3014">That&apos;s all right. I can find someone else who will pay me for it, I think.</string>
<string name="3015">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Mmmm... okay. But me likes it a lot... 500 gold pieces seems not so much.</string>
<string name="3016">Me guesses 500 gold pieces is okay.</string>
<string name="3017">Nope. Me sell someone else for more.</string>
<string name="3018">Where did you say you thought that book was?</string>
<string name="3019">I think I found your book, is this it?</string>
<string name="3020">No, nothing yet.</string>
<string name="3021">Quit being so pushy! I&apos;ll get around to finding it.</string>
<string name="3022">Found it, me thinks. This it?</string>
<string name="3023">Nope. But me working on it.</string>
<string name="3024">You no bug me. Me find when good and ready to find.</string>
<string name="3025">Where me find book again?</string>
<string name="3026">Okay, goodbye.</string>
<string name="3027">What did you do then?</string>
<string name="3028">Obviously you didn&apos;t hire good guards!</string>
<string name="3029">I&apos;m sorry for your grief.</string>
<string name="3030">Get to the point.</string>
<string name="3031">Me sorry they die.</string>
<string name="3032">Hurry up.</string>
<string name="3033">What you do?</string>
<string name="3034">Why you no hire big, strong guards?</string>
<string name="3035">When did they fight dragons?</string>
<string name="3036">How long ago did this supposedly take place?</string>
<string name="3037">When fight dragons?</string>
<string name="3038">When this maybe happen?</string>
<string name="3039">And you think you can prove this race existed?</string>
<string name="3040">Grant money? Is that what you are worried about?</string>
<string name="3041">What is the grant money for?</string>
<string name="3042">What grant money?</string>
<string name="3043">Ah! You care &apos;bout money. That me understand.</string>
<string name="3044">That would be just fine.</string>
<string name="3045">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This sounds very dangerous. I think some money up front would be justified.</string>
<string name="3046">That be good.</string>
<string name="3047">All right, I&apos;m off.</string>
<string name="3048">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; This sound dangerous. Me want gold first to do job.</string>
<string name="3049">Me off.</string>
<string name="3050">Good enough, for now.</string>
<string name="3051">Me agree, for now.</string>
<string name="3052">What&apos;s your name again?</string>
<string name="3053">What you called?</string>
<string name="3054">What kind of research do you do here?</string>
<string name="3055">What re-search? What you do here?</string>
<string name="3056">Research? You mean you&apos;re hunting creatures?</string>
<string name="3057">Uhh... you mean you hunts stuff?</string>
<string name="3058"></string>
<string name="3059">Help! Attack! What? Who? Er... oh... um... you don&apos;t look like... nevermind. Hello &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="3060"></string>
<string name="3061">You are back already? What can I help you with now?</string>
<string name="3062">Er... oh, you&apos;re already back. What can I do to help you? Any evidence of the tome yet?</string>
<string name="3063">Ah, yes... you are with &lt;CUSTOM2402&gt;, correct? I&apos;m glad that more could join on this quest.</string>
<string name="3064">I am off for Waterdeep. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="3065">My name is Jax. Professor Jax, a famous archeologist don&apos;t you know. I am looking for knowledge about some ancient creatures. That&apos;s why I came here. Who are you?</string>
<string name="3066">Er... trolls of course. Like the ones that attacked my expedition.</string>
<string name="3067">Actually you kind of talk like them though.</string>
<string name="3068">Trolls attacked a group of us in a cave to the north. We were there searching for an entrance to... ah but maybe I should start with an introduction.</string>
<string name="3069">I am talking about a creator race. Very fascinating actually. I believe they lived thousands of years ago and I think one of their ruins lies somewhere around here.</string>
<string name="3070">Oh, a fellow scholar are you? Let me tell you about my research.</string>
<string name="3071">Oh, I&apos;m not actually hunting them, dear &lt;boy/girl&gt;. They are already dead.</string>
<string name="3072">Oh... oh my, that hardly seems to be a polite way to start a conversation. Are you sure you&apos;re not a troll? I suppose not.</string>
<string name="3073">No, no, no, I am looking for proof of the existence of this race.</string>
<string name="3074">You see, some fellow archeologists and I were hunting through the cave systems in the area to find an entrance to some ruins that lie beneath them. It was a marvelous expedition, or so it seemed.</string>
<string name="3075">I was studying a rock formation in one of the caves when they attacked us. We had some guards with us and they were holding the ogres off, but the trolls killed them as easily as children.</string>
<string name="3076">Not too much is known about them. They were very powerful and it is speculated that they fought for control of Toril against the dragons.</string>
<string name="3077">If they were as advanced as I think they were then they should have left behind some writings.</string>
<string name="3078">If I could get my hands on a book that proves these ruins were built by the creator race, then I could get the rest of my grant money. I need to find a Complete History of the Ruins.</string>
<string name="3079">You know what I&apos;m looking for! We already talked about this. All right, I&apos;ll go over the important parts again.</string>
<string name="3080">Oh my. I was really hoping you could help. If you change your mind come talk to me again.</string>
<string name="3081">Oh my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, that would be wonderful. And since I need this for my own financial gain, I would pay you 500 gold pieces and you can keep any treasure you find. Here is a key for the barracks. You can talk to my colleagues inside for more information.</string>
<string name="3082">Hmm. Well I guess I do need the help. I could pay you 500 gold pieces if you bring it to me. Here is a key for the barracks. You can talk to my colleagues inside for more information.</string>
<string name="3083">I suppose I don&apos;t have much choice, since no one else will go do it. I can pay you 500 gold pieces if you find it for me. Here is a key for the barracks. You can talk to my colleagues inside for more information.</string>
<string name="3084">Just find me a tome that proves the creator race existed and that they built these ruins. Bring it back to me as quickly as you can.</string>
<string name="3085">Oh. That&apos;s too bad. If you change your mind, just speak to me again.</string>
<string name="3086">Er... well, if they were powerful enough to contend with dragons, as I think they were, then they must have had some powerful magic items. Not to mention wealth. The trolls might have some treasure too.</string>
<string name="3087">Oh dear, your memory is shorter than mine! As I said before, I am looking for an ancient tome I need. So far I have had little luck.</string>
<string name="3088">Er... yes, well, goodbye again.</string>
<string name="3089">Er... um... oh, yes! Astounding! How did you get past the trolls? No, it is of no import. What matters is you have it now.</string>
<string name="3090">Well, excellent job young &lt;lad/lass&gt;. So... I trust 500 gold pieces is ample reward for recovering this book?</string>
<string name="3091">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh my. Well, I guess it was probably very tough. I hope that 750 gold will cover it. That&apos;s all I have left.</string>
<string name="3092">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; 500 gold pieces is all I can afford right now. You wouldn&apos;t break an agreement, would you?</string>
<string name="3093">Er... good. I must return to Waterdeep now. Good luck to you.</string>
<string name="3094">Wait! Please, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! 1000 gp, no more!</string>
<string name="3095">Part of me wishes the trolls got you. Oh my, I can&apos;t believe I said that. I&apos;ve got to get back to civilization.</string>
<string name="3096">Oh... er... why did you even come back here then, if you were going to keep it?</string>
<string name="3097">No one will pay you more than I would have, because no one wants it as badly. What a mistake! Fine, goodbye.</string>
<string name="3098">Oh my, you must have had a rough time. No need to get jumpy. Here is 750 gp. It&apos;s all that I have left.</string>
<string name="3099">Wonderful. I can hardly wait to get back to Waterdeep. Those snobs are going to choke when they see this! Good luck &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="3100">No! It is of no value to you, but I simply must have it. Please!</string>
<string name="3101">I think there are ruins underneath the cave systems in this area. The book should be in there somewhere.</string>
<string name="3102">Good luck in the search young &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="3103">Er... um... well I guess there&apos;s not much else to say. Keep hunting.</string>
<string name="3104">I paid an advance already, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. I expect a get-to-it attitude for that kind of money. Is there anything else?</string>
<string name="3105">Oh, I don&apos;t think you understand how important this is. This could really help our understanding of the historical roots of society.</string>
<string name="3106">Um... so... have you any news? Any clues to the tome&apos;s whereabouts yet?</string>
<string name="3107">We ran for our lives. The guards gave us enough time for a few of us to get away. But not enough. Not nearly enough.</string>
<string name="3108">We hired what we could afford. And we paid for our mistake.</string>
<string name="3109">I figured there should be lots of treasure and tomes created by this race. But then we were attacked by the trolls and ogres.</string>
<string name="3110">All that death has come to nothing! So many sacrifices and we still don&apos;t have the proof I need about the creator race.</string>
<string name="3111">You sound like the supposed &apos;scholars&apos; in Waterdeep. Always sneering in disbelief.</string>
<string name="3112">This happened over 10,000 years ago. Even before the first human civilization of the Netheril came into power.</string>
<string name="3113">They used powerful spells, creating magical effects and items that can only be dreamed of now that the gods have limited its use.</string>
<string name="3114">No, no, no! The money is necessary to keep funding my research.</string>
<string name="3115">The money goes to pay for guards, supplies and equipment, as well as the expertise of other researchers. Without that money, I cannot learn more.</string>
<string name="3116">That is why it is so important that I find this proof.</string>
<string name="3117">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; That seems reasonable. Here is 100 gp. That should seal the deal.</string>
<string name="3118">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I just can&apos;t afford to do that. I can only pay you when you bring the artfiact back.</string>
<string name="3119">Be careful &lt;lad/lass&gt;. This has turned out to be a very difficult operation. Good luck.</string>
<string name="3120">Oh, hello there again. Er... something you needed? I am quite busy with my research, you know.</string>
<string name="3121">Oh. I wouldn&apos;t expect someone of your limited... uh... that is, it&apos;s always pleasant to see someone interested in my research! Let me tell you about it.</string>
<string name="3122">Who are you?</string>
<string name="3123">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="3124">Who you be?</string>
<string name="3125">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="3126">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="3127">My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;. </string>
<string name="3128">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. I&apos;m pleased to meet you.</string>
<string name="3129">You don&apos;t need to know my name.</string>
<string name="3130">I don&apos;t usually share my name with cretins.</string>
<string name="3131">Me name be &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="3132">Me be called &lt;FullName&gt;. Nice meet you.</string>
<string name="3133">You not need know name.</string>
<string name="3134">You grumpy. Me not tell.</string>
<string name="3135">What&apos;s put you in this mood?</string>
<string name="3136">You&apos;re certainly miserable.</string>
<string name="3137">Why you in such bad mood?</string>
<string name="3138">Why you got stick up butt?</string>
<string name="3139">You don&apos;t think the ruins exist?</string>
<string name="3140">You no think there be ruins?</string>
<string name="3141">You&apos;re miserable. I&apos;m done talking to you.</string>
<string name="3142">You too grumpy. Me no talk no more.</string>
<string name="3143">Nothing?</string>
<string name="3144">I have no idea.</string>
<string name="3145">Me not know.</string>
<string name="3146">Oh, I&apos;m sorry. That&apos;s horrible.</string>
<string name="3147">Guess you should have been paying better attention.</string>
<string name="3148">Me sorry. That bad to happen to you brother.</string>
<string name="3149">Ha! That be funny to see.</string>
<string name="3150">What would you be willing to pay to have these trolls and ogres wiped out?</string>
<string name="3151">That sounds like an important job. I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="3152">What&apos;s your name?</string>
<string name="3153">Why are you in such a bad mood?</string>
<string name="3154">What you name?</string>
<string name="3155">What happen &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="3156">What&apos;s going on around here?</string>
<string name="3157">Why you bad mood?</string>
<string name="3158">What exactly can&apos;t you stand?</string>
<string name="3159">What you no stand?</string>
<string name="3160">What you pay me kill trolls &apos;n&apos; ogres?</string>
<string name="3161">Me like kill trolls. Me do job.</string>
<string name="3162">I&apos;m not interested. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="3163">Me no want that job. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="3164">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think it would be a sign of good faith if you fronted me some of that gold.</string>
<string name="3165">All right, I&apos;m off.</string>
<string name="3166">Me want some gold now, else me make you troll-bait.</string>
<string name="3167">You better give me some of that gold right now, or else I&apos;ll take you with me for bait.</string>
<string name="3168">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me think me should have some gold now, please?</string>
<string name="3169">Me go kill trolls now.</string>
<string name="3170">What do you want done again?</string>
<string name="3171">I have the troll&apos;s head right here.</string>
<string name="3172">I&apos;ve changed my mind, I&apos;ll hunt the trolls for you.</string>
<string name="3173">No. I&apos;m still not interested.</string>
<string name="3174">What you want again?</string>
<string name="3175">I have big ugly&apos;s head here.</string>
<string name="3176">Me want hunt trolls now.</string>
<string name="3177">Me not want job still.</string>
<string name="3178">The whole thing.</string>
<string name="3179">A summary.</string>
<string name="3180">I need no reward. Avenging a life and slaying evil is reward enough.</string>
<string name="3181">As we agreed, that will be fine.</string>
<string name="3182">You had better find some more, or I&apos;ll make you look like this troll.</string>
<string name="3183">No pay. I glad I avenge brother and kill trolls.</string>
<string name="3184">That be good.</string>
<string name="3185">You pay more, or me cut your head off too.</string>
<string name="3186">What was I supposed to do again?</string>
<string name="3187">I&apos;m working on it.</string>
<string name="3188">What me do again?</string>
<string name="3189">Me trying. Just wait.</string>
<string name="3190">Sure.</string>
<string name="3191">No thanks.</string>
<string name="3192">What do you want? Ah, my apologies &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I&apos;m in a foul temper today. How can I help you?</string>
<string name="3193">What do you want? Sorry, I&apos;m in a foul temper today. How can I help you?</string>
<string name="3194">What do you want? I&apos;ve had enough trouble and I&apos;m in a foul temper today. How can I help you?</string>
<string name="3195">I see you are back again. Have you changed your mind about killing those trolls?</string>
<string name="3196">So you&apos;re back. Do you have the head of the troll chieftain yet?</string>
<string name="3197">Well, I&apos;ll be off now. Farewell.</string>
<string name="3198">My name is Lenton. Now what&apos;s your name?</string>
<string name="3199">Fine. So like I said, what do you want?</string>
<string name="3200">All right, I&apos;m sorry. It&apos;s just that a plague of locusts couldn&apos;t make things worse.</string>
<string name="3201">Well, aren&apos;t we in just a dandy cheerful mood today!</string>
<string name="3202">Oh, just too special to share, huh?</string>
<string name="3203">How about we start with creator-race-obsessed Jax and his stupid expedition to find ruins that don&apos;t exist.</string>
<string name="3204">Maybe before you judge people, you ought to find out if they have a reason for being upset.</string>
<string name="3205">Fine. That actually improves my day!</string>
<string name="3206">Oh, I did. Jax had me totally convinced. But we searched through cavern after cavern. And you know what we found?</string>
<string name="3207">Blast! I wish we had found nothing.</string>
<string name="3208">We found trolls! And ogres! Hordes of trolls and their pet ogres. No ancient creatures, no tombs, no tomes, just trolls and ogres.</string>
<string name="3209">We were studying this unusual rock formation, because Jax thought it might be special. But it wasn&apos;t. Suddenly I hear this scream.</string>
<string name="3210">I turned around and there&apos;s this huge troll holding my brother, Drokas, by one leg. It dangles him upside down and then... it bites his head off.</string>
<string name="3211">You&apos;re exactly the kind of person I need to help me get revenge.</string>
<string name="3212">I don&apos;t need your pity! I need your help.</string>
<string name="3213">The one that... ate my brother was obviously the leader. He started pointing and snarling and a whole tribe, or whatever you&apos;re supposed to call a group of trolls, rushed out and started to attack us. </string>
<string name="3214">Only a few of us escaped from those caves. I want someone to go back there and wipe out every one of those trolls. Especially the big one.</string>
<string name="3215">I guess I&apos;ll try. Don&apos;t waste my time though.</string>
<string name="3216">Nothing! We&apos;re all just standing around doing nothing. I can&apos;t stand it anymore.</string>
<string name="3217">Ya, bye.</string>
<string name="3218">Excellent. Bring me the troll Chieftain&apos;s head and I will pay you 300 gold.</string>
<string name="3219">All I can afford to pay you is 300 gold. That&apos;s all I have left after this fool&apos;s errand. So what do you think?</string>
<string name="3220">Like I should be surprised. If you decide to develop a backbone, just come back here.</string>
<string name="3221">Okay. Good luck and happy hunting.</string>
<string name="3222">That&apos;s an excellent attitude for a hunter. All right, here&apos;s 100 gold.</string>
<string name="3223">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Okay. I guess I could pay you 100 gold. But I expect results!</string>
<string name="3224">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I can&apos;t do that. You bring me a head, I give you the gold. That&apos;s the only deal you are getting.</string>
<string name="3225">Oh for pity&apos;s sake. All right, do you need the whole story again, or just a summary?</string>
<string name="3226">I want you to go down into the caves and kill all of the trolls. Then bring me back the big guy&apos;s head.</string>
<string name="3227">So, are you up for the job?</string>
<string name="3228">Then why are you bothering me? Don&apos;t talk to me unless you want to hunt some trolls.</string>
<string name="3229">Finally! My brother is avenged. I am very impressed with your skill.</string>
<string name="3230">I will take that off your hands and burn it with pleasure. I wish I had more gold to pay you, but 300 is all I have. Sorry there isn&apos;t more.</string>
<string name="3231">You are an honorable &lt;man/woman&gt;. I shall tell everyone I know of your heroic deeds.</string>
<string name="3232">Very well. Good luck to you in the future. I am off.</string>
<string name="3233">I guess I should have expected such a comment from your type. You can threaten all you want. You won&apos;t find anymore money on my corpse.</string>
<string name="3234">Here is your 300 gold, just as I promised. Now, I am off.</string>
<string name="3235">Oh, for pity&apos;s sake! I want you to go down into the caves and kill the trolls. Bring back the big troll&apos;s head. </string>
<string name="3236">Now, get going and finish the job.</string>
<string name="3237">All right, well keep trying. I&apos;ll be waiting.</string>
<string name="3238">I don&apos;t understand what you are saying.</string>
<string name="3239">Yes, I can understand you.</string>
<string name="3240">That doesn&apos;t sound like the proper tone of voice for one who was beaten, but I understand what you say.</string>
<string name="3241">Me know what you say. What you be?</string>
<string name="3242">Me not like way you talk. You watch mouth or me take you head.</string>
<string name="3243">Me not know what you say.</string>
<string name="3244">I don&apos;t know what you are talking about. We &quot;mammals&quot; rule the world.</string>
<string name="3245">You talk as if you just won the battle. Why aren&apos;t you afraid of me?</string>
<string name="3246">What you mean? We rule world.</string>
<string name="3247">Me just beat you. Why you no afraid of me?</string>
<string name="3248">Slaves? We are nobody&apos;s slaves.</string>
<string name="3249">I&apos;m not answering any of your questions until you answer mine.</string>
<string name="3250">Slaves? Me no be slave to anyone.</string>
<string name="3251">Me not answer questions &apos;til you answer mine.</string>
<string name="3252">They don&apos;t really rule much of anything. Are you concerned about dragons?</string>
<string name="3253">If you don&apos;t answer my questions right now, I&apos;m going to slit your slimy throat!</string>
<string name="3254">I&apos;m not talking to you anymore. Get out of my sight.</string>
<string name="3255">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Dragons? Does your race fear the power of the dragons?</string>
<string name="3256">What are you?</string>
<string name="3257">Who are you?</string>
<string name="3258">Not rule, but do fly. You worry &apos;bout dragons?</string>
<string name="3259">You answer me questions now, or me cut heads off.</string>
<string name="3260">You bothering me. Go away quick.</string>
<string name="3261">I can tell you that I am getting rather tired of being called a mammal. Call me &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="3262">What are you doing here?</string>
<string name="3263">What you be?</string>
<string name="3264">Who you be?</string>
<string name="3265">What you do here?</string>
<string name="3266">That doesn&apos;t answer my question.</string>
<string name="3267">I don&apos;t trust you. I think I had better kill you.</string>
<string name="3268">That not good answer! No make any sense.</string>
<string name="3269">Me no trust you. Me kill you now.</string>
<string name="3270">You say we. Who are you refering to?</string>
<string name="3271">What makes you think your race will dominate ours?</string>
<string name="3272">Me just beat you. What make you think you take us over?</string>
<string name="3273">You will answer my questions now!</string>
<string name="3274">You answer me questions now, or else!</string>
<string name="3275">I have more questions.</string>
<string name="3276">Me have more question.</string>
<string name="3277">I have more questions.</string>
<string name="3278">Me have another question.</string>
<string name="3279">Who is this queen you speak of?</string>
<string name="3280">Who be you queen?</string>
<string name="3281">I would ask you more questions.</string>
<string name="3282">Me want ask more question.</string>
<string name="3283">If you are so powerful, then how was I able to defeat you?</string>
<string name="3284">If you so tough, why me beat you so easy?</string>
<string name="3285">Essa sythider cansticyle, vassa! Vassa! Vassa!</string>
<string name="3286">Fregan paeca, fregan paeca. Sussenda messa!</string>
<string name="3287">Syssin weras goola sisni?</string>
<string name="3288">Posna! Eck canessa tallak!</string>
<string name="3289">There! That brood spell should enable us to converse. Can you understand me, mammal?</string>
<string name="3290">Why are you in here? How does a soft, weak mammal like yourself dare to enter this room?</string>
<string name="3291">Such a thing cannot be. How could your slave race have risen so high?</string>
<string name="3292">I... I am unused to being in a subordinate position. It is hard for me to get used to. How is it that a slave race could become this powerful?</string>
<string name="3293">We might no longer be in power, or so you say, but then surely the draconic race must rule the surface as they used to rule the skies?</string>
<string name="3294">All right, mammal. I suppose I should humor your request, since I did surrender. What questions would you ask of me? </string>
<string name="3295">As if I would turn tail and flee from a mammal like you. You have given me enough time to recover. </string>
<string name="3296">Hm. You mammals have become more intelligent than we had suspected. Interesting.</string>
<string name="3297">My, a sense of identity. You are much like the Sentiegans. It didn&apos;t take long for their resistance to be broken. It should be amusing to see what becomes of your civilized manners when our race dominates yours again.</string>
<string name="3298">I am a member of a race that is highly superior to yours. We are masters of flesh, mind and spirit.</string>
<string name="3299">You have given me enough time to recover.</string>
<string name="3300">I remember being in a dark, peaceful sleep. I thought it would never end, but my companions and I awoke when we heard a call from our Queen. May her all-knowing, all-powerful wisdom guide us to our glorious destiny. </string>
<string name="3301">Someday soon your race will once again fall under our domination.</string>
<string name="3302">So the winged masters have been weakened? Excellent. Do you mean to tell me that you mammals aren&apos;t ruled by a greater race?</string>
<string name="3303">It would, if your race had true intelligence, but I will speak so that one such as you can understand. We are the master race, created perfect in form and mind, and meant to rule the lesser races. </string>
<string name="3304">My name is Synsilliusarian, though I doubt your fleshy tongue could possibly pronounce such a noble name. I am a mage of the Calantian Order. </string>
<string name="3305">Though it will mean nothing to you now, once we have dominated your race again you will learn how great of an honor it is to have spoken with me.</string>
<string name="3306">You haven&apos;t even the slightest idea of what you face. You will learn, in time. Is your mind completely worn out from the effort of communicating, or do you have other questions?</string>
<string name="3307">(Sigh) That such a small, barbaric mind could defeat us. This is a sad day.</string>
<string name="3308">This is very hard to understand. Things have obviously changed greatly.</string>
<string name="3309">Now you die!</string>
<string name="3310">Now it is you who shall die!</string>
<string name="3311">She is the Tykalatian Matriarch. She is power beyond understanding. Cunning beyond belief. You will fall to her, as all have fallen before. That is all I will tell you.</string>
<string name="3312">I remember being in a dark, peaceful sleep. I thought it would never end, but my companions and I awoke when we heard a call from our Queen. May her all-knowing, all-powerful wisdom guide us to our glorious destiny. </string>
<string name="3313">Her words whispered in my mind, communicating visions of conquest and power. The entire world would bow before us, begging for mercy and receiving none. </string>
<string name="3314">Since awakening we have not heard from her again, but when she speaks we will go forth and conquer. </string>
<string name="3315">We possess incredible magics, the likes of which your puny mages can only dream of. Our warriors are fearless and nearly unstoppable.</string>
<string name="3316">I have not been awake long. Perhaps I have simply not recovered my full strength. Be assured, when my queen decides that it is time, we shall come forth and show you what real power is.</string>
<string name="3317">Sounds bad. What&apos;s your name?</string>
<string name="3318">There, there, fellow. It&apos;ll be all right. May I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="3319">Don&apos;t you think you&apos;re a little old to be crying like that? What&apos;s your name?</string>
<string name="3320">Uh, don&apos;t worry, maybe I can help. Why don&apos;t you answer some questions for me first?</string>
<string name="3321">Oh quit your blubbering and tell me who you are.</string>
<string name="3322">Yeah, whatever. I have a question.</string>
<string name="3323">You so sad. Who you?</string>
<string name="3324">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="3325">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="3326">Call me &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>

<string name="3335">Who you?</string>

<string name="3337">Where would they be keeping your mom?</string>
<string name="3338">What would you pay to get your mom back?</string>
<string name="3339">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll save her for you.</string>

<string name="3555">There no be screams. No worry, me kill trolls.</string>
<string name="3556">Oh great. Now what me do with crazy person?</string>
<string name="3557">I&apos;ve already killed a number of trolls. Now, what&apos;s your name?</string>
<string name="3558">I can handle trolls. What is wrong with you? Have you lost your mind?</string>
<string name="3559">Me kill lots of trolls. Tell me what name you have.</string>
<string name="3560">Me can take trolls. Why you so crazy?</string>
<string name="3561">I guess you have an excuse. Don&apos;t worry, I have already killed a number of trolls.</string>
<string name="3562">I don&apos;t have time to escort you back to the surface, but the way should be clear.</string>
<string name="3563">Do you want me to take you to the surface?</string>

<string name="3572">That&apos;s horrible. They did it right in front of you?</string>
<string name="3573">Enough whining already! I&apos;m getting out of here, with or without you.</string>
<string name="3574">Me sorry that happen, but you no worry, me kill lots of trolls.</string>
<string name="3575">That awful. You see them eat friends?</string>
<string name="3576">You quit crying! Me go now, with you or not, me no care.</string>
<string name="3577">Ahh! Don&apos;t eat me please!</string>
<string name="3578">You... you aren&apos;t a troll are you?</string>
<string name="3579">Then please help me. I need to get out of here. They&apos;re coming to kill me and eat me.</string>
<string name="3580">I can hear them. I can hear them coming. Can&apos;t you hear them? Can&apos;t you hear the screams? They&apos;re eating the others.</string>
<string name="3581">I don&apos;t know. I... I guess not. But they are close.</string>
<string name="3582">You? You can&apos;t kill the trolls. They killed all the guards, they&apos;ll kill you too.</string>
<string name="3583">Crazy? Me? Yes, maybe I am. Maybe I have imagined all of this. Maybe the other four are still alive. Perhaps I never saw the trolls come here. </string>
<string name="3584">You could be right. The trolls didn&apos;t come in and tear the others apart. They didn&apos;t rip off limbs and chew the flesh from the bone.</string>
<string name="3585">Too many! There are too many. And just when you think you&apos;ve killed one, it pulls itself back up and starts to attack again. No, we have to flee!</string>
<string name="3586">Yes, I will go by myself. Then the trolls will eat you while I escape. The trolls will get you. And if they don&apos;t, the other thing will.</string>
<string name="3587">No! The trolls will eat you. They will find you. And even if they don&apos;t, the other thing will.</string>
<string name="3588">They&apos;re afraid of it. It&apos;s down deep. They won&apos;t go near it.</string>
<string name="3589">Can you imagine something that could scare trolls? They know it is powerful. There is nothing we can do. It will kill them and then it will kill you.</string>
<string name="3590">I must flee now! Good luck.</string>
<string name="3591">I will flee now. You will die so that I might live. Thank you.</string>
<string name="3592">Then it is real? No. Even Kendin? He&apos;s really dead? No. I must get out of here.</string>

<string name="3864">Me not know what you mean.</string>
<string name="3865">I think so, but then what is wrong with the Spirit?</string>

<string name="3873">Me do it.</string>
<string name="3874">What you pay for me to do this?</string>
<string name="3875">Me got other things to do.</string>
<string name="3876">What did you mean when you said some of you went missing?</string>
<string name="3877">What you mean when you say some folk go missing?</string>
<string name="3878">I swear I shall do my best to save the Wood.</string>
<string name="3879">Yeah, yeah, enough with the speeches. I said I would take the job.</string>
<string name="3880">Maybe you should find someone else. I&apos;m rather busy.</string>
<string name="3881">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You shall find I am always very committed - to gold.</string>
<string name="3882">Me swear me do good job!</string>

<string name="3886">What are the names of the missing druids?</string>
<string name="3887">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe you could pay me something in advance?</string>
<string name="3888">That&apos;s all I need. Farewell.</string>
<string name="3889">What be druid&apos;s names who be gone?</string>
<string name="3890">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You give me some gold now, maybe?</string>

<string name="3900">I have cured the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="3901">The Spirit of the Wood is dead.</string>
<string name="3902">What be names of lost druids?</string>

<string name="3906">No. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="3907">Is this one of your druids?</string>
<string name="3908">This be druid, yuh?</string>
<string name="3909">I am happy to have been of service. Thank you for your generosity.</string>
<string name="3910">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I had to die to save your precious Spirit! I think such a sacrifice should be worth a little more than 500 gold.</string>
<string name="3911">You will give me more than 500 gold pieces or maybe I&apos;ll set fire to your precious forest!</string>
<string name="3912">Restoring the balance of nature is reward enough for me. Give the 500 gold pieces to the poor instead.</string>
<string name="3913">Me be glad job done. Thanks for gold.</string>
<string name="3914">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me died to do job. Me think me life worth more than 500 gp.</string>
<string name="3915">You give me more than 500 gold pieces or maybe me burn down whole forest.</string>
<string name="3916">Job need done, so me do. Me no need you gold.</string>
<string name="3917">I am sorry for nature&apos;s loss, but there were no other choices open to me.</string>
<string name="3918">Hey, you win some, you lose some. Either way I still expect to get paid.</string>
<string name="3919">Me sad that had to kill Spirit, but me had no choice.</string>
<string name="3920">What you complain for? Spirit no make animals attack no more. Now you pay me.</string>
<string name="3921">I understand. Please accept my apology and my gratitude for what you could give.</string>
<string name="3922">Saving the forest is more important than a reward. Take all of the gold and do what you can.</string>
<string name="3923">No! We had a deal and you had better stick with it or else!</string>
<string name="3924">Me sorry. Me thank you for gold and hope you save forest.</string>
<string name="3925">You need save forest. Me let you keep all gold to help.</string>
<string name="3926">You pay me 500 gold now, or else.</string>
<string name="3927">Is there anything that I can do as a druid to assist the grove?</string>
<string name="3928">There be stuff me do as druid here?</string>
<string name="3929">Is there anything else that I can do to assist the grove?</string>
<string name="3930">There be stuff me do for grove?</string>
<string name="3931">Where were the druids last seen?</string>
<string name="3932">Where druids be seen last?</string>
<string name="3933">Ah, a fellow child of nature. Be welcome here. How may I be of service?</string>
<string name="3934">Hello there. All of nature&apos;s creatures are welcome to this grove. How can I help you?</string>
<string name="3935">I am the Archdruid Aawill and you are &lt;FullName&gt;.</string>
<string name="3936">The wind stole your name from your lips and carried it to the trees, who whispered it to me.</string>
<string name="3937">Nature doesn&apos;t lie to her allies.</string>
<string name="3938">Now, how may I help you?</string>
<string name="3939">This is a druid grove. Here, those who truly revere nature gather to discuss, to contemplate, to learn, and even to challenge nature. Usually there are more of us here, but several of our members have gone missing.</string>
<string name="3940">There are many different philosophies about nature, which we spend time arguing, but right now the topic has mainly centered on the missing druids.</string>
<string name="3941">It is a long story, but I sense that you are a &lt;man/woman&gt; of action, so I shall try to be brief.</string>
<string name="3942">I am sad to hear that. If you would like to know how you could help restore the natural order, please return and speak to me again. </string>
<string name="3943">Until recently, this wood was a relatively peaceful place. The nymphs of the wood protected the creatures and the natural order reigned.</string>
<string name="3944">But now something has gone terribly wrong. The creatures have become overly aggressive, attacking anyone they lay eyes on, including those who are considered friends of nature.</string>
<string name="3945">We can&apos;t even seem to communicate with the animals. It is like their minds have been driven mad. They simply want to destroy.</string>
<string name="3946">Yes, nature has her ferocious side, but she has a tender side too. It is that side which seems to have disappeared.</string>
<string name="3947">I think that something must be wrong with the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="3948">The Spirit of the Wood is a difficult concept to explain. The forest is not just a group of trees, it is a living being. The Spirit is the protective essence of the Wood.</string>
<string name="3949">It has a mind... of sorts... though it really doesn&apos;t think like either of us. It cares for the creatures that live here, maintaining the circle of existence that includes life and death.</string>
<string name="3950">The Spirit of the Wood can use those who live in the wood to protect its existence. Now it is attacking even those who would be its protectors.</string>
<string name="3951">I do not know what is wrong with the Spirit, but it is obvious that it is using the creatures to strike out at anything foreign. I need someone to find out what is wrong, even though the Spirit will surely try to kill that person.</string>
<string name="3952">(sigh) Patience is a virtue. Patience is a virtue.</string>
<string name="3953">Okay, let me try to explain it like this. Your body is alive and your brain controls your body. The forest is like a body and the Spirit is like the brain. </string>
<string name="3954">So, if you want to swat a mosquito, your mind tells your hand what to do. If the Spirit wants to stop a greedy woodcutter, it might tell a bear to go attack him. Understand?</string>
<string name="3955">Strangely enough, you&apos;re beginning to convince me.</string>
<string name="3956">The wood is alive and it&apos;s acting in a way it never has before!</string>
<string name="3957">Nature is always competitive. We try ourselves in contests against one another, but only druids are allowed to participate in these rites.</string>
<string name="3958">As a druid, you can choose to enter a challenge to become a member of the druidic circle. If you are interested, you should go and speak to Jaer. She organizes the challenges.</string>
<string name="3959">This is not a responsibility to be taken on lightly. I dare not send someone who is only partially committed to the task.</string>
<string name="3960">That is unfortunate, but nature always finds a way to balance herself. I am sure someone of tougher mettle will come along soon.</string>
<string name="3961">Then I thank you for your assistance in this task. There are two jobs that need to be done. I have mentioned the first: to discover what is wrong with the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="3962">The second is to find the missing druids. As the druids were on the same mission as you, it is possible that they might be able to provide you with information you need to complete your primary task.</string>
<string name="3963">If you can help me save the Spirit, I can pay you 500 gp. For each of the druids you rescue, I will give you 300 gp. Is there anything else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="3964">I find your attitude lacking and unappreciative of the importance of this mission. Perhaps if you can gain an appropriate perspective, I could charge you with this trust.</string>
<string name="3965">Please return if you do.</string>
<string name="3966">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose all nature&apos;s children have different goals. So long as you remain a loyal servant to he who pays you.</string>
<string name="3967">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You do not have your heart in the right place. I fear I cannot trust you with such an important charge.</string>
<string name="3968">Silvanus goes with you my child.</string>
<string name="3969">I see that you do indeed have proper instincts for this job. The missing druids include Orlane, Bree and Terari.</string>
<string name="3970">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose I could give you 100 gold pieces to help you get started. Please take care that you always work toward the best interests of nature.</string>
<string name="3971">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I can offer you nothing until you cure the Spirit or return with one of the druids. Show your commitment through perseverance.</string>
<string name="3972">You have returned. What can I help you with?</string>
<string name="3973">Something is wrong with the Spirit of the Wood. Also, some druids are missing. I need help with both problems.</string>
<string name="3974">Farewell again.</string>
<string name="3975">I see you are back. Have you had any luck?</string>
<string name="3976">The druids are Orlane, a halfling; Bree, a human; and Terari, an elf. I hope you find them soon.</string>
<string name="3977">Silvanus be with you.</string>
<string name="3978">Nature thanks you for all you have done. Go with her blessing and mine.</string>
<string name="3979">Steadfast Orlane has returned. It is good to have him back in the circle. Here is your 300 gold, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="3980">I look forward to seeing the completion of your entire mission.</string>
<string name="3981">You have done very well, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. With the Spirit of the Wood cured, we can return to our union with nature and her creatures without fear of destruction.</string>
<string name="3982">Good luck to you my child. May the blessings of Silvanus go with you.</string>
<string name="3983">May the glory of Silvanus shine on your blessed heart &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Nature will surely remember your generous spirit.</string>
<string name="3984">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you did give your all to the task. I guess I could give you an extra 100 gold. </string>
<string name="3985">Here is the 500 gold, as I promised earlier.</string>
<string name="3986">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; There are more rewards in serving nature than just gold. I have paid you what we agreed upon. Be content with what you are given and nature will reward you with a happier Spirit.</string>
<string name="3987">I suppose that nature has both its gentle creatures and its savage beasts. Although I hardly fear your threats, I will give you an extra 100 gold, since this quest has obviously unbalanced you.</string>
<string name="3988">Now I have other matters to attend to. I hope you find a way to soothe the beast inside you someday.</string>
<string name="3989">Alas, that is a great loss to all of nature. The forest will never be the same again. Was it truly necessary for all to come to this?</string>
<string name="3990">Even that is hard to accept. There will be great suffering in the forest without the protection of the Spirit. I can only give you 250 gold, as the rest shall have to go toward helping the forest survive.</string>
<string name="3991">With such a callous attitude, I can see I should never have allowed you to enter the forest. I will still pay you, but only 300 gold, as the rest shall go toward helping the forest survive.</string>
<string name="3992">You obviously did what you thought you had to. I hope you do better in future endeavors.</string>
<string name="3993">I thank you for your concern and generosity. Somehow nature will find a balance and continue on.</string>
<string name="3994">Or else what? Will you challenge the might of the entire circle of druids and all the forces of nature we can bring to bear? I think not. Now take your blood money and leave this place.</string>
<string name="3995">You are no longer welcome here.</string>
<string name="3996">The forest will never be the same.</string>
<string name="3997">We were overjoyed to welcome back dear Bree. Here is your 300 gold, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="3998">My dear friend Terari&apos;s return was welcomed by the grove. Here is your 300 gold, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="3999">Nature herself is impressed with your abilities. Thank you for rescuing all of the druids. I have great hope for the Spirit of the Wood. Good luck.</string>
<string name="4000">If you would like to become a member of the grove you need to speak to Jaer. She sets up the challenges for those who wish to gain acceptance to the circles. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4001">The most important task is to save the Spirit of the Wood. Otherwise, if you would like to become a member of the grove you need to speak to Jaer. She sets up the challenges for those who wish to gain acceptance to the circles. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4002">They entered the deep woods and that is the last anyone has seen of them. Nothing more is known about their location.</string>
<string name="4003">Who says I can&apos;t enter?</string>
<string name="4004">What terrible death?</string>
<string name="4005">Get out of my way or I&apos;ll knock your head off!</string>
<string name="4006">Who say me no go in wood?</string>
<string name="4007">What death be that?</string>
<string name="4008">You get out of way or me knock you head off!</string>
<string name="4009">Halt there! Ye may not enter these woods, lest ye die a terrible death.</string>
<string name="4010">I hear that ye have a contract with the great druid Aawill. Very well then, good luck to ye.</string>
<string name="4011">Me name be Dregin and I be guardin&apos; the woods for the great Archdruid Aawill. The creatures of the wood have turned horrible vicious and Aawill has ordered that no one enter without his permission.</string>
<string name="4012">I&apos;m just tryin&apos; to save yer bloody life, &lt;man/woman&gt;! Go into the grove and speak to Aawill and if ye still want to throw yer life away, I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll let ye pass.</string>
<string name="4013">I told ye to get permission from the druid Aawill. I&apos;ll not be let&apos;n ye past without it.</string>
<string name="4014">Uh, sorry. I didn&apos;t mean to stare.</string>
<string name="4015">Pretty sensitive for a big lug.</string>
<string name="4016">Watch your tone, or I&apos;ll show you how unimpressed I am.</string>
<string name="4017">Uh, me no mean to stare. Sorry.</string>
<string name="4018">Why you upset by me look?</string>
<string name="4019">You watch mouth or me teach you manners.</string>
<string name="4020">Who are you?</string>
<string name="4021">What is this place?</string>
<string name="4022">Who is in charge here?</string>
<string name="4023">Who be you?</string>
<string name="4024">What this place be?</string>
<string name="4025">Who be big boss here?</string>
<string name="4026">What are you talking about? What kind of circles are you defending?</string>
<string name="4027">What you mean you defend circles?</string>
<string name="4028">Nevermind. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4029">So can I challenge you?</string>
<string name="4030">So me fight you then?</string>
<string name="4031">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4032">Is Jaer the one in command here?</string>
<string name="4033">Jaer be big boss then?</string>
<string name="4034">What kind of trouble is that?</string>
<string name="4035">What do you mean protect nature?</string>
<string name="4036">What challenges are these?</string>
<string name="4037">What you mean protect nature?</string>
<string name="4038">What you fight for?</string>
<string name="4039">What did you mean by challenges?</string>
<string name="4040">What you mean when you say challenges?</string>
<string name="4041">What trouble you have?</string>
<string name="4042">What are you lookin&apos; at. Ain&apos;t ya never seen a half-orc druid before?</string>
<string name="4043">Mm. Well be sure that ya don&apos;t go and do it again. Now, was there somethin&apos; that you wanted, or are you just a gawker?</string>
<string name="4044">You had better watch your smart mouth or I might plant you upside down in the ground and see if you grow into a tree. Har! Now, what can I do for ya?</string>
<string name="4045">Har! A &lt;man/woman&gt; with a spine! What an unusual thing. I&apos;m not sure if I want to be your friend or cut your ugly mug off. Har. How can I help ya?</string>
<string name="4046">So you&apos;re back now. What do ya want this time?</string>
<string name="4047">My name is Elgar and I am the first circle defender for the challenges. What else do ya want to know?</string>
<string name="4048">I wish you&apos;d ask someone else; I hate explaining stuff. All right. If you are a druid and you want to join this grove, you have to prove your worth in combat. There are four circles of druids in this grove.</string>
<string name="4049">Jaer decides when you are ready, then you fight against the fourth level defender. You work your way up through the circles until you reach me. Then you lose. Har!</string>
<string name="4050">As I said, Jaer sets these things up. Ya wanna fight, go talk to her.</string>
<string name="4051">That&apos;s what I always say to my opponents! Goodbye, good night, sweet dreams, and then they fall. Har!</string>
<string name="4052">Na, she&apos;s just in charge of settin&apos; up the fights.</string>
<string name="4053">Aawill is the Archdruid. He&apos;s the one to go to if you want to assist the grove with something like the troubles we&apos;re having right now. Jaer is second-in-command, in charge of circle challenges.</string>
<string name="4054">This is the Neverwinter Wood druid grove. This is where we meet to learn about and protect nature. It&apos;s also where we get to challenge ourselves in physical contests. That&apos;s my favorite part.</string>
<string name="4055">Right. Off with your nosey questions. Go find a big red dragon to chat with. Har!</string>
<string name="4056">The creatures in the woods have been acting vicious lately. Like they&apos;ve gone mad. We could just kill them, but that&apos;s not what druids do. So Aawill is trying to save the Spirit of the Wood. You should talk to him if you want more details.</string>
<string name="4057">Good to see ya again. That was the best fight I&apos;ve had in years. Must have been distracted by your ugly face. Har!</string>
<string name="4058">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="4059">Sure. My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;. May I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="4060">Only if it leads to a city. I can&apos;t stand nature.</string>
<string name="4061">What you mean?</string>
<string name="4062">Okay. Me be &lt;FirstName&gt;. Me ask you questions, maybe?</string>
<string name="4063">No. Me no like trees and beasts and stuff.</string>
<string name="4064">All right then, guide me by answering some questions.</string>
<string name="4065">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; What kind of people have guided you in the past?</string>
<string name="4066">I don&apos;t see why that would be a duty.</string>
<string name="4067">You guide by give me answers to questions.</string>
<string name="4068">Why that be you duty?</string>
<string name="4069">What is happening around here?</string>
<string name="4070">What do you do around here?</string>
<string name="4071">Who is in charge here?</string>
<string name="4072">What going on here?</string>
<string name="4073">What you do here?</string>
<string name="4074">Who be boss here?</string>
<string name="4075">What kind of rumors?</string>
<string name="4076">What be rumors?</string>
<string name="4077">Thank you. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4078">Nothing. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4079">What do you mean defender?</string>
<string name="4080">So can I challenge you?</string>
<string name="4081">What that mean defender?</string>
<string name="4082">Let me ask you another question.</string>
<string name="4083">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="4084">Nevermind. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4085">Can me challenge you?</string>
<string name="4086">Why are you suddenly so uptight? I was just trying to be polite.</string>
<string name="4087">Fine. Maybe you could answer some other questions.</string>
<string name="4088">Is that what you meant by guiding me down the right path? Telling me to mind my own business?</string>
<string name="4089">Whatever. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4090">Why you get mad? Me just be friendly.</string>
<string name="4091">Fine. Then you answer other questions.</string>
<string name="4092">That how you guide me? Tell me no ask questions?</string>
<string name="4093">What sort of counselor?</string>
<string name="4094">What you do to counsel?</string>
<string name="4095">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I understand, but sometimes it helps to share your pain.</string>
<string name="4096">That&apos;s okay. Why don&apos;t you just answer a different question?</string>
<string name="4097">You tell me story.</string>
<string name="4098">You answer me other questions.</string>
<string name="4099">No. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4100">That&apos;s terrible. What did you do?</string>
<string name="4101">That happens a lot, especially to foolish people.</string>
<string name="4102">That be sad. What you do next?</string>
<string name="4103">That happens lots. You be foolish with gold.</string>
<string name="4104">What do you mean, the Spirit?</string>
<string name="4105">Maybe you could answer some other questions now?</string>
<string name="4106">What you mean Spirit?</string>
<string name="4107">You answer other questions now?</string>
<string name="4108">Thank you for telling me your story. Take care and farewell.</string>
<string name="4109">Thank you tell me story. You be well. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="4110">Okay. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4111">Hello there. My name is Henna. May I guide you along nature&apos;s path today?</string>
<string name="4112">I see you have returned. What may I do for you?</string>
<string name="4113">Nature has paths that we walk everyday. Some paths are more dangerous than others. Guiding you to the right path is my duty in life, just as others have guided me.</string>
<string name="4114">There have been many, including Aawill, the Archdruid and Jaer, Aawill&apos;s second-in-command. There have been... others, as well. But that is really none of your concern.</string>
<string name="4115">What questions would you like answered?</string>
<string name="4116">The biggest problem we face right now is the trouble with the Spirit of the Wood. Anyone travelling near or through the woods is in danger right now. No one is exactly sure what is going on.</string>
<string name="4117">I imagine that Aawill, the Archdruid, would know more about it. The most I know is just rumor. You should speak to Aawill if you want the facts.</string>
<string name="4118">Be careful. There is always danger and the potential for tragedy on the paths you walk.</string>
<string name="4119">Missing druids, evil spirits, angry gods - you name it, people have speculated about it. None of it is worth repeating. You should talk to Aawill.</string>
<string name="4120">I am the defender for the third circle of the grove. I also act as a counselor for troubled minds.</string>
<string name="4121">If a druid of the fourth circle wishes to advance to the third circle, then they must speak to Jaer to challenge me. If the druid can beat me, then they are awarded a place in the third circle. </string>
<string name="4122">That depends on what you want. If you mean overall, then Aawill the Archdruid is in charge. If you refer to the challenges for entrance into the druid circle, however, then you should speak to Jaer. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4123">A druid may challenge me, but only if they are a member of the fourth circle and have sufficient experience. You should speak to Jaer if you have further questions about the challenges. Is there anything else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="4124">I&apos;m sorry, I shouldn&apos;t have snapped like that. You just touched on a sore topic. I just don&apos;t like people prying into my past.</string>
<string name="4125">Just as I needed guidance in the past, so too do others. I try to assist them when they have difficulties.</string>
<string name="4126">I understand. Hearing others&apos; tales can be a burden.</string>
<string name="4127">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe you&apos;re right. You seem trustworthy. I was the spoiled child of a noble family. When I turned twelve I decided that my parents&apos; rules were too strict, so I ran away from home. I knew nothing of the world and all its dangers.</string>
<string name="4128">For food, I began to pawn some jewelry that I had brought with me. The first piece brought me more than I had expected, so like a fool I ran out and stayed at an expensive inn, eating and drinking like a queen. The next day I woke up to find everything was gone.</string>
<string name="4129">I was living on the street, eating scraps from inns and sleeping in an old shanty with some other homeless people, until Kend found me. Kend was a druid who saw me on the street. </string>
<string name="4130">He taught me the ways of nature and how to choose the right path. We spent many years together. He... he died last year and I buried him in the woods. I hope that someone helps save the Spirit soon. I would like to go and visit his grave again.</string>
<string name="4131">Yes, I was foolish. But then, most young people are. We make bad choices and we pay the penalty. My path was dificult, but not the worst.</string>
<string name="4132">The Spirit of the Wood is causing creatures to attack anyone in or near the forest. You should talk to Aawill if you are interested in helping.</string>
<string name="4133">You are very welcome. Come back and visit anytime.</string>
<string name="4134">When other people help you out, it becomes your duty to help others. At least that is what others have taught me, and I believe it.</string>
<string name="4135">Then you walk a very sad and empty path. </string>
<string name="4136">You did very well against me. You have much to be proud of.</string>
<string name="4137">He felt sorry for such a young, pathetic looking creature, so he convinced me to follow him and he took me under his wing as his protege. As I got older, I fell in love with him, and he for me.</string>
<string name="4138">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t know you well enough to talk about that.</string>
<string name="4139">Yes! I challenge fate daily to prove myself worthy.</string>
<string name="4140">Uh... sure. I guess you like to fight?</string>
<string name="4141">Actually, I think I would rather live in a nice, peaceful age.</string>
<string name="4142">Yes! Me love to fight!</string>
<string name="4143">Um... okay, if you say. You like fights?</string>
<string name="4144">No. Me like peace. Me no like fights.</string>
<string name="4145">No. There is a time for fighting and a time for talking, but a wise person knows the difference.</string>
<string name="4146">There is very little that one cannot accomplish using the mind instead of the body.</string>
<string name="4147">It&apos;s small-minded people like you who cause war and destruction in the world.</string>
<string name="4148">You keep getting in my face and I&apos;ll show you how the strong survive!</string>
<string name="4149">No. There be time for fight and time for talk. Me like both.</string>
<string name="4150">Me like to be sneaky instead. Get stuff done better that way.</string>
<string name="4151">You watch mouth or me knock you on that skinny butt!</string>
<string name="4152">You folks cause war and death. Me not like you.</string>
<string name="4153">What&apos;s been going on around here?</string>
<string name="4154">Nothing. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4155">What going on here?</string>
<string name="4156">What do you do here?</string>
<string name="4157">What your job be?</string>
<string name="4158">Can I challenge one of the druids?</string>
<string name="4159">All right. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4160">Yes.</string>
<string name="4161">No.</string>
<string name="4162">I am ready for the challenge.</string>
<string name="4163">Yes.</string>
<string name="4164">No. I have some questions first.</string>
<string name="4165">No. Me want ask question first.</string>
<string name="4166">Could you explain the rules again?</string>
<string name="4167">Could you tell me more about the person I am fighting?</string>
<string name="4168">I&apos;m not ready for a fight yet.</string>
<string name="4169">What be rules again?</string>
<string name="4170">Me want know more &apos;bout person me fighting.</string>
<string name="4171">Me not ready for fight yet.</string>
<string name="4172">Nevermind. I am ready to fight now.</string>
<string name="4173">Okay. Me ready for fight.</string>
<string name="4174">I will go talk to him then. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4175">Me go talk to him. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="4176">Me want fight druid.</string>
<string name="4177">Tell me why you are here again.</string>
<string name="4178">I be ready for challenge.</string>
<string name="4179">Why you be here again?</string>
<string name="4180">Yes.</string>
<string name="4181">Not yet.</string>
<string name="4182">Yes.</string>
<string name="4183">Not yet.</string>
<string name="4184">Yes.</string>
<string name="4185">No.</string>
<string name="4186">Yes.</string>
<string name="4187">No.</string>
<string name="4188">There is nothing like living in dangerous times to test one&apos;s strength of heart! Do you agree, stranger?</string>
<string name="4189">I see that you are back. Have you defied death and proven your mettle lately?</string>
<string name="4190">Excellent! I will buy you a drink later, when I am not on duty. Of course, in the defense of nature, I am always on duty. Ha!</string>
<string name="4191">Wonderful! Good to meet a fellow druid with some spine in &lt;him/her&gt;! Nature requires followers that know how to be strong and defend her.</string>
<string name="4192">It is the responsibility of one who follows nature. The strong survive and the only way to become stronger is to pit yourself against worthy adversaries.</string>
<string name="4193">Bah! And what price comes with peace? Weakness! Life gets easy, people get fat and lazy, then someone with real strength comes along and takes everything. That&apos;s how nature works.</string>
<string name="4194">Do you really think that everything can be solved by sitting around and hoping problems will just go away?</string>
<string name="4195">Challenging the mind is a part of growth. But do not forget: strong of body, strong of mind, they work together to form the perfect whole.</string>
<string name="4196">And on that note, I think this conversation is over. Come back when you decide to join the rest of us in reality. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4197">Now what is it that I can do for you today?</string>
<string name="4198">Excellent! You prove my point through your actions. I was worried that you might be one of those foolish and weak pacifists!</string>
<string name="4199">Right now, the latest fight facing us is with the Spirit of the Wood. It is driving the animals to attack everyone and everything in an insane fashion. There is no pleasure in slaughtering maddened animals.</string>
<string name="4200">I suggest you go and talk to Aawill about it, if you want to help. He&apos;s in charge of the investigation. I have enough to do around here.</string>
<string name="4201">I am in charge of the druid circle challenges. When a druid wants to become a member of our grove, he or she must challenge one of our members to gain entry to the first circle.</string>
<string name="4202">Go and test yourself against a worthy opponent. It will stiffen your spine and make you stronger.</string>
<string name="4203">While I respect your desire, only a druid may challenge and become a member. If you were to learn the ways of the druid and return, then you could prove yourself.</string>
<string name="4204">An interested competitor! Perhaps today we will witness a duel worthy of nature&apos;s attention.</string>
<string name="4205">The rules are simple; you will be teleported to the challenge pit. Once there you will see your adversary; who it is will depend on which circle you are fighting. There is a door in the pit; once you open the door, the fight is over. </string>
<string name="4206">If your opponent has fallen and the door is opened, then you win. If, however, you open the door before your opponent is finished, then you lose. This is not to the death. Whoever falls will be teleported back here and healed. </string>
<string name="4207">That is unfortunate. Do not cower in fear of a little bloodletting. Return when you are ready.</string>
<string name="4208">Those are the only rules. Are you ready for a challenge?</string>
<string name="4209">You have honed your abilities to a razor sharp edge. I am proud to call you a &lt;brother/sister&gt; in nature. You are now ready to combat your final opponent.</string>
<string name="4210">Your opponent for the fourth, and weakest circle of the grove is Welcar. Welcar is a druid relatively new to the grove. As he was successful in his first challenge, he must now defend his rank. Are you truly ready?</string>
<string name="4211">Then, let the battle begin!</string>
<string name="4212">I understand if you are nervous, but do not tarry long. It is best to fight while the blood runs hot, than after it has had time to cool!</string>
<string name="4213">Sorry. If you want to know more about Welcar, then go talk to him. You know all you need to, in order to fight him.</string>
<string name="4214">Do not be long, lest the cold grip of fear get a hold on you.</string>
<string name="4215">I see the fear of pain and defeat has not driven you away. You are doing well. Make ready.</string>
<string name="4216">I am glad you have become a member of the fourth circle. It bodes well for the grove to have fresh, adventurous, new members.</string>
<string name="4217">Then, once again you shall face Welcar in the pit. I do hope that the battle proves to be more interesting this time. Are you ready?</string>
<string name="4218">The champion of the first circle of the grove is Elgar. Elgar is a half-orc druid. A fierce and cunning warrior, Elgar is dedicated to perfecting himself through nature&apos;s testing. I hope you are ready to face a most worthy opponent.</string>
<string name="4219">Even the most ferocious warrior should be fully prepared before doing battle. I await your return.</string>
<string name="4220">Then let your final challenge begin!</string>
<string name="4221">Janken is the druid you must face for the second circle challenge. He is wise in the ways of nature and should prove as crafty as the fox he most admires. Are you ready?</string>
<string name="4222">Then let us see what you can do this time.</string>
<string name="4223">You will now face Henna, champion of the third circle. She is a human druid of impressive ability. I think you shall find her a challenging opponent. Are you ready?</string>
<string name="4224">Then be on your guard. It begins!</string>
<string name="4225">Well fought! I give you this ring, to prove to all that you are a member of the fourth circle of druids. Go now and gain more experience. When you are ready, return and you may challenge for the next circle.</string>
<string name="4226">I am sorry, but you have not gained enough experience to challenge for the next circle. Return when you are more prepared to face the difficulty of this next challenge.</string>
<string name="4227">Wonderful job! I give you this ring, to prove to all that you are a member of the third circle of druids. Go now and gain more experience. When you are ready, return and you may challenge for the next circle.</string>
<string name="4228">Excellent fight! I give you this ring, to prove to all that you are a member of the second circle of druids. Go now and gain more experience. When you are ready, return and you may challenge for the next circle.</string>
<string name="4229">An amazing battle! I give you this ring, to prove to all that you are a member of the first circle of druids. You have proven yourself to be a master of combat.</string>
<string name="4230">I am sorry, but you failed that challenge. Go out and strengthen yourself, then return and do battle again.</string>
<string name="4231">Go forth and make the grove proud to call you its champion.</string>
<string name="4232">Good luck.</string>
<string name="4233">Best of luck.</string>
<string name="4234">I look forward to your final challenge.</string>
<string name="4235">You are a worthy challenger, but a fight is already in progress. Return another time.</string>
<string name="4236">You have already faced our greatest challenge in the druid circle; now it is time to aid the ailing Spirit of the Wood. Speak with Aawill, my valiant friend.</string>
<string name="4237">Tell me about yourself.</string>
<string name="4238">What is this place?</string>
<string name="4239">Me want know about you.</string>
<string name="4240">What this place be?</string>
<string name="4241">Nevermind. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4242">How does that work?</string>
<string name="4243">Aren&apos;t you a little old to be fighting for a living?</string>
<string name="4244">How that work?</string>
<string name="4245">You bit old for fight, no?</string>
<string name="4246">So how does one get involved in this combat?</string>
<string name="4247">Aren&apos;t you worried about getting killed in these fights?</string>
<string name="4248">How me get in fight?</string>
<string name="4249">You not worry &apos;bout dying in fight?</string>
<string name="4250">What is wrong with the animals?</string>
<string name="4251">Who is in charge here?</string>
<string name="4252">What wrong with animals?</string>
<string name="4253">Who be boss here?</string>
<string name="4254">Nothing else, thank you.</string>
<string name="4255">That all, thanks.</string>
<string name="4256">What is your role here?</string>
<string name="4257">Just couldn&apos;t fit in here?</string>
<string name="4258">What you do here?</string>
<string name="4259">You no fit in with others either?</string>
<string name="4260">Who is in charge here?</string>
<string name="4261">Who be boss here?</string>
<string name="4262">Can I challenge you?</string>
<string name="4263">Me fight you, maybe?</string>
<string name="4264">Hello there good &lt;sir/madam&gt;. How can old Janken be of help to you?</string>
<string name="4265">I doubt you would be very interested in me. Not too much to tell, but I guess I could share a bit. I&apos;m a druid and have been a member of this grove for about fourteen years now. I used to be the second-in-command around here.</string>
<string name="4266">But I got tired of the responsibility, so I decided to focus on my fighting skills instead. I am now the defender of the second circle of the grove.</string>
<string name="4267">You know, I always thought I would retire and relax in some peaceful little cottage in the woods by this point in life, but the lure of one-on-one combat holds me here. I guess it just makes me feel more alive.</string>
<string name="4268">Jaer, the very serious young woman over there, meets with druids who wish to either join or improve their standing in the circle of druids. She organizes challenge fights between the druid seeking improvement and the defender of the appropriate circle.</string>
<string name="4269">The fights aren&apos;t to the death and the loser is always healed. Even if I did die, and they couldn&apos;t raise me, I can&apos;t think of a better way to go. In a wolf pack, the dominant wolf eventually gets old and is beaten by a younger wolf. That&apos;s just life.</string>
<string name="4270">I like that I don&apos;t have to worry about the details anymore; I just have to fight. When I was younger, that used to mean full frontal assault. Now I have more wisdom and I fight like a wolf; snap in and out, never leaving myself open.</string>
<string name="4271">Not that the animals in this wood are fighting with intelligence, but that&apos;s another subject entirely. Do you have questions you would like to ask about anything else?</string>
<string name="4272">Take care friend. May nature guide your path through life.</string>
<string name="4273">Aawill is the Archdruid. He has been here even longer than I have, though I still remember when he was much farther down in the chain of command. He has definitely earned his place of respect. He is looking into the attacks by the animals of the woods right now.</string>
<string name="4274">Is there anything else I can help you with?</string>
<string name="4275">The animals have attacked people who step foot anywhere near the Wood. I believe there is something wrong with the Spirit. Some druids have been sent to investigate the matter, but they haven&apos;t returned yet. You should speak to Aawill if you want to help.</string>
<string name="4276">Aawill is the Archdruid of this grove. He makes all the major decisions and usually has more accurate information than the rest of us. Is there anything else I can help you with? </string>
<string name="4277">This is the Neverwinter Wood grove. We are druids who have come together to study and protect nature. Of course my role here is a little different than that.</string>
<string name="4278">Well, take care then. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4279">No, that&apos;s not exactly what I meant. Most people come here seeking to work with nature, but some find a different role to play. That&apos;s what happened to me.</string>
<string name="4280">I love nature, and I was good enough to become the second-in-command.</string>
<string name="4281">I see you have returned. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="4282">Maybe it is time to build that cabin in the woods and retire. I&apos;m getting a little old for punishment like that.</string>
<string name="4283">Druids may challenge for admittance to the grove. Talk to Jaer if you want more details about it. Anything else?</string>
<string name="4284">I am &lt;FirstName&gt;. You seem very friendly.</string>
<string name="4285">My name is &lt;FullName&gt;. It is a pleasure to meet you.</string>
<string name="4286">None of your business. How about you answer some questions?</string>
<string name="4287">Me be &lt;FirstName&gt;. You be friendly.</string>
<string name="4288">Me name be &lt;FullName&gt;. It be nice to meet you.</string>
<string name="4289">You no ask questions. Me ask questions.</string>
<string name="4290">What challenge was this?</string>
<string name="4291">Who cares. I just want you to answer some questions.</string>
<string name="4292">Congratulations. How would you like to answer some questions?</string>
<string name="4293">What be this challenge?</string>
<string name="4294">Me not care. You answer me questions now.</string>
<string name="4295">Good job! Now you answer me questions.</string>
<string name="4296">Okay, and what did she say?</string>
<string name="4297">So you tested and became the defender?</string>
<string name="4298">So Jaer test you and you pass?</string>
<string name="4299">You get to point soon?</string>
<string name="4300">So then what happened?</string>
<string name="4301">This story has a happy ending, or at least an ending of some sort, yes?</string>
<string name="4302">Then what happen you?</string>
<string name="4303">This story getting long. Hurry up.</string>
<string name="4304">Can anyone get involved in these challenges?</string>
<string name="4305">I would like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="4306">Tell me more about Jaer.</string>
<string name="4307">Okay, well, good luck in the future.</string>
<string name="4308">Can me get in on fights?</string>
<string name="4309">Me want ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="4310">You talk more &apos;bout Jaer.</string>
<string name="4311">Good job. Take care. Bye.</string>
<string name="4312">What is going on around here?</string>
<string name="4313">Who is in charge here?</string>
<string name="4314">What&apos;s your job here?</string>
<string name="4315">What happen here?</string>
<string name="4316">Who be boss here?</string>
<string name="4317">What you do here?</string>
<string name="4318">Nevermind. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4319">Who is Aawill?</string>
<string name="4320">Who be Aawill?</string>
<string name="4321">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4322">What does that mean?</string>
<string name="4323">What that mean?</string>
<string name="4324">So how did you get this promotion?</string>
<string name="4325">I want to ask some other questions.</string>
<string name="4326">How you get to be defender?</string>
<string name="4327">Me ask other questions now.</string>
<string name="4328">Okay. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4329">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; No really, I like to hear people&apos;s stories.</string>
<string name="4330">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me want to hear you story.</string>
<string name="4331">Hello there stranger. Welcome to the grove. My name is Welcar, and who might you be?</string>
<string name="4332">I see you are back. Is there anything I can help you with?</string>
<string name="4333">I am shamed. I must learn more so that I can return and prove myself worthy of being a member of the grove. I hope Jaer will not look poorly on me.</string>
<string name="4334">I&apos;m just very excited. You wouldn&apos;t know this, but recently I won a very important challenge.</string>
<string name="4335">It is a pleasure to meet you too. Especially since this week has been going so well. Just recently I won a very important challenge.</string>
<string name="4336">You know, not even your grumpy demeanor can throw off my mood. What questions do you have?</string>
<string name="4337">Okay. What questions do you have?</string>
<string name="4338">About a year ago I came to this grove hoping that I could join the druids here. I talked to Aawill, he&apos;s the Archdruid here, who told me talk to Jaer. Jaer is the druid in charge of testing new recruits.</string>
<string name="4339">Jaer told me that the test was to challenge another druid to combat in the pit. I thought I was ready, naturally, so I asked her to set it up. She told me that she didn&apos;t think I was ready, but I wanted to impress her.</string>
<string name="4340">I was teleported into the pit and we started to fight, and this other druid cast a spell that made my mind go hazy and the next thing I knew, I was laying on the ground back up here. I was humiliated, but Jaer told me to get back up and improve myself.</string>
<string name="4341">I trained for eleven months, watching others fight in the pit. I would question Jaer about different styles that I saw. She is very knowledgeable. I learned a lot and finally I was ready. I challenged again, and this time I won.</string>
<string name="4342">Now I am the defender of the fourth circle. Jaer said that I learned combat techniques very quickly and that the best way for me to learn more was to become the defender. I think Jaer is so wise.</string>
<string name="4343">Thank you. Come back if you want to hear more.</string>
<string name="4344">Only druids can challenge. That&apos;s sort of the point. You could always spend a few months here and learn to become a druid though. Of course, not everybody is cut out to be a druid. That&apos;s what Jaer says and she is almost always right.</string>
<string name="4345">She is beautiful and bright. She has this commanding presence that just makes you want to jump up and make something of yourself. I think she is the best. If you work hard to improve yourself, she will always encourage you. </string>
<string name="4346">That&apos;s really all I know about her. She commands the respect of the other druids around here, and she is second-in-command to Aawill. It is her job to organize the challenges.</string>
<string name="4347">You&apos;re the one who asked to hear my story. As Jaer always says, &quot;Never let impatience force you into a mistake.&quot; Doesn&apos;t she say the cleverest things? Well, I will try to speed this up.</string>
<string name="4348">Just wait for the story. &quot;Don&apos;t let a lack of patience lead to your downfall,&quot; that&apos;s what Jaer always says. She has the driest wit!</string>
<string name="4349">The biggest news right now is the way the creatures in the Wood have started to attack everyone. I don&apos;t even leave the grove anymore. Some say that the Spirit of the Wood has gone mad and is driving the other creatures mad too.</string>
<string name="4350">I&apos;m not really sure what&apos;s happening, since I&apos;ve really been stuck here in the grove for the past month. You should talk to Aawill about that, if you want more information.</string>
<string name="4351">Aawill is the Archdruid. He is in charge of all the other druids and makes sure that everyone is working together for the benefit of the Wood. If you are interested in helping out with some of the problems around here, I would suggest you speak to him.</string>
<string name="4352">Okay, good luck!</string>
<string name="4353">I am the defender for the fourth circle of druids for this grove.</string>
<string name="4354">If a druid comes to the grove and wants to join, then he or she must talk Jaer into setting up a challenge with the defender of the fourth circle. If the challenger wins, he or she is allowed to join the fourth circle. Jaer has just recently promoted me to defender.</string>
<string name="4355">I just became the defender for the fourth circle of this grove.</string>
<string name="4356">It&apos;s a long story. I wouldn&apos;t want to bore you with it.</string>
<string name="4357">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, I guess I could. Okay, here goes.</string>
<string name="4358">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but I just don&apos;t feel like talking about it. I will try to answer other questions though.</string>
<string name="4359">Danger: Do not continue.</string>

<string name="4447">What cause rage?</string>
<string name="4448">Why you attack me?</string>
<string name="4449">What could affect your mind in such a strong manner?</string>
<string name="4450">It seems to be affecting the whole forest.</string>
<string name="4451">What control you mind?</string>
<string name="4452">Whole forest go crazy!</string>
<string name="4453">Do you know what I might do to stop it?</string>
<string name="4454">Stay calm and keep control. I don&apos;t want to have to hurt you anymore.</string>
<string name="4455">I think I had better kill you before you try to kill me.</string>
<string name="4456">What me do to stop it?</string>
<string name="4457">You be calm so me no have to hurt you no more.</string>
<string name="4458">Me no trust you. Me must kill you now.</string>
<string name="4459">I guess you had better flee now. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4460">You run away now. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4461">Who wouldn&apos;t be affected?</string>
<string name="4462">Who no be affected?</string>
<string name="4463">Tell me about the druids.</string>
<string name="4464">Why would the nymphs not be affected?</string>
<string name="4465">Tell me more about the witch.</string>
<string name="4466">What druids you mean?</string>
<string name="4467">Why nymphs be not crazy?</string>
<string name="4468">Which witch?</string>
<string name="4469">What do you mean &apos;because of her face?&apos;</string>
<string name="4470">I think your madness is getting worse.</string>
<string name="4471">What you meaning her face?</string>
<string name="4472">You getting more crazy?</string>
<string name="4473">I&apos;m not going to hurt you, now stop yelling at me.</string>
<string name="4474">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You can trust me dear. Why don&apos;t you tell me what you know?</string>
<string name="4475">Me not hurt you, but you stop yelling.</string>
<string name="4476">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me no hurt you. Me you friend. You tell me what you know.</string>
<string name="4477">You tell me, or I&apos;ll chop your tree into kindling!</string>
<string name="4478">You tell me, or me chop tree and make big fire!</string>
<string name="4479">Get away from my tree! You must die!</string>
<string name="4480">No, please let me live! I give up.</string>
<string name="4481">The rage... it burns me up... makes me want to kill you. I am trying to control it, but please be quick. What do you want?</string>
<string name="4482">I don&apos;t know. The rage just fills my mind. It makes everyone seem like an enemy. I don&apos;t know you or who you are except that something makes me hate you.</string>
<string name="4483">Must you keep talking to me? I must flee soon, or else I will be forced to attack you. The only being I know of who has that kind of power is the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="4484">But it has never caused harm before. I don&apos;t know why it would start now. No! &lt;He/She&gt; has spared me. I must not do such things. Sorry &lt;master/mistress&gt;.</string>
<string name="4485">Not without a fight, tree-killer!</string>
<string name="4486">I don&apos;t know. I can&apos;t think. The Spirit hasn&apos;t been here in a while. It doesn&apos;t travel by here now. I don&apos;t know why. Maybe if you could find someone whose mind isn&apos;t affected by the Spirit&apos;s power.</string>
<string name="4487">Stay calm! There are demonic talons pressing into my mind and burning it away into nothing, and you want me to stay calm! I am doing my best.</string>
<string name="4488">No. I will not flee! I will strike you down and kill... oh no. Yes. I will flee. You must get away from my tree. If you remain close I will lose control and attack you again. </string>
<string name="4489">Goodbye and good luck.</string>
<string name="4490">How should I know? I never go far from my tree! You are the ones free to roam around! You should know these things. You&apos;re so stupid I should... uh, nevermind. Maybe the druids could help, or the nymphs, or even the witch.</string>
<string name="4491">There were some druids wandering around here a while back. I don&apos;t know where they went because I was hiding so I wouldn&apos;t have to attack them. They were dangerous. They wanted to hurt my tree! No, no. That is the hate speaking.</string>
<string name="4492">I didn&apos;t say they wouldn&apos;t, did I? I just said they might not. How should I know? Um, sorry. I don&apos;t mean to keep yelling at you like that.</string>
<string name="4493">Setara is the Witch of the Wood. She comes here sometimes. She is bad and wants to eat me! No wait, she is good and she helps me. Oh, I wish I could think clearly. This is so hard.</string>
<string name="4494">You must be careful when you deal with Setara though. She has a hard time dealing with people. It&apos;s because of her face of course.</string>
<string name="4495">No, that&apos;s not it. This time I am thinking straight.</string>
<string name="4496">She used to be beautiful, but now she is ugly. I don&apos;t know what happened, since she doesn&apos;t like to talk about it. I just know that she thinks that people are always judging her by her looks. She won&apos;t talk to you because you&apos;re evil!</string>
<string name="4497">You want to kill us all and burn our trees, so she won&apos;t talk to you and I&apos;m not going to tell you how to get her to talk to you! Get away from me!</string>
<string name="4498">Okay, okay, I&apos;m sorry. Please don&apos;t hurt my tree. I&apos;ll tell you what you could do.</string>
<string name="4499">Oh &lt;master/mistress&gt;, I&apos;m sorry. I just can&apos;t control this much longer. I will tell you what you might do, but then you must go.</string>
<string name="4500">The witch Setara would give anything to have her looks restored. One day one of the nymphs told me that she had something that made people think they were beautiful. I don&apos;t know anymore than that, but you might be able to trick Setara with that.</string>
<string name="4501">Now please, let me go and you should leave, before I am overcome.</string>
<string name="4502">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh you are right. I&apos;m so sorry I yelled at you, it&apos;s just so powerful. I will tell you what you could do, but then you must flee.</string>
<string name="4503">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No! You are just going to kill me and my tree. Stay away from me you horrible &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>

<string name="4618">I am not your slave, villianous creature. Prepare yourself for death.</string>
<string name="4619">If you were trying to dominate me with your powers, you have failed. If you want to die, just try to pull that again.</string>
<string name="4620">You try to dominate me mind, but you no do. You no try again, or me kill you.</string>
<string name="4621">Me no you slave! Me kill you now.</string>
<string name="4622">I&apos;ve been attacked several times in your home. Give me one good reason why I shouldn&apos;t kill you now?</string>
<string name="4623">I don&apos;t really care about your powers. Now that we know they are gone, why don&apos;t you tell me what is going on here.</string>
<string name="4624">Me attacked by you and your slaves. Why me not kill you now, huh?</string>
<string name="4625">Me not really care &apos;bout powers. You be weak, I be strong, so you tell me what going on here.</string>
<string name="4626">You attacked me! I didn&apos;t start this.</string>
<string name="4627">Your slaves attacked me and then you did the same thing. How is this my fault?</string>
<string name="4628">Me no start attack, you start attack.</string>
<string name="4629">You slaves attack me, then you attack me. How this be my fault?</string>
<string name="4630">You are the one who started this, but now I will finish it!</string>
<string name="4631">You start this fight, but me finish it now!</string>
<string name="4632">Of course not! I came here looking for a way to help the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="4633">I came here to talk and was attacked before I had the chance. Why would you think I came here to kill you?</string>
<string name="4634">No. Me come to find help for Spirit of Wood.</string>
<string name="4635">Me never had chance to talk. Everyone just attack me when I get here. Why you think me be bad?</string>
<string name="4636">I guess I can forgive you, but I expect you to help me in any way you can now.</string>
<string name="4637">That&apos;s a pretty horrible mistake. I can&apos;t forgive you, but I won&apos;t hurt you unless you try something again.</string>
<string name="4638">There can be no forgiveness for what you have done, there can be only death.</string>
<string name="4639">Me guess me forgive you, but now you must help me however you can.</string>
<string name="4640">That be too bad mistake to forgive, but me no hurt you &apos;less you try bad stuff again.</string>
<string name="4641">Me will no forgive you. You pay with life!</string>
<string name="4642">How long have you been having trouble?</string>
<string name="4643">You still had enough power to control your slaves.</string>
<string name="4644">What could have caused that?</string>
<string name="4645">What cause such bad pain?</string>
<string name="4646">How long you have trouble?</string>
<string name="4647">You still got slaves, so got some power.</string>
<string name="4648">If it is so bad, then why don&apos;t you leave?</string>
<string name="4649">You have suffered greatly. I suppose anyone would have trouble retaining their sanity.</string>
<string name="4650">You must be weak, if you give in so easily and enslave other&apos;s minds.</string>
<string name="4651">If it be so bad, why you no leave?</string>
<string name="4652">You been through lots. Me go crazy too if fear so strong in mind.</string>
<string name="4653">You be weak! Me no give in and hurt others just because scared.</string>
<string name="4654">I&apos;m sorry. I guess I just have a hard time accepting when others have attacked me. Go on.</string>
<string name="4655">Just keep going and try to limit the whining.</string>
<string name="4656">I&apos;m sick of your whining, that&apos;ll be enough. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4657">Me sorry. Me just have hard time with people who attack me. Go on.</string>
<string name="4658">You keep talking, but not so much whining.</string>
<string name="4659">Me no can stand you whining. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4660">If I&apos;m going to help you, I need to get to the Spirit of the Wood. Do you know how I could do that?</string>
<string name="4661">Me want help you, so me need to reach Spirit of Wood. You know how I do that?</string>
<string name="4662">To do my job, I need to get to the Spirit of the Wood. Can you help me?</string>
<string name="4663">Me have job to do and me need to get to Spirit of Wood. You help me maybe?</string>
<string name="4664">What does that mean, both life and death?</string>
<string name="4665">There must be a way! Where is this portal?</string>
<string name="4666">What you mean life and death both?</string>
<string name="4667">There must be way! Where be this portal?</string>
<string name="4668">Are you sure that the Spirit is the only creature to ever enter the pool?</string>
<string name="4669">There has got to be a way for me to get there.</string>
<string name="4670">You be sure that Spirit only one ever go through portal?</string>
<string name="4671">There must be way for me to get to Spirit.</string>
<string name="4672">You were going to say something else. You must tell me, please.</string>
<string name="4673">Tell me what you were going to say, or you&apos;ll be sorry you didn&apos;t.</string>
<string name="4674">You have other idea. Please tell me what it be.</string>
<string name="4675">Tell me what you gonna say, or me make you wish you did.</string>
<string name="4676">It&apos;s okay. I&apos;m going to find the Spirit and help you escape this fear.</string>
<string name="4677">Don&apos;t start whining again. Get some backbone.</string>
<string name="4678">I don&apos;t think I can listen to you anymore. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="4679">Is there anything else you can tell me that might help?</string>
<string name="4680">It be okay. Me find Spirit and stop the fear.</string>
<string name="4681">You be whining again. Get a grip.</string>
<string name="4682">There be anything else you tell me that help?</string>
<string name="4683">Me tired of listen to you. Me go now.</string>
<string name="4684">I met the druid you had locked up in the other room. Do you know about the other missing druids?</string>
<string name="4685">What do you know about the witch, Setara?</string>
<string name="4686">Do you have the mirror that Setara is seeking?</string>
<string name="4687">Could you tell me your story again?</string>
<string name="4688">That&apos;s all I can think of for now. Farewell.</string>
<string name="4689">Me find locked up druid. You maybe see other druids near here?</string>
<string name="4690">What you tell me &apos;bout witch Setara?</string>
<string name="4691">You have mirror Setara be seeking, maybe?</string>
<string name="4692">You tell me you story again?</string>
<string name="4693">That be it. Me go now. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="4694">What are you talking about? I&apos;m not a slave.</string>
<string name="4695">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes mistress. What is your command?</string>
<string name="4696">What you mean? Me no slave.</string>
<string name="4697">Menial labor? I don&apos;t think so!</string>
<string name="4698">Cleaning out your chamber pots? That&apos;s disgusting, forget it.</string>
<string name="4699">I&apos;m not wearing that! It&apos;s pink!!!</string>
<string name="4700">No, I will not allow you to kill me! Nature&apos;s creatures must be protected.</string>
<string name="4701">Foolish &lt;man/woman&gt;! I don&apos;t know why you thought you could just steal into my house, kill my slaves and destroy another of nature&apos;s protectors, but now you have fallen to my charms. Now, bow to your mistress!</string>
<string name="4702">No! How is this possible? What has happened to my powers?</string>
<string name="4703">No, please! Please don&apos;t hurt me. What have I done to provoke this attack on my home?</string>
<string name="4704">Then I call upon nature&apos;s power to defend myself.</string>
<string name="4705">You... you mean you didn&apos;t come here to destroy me?</string>
<string name="4706">Oh, this is terrible. I&apos;m so sorry, but I was certain that you... oh, I don&apos;t know why I thought that now. There is nothing I can do to make up for this. I was wrong; how is that possible?</string>
<string name="4707">Oh thank you &lt;master/mistress&gt;! You are very kind. I will do whatever I can to help you. I just wish I still had my powers, I don&apos;t know why they have become so weakened.</string>
<string name="4708">I will do as you command. I only wish I had some way to make it up to you. Without my powers, there is very little I can do.</string>
<string name="4709">A couple of weeks ago I was down by the river, watching the fish jump, when I felt the presence of danger. I looked around, then scrambled up the bank and into a grove of trees. I couldn&apos;t see anything, yet the fear kept growing.</string>
<string name="4710">Suddenly there was a scream in my mind that felt like someone had stabbed a dagger into my brain. I was overcome by the power of it and I fell to the ground unconscious. When I woke up, the fear was still there, and the sense that the whole forest was in pain.</string>
<string name="4711">It was the Spirit of the Wood. I have been sensing its pain and fear ever since that day. It is constantly screaming for help. It is all I can do to keep my sanity; indeed I guess you have experienced just how I am losing that battle.</string>
<string name="4712">As time passed I began to keep myself closer to home, until recently I have not even been able to leave my room, so great is the fear.</string>
<string name="4713">It is not so simple as that. This tree is my home, I have been here for centuries. I feel as though every person who comes along is a danger to both my home and myself.</string>
<string name="4714">That is very comforting to hear you say. I... I feel as though you give me strength. The fear is not as consuming when we speak. Uh... well, I guess there is more I should tell you.</string>
<string name="4715">You have never had a presence in your mind that could affect your emotions and try to command you to do what it wants. You despise me so much, maybe I should... </string>
<string name="4716">The first time a person came near my tree, I took him with my power and kept him to guard my home. The next few were easy too, but they started to get harder and harder. Now I have no power left, as you can see. I don&apos;t know what to do now.</string>
<string name="4717">I... I really am sorry for what I have done. If you ever need anything, please return.</string>
<string name="4718">I don&apos;t think that&apos;s possible. The Spirit is a creature of both life and death, and only he can enter the portal to the other realm.</string>
<string name="4719">The Spirit lives on another realm, somewhere between the world of the living and the world of the dead. It is the only creature on this plane who can enter the portal.</string>
<string name="4720">The portal is in a pool, below a waterfall, but finding it won&apos;t help you. It wouldn&apos;t help anyone.</string>
<string name="4721">Well... several have tried... but no... that&apos;s not a good solution. Forget it. The Spirit is the only one who can do so successfully.</string>
<string name="4722">There was a druid, a long time ago, who claimed he had figured out how to enter the Spirit&apos;s realm. He said he had been studying it for years and had finally pieced it together. He didn&apos;t tell me how he was going to enter, but I was curious, so I followed him.</string>
<string name="4723">You don&apos;t have to threaten me, I told you I would do as you command.</string>
<string name="4724">He went to the pool and built an altar, but then he did the strangest thing! He took out a dagger and plunged it into his own chest. His body slipped below the surface of the water, but when I went over to the pool, it was gone. </string>
<string name="4725">Maybe he made it to the realm, but if he was dead when he got there, I&apos;m not sure it was worth it. Others have tried it through the years, but their bodies just lay there decomposing. Well... most of the others.</string>
<string name="4726">I can&apos;t think of anything else that would help, but I will answer any questions you have.</string>
<string name="4727">You have a strength within you that burns away the mask of terror that has shrouded my life these past days. I hope... it sounds presumptuous I&apos;m sure, but I really hope that I may call you a friend.</string>
<string name="4728">You&apos;re not well loved are you?</string>
<string name="4729">It is just as well. I would like to be alone now. I hope you can help save the Spirit.</string>
<string name="4730">I&apos;m truly sorry if there are other druids missing, but I don&apos;t know anything about them. The elf was the last person I took with my power, before I tried it on you.</string>
<string name="4731"> I couldn&apos;t even keep him dominated, but had to renew my domination anytime I went into the room I kept him in. I feel very guilty about locking him up, but I was afraid that once he realized I had dominated him, he would want to kill me.</string>
<string name="4732">Oh, she is a terribly ugly old crone. You don&apos;t want to have anything to do with her. I can&apos;t even bear to look on her, so I refuse to allow her anywhere near my tree. I don&apos;t even like to talk about her, it disturbs me that much.</string>
<string name="4733">Is there anything else I can do?</string>
<string name="4734">I have a magic mirror, but it just shows the person what they wish they looked like, not what they actually look like. It certainly wouldn&apos;t make anyone young again. I suppose it would be a sort of wish fulfillment for someone as ugly as that old crone though.</string>
<string name="4735">If it will help you in your quest to save the Spirit, then you can certainly have it. Is there anything else you need?</string>
<string name="4736">My powers have been weakening and I have been becoming more and more fearful ever since the Spirit started to take control of my mind. I don&apos;t know what caused the problem, but if you can reach the Spirit, you may find some answers.</string>
<string name="4737">The Spirit can only be reached through the portal, which is hidden beneath the waterfall, here in the woods. The only person who might have made it through the portal is a druid who stood in the pool and killed himself. </string>
<string name="4738">I have no real evidence that he made it though. I think such an act would be very foolish, since you can&apos;t do too much if you are dead.</string>
<string name="4739">Thank you for all your kindness my friend. I do hope you will return again someday. If you manage to cure the Spirit, please return and maybe we can continue our friendship.</string>
<string name="4740">Good luck in your quest. I am truly sorry for the harm I brought you and for the death of my slaves, for which I am wholly to blame.</string>
<string name="4741">I see you have returned. Just seeing your face again makes my soul ache from the death I brought about in my paranoia. Is there something else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="4742">My friend! It is so very good to see you. My soul still aches from the death my paranoia caused, but seeing your face helps me through these troubled times. Is there something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="4743">Nature&apos;s hero returns triumphant! I am sure that your confidence and courage shall be an inspiration to all who serve nature&apos;s purpose.</string>
<string name="4744">Killer of the Spirit! I cannot believe that you would return to the Wood after the damage you have done to it. I will not speak to you anymore!</string>
<string name="4745">Don&apos;t talk back to me slave! Now, what menial task should I put you to work at?</string>
<string name="4746">First, you can go and clean up any mess you made while getting in here. After that, you can go and collect all of the chamber pots and clean them out. Before you go, I want you to put on this cute little outfit.</string>
<string name="4747">What? How dare you talk back to me! You&apos;re my unthinking sla... you... you tricked me!</string>
<string name="4748">Here lies Kend, beloved of Henna, one with the Spirit.</string>

<string name="4846">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That almost made sense. Do you mean you&apos;re crazy, because you are on the Spirit&apos;s plane?</string>
<string name="4847">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That almost make sense. You mean you be crazy, &apos;cause you be on Spirit plane?</string>
<string name="4848">I think I understand. Now I want to try to ask you some other questions.</string>

<string name="4863">So you&apos;re the one who hurt the Spirit of the Wood. Do you know how to cure it?</string>
<string name="4864">So you poisoned a tree and that made the Spirit sick? Why would anyone want the Spirit hurt?</string>
<string name="4865">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You mean you get left here and you no can get out?</string>

<string name="4886">I must be hazy, my thoughts are lazy!</string>
<string name="4887">Me hat be gone, who would know? Ye hid it on me, now it&apos;s time ye go!</string>
<string name="4888">Befuddle me this, befuddle me that, now where&apos;d ye put me blasted hat?</string>
<string name="4889">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Too long, too long, could not hold on. Got me mind, now in a bind.</string>
<string name="4890">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Look at the birdie, high in the sky... Oh no, it be just a fleck in me eye.</string>
<string name="4891">I tell ye once and then no more, me name be locked behind a door. The door can open if ye try, but if ye lose then say goodbye.</string>
<string name="4892">When out of luck, then me get stuck. They did say hi, but no goodbye.</string>
<string name="4893">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Like mice through holes, out they go, but closed the holes to me, said no. </string>
<string name="4894">The job me did, though not know why, was to the tree to say goodbye. The Spirit sick, but it no die, though I did me best to try. Me chopped it good, then poisoned well, but now me be stuck here in hell.</string>
<string name="4895">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh dear, a cloud has wandered by, it lost its way, me wonder why?</string>
<string name="4896">A stone to get with magic rune, that Spirit hid like a sacred tomb. Me did not see what rune be like, it goes to mage, that&apos;s quite a hike!</string>
<string name="4897">What thing it does me do not know, me did it because Maugrim tells me so.</string>
<string name="4898">If the mouse squeaks, the lion pounces, and swallows down those little ounces.</string>
<string name="4899">Bye bye, now ye die!</string>
<string name="4900">Bye bye, now ye die!</string>
<string name="4901">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; This Maugrim be a mage who hides in tower, be wary of his awful power. It soars up high as it can, in evil city of Luskan. Like a queen bee in her hive, others he send to keep his works alive.</string>
<string name="4902">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The wounded duck might flop and flail, but soon be eaten, same with quail. Others come and join the feast, that&apos;s the part ye&apos;ll like the least.</string>
<string name="4903">A vial with the cure does be, but you won&apos;t find it out from me.</string>
<string name="4904">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Up in the northeast, across the river Lox, is where you can find a pile of rocks. Within the pile, does lie the vial.</string>
<string name="4905">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Without me cure you out of luck, and me no give a flying... duck.</string>
<string name="4906">Of other cultists me know three, but me not know who they be. One does walk in caves like fort, north of the city of last port. Two does hide, unless he ran, within the city of Luskan. The last would be number three, lost in Charwood, mad like me.</string>
<string name="4907">And now it does be time to go, I&apos;ll just get me hat, but wait, oh no!</string>
<string name="4908">The song me sing is in me head, better to sing than soon be dead.</string>
<string name="4909">Can you speak?</string>
<string name="4910">What are you?</string>
<string name="4911">You talk, maybe?</string>
<string name="4912">What you be?</string>
<string name="4913">What happened to you again?</string>
<string name="4914">I have found the cure for you.</string>
<string name="4915">Why you sick again?</string>
<string name="4916">I got cure to save you.</string>
<string name="4917">Yes, I will cure you.</string>
<string name="4918">You must know where some treasure lies in the forest. Why don&apos;t you tell me where first?</string>
<string name="4919">No. I think it would be better to kill you.</string>
<string name="4920">Ya, me cure you.</string>
<string name="4921">You know where gold be hid? Show me first.</string>
<string name="4922">No. Me decide to kill you.</string>
<string name="4923">All right, I guess I&apos;ll cure you.</string>
<string name="4924">No gold, no cure. I guess you can just suffer and die.</string>
<string name="4925">Okay, me cure you.</string>
<string name="4926">No gold, no cure. That the way it is. You just die I guess.</string>
<string name="4927">Now can you show me what happened here?</string>
<string name="4928">Now you show me why you attacked.</string>
<string name="4929">So that&apos;s how they managed to poison you. But why did they want to?</string>
<string name="4930">That&apos;s not the part I care about. What were they after?</string>
<string name="4931">So you be poisoned in sneaky way. Why them do that?</string>
<string name="4932">You already cured. Me want know why poisoned.</string>
<string name="4933">What was on that stone?</string>
<string name="4934">What be on stone?</string>
<string name="4935">A sense of rage and helplessness emanates from the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="4936">Feelings of fear and hopelessness impress themselves on your mind.</string>
<string name="4937">The Spirit of the Wood looks at you in confusion.</string>
<string name="4938">Blurry images race through your mind. Very little is recognizable, except some images of small animals and other woodland creatures. Then the images become clearer.</string>
<string name="4939">A stream of pictures flicks through your mind: woodland creatures of all shapes and sizes, trees and bushes, insects and rocks. The images are jumbled together and include everything imaginable that could be found in a forest.</string>
<string name="4940">The images slow down and you see one creature. While the details are blurry, it is obviously a dwarf. An image of the Spirit appears and the dwarf does something to a tree, but you can&apos;t quite understand what he does.</string>
<string name="4941">Suddenly the dwarf is gone and the image of the Spirit begins to fade. The woodland creatures appear again, but this time you see them as if through a red glass. </string>
<string name="4942">The creatures begin to attack each other and other shapes that might be humanoid. You sense the fear and frustration of the Spirit as the images jumble together into incomprehensible darkness. The Spirit stands staring off into nothing, looking weaker than ever.</string>
<string name="4943">Fear and despair are the Spirit&apos;s only response to your return.</string>
<string name="4944">You see a blurry image of yourself touching the Spirit, followed by the Spirit getting larger.</string>
<string name="4945">You walk forward and give the antidote to the Spirit. It shudders, then the Spirit seems to swell in size. Emotions of joy and love threaten to overwhelm your senses.</string>
<string name="4946">Feelings of confusion and despair radiate from the Spirit.</string>
<string name="4947">A wash of emotional despair covers your thoughts, then anger and hatred. The Spirit attacks.</string>
<string name="4948">The images in your mind gain clarity and focus as the Spirit recovers from the poison. An image of a fox curled around a sleeping rabbit fills your mind, along with an intensely protective feeling.</string>
<string name="4949">You see a group of men come into the forest. A familiar, evil-eyed dwarf is with the group. They go to the pool and the dwarf steps into it. One of the men walks over and thrusts a dagger through the back of the dwarf&apos;s throat.</string>
<string name="4950">The image dissolves and suddenly you can see that the dwarf is in the Spirit&apos;s realm. A few minutes later he is joined by several of the other men. One of the other men mouths a word, and the name &quot;Relmar&quot; forms in your mind.</string>
<string name="4951">The group walks toward the Spirit&apos;s tree, spreading out until they form a circle. Three of the men rush at the Spirit, while Relmar sneaks up on the tree. Relmar takes his axe and coats the edge with a green liquid. He hacks at the tree a couple of times.</string>
<string name="4952">The image returns with the two men who were not in the fight running over to the tree. They start to dig between its roots until they uncover a smooth, flat stone.</string>
<string name="4953">One of the men in the image laughs and then casts a spell. The two step through a portal that appears and they are gone. Relmar goes to run through the portal, but it disappears.</string>
<string name="4954">The last of the men fighting the weakened Spirit are slain and Relmar flees away from the tree to disappear.</string>
<string name="4955">All images disappear from your mind, to be replaced by a glowing sigil. The glyph pulses with power and you get the sense of incredibly strong magic.</string>
<string name="4956">As you look at the rune, the feeling changes from power to time. You feel ages slipping away, from your present to the past: long before your time... before the demihuman races... even before the humans had power.</string>
<string name="4957">The sense of time disappears and you are left with an image of the Spirit placing the stone in the roots of the tree. The images recede entirely from your mind and your body feels distorted for a short moment.</string>
<string name="4958">The Spirit smiles at you. The last thing you sense is a pleasant emotion of farewell.</string>

<string name="5081">Who are you?</string>
<string name="5082">What you be talking &apos;bout? Why you attack me?</string>
<string name="5083">Who you be?</string>
<string name="5084">Yes, this is the Wood. Why did you just attack me?</string>
<string name="5085">I am asking the questions here. You should have known better than to attack me.</string>
<string name="5086">Yes, this be the Wood. Why you attack me?</string>
<string name="5087">You no ask questions. You be dumb to attack me.</string>
<string name="5088">Don&apos;t you remember anything about your captivity?</string>
<string name="5089">All right, you should get out of here now.</string>
<string name="5090">You no remember being held?</string>
<string name="5091">Okay. You better go now.</string>
<string name="5092">I think you are trying to trick me. Die foolish man!</string>
<string name="5093">You be sneaky. You try to trick me, but now me kill you!</string>
<string name="5094">Let me ask you some questions about what you knew before you were captured.</string>
<string name="5095">Me want know what you learn before you forgot stuff. You answer me questions.</string>
<string name="5096">What did you discover about what is happening to the animals in the Wood?</string>
<string name="5097">There are some druids missing. Do you know what happened to them?</string>
<string name="5098">I heard about a witch named Setara. What do you know about her?</string>
<string name="5099">What you find &apos;bout animals attacking?</string>
<string name="5100">There be druids missing. You know &apos;bout that?</string>
<string name="5101">Setara be the witch of the Wood. You know &apos;bout her?</string>
<string name="5102">Protect the mistress! Kill the intruder!</string>
<string name="5103">No, please no more! I surrender!</string>
<string name="5104">I don&apos;t know what is going on. Where am I? Where are my clothes?</string>
<string name="5105">I... I don&apos;t remember attacking you. I don&apos;t even know who you are or where this is. The last thing I remember is walking through the Wood trying to figure out what went wrong with all the animals.</string>
<string name="5106">I had avoided several bears and a few boars, but I was getting very tired. I stumbled into an open glade and... I saw... I think it was a woman. A beautiful woman, yes, that&apos;s it.</string>
<string name="5107">That&apos;s the last I remember. Next thing I know, you were attacking me, although you say I was the one who attacked. This is all very confusing.</string>
<string name="5108">I am a ranger here in... um... is this Neverwinter Wood? I don&apos;t recognize this place.</string>
<string name="5109">Hm... no, I don&apos;t remember a thing, sorry.</string>
<string name="5110">I will try, although I can&apos;t promise anything. I hadn&apos;t learned very much.</string>
<string name="5111">Thank you. Good luck to you &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="5112">You will pay for this treachery!</string>
<string name="5113">There is nothing much to tell. I couldn&apos;t speak to them or calm them. They are just extremely hostile. I never had the opportunity to find out more.</string>
<string name="5114">I haven&apos;t the slightest idea. Perhaps you should search this place, but be careful, since they might attack you too, if they&apos;re like I was.</string>
<string name="5115">I have heard a little bit about her. She likes to help the forest creatures, but she doesn&apos;t have much contact with people. There is some story about how she used to be beautiful, but suddenly turned ugly. That&apos;s all I know about her.</string>
<string name="5116">The mistress must be protected. Slay the intruder!</string>
<string name="5117">No, I&apos;m not. I have control of my own mind. Who are you?</string>
<string name="5118">I am not so foolish as to be captured by a nymph. You may leave now, thanks to me.</string>
<string name="5119">You just wait here. I&apos;ll be back.</string>
<string name="5120">I not be fooled by nymph. Me smart. Who you?</string>
<string name="5121">Me not get caught by little nymph like you. You go away now.</string>
<string name="5122">You no move. Me be back.</string>
<string name="5123">THIS LINE NEVER APPEARS IN CONVERSATION (though there are links to what&apos;s below).</string>

<string name="5133">Why didn&apos;t you want to enter her house?</string>
<string name="5134">You were suspicious already, weren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="5135">Why you no want enter house?</string>
<string name="5136">You already think she be bad?</string>
<string name="5137">I&apos;m trying to help with that. What have you learned about the Spirit of the Wood?</string>
<string name="5138">The other druids never returned either. I don&apos;t suppose you know where they might be?</string>
<string name="5139">Are you able to get out of here on your own now?</string>
<string name="5140">Me trying to help. What you learn &apos;bout Spirit of Wood?</string>
<string name="5141">Other druids no come back. You know where they be going?</string>
<string name="5142">Me go now. You get out okay?</string>
<string name="5143">Tell me more about this pool.</string>
<string name="5144">Why hasn&apos;t the Spirit come?</string>
<string name="5145">Tell me &apos;bout pool.</string>
<string name="5146">Why Spirit not come now?</string>
<string name="5147">Why didn&apos;t you go into it?</string>
<string name="5148">What do you mean another realm?</string>
<string name="5149">You no go into pool?</string>
<string name="5150">What you mean other realm?</string>
<string name="5151">Do you have any suggestions of what I should do?</string>
<string name="5152">Now what me do?</string>
<string name="5153">Why don&apos;t you tell me your story?</string>
<string name="5154">You tell me what happen to you.</string>
<string name="5155">He sent me to rescue some druids. Are you one of them?</string>
<string name="5156">I have met someone named Aawill. How do you know him?</string>
<string name="5157">Him tell me rescue druids. You be druid?</string>
<string name="5158">Me know him. How you know him?</string>
<string name="5159">I am &lt;FullName&gt;, and Aawill sent me to rescue you.</string>
<string name="5160">I be &lt;FullName&gt; and I come to find you. Me sent by Aawill.</string>
<string name="5161">I guess she knew how to manipulate you.</string>
<string name="5162">I guess I could see how that could happen.</string>
<string name="5163">Being locked up is the least of what you deserved for such disgusting behavior.</string>
<string name="5164">Women always know how get men.</string>
<string name="5165">Me know how that can happen.</string>
<string name="5166">That bad behavior get you what you deserve.</string>
<string name="5167">Oh dear, I see the nymph has bewitched another one. Wait, you don&apos;t have the look of one beguiled by her sorcery.</string>
<string name="5168">Thank you for your assistance. I would be grateful if you wouldn&apos;t spread the details of what happened to me around.</string>
<string name="5169">My name is Terari. I am a druid of the Neverwinter Wood grove. And who are you good &lt;sir/madam&gt;?</string>
<string name="5170">Wait, before you go, did Aawill send you?</string>
<string name="5171">I will try to wait patiently, though I do not wish to be locked in here again, so please make haste.</string>
<string name="5172">Then I owe both Aawill and you a debt of honor. I only wish I had gotten further on my mission to save the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="5173">It is rather embarrassing actually. I thought the nymphs might be a good source of information, since they have stronger minds than your average woodland animal.</string>
<string name="5174">I didn&apos;t get very far. I thought that although the animals were not communicating, the nymphs might be a good source of information. They may be flighty, but I thought that they would have strong enough minds to resist the Spirit&apos;s madness.</string>
<string name="5175">I came to this house first, since I had... um... known this particular nymph in the past. She seemed very pleased to see me, eager even. I was hoping to get some information from her, without... well... going into her house.</string>
<string name="5176">That is far more insightful than I would have given you credit for.</string>
<string name="5177">She did seem a bit more eager than normal to get me into her house.</string>
<string name="5178">Somewhere in the back of my mind, a part of me was wondering why she never actually used my name, even though we have known each other for quite a while. It seemed... odd.</string>
<string name="5179">Unfortunately, I was not thinking clearly. I guess I was just certain that I could handle anything she tried. When we got into her house she suggested that I get undressed, and while I was doing that she cast a spell on me.</string>
<string name="5180">I do not know why, but there is madness in the Spirit and it is infecting the Wood. It even affected the nymphs, so the madness must have a powerful hold.</string>
<string name="5181">I do know that in order to get to the Spirit you will have to find a way to enter the pool that it used to come through to get into and out of the Wood. Before she cast the spell, the nymph did mention that the Spirit hasn&apos;t been here in quite a while.</string>
<string name="5182">The pool is some kind of entrance to another realm where the Spirit usually lives. I haven&apos;t the slightest idea what the other realm looks like though.</string>
<string name="5183">She didn&apos;t say why, she just said that the Spirit hasn&apos;t come out of the pool in a while. Nymphs don&apos;t have a very good grasp of time.</string>
<string name="5184">I can make it on my own. I will meet up with you at the druid grove.</string>
<string name="5185">No living creature can get through the portal and into the other realm. That is what some of the oldest stories of my people say.</string>
<string name="5186">The stories say that the portal exists between the realms of life and death. The Spirit exists as some sort of half-life, so she can go back and forth through the portal, but we can&apos;t.</string>
<string name="5187">You should try to find the others and see if they know any more. There is also a witch named Setara in the Wood, who might know something. I was going to talk to her after the nymphs.</string>
<string name="5188">It&apos;s another plane of existence. The pool acts as a portal to this other place.</string>
<string name="5189">I am unsure of what the others had planned, although Orlane was headed in a southeasterly direction. As for Bree, it&apos;s hard to divine her intentions, since her vanity masks them well.</string>
<string name="5190">I wish I could help you more. Hopefully they will have discovered more about the Spirit than I have.</string>
<string name="5191">As patient as the trees I wait upon your pleasure. Still, I should like to be going soon.</string>
<string name="5192">Wise Aawill. Always making sure all is taken care of.</string>
<string name="5193">He is the head of our druidic circle.</string>
<string name="5194">Thank you again and good luck.</string>
<string name="5195">Beyond that, I have no idea how to cure the Spirit, but it needs to be done soon, before some rash adventurer decides to kill off every living thing in the forest.</string>
<string name="5196">Next thing I knew, I was locked in here, unable to escape. The nymph hasn&apos;t harmed me, she just won&apos;t let me go. Before she enters the room she casts some kind of spell and I wake up later with no memories of what happened. </string>
<string name="5197">Now that you have freed me, I must return to the grove to discuss the Spirit of the Wood with the other druids. Maybe the others have learned more than I have.</string>
<string name="5198">You can judge my behavior when you have proven your own to be perfect.</string>
<string name="5199">I shall escape from here and meet you back at the grove.</string>

<string name="5230">I am glad I was able to find you down here. Who are you?</string>
<string name="5231">It&apos;s too dangerous in here for me to worry about you. You had better get out on your own.</string>
<string name="5232">You just wait here. I&apos;ll be back.</string>
<string name="5233">Me happy me find you in big messy webs. Who you be?</string>
<string name="5234">Me not want protect you. You get out alone.</string>
<string name="5235">You no move. You wait, me be back.</string>
<string name="5236">No, but I&apos;m working on it. What can you tell me about the situation?</string>
<string name="5237">No. Some of the other druids have gone missing too. Do you know where they might be?</string>
<string name="5238">I have met Aawill. My name is &lt;FirstName&gt; and I was sent to rescue you.</string>
<string name="5239">No, but me do it soon. You know stuff &apos;bout it?</string>
<string name="5240">Me know Aawill. Him send me find you. Now you be found.</string>
<string name="5241">No. Some other druids gone too. You know &apos;bout them?</string>
<string name="5242">You were attacked by a deer? I&apos;ve never heard of such a thing.</string>
<string name="5243">Ha! You got your butt kicked by a deer?</string>
<string name="5244">Deer attack you? That odd.</string>
<string name="5245">Ha! You get butt kicked by deer?</string>
<string name="5246">The spiders attacked you on the surface?</string>
<string name="5247">Surprised twice? You were really alert for danger, weren&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="5248">Spiders come out of cave to get you?</string>
<string name="5249">You not very bright if surprised twice.</string>
<string name="5250">Tell me what you&apos;ve learned about the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="5251">Do you know what happened to the other druids who were searching for answers?</string>
<string name="5252">I hope you are feeling better now. You should get going.</string>
<string name="5253">What you learn &apos;bout Spirit of Wood?</string>
<string name="5254">Where other druids go?</string>
<string name="5255">You go now. You be safe.</string>
<string name="5256">Tell me more about this pool.</string>
<string name="5257">You mean there&apos;s a cave under the pool?</string>
<string name="5258">Tell me &apos;bout pool.</string>
<string name="5259">It live in the pool?</string>
<string name="5260">Why didn&apos;t you go into it?</string>
<string name="5261">What do you mean another realm?</string>
<string name="5262">You no go into pool?</string>
<string name="5263">What you mean other realm?</string>
<string name="5264">So now what am I supposed to do?</string>
<string name="5265">So how did you get down here?</string>
<string name="5266">Now what me do?</string>
<string name="5267">How you get down here?</string>
<string name="5268">Why don&apos;t you tell me your story?</string>
<string name="5269">You tell me what happen to you.</string>
<string name="5270">So how did you get captured?</string>
<string name="5271">So you&apos;re one of the druids I was looking for. Glad I found you.</string>
<string name="5272">You be druid me look for. Me glad me find you.</string>
<string name="5273">What were you doing down here?</string>
<string name="5274">How you get caught?</string>
<string name="5275">What you do in caves here?</string>
<string name="5276">Oh, thank you for unraveling me from that cocoon! I thought I was dead for sure.</string>
<string name="5277">If I can just get back to Aawill I will feel better.</string>
<string name="5278">I love nature, but not spiders. Not anymore. Thanks again for the rescue.</string>
<string name="5279">My name is Orlane. I am a druid who was sent by my leader Aawill to find out what is wrong with the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="5280">I will in a moment, but for now I just need to clear my head of the spider&apos;s poison. Could you please sit with me until I&apos;m up to leaving? It shouldn&apos;t take too long.</string>
<string name="5281">Please don&apos;t be long. I can&apos;t stand the touch of these spider webs.</string>
<string name="5282">I was sent into the Wood to find out why the creatures were attacking everyone. I tried talking to a deer in one clearing, but the poor thing&apos;s mind was so confused that it attacked me.</string>
<string name="5283">Limited mind, limited sense of humor. That&apos;s your story is it?</string>
<string name="5284">It&apos;s not funny. I would have been ready for an attack if it had been a wolf or a bear, but nobody expects to be attacked by a deer.</string>
<string name="5285">It came right at me and I tried to dodge, but it caught me in the side with a hoof. It reared up to strike me again, but then it suddenly turned and ran off.</string>
<string name="5286">I got up to try and follow, but then I heard a soft chittering sound behind me. I turned around, but before I even saw what was happening, something soft with long hairy legs and mandibles leapt on top of me.</string>
<string name="5287">Coming from you, that really, really hurts.</string>
<string name="5288">I was a little distracted at the moment. You get kicked by a deer and see how you feel.</string>
<string name="5289">I didn&apos;t even know what it was at first. I felt the thing bite me and suddenly the entire world started to spin. Next thing I knew I was in here, all wrapped up.</string>
<string name="5290">I was just waiting to feel another bite when you came along and set me free. Again, thank you so very much. Now I need to find my companion druids and see if we can figure out what to do about the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="5291">Well, it is obvious that something is severely wrong with the Spirit of the Wood. It seems to have gone crazy.</string>
<string name="5292">Usually the Spirit enters and exits the Wood through a pool in the north part of the forest, but from what I could gather, the Spirit hasn&apos;t been seen for a while.</string>
<string name="5293">The pool is some kind of entrance to another realm where the Spirit usually lives. I haven&apos;t the slightest idea what the other realm looks like though.</string>
<string name="5294">No, it&apos;s a kind of portal.</string>
<string name="5295">I should be fine now. Again, I can&apos;t thank you enough for your assistance. Good luck.</string>
<string name="5296">I don&apos;t know much about the pool, except a few legends. I do know that no living creature can get through the portal and into the other realm.</string>
<string name="5297">According to an old druid I once met, the portal exists between the realms of life and death. The Spirit exists as some sort of half-life, so it can go through the portal at will, but we can&apos;t.</string>
<string name="5298">I don&apos;t know. Maybe if you find the other druids that were searching, they could help you. Otherwise you might want to talk to a nymph. Maybe they haven&apos;t gone crazy like the animals.</string>
<string name="5299">It&apos;s another plane of existence. The pool acts as a portal to this other place.</string>
<string name="5300">I haven&apos;t a clue. We separated, so that we could discover as much as we could, then we were supposed to meet up back in the grove. </string>
<string name="5301">As you know, I never made it. I guess the others didn&apos;t either. I wonder if they found out more than I did?</string>
<string name="5302">You came back. Can I leave yet?</string>
<string name="5303">Thank the balance for Aawill. He is a strong leader.</string>
<string name="5304">I am glad you found me too. That must mean that Aawill sent you.</string>
<string name="5305">Good luck and be careful out there.</string>

<string name="5362">You noticed? Why don&apos;t you run along now, before the witch comes back.</string>
<string name="5363">You just wait here. I&apos;ll be back.</string>
<string name="5364">You be pretty. What you name?</string>
<string name="5365">Me not hag. You go now, before witch come back.</string>
<string name="5366">You no move. Me be back.</string>
<string name="5367">What did you discover about the Spirit?</string>
<string name="5368">Other druids have disappeared too. Do you know where they are?</string>
<string name="5369">Why don&apos;t you tell me what happened to you?</string>
<string name="5370">You know what wrong with Spirit?</string>
<string name="5371">Me want know how you got caught.</string>
<string name="5372">Other druids gone too. You know where them be?</string>
<string name="5373">Why would you seek the witch?</string>
<string name="5374">That certainly turned out to be a brilliant decision.</string>
<string name="5375">Why you think of witch?</string>
<string name="5376">That be stupid idea.</string>
<string name="5377">Did she recognize you or something?</string>
<string name="5378">Why would she stare at your face?</string>
<string name="5379">She know you face from before?</string>
<string name="5380">Why she stare at you face?</string>
<string name="5381">Tell me what you&apos;ve learned about the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="5382">Do you know what happened to the other druids?</string>
<string name="5383">Do you need help escaping, or can you make it on your own?</string>
<string name="5384">What you learn &apos;bout Spirit of Wood?</string>
<string name="5385">Where other druids go?</string>
<string name="5386">Me go now. You get out okay?</string>
<string name="5387">Tell me more about this pool.</string>
<string name="5388">How do you think the Spirit would have reacted to you?</string>
<string name="5389">Tell me &apos;bout pool.</string>
<string name="5390">What Spirit do if you talk?</string>
<string name="5391">Why didn&apos;t you go into it?</string>
<string name="5392">What do you mean another realm?</string>
<string name="5393">You no go into pool?</string>
<string name="5394">What you mean other realm?</string>
<string name="5395">Do you have any suggestions of what I should do?</string>
<string name="5396">So how did you get down here?</string>
<string name="5397">Now what me do?</string>
<string name="5398">How you get down here?</string>
<string name="5399">Why don&apos;t you tell me your story?</string>
<string name="5400">You tell me what happen to you.</string>
<string name="5401">He sent me to rescue some druids. Are you one of them?</string>
<string name="5402">I have met someone named Aawill. How do you know him?</string>
<string name="5403">Him tell me rescue druids. You be druid?</string>
<string name="5404">Me know him. How you know him?</string>
<string name="5405">What are you doing here in the witch&apos;s house?</string>
<string name="5406">What you do in this place with witch?</string>
<string name="5407">Leave my face alone you horrible... oh, wait, you&apos;re not that ghastly hag.</string>
<string name="5408">I&apos;m still beautiful, thanks to you. You have my eternal gratitude.</string>
<string name="5409">My name is Bree. Besides being the most beautiful druid in the Neverwinter Wood, I am also one of the druids who was investigating the problems with the Wood&apos;s Spirit.</string>
<string name="5410">Wait, before you go, did Aawill send you?</string>
<string name="5411">Oh, please don&apos;t be long. I must get away from here soon.</string>
<string name="5412">I was wandering through the forest, dodging encounters with the normal inhabitants. There was no point in even trying to speak with the animals; they were almost rabid with fear and anger. Then I thought of the witch.</string>
<string name="5413">You should be careful who you call stupid.</string>
<string name="5414">How could I possibly have anticipated her reaction to seeing how incredibly beautiful I am?</string>
<string name="5415">The animals have always held the witch in high esteem. She protects and helps them quite often. I figured that the Spirit probably wouldn&apos;t have any control over her mind, so perhaps she would be a source of information.</string>
<string name="5416">I found the witch in a clearing near here. She was harvesting some herbs at the time, so I came out quietly and waited for her to notice me. She worked for a while, then turned and smiled at me. Her eyes remained fixed on my face for a long time.</string>
<string name="5417">Are you blind? My radiant beauty stunned her, the poor thing.</string>
<string name="5418">She just seemed to admire my looks. No surprise really, since she certainly has none. She convinced me to enter her house, and we sat down to have tea. We talked a little, but then I started to get dizzy and I realized there was something in my tea. </string>
<string name="5419">Next thing I knew I was locked in this room. The witch came in and muttered something about stealing my face. I don&apos;t know what she meant by that, although if I had her face I&apos;d want a different one too. </string>
<string name="5420">It&apos;s gone insane! The whole forest is caught up in its insanity, and if someone doesn&apos;t stop it soon I fear the creatures will start tearing each other apart.</string>
<string name="5421">The Spirit is normally peaceful and comes into the Wood through its pool to tend to the creatures. Since the violence began, the Spirit hasn&apos;t come through at all. If it had, I would have tried to talk to it.</string>
<string name="5422">The pool is some kind of entrance to another realm where the Spirit usually lives. I haven&apos;t the slightest idea what the other realm looks like though.</string>
<string name="5423">I don&apos;t know what it would have done. It might have attacked me, but I would have tried anyways. It is the source of the problem.</string>
<string name="5424">I can make it on my own. I will meet up with you at the druid grove.</string>
<string name="5425">I don&apos;t know much about the pool, mostly just stories. I do know that no living creature can get through the portal and into the other realm.</string>
<string name="5426">I think Orlane told me something about how the portal exists between the realms of life and death. The Spirit exists as some sort of half-life, so it can go back and forth through the portal, but we can&apos;t.</string>
<string name="5427">Somehow you need to find a way through the portal, then you need to either cure the Spirit or, and I hate to say this, you need to kill it. Most druids wouldn&apos;t even suggest something like that, but you do what you have to.</string>
<string name="5428">It&apos;s another plane of existence. The pool acts as a portal to this other place.</string>
<string name="5429">I don&apos;t know where the little one went, Orlane&apos;s his name, but I know that the pretty elf, Terari, was going to try his charms on the nymphs. You could go ask him.</string>
<string name="5430">They might know where he went. Of course they might have gone as crazy as the rest of the forest, so you might want to be careful what you say.</string>
<string name="5431">I&apos;m so glad you&apos;re back. I was starting to worry. Can I leave yet?</string>
<string name="5432">Wonderful Aawill! Thank goodness for his wisdom.</string>
<string name="5433">He is the head of our druidic circle.</string>
<string name="5434">Carry the image of my beautiful face in your mind, for good luck. Farewell.</string>
<string name="5435">Don&apos;t ask me how you can do any of those things, because I don&apos;t know. I know I am both highly beautiful and intelligent, but I simply don&apos;t have the answers.</string>
<string name="5436">All I want to do is get back to the grove and take a bath.</string>
<string name="5437">Now that you have freed me, I will return to the grove and consult with the other druids about the Spirit of the Wood.</string>
<string name="5438">The forest is destroying itself all around you and I am trying to find a way to save it.</string>
<string name="5439">There are some missing druids that I am seeking and I hoped you might have seen one.</string>
<string name="5440">Get out of my way you ugly hag, before I chop off your withered head!</string>
<string name="5441">Me try to help forest, so it not kill people no more.</string>
<string name="5442">Me just stop in for visit.</string>
<string name="5443">You get out of way or me chop you ugly face off.</string>
<string name="5444">I was just looking around.</string>
<string name="5445">Me need find missing druids to help. You see druid anywhere?</string>
<string name="5446">I heard that you were a friend to forest creatures and thought you might know something that could assist me.</string>
<string name="5447">I&apos;m just desperate to find some information or anything that could help.</string>
<string name="5448">Me thought you friend of animals. Me thought you help, maybe?</string>
<string name="5449">Me need help bad. Me take any me can get.</string>
<string name="5450">I&apos;ve heard enough. I&apos;ll leave now.</string>
<string name="5451">Me heard &apos;nuff. Me go.</string>
<string name="5452">I didn&apos;t come to gawk. What happened to you?</string>
<string name="5453">You would certainly fit into the freak show at a circus, but I&apos;m here to find something specific, not to stare.</string>
<string name="5454">I guess I&apos;ll put you out of your misery then hag!</string>
<string name="5455">Me not here to stare. What make you ugly?</string>
<string name="5456">You would win prize for ugliest person, but me look for something, not here for show.</string>
<string name="5457">You too ugly to live, so me kill you.</string>
<string name="5458">What can I do to help you?</string>
<string name="5459">What are you willing to give me if I help you?</string>
<string name="5460">I don&apos;t trust you. I think I&apos;ll kill you instead.</string>
<string name="5461">What me do to help?</string>
<string name="5462">What you give me if me help you?</string>
<string name="5463">Me no trust you, so me kill you.</string>
<string name="5464">All right, what do you want me to do?</string>
<string name="5465">That&apos;s not enough. I want gold.</string>
<string name="5466">What you want me to do?</string>
<string name="5467">Not &apos;nuff. Me want gold.</string>
<string name="5468">Okay, I will get this mirror for you.</string>
<string name="5469">What will you give me to get this mirror for you?</string>
<string name="5470">Okay, me get you mirror.</string>
<string name="5471">What you give me if me get you mirror?</string>
<string name="5472">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; If you really want my help, you should show some trust by telling me what happened to you.</string>
<string name="5473">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You want help, you tell me what happen to you first.</string>
<string name="5474">Nothing. Nevermind.</string>
<string name="5475">Where did you say the nymph lives again?</string>
<string name="5476">I have the mirror right here.</string>
<string name="5477">Where you say nymph live?</string>
<string name="5478">Me have you mirror here.</string>
<string name="5479">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5480">I want the gem and the information though.</string>
<string name="5481">Me want gem and information too.</string>
<string name="5482">Uh... you&apos;re right. You are definitely striking to look at.</string>
<string name="5483">But you don&apos;t look any different.</string>
<string name="5484">Uh... you right. Me no think you would look so... lovely.</string>
<string name="5485">But you no look no different.</string>
<string name="5486">How do I know that you really have any information about them?</string>
<string name="5487">I guess I need any information I can get. What do you need help with?</string>
<string name="5488">How me know you know stuff &apos;bout druids?</string>
<string name="5489">Me need help to find them. What me help you with?</string>
<string name="5490">Why is the druid locked up in your house?</string>
<string name="5491">Why druid be locked in you house?</string>
<string name="5492">What in Sune&apos;s name are you doing in my house?</string>
<string name="5493">I see you are back. What do you want?</string>
<string name="5494">You have returned. Does that mean you have found the mirror?</string>
<string name="5495">Ugly! I was one of the most beautiful women in the land. Now leave my house before I turn you into a toad!</string>
<string name="5496">Do you think that gives you the right to barge into my home? You come in here, slaughter my servants, help yourself to my possessions and you think that noble intentions suffice to explain your actions?</string>
<string name="5497">Oh, really. Very interesting. Well... what is information on that worth to you? Would you be willing to do me a small service?</string>
<string name="5498">Don&apos;t treat me like a fool! I may have lost my stunning beauty, but I haven&apos;t lost my mind. Nobody goes wandering around through the Wood, where everything has gone insane, just to look around. What are you searching for?</string>
<string name="5499">Good. Begone from my home and don&apos;t come back to play &apos;stare at the freak&apos; again.</string>
<string name="5500">If I knew anything that could really help the animals, I would certainly have done something about it. I have been doing some research, but I haven&apos;t gotten very far.</string>
<string name="5501">What I don&apos;t do is help people. You come to stare and humiliate me, just because I have fallen so far from a glamorous beauty to a despised fright.</string>
<string name="5502">It&apos;s none of your business and I don&apos;t like to talk about it. If you are interested, there is something you could do to help me though.</string>
<string name="5503">I have a small gem that might interest you. It has elven writing scribed on its facets and seems to have some value to an elf in Port Llast. He&apos;s been writing me, trying to convince me to give it up, but I couldn&apos;t be bothered.</string>
<string name="5504">I&apos;m sure you could sell it to him for a fair price. I also have knowledge of the whereabouts of a druid who has been missing. She might have information on the Spirit of the Wood. If you do what I ask I will give you both things.</string>
<string name="5505">The only thing that holds true value for me is my beauty. There is a nymph who lives in this forest who has a mirror that can return my beauty. I overheard two dryads talking about it, just before all this trouble started.</string>
<string name="5506">The nymph lives to the northeast of here. I would get it myself, but I can&apos;t go anywhere near her. The unearthly beauty of her face physically hurts me, and she shuns me because I am ugly. Please, please get me the mirror!</string>
<string name="5507">I have a small gem that might interest you. It has elven writing scribed on its facets and seems to have some value to an elf in Port Llast. He&apos;s been writing me, trying to convince me to give it up, but I couldn&apos;t be bothered.</string>
<string name="5508">I&apos;m sure the elf will give you a fair price for the gem. I also have knowledge of the whereabouts of a druid who has been missing. She might have information on the Spirit of the Wood. If you do what I ask I will give you both things.</string>
<string name="5509">Oh thank you! You dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. I look forward to the return of the dazzling beauty I once possessed. Should you be successful, I will gladly give you a precious gem and tell you what I know of the druids... if, indeed, that is the kind of reward you still desire, then. Ha ha!</string>
<string name="5510">Good luck, and don&apos;t be long please.</string>
<string name="5511">Then you shall die a painful, deforming death!</string>
<string name="5512">I know my beauty keeps drawing you back, but please leave my house now.</string>
<string name="5513">I tire of people returning to stare at the freak. You are hardly a pleasure to look at, so tell me what you want and be quick about it.</string>
<string name="5514">You will get gold from selling the gem to the elf in Port Llast, and you could probably convince Aawill to give you gold for rescuing the druid. You will also, hopefully, get information to help you with the Spirit of the Wood, which Aawill will likely pay you for.</string>
<string name="5515">I would say that should be more than sufficient, even for someone as greedy as yourself. Now, do we have a deal?</string>
<string name="5516">How dare you! I would like to see what you look like when age has left her dusty tracks on your face. I was not always this monstrous hag you see before you. But I would rather not speak of that right now. Tell me what you seek.</string>
<string name="5517">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t know why you should care, but if it will convince you to help me then I guess I can tell you. When I turned thirty I found that I had my first noticeable wrinkle. The thought of my beauty fading terrified me.</string>
<string name="5518">I decided that I would try to make a potion of longevity to help me keep young. I... I won&apos;t tell you all of the details. Somehow I messed up the potion and when I drank it, instead of becoming 15 years younger, I aged 100 years.</string>
<string name="5519">I have sustained my life in ways I cannot discuss, but I have found a solution to my problem, if you will only help me.</string>
<string name="5520">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No. It is none of your business. You will help me or leave now.</string>
<string name="5521">Then be gone and bother me no more.</string>
<string name="5522">She lives somewhere to the northwest of here. If you find an arrogant, young tart in skimpy clothing, that&apos;s her.</string>
<string name="5523">Please bring the mirror back soon.</string>
<string name="5524">Yes, get out of my home. I don&apos;t need you staring at me constantly!</string>
<string name="5525">Oh, yes, yes, YES! I am so glad I trusted you with the task. Now if you will just give it to me, then I can be cured. You will be blessed to look upon my true, dazzling beauty.</string>
<string name="5526">Of course. Here is the gem; you should be able to get something for it from that elf, Elaith, in Port Llast. He seemed quite desperate for it. </string>
<string name="5527">Look at me! It worked. I&apos;m beautiful again! I&apos;ll bet that you never expected me to be so incredibly stunning now did you?</string>
<string name="5528">Oh, it&apos;s true, it&apos;s true! And you are quite perceptive, so I&apos;ll help you even more. I found an old book that talks about entering the realm of the Spirit of the Wood. It is in my library to the southeast of here.</string>
<string name="5529">Good luck adventurers!</string>
<string name="5530">Yes I do! You must be blind! No, wait, you are just jealous of me because I am so much better looking than you now. Yes, that&apos;s it. Go away now, simpleton. </string>
<string name="5531">I can&apos;t tell you anything now, but if you truly want to save the female druid, then you will listen to what I say.</string>
<string name="5532">That is something best left unspoken; besides, I am young and beautiful now, so I promise it will never happen again. Now, don&apos;t you think I am simply gorgeous now?</string>
<string name="5533">Road to Port Llast.</string>

<string name="5580">I do not jump through hoops! Defend yourself!</string>
<string name="5581">Me not play for you! You die... uh... again!</string>
<string name="5582">Okay, a clan... uh... Big Duck Clan?</string>
<string name="5583">The mighty Clan I Don&apos;t Have a Clue?</string>
<string name="5584">Um... a clan? It maybe... Clan... Famous Guys... in Hats?</string>
<string name="5585">Mirialis Clan.</string>
<string name="5586">I&apos;ll take a shot. Clan Long Since Gone?</string>
<string name="5587">I do not know. How would I find out?</string>
<string name="5588">Me don&apos;t know. How me find out?</string>
<string name="5589">That&apos;s it? A stupid riddle?</string>
<string name="5590">What? You just gots a stupid riddle?</string>
<string name="5591">&lt;StartAction&gt;Show Maegel the book you found on the corpse.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="5592">What? OH! Yes, of course it did. Real far.</string>
<string name="5593">No, not... uh... YES, far. Real far. Whoo, me tired.</string>
<string name="5594">I&apos;m sorry. Maybe you have another riddle?</string>
<string name="5595">Uh, me sorry. Maybe you gots another riddle?</string>
<string name="5596">I am sorry for you, but I did answer correctly.</string>
<string name="5597">That the way it goes, me guess. So, gimme stuff.</string>
<string name="5598">If it&apos;s any consolation, I am on an important quest.</string>
<string name="5599">Uh, me on important quest already. Feel better?</string>
<string name="5600">Don&apos;t blame me. I was just hunting bears.</string>
<string name="5601">Me just hunting bears. What you want?</string>
<string name="5602">Who has summoned me? Who claims the title of Champion? Who is my inheritor?</string>
<string name="5603">A contendor approaches. My cause... my people... vanished long ago, but my spirit is vain, and I will have the respect I am due.</string>
<string name="5604">Answer my question and prove you are my proper inheritor. Fail, and burn for dishonoring my legacy with your ignorance.</string>
<string name="5605">So be it. Show your knowledge of my legacy. The clan of my siblings, now dust, just as I... What was it called?</string>
<string name="5606">You would be pointless by choice?! Not good enough!</string>
<string name="5607">You tilt without reason. I am a shade of what I was, and cannot be made less than I am. You will have nothing.</string>
<string name="5608">It&apos;s... it&apos;s not stupid, it&apos;s a good one. See, it ensures that you quested to know what I have done, and are therefore worthy of what is mine.</string>
<string name="5609">Quest for the legacy I left. Know the glory of my lost kingdom and you shall have what is mine. Now burn, and learn of your failure.</string>
<string name="5610">That is... correct. You did not hesitate. How did you come by this difficult information? My legacy must have reached far.</string>
<string name="5611">You are just guessing! Respect me and quest for what I want! Search and be rewarded! Taunt me again and I shall not be so lenient!</string>
<string name="5612">You are doing that on purpose! Do not mock my fate! Quest for my answer and be rewarded! Taunt me again and suffer further!</string>
<string name="5613">Your manner is strange, but the answer satisfies. Take my great possessions and fulfill the prophecies laid down at my death.</string>
<string name="5614">I was not forgotten. At last, I can rest.</string>
<string name="5615">A corpse&apos;s book? This isn&apos;t right. He must have quested. You just had the answer served on a platter, swiped from his backpack.</string>
<string name="5616">What? No, no I don&apos;t. See, I&apos;m dead so I don&apos;t get out much. Idiot. &quot;Another riddle,&quot; &lt;he/she&gt; says. Thanks a lot.</string>
<string name="5617">Do you know how long I&apos;ve been here? Hah? I&apos;ve watched water drips melt rock. A snail is a year&apos;s worth of excitement!</string>
<string name="5618">Yes, but... that&apos;s not the way it was supposed to be... You&apos;re supposed to be on a great quest to fulfill my legacy.</string>
<string name="5619">Should&apos;a walked toward the light when I had the chance. I don&apos;t believe this.</string>
<string name="5620">What?! What do you want? Look, I&apos;m done, all right? My stuff is in the casket. It&apos;s yours. Go nuts. I&apos;m out of here.</string>
<string name="5621">Oh yes, I am ever so pleased to be a diversion from something important. Don&apos;t patronize me. I was great once.</string>
<string name="5622">Hunting... bears? You were killing simple animals and just stumbled on my centuries old tomb? Well, I certainly feel important now. Yes &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="5623">Yes.</string>
<string name="5624">No.</string>
<string name="5625">Yes.</string>
<string name="5626">You notice what looks to be an underwater passage. If you could hold your breath long enough, perhaps it would be possible to swim to the other side. Do you wish to try?</string>
<string name="5627">You dive into the pool but run out of breath before reaching the passage.</string>
<string name="5628">You successfully make it to the other side.</string>
<string name="5629">It should be much easier to make it back. Do you wish to try?</string>
<string name="5630">You successfully make it to the other side.</string>
<string name="5631">This wall fell to fractures and temperature changes years ago, but ages too late for the corpse trapped behind it.</string>
<string name="5632">Intruder! Sound the alarm!</string>
<string name="5633">I sense the wardstone. You may pass.</string>
<string name="5634">When you pull the lever, you hear an electrical hum.</string>
<string name="5635">Apologies won&apos;t save you now, mage! Die!</string>
<string name="5636">Perhaps you had better answer my questions before I finish what you started.</string>
<string name="5637">I give you rash, bad guy! Die! Die!</string>
<string name="5638">I no got rash. You answer me questions now!</string>
<string name="5639">I have been sent here to take a magical gem from you. </string>
<string name="5640">Me come for magic gem.</string>
<string name="5641">I have no further questions.</string>
<string name="5642">Me have no more questions.</string>
<string name="5643">You are of no use to me. Die!</string>
<string name="5644">You useless! Die!</string>
<string name="5645">I have been hired to get the gem and I intend to get it. Hand it over now!</string>
<string name="5646">Elaith Serpent guy hire me so me gonna get the gem. Give it now!</string>
<string name="5647">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That is not acceptable. Tell me what happened to the gem.</string>
<string name="5648">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me say no. You tell me what happen to gem.</string>
<string name="5649">I do not care to listen to your excuses. Tell me where the gem is or suffer the consequences.</string>
<string name="5650">No excuses! You tell where gem or me hurt you good!</string>
<string name="5651">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You say that YOU are unable to retrieve the gem but I believe that I have just proven myself to be stronger than you.</string>
<string name="5652">Come on, you must have more than that. Hand it over!</string>
<string name="5653">C&apos;mon! You have more treasures! Gimme!</string>
<string name="5654">That is not enough! Give me more or I&apos;ll feed you a foot of sharpened steel!</string>
<string name="5655">Me want more or me stab you good!</string>
<string name="5656">Who are you?</string>
<string name="5657">I want your valuables. Anything and everything of value.</string>
<string name="5658">Who you be?</string>
<string name="5659">You give me gold and treasures.</string>
<string name="5660">Who are you, exactly?</string>
<string name="5661">That isn&apos;t how it works. You answer my questions or I kill you.</string>
<string name="5662">I dunno. Who you be?</string>
<string name="5663">Nuh-uh. You answer me or you die.</string>
<string name="5664">Go on.</string>
<string name="5665">Enough of this. I have another question.</string>
<string name="5666">Story too long. Me have other question.</string>
<string name="5667">And the gem?</string>
<string name="5668">I care not. Let me ask you something else.</string>
<string name="5669">Me no care. Other question.</string>
<string name="5670">Where is this area and how do I get there?</string>
<string name="5671">Where be area and how me get there?</string>
<string name="5672">Give me the key to the door and I shall get the gem myself.</string>
<string name="5673">Gimme key and me get gem.</string>
<string name="5674">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there anything in the area that could help me get through without becoming demon fodder?</string>
<string name="5675">I will attempt to close the portal as I search for the gem.</string>
<string name="5676">Yeah, me try close portal for you.</string>
<string name="5677">If the reward is good.</string>
<string name="5678">What be reward?</string>
<string name="5679">I&apos;m not interested. I just want the gem.</string>
<string name="5680">Me no care. Just want gem.</string>
<string name="5681">How about a little bit of the reward in advance?</string>
<string name="5682">You give some reward now?</string>
<string name="5683">I haven&apos;t closed the portal yet.</string>
<string name="5684">Me no close portal yet.</string>
<string name="5685">What was I supposed to do again?</string>
<string name="5686">What you want me do again?</string>
<string name="5687">The portal has been closed.</string>
<string name="5688">Me close portal real good.</string>
<string name="5689">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5690">Could you tell me the story about the portal again?</string>
<string name="5691">Me want to hear portal story again.</string>
<string name="5692">You mentioned that you had lost the gem?</string>
<string name="5693">You say you lose gem?</string>
<string name="5694">We are both of the same race. Surely you could take that into consideration and offer a bit more.</string>
<string name="5695">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ve just saved your home from a demon infestation. I want a bigger reward.</string>
<string name="5696">Why don&apos;t you throw a little extra in so I won&apos;t have to hurt you again?</string>
<string name="5697">Indeed. Farewell!</string>
<string name="5698">Me &lt;race&gt; kind. You &lt;race&gt; kind. Be nice to me.</string>
<string name="5699">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me save you big demon trouble. You give more money?</string>
<string name="5700">How &apos;bout you give more money and me not kill you real bad?</string>
<string name="5701">Bye bye.</string>
<string name="5702">Sure. That would be handy.</string>
<string name="5703">Yuh, it move me so me no walk.</string>
<string name="5704">I&apos;ll find my own way out.</string>
<string name="5705">Me okay. Bye bye.</string>
<string name="5706">How in the name of the gods did you get in here?! Prepare to be destroyed, utterly!</string>
<string name="5707">Perhaps I was too rash in attacking you. Please, accept my apology.</string>
<string name="5708">Then I shall blast you into dust!</string>
<string name="5709">What questions do you have?</string>
<string name="5710">Please! Attack no more! I am defeated!</string>
<string name="5711">I appreciate not being killed. Take this wardstone and my servants shall leave you be. </string>
<string name="5712">So the Serpent still seeks an easy way home. Well, he shall have to become used to disappointment. He cannot have the gem.</string>
<string name="5713">You don&apos;t understand! I have lost the gem and am quite unable to retrieve it, despite my powers. You would be wise to forget about this job and leave now.</string>
<string name="5714">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, if you wish to get yourself killed, why should I care?</string>
<string name="5715">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; In good conscience, I cannot! For your own good, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, do not press the issue!</string>
<string name="5716">(sigh) I&apos;ve been defeated by a common houseburglar? Fine, take my gold you barbaric leech!</string>
<string name="5717">Will you not even leave me enough to feed myself?! Take it and begone!</string>
<string name="5718">There is no more gold. I shall be henceforth known as &apos;Wanev the Idiot Pauper&apos; by those bastards in the Gibbering Twelve! My reputation is ruined!</string>
<string name="5719">Stop, please! If you are so vey desperate take this and begone!</string>
<string name="5720">I am Wanev, a man well-versed in the magical arts and of no small renown. I am somewhat displeased at being defeated by you. My idiot friends will have many a jest at my expense.</string>
<string name="5721">I should like to counter that with a question of my own. Why are you in my home?</string>
<string name="5722">I had heard that Elaith intended to take this gem and prior to receiving that information I had taken little interest in the bauble. I wondered why he intended to steal it.</string>
<string name="5723">To be honest, I am not a patient man. I had better things to do than search through my library trying to match the description of the gem to one of the artifacts in the books.</string>
<string name="5724">So, I thought it wise to summon an imp or some sort of lesser demon and make him do the legwork. There was, uh, a bit of a setback.</string>
<string name="5725">I was somewhat less than careful with the preparations and the little fiend escaped the summoning circle. Let this be a lesson about casting when drunk.</string>
<string name="5726">The wretch expanded the portal and began to bring forth his demonic minions. I sealed off the area as fast as I could and sobered up.</string>
<string name="5727">In my haste, I left the gem in a storage chest and subsequent forays into my summoning chamber have met with ill luck. I shall truly miss Pooky. He was a loving familiar.</string>
<string name="5728">So you see, the area is quite full of demonic adversaries and the gem lies within, most likely stolen by that spiteful imp!</string>
<string name="5729">The door behind me shall teleport you there though I keep it well locked for safety&apos;s sake.</string>
<string name="5730">Take the key and know this: if you should be able to close the demon portal, I would be most grateful. The gem is yours regardless. What say you?</string>
<string name="5731">I&apos;m sure I can dig up some magical equipment of no small worth while you try to set things right.</string>
<string name="5732">You need only kill the imp that I originally summoned and place his cursed little heart in the summoning brazier. That should take care of the portal. His name is Gulgash.</string>
<string name="5733">Please return to me when you have closed the portal for I shall try to find a suitable reward in the meantime.</string>
<string name="5734">Very well. If you change your mind, I would be grateful.</string>
<string name="5735">I&apos;d love to but I have nothing with me. I&apos;m sure I can find something by the time you&apos;ve completed the task.</string>
<string name="5736">Hello, again. Have you managed to kill the imp and close the portal?</string>
<string name="5737">Greetings. Have you changed your mind about attempting to close the portal?</string>
<string name="5738">Hmm, yes. The hallway that leads from the first large area you&apos;ll find yourself in leads to my treasure chamber. This is, in fact, where I had stored the gem. </string>
<string name="5739">Halfway down the hallway is a defence lever. When pulled, it lets off a rather nasty spell in the treasure chamber. This should weaken any demonic beings that might have made their way there.</string>
<string name="5740">What do you want now? Don&apos;t be rash and attack me again.</string>
<string name="5741">Indeed. I made a mistake when summoning that imp and he opened up a demonic portal in my summoning chambers.</string>
<string name="5742">Please return when you have closed the portal. The door to the summoning chamber is behind me.</string>
<string name="5743">You need only kill the imp that I originally summoned and place his cursed little heart in the summoning brazier. That should take care of the portal. His name is Gulgash.</string>
<string name="5744">Ah, excellent. Here is a reward for your troubles. A bruised ego and the loss of a couple of magic items are a small price to pay for having my summoning chamber back. </string>
<string name="5745">Well, I have some work to do so we shall most likely not meet again. I could set up a teleport portal to help you get out of here, if you&apos;d like.</string>
<string name="5746">Why not, my friend! Here is some extra coin!</string>
<string name="5747">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmm. You have saved me a great deal of trouble! Here is some extra coin!</string>
<string name="5748">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The reward I&apos;ve given you is quite valuable and quite sufficient.</string>
<string name="5749">Calmly, friend. There is no reason for violence. Take my last coins, then!</string>
<string name="5750">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5751">No need to get nasty. I&apos;ll tell you.</string>
<string name="5752">Very well. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5753">As you wish. Farewell.</string>
<string name="5754">Bwok, bwok-bwok... </string>
<string name="5755">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="5756">Me ask questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="5757">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5758">Do you know anything about the cult that spread plague in Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="5759">Have you ever been to Charwood?</string>
<string name="5760">I saw a cave up past those waterfalls. Do you know anything about it?</string>
<string name="5761">Anything interesting going on in these parts?</string>
<string name="5762">You know stuff &apos;bout that plague cult in Neverwinter?</string>

<string name="5764">Me see cave past them waterfalls. What be in dere?</string>
<string name="5765">You know odd things about this area?</string>
<string name="5766">You&apos;re sure you don&apos;t know anything else about the cult?</string>
<string name="5767">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Is there anyone who might know more?</string>
<string name="5768">You sure you not know more &apos;bout da cult?</string>
<string name="5769">What sorts of adventures?</string>
<string name="5770">I&apos;d be interested in work, if you know of anything.</string>
<string name="5771">Are there any places of interest around here that I should visit?</string>
<string name="5772">Adventures? What adventures you speak of?</string>
<string name="5773">Me want work.</string>
<string name="5774">You know good places to go &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="5775">Is there anything else you can tell me about Charwood?</string>
<string name="5776">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Do you know of anyone who might have been there?</string>
<string name="5777">Tell more. Me want to know more &apos;bout Charwood?</string>

<string name="5781">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You tell me. It hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="5782">I&apos;m investigating some recent events you might be aware of.</string>
<string name="5783">Me hear of stuff going on. Maybe you know more?</string>
<string name="5784">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="5785">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="5786">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="5787">Farmlands stretch on for long time. Me need directions.</string>
<string name="5788">Where does the west road lead?</string>
<string name="5789">Where does the east road lead?</string>
<string name="5790">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="5791">Where da west road go?</string>
<string name="5792">Where da east road go?</string>
<string name="5793">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="5794">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="5795">No, me have other question.</string>
<string name="5796">Who are you?</string>
<string name="5797">Who you be?</string>
<string name="5798">I want to speak with you about Erik&apos;s brooch.</string>
<string name="5799">We talk &apos;bout that brooch of Erik&apos;s, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="5800">Come on, darling, you can tell me, can&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="5801">You purty when you pout. Come, you tell Mister &lt;FirstName&gt;, yuh?</string>
<string name="5802">Be reasonable. It&apos;s all he has left to remind him of his ma... </string>
<string name="5803">How&apos;d you like me to pry it from your cold, dead hands?</string>
<string name="5804">Slow down, I need to ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="5805">But it be all that remind him of his ma, yuh?</string>
<string name="5806">You give it or me just kill you an&apos; bring him your corpse, yuh?</string>
<string name="5807">Slow down. Me ask &apos;bout something else.</string>
<string name="5808">1,000 gold? Deal.</string>
<string name="5809">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; It&apos;s a simple peasant&apos;s brooch, worth 250 gold pieces at most!</string>
<string name="5810">Hand the brooch over or I&apos;ll gut you like a fish!</string>
<string name="5811">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; That too much for peasant&apos;s doodad. Me give 250 gp.</string>
<string name="5812">You give brooch or me slit stomachs, yuh?!</string>
<string name="5813">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Take the 250 gold. The next fool Erik sends might not be so happy to negotiate.</string>
<string name="5814">400 gold? Deal.</string>
<string name="5815">250 gp? Deal.</string>
<string name="5816">I&apos;m done haggling. Time to kill you and take it for free!</string>
<string name="5817">Me not argue no more. Now me kill you!!</string>
<string name="5818">I can&apos;t afford to spend that much gold on this.</string>
<string name="5819">Me not got that much gold for spend on this.</string>
<string name="5820">I can&apos;t afford to spend that much on this.</string>
<string name="5821">Me not afford that much for this.</string>
<string name="5822">I don&apos;t have 400 gold to spend on this.</string>
<string name="5823">Me no got 400 gold to spend on this.</string>
<string name="5824">I don&apos;t believe you! Hand over the brooch... now!</string>
<string name="5825">Hey, if you don&apos;t have the item, I want my money back!</string>
<string name="5826">What do you mean you&apos;ve been robbed?</string>
<string name="5827">Really? I guess I&apos;ll be going then.</string>
<string name="5828">Me no believe you! You give item now!</string>
<string name="5829">Hey, you no give item. Me want me money back!</string>
<string name="5830">What you mean you be robbed?</string>
<string name="5831">Yuh? Me guess me go now, den.</string>
<string name="5832">That&apos;s not fair!</string>
<string name="5833">Give my money back or I&apos;ll slit your throat!</string>
<string name="5834">Fine, keep the money.</string>
<string name="5835">That not fair!</string>
<string name="5836">You give me money back, or me kill you!</string>
<string name="5837">Fine, you keep money.</string>
<string name="5838">Maybe I can buy it off you... </string>
<string name="5839">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; He loves you Constance. Don&apos;t betray that.</string>
<string name="5840">For but a peasant&apos;s brooch, you&apos;ll have my undying love.</string>
<string name="5841">Uh, well maybe me buy it off you, then.</string>
<string name="5842">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; But he love you Constance. Be good to him.</string>
<string name="5843">Gimme da li&apos;l brooch an&apos; you have my heart, li&apos;l lady... </string>
<string name="5844">Money? That&apos;s all this means to you?</string>
<string name="5845">Money? That be all this mean to you?</string>
<string name="5846">All right, tell me a little about Erik.</string>
<string name="5847">Uh... tell me &apos;bout Erik.</string>
<string name="5848">Why is the herd so important?</string>
<string name="5849">Why this &apos;erd be so important?</string>
<string name="5850">Why is the herd so important?</string>
<string name="5851">Why this &apos;erd be so important?</string>
<string name="5852">Why so much money?</string>
<string name="5853">Hello, handsome... What brings you to a lady&apos;s bedroom?</string>
<string name="5854">Fare you well, then. Perhaps we&apos;ll speak again.</string>
<string name="5855">Yes, yes. On your way.</string>
<string name="5856">At long last and good riddance.</string>
<string name="5857">I see. A little on the slow side, are we?</string>
<string name="5858">I&apos;d be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="5859">I suppose I can answer a question for you. What might it be?</string>
<string name="5860">I&apos;ll answer your questions if you don&apos;t take too long... </string>
<string name="5861">On our last trip to Port Llast, I heard a woman telling how awful the plague had been. Don&apos;t know much about the cult but they sound horrible.</string>
<string name="5862">Me? No, what&apos;s the point? They&apos;re pretty self-sufficient it seems and so are we.</string>
<string name="5863">Oh, that&apos;s the den of those wretched wolves!</string>
<string name="5864">Well there&apos;s always some sort of adventure to be had when you&apos;re this far from the rest of the world.</string>
<string name="5865">They&apos;ve killed two cows already this season. You can ask me pa about it if you&apos;re really interested. He&apos;s been watching them like a hawk!</string>
<string name="5866">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="5867">Well... there is that fool Erik... But that&apos;s his problem, not mine... </string>
<string name="5868">You should talk to me pa. He&apos;s out watching over the cattle I&apos;m sure. A helping hand is always welcome, what with the wolves and all.</string>
<string name="5869">I&apos;m not sure what you would find interesting. There&apos;s our farm and then the one Erik works with his pa. Not much more than that.</string>
<string name="5870">Well I suppose that&apos;s about as direct as one can get.</string>
<string name="5871">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="5872">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I suppose it wouldn&apos;t. He gave me a little something and now wants it back.</string>
<string name="5873">If you want to know more about it, I suggest you talk to Erik yourself. Just take the north fork and the road will take you right to his front door.</string>
<string name="5874">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Sorry, but it&apos;s his problem, not mine. If you really must know more, go find him yourself. Where the road forks, just head north.</string>
<string name="5875">It gets pretty isolated out here. What news there is is usually about the weather, a new calf, or a good harvest.</string>
<string name="5876">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="5877">I don&apos;t know, maybe Erik or his pa have heard something more but I doubt it... </string>
<string name="5878">Just take the north fork and the road will take you right to their front door. You&apos;ll know it by the corn fields and such.</string>
<string name="5879">Well, just that as kids, me and Erik used to tell each other the woods were haunted. Just children&apos;s stories, though. Little harm can come of them.</string>
<string name="5880">Do you have more questions?</string>
<string name="5881">Maybe Ingo, Erik&apos;s pa. Before his wife passed away, he used to have a tinkering wagon that traveled from hamlet to hamlet around the area.</string>
<string name="5882">Did Ma let you in here? This is a bedroom, not a bar table, I&apos;ll have you know.</string>
<string name="5883">Stop that! If you like me so much, then you&apos;re the last person he&apos;ll want to approach for help... I have a little something of his, that&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="5884">I might. What events are you referring to?</string>
<string name="5885">Where do you need to go?</string>
<string name="5886">(sigh) Make it quick.</string>
<string name="5887">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="5888">Yes, I suppose a village idiot might be lost without a village, wouldn&apos;t &lt;he/she&gt;?</string>
<string name="5889">Follow it long enough and you&apos;ll make it all the way to Port Llast. That&apos;s the route we take on market day.</string>
<string name="5890">Nowhere really. Just into Charwood and I haven&apos;t seen anyone head that way in years. It&apos;s funny how the road never seems to grow over, though.</string>
<string name="5891">Around here? Don&apos;t hold your breath. If we can&apos;t grow it or make it ourselves, we have to trek all the way into Port Llast to find it.</string>
<string name="5892">Is there something else?</string>
<string name="5893">I&apos;m Constance O&apos;Deel, the prettiest girl for miles around... Also the *only* girl for miles around, but that&apos;s another story. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="5894">The boy&apos;s been spreading tales again, has he? No doubt he told you I was a horrible old crone, too! Well I&apos;ll tell you what I told him:</string>
<string name="5895">If you&apos;re going to give a beautiful woman a gift, it&apos;s hardly becoming to ask for it back, wouldn&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="5896">Look, are we going to go over this again? I already told you this before, but I guess I have to repeat myself.</string>
<string name="5897">What is this, a joke? I already gave it to you, don&apos;t you remember? </string>
<string name="5898">Now, if there&apos;s something else I can do for you... </string>
<string name="5899">It&apos;s a little late for that, I&apos;m afraid, as I&apos;ve long since given it away. Honestly, you didn&apos;t really expect me to wear the gaudy thing, did you?</string>
<string name="5900">Is there something else I can help you with, maybe?</string>
<string name="5901">Really? Okay. You may have it for... 1,000 gold!</string>
<string name="5902">Whoa, where did that come from? Erik may want his brooch back but I know for a fact that he wouldn&apos;t have sent someone to kill me!</string>
<string name="5903">Look, if this stupid brooch means that much to you maybe we could work out a deal. 1,000 gold and it&apos;s yours, all right?</string>
<string name="5904">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *Sigh* Bargaining with Erik would have been a lot simpler, I&apos;ll have you know. Fine, then: 250... </string>
<string name="5905">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Okay, maybe I couldn&apos;t get 1,000 for it but I sure could get 400!</string>
<string name="5906">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Well you&apos;re the one who seems to want it so much! 1,000 gold seems like a fair enough price for memories of one&apos;s mother.</string>
<string name="5907">Give me a second, I have the brooch right here in my pocket... </string>
<string name="5908">1,000 gold? We... We could buy another half herd with this! Thank you so much, you can&apos;t know how much this means to my family!</string>
<string name="5909">Hey, hey, hey! Let&apos;s settle down. I&apos;m sure Erik didn&apos;t send you to kill me! Look, I&apos;ll go as low as 250 then but no more threats from you... </string>
<string name="5910">Fine, but you&apos;ll have to catch me, first!</string>
<string name="5911">All the love in the world won&apos;t buy a head of cattle... but you sure are a sweet talker.</string>
<string name="5912">Well, then I guess you&apos;re out of luck. 1,000 gold seems a perfectly reasonable price for memories of one&apos;s mother, wouldn&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="5913">Hey, if you don&apos;t have 250 on you, what use are you? One way or another, my family needs that money.</string>
<string name="5914">Well if you don&apos;t even have 400 gold to spare, what good are you? Haggle all you want, but that&apos;s as low as I&apos;ll go.</string>
<string name="5915">Here it is and I hope that fool Erik has learned not to give his heart so freely. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="5916">What the -? Where is it? It&apos;s gone! Somebody must have picked my pocket! I&apos;ve been robbed!!!</string>
<string name="5917">You! You were involved in this, weren&apos;t you? Erik sent you to distract me so someone else could pick my pocket! I&apos;m not stupid, you know!</string>
<string name="5918">Well my family and I aren&apos;t going to come out on the short end of this mess! I&apos;m keeping your money!</string>
<string name="5919">Hmph. I&apos;m glad we could reach an understanding. I guess we can consider this matter settled, then. Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="5920">How dare you threaten me after all this! You&apos;re a cruel and evil &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="5921">Fair? Don&apos;t talk to me about fair! I&apos;ve just been robbed and I *know* you were involved somehow! So I&apos;m keeping your money, end of story.</string>
<string name="5922">That may be so but it will also fetch a fine price in Port Llast. Enough to by a couple head of cattle to replace those killed by the wolves, of late... </string>
<string name="5923">Look, 250 gold would buy us a healthy bull, let us rebuild the herd. If you really love me, you&apos;ll give at least that, won&apos;t you?</string>
<string name="5924">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well he&apos;s a fool to do so. All the love in the world won&apos;t buy a head of cattle! *Sigh* But I know you&apos;re right... </string>
<string name="5925">Look, 250 gold would buy us a healthy bull, let us rebuild the herd. Give me that much and you may do what you wish with the brooch.</string>
<string name="5926">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; He loves me? He loves a good romp in the hay is all he loves and you&apos;ll not convince me otherwise!</string>
<string name="5927">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well he&apos;s a fool to do so. All the love in the world won&apos;t buy a head of cattle! *Sigh* But I know you&apos;re right... </string>
<string name="5928">Look, 400 gold buys us a couple of good jersey milkers to replace what we&apos;ve lost to the wolves. Give me that much and you can have the stupid brooch.</string>
<string name="5929">*Sigh* Bargaining with Erik would have been a lot simpler, I&apos;ll have you know. Fine, then: 250... </string>
<string name="5930">Back again, are you?</string>
<string name="5931">Look, my ma and his ma were best friends before she passed on! If she would have known we were struggling, she&apos;d have been happy to give it!</string>
<string name="5932">I know, I know. &quot;He&apos;s a nice boy.&quot; That&apos;s what me ma always says and I can&apos;t say I entirely disagree... </string>
<string name="5933">But if he was a really nice boy, he&apos;d spend more time helping out me pa and less time picking wildflowers, and that&apos;s all there is to it.</string>
<string name="5934">Me pa&apos;s a cattle rancher and a good one, too. Without a proper herd, though, we&apos;ve got nothing. There wouldn&apos;t even be food on the table... </string>
<string name="5935">Me pa&apos;s a cattle rancher and a good one, too. Without a proper herd, though, we&apos;ve got nothing. There wouldn&apos;t even be food on the table... </string>
<string name="5936">Me pa&apos;s a cattle rancher and a good one, too. Without a proper herd, though, we&apos;ve got nothing. There wouldn&apos;t even be food on the table... </string>
<string name="5937">Those stupid wolves have almost been the death of us, even if all they ever preyed on was the cattle!</string>
<string name="5938">Don&apos;t think I enjoyed doing this to poor Erik! I like him, honest. But sometimes things get desperate, all right? I need the 1,000 gold.</string>
<string name="5939">...Mooo... </string>
<string name="5940">Who are you?</string>
<string name="5941">I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="5942">Who you be?</string>
<string name="5943">Me want ask questions.</string>
<string name="5944">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="5945">What do you know of the cultists who beset Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="5946">I&apos;m looking for work, if you know of any.</string>
<string name="5947">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="5948">You know stuff &apos;bout da cult from Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="5949">Me look for job. You got one?</string>

<string name="5951">What other things are on your mind?</string>
<string name="5952">What be on you mind?</string>
<string name="5953">Where does the west road lead?</string>
<string name="5954">Where does the east road lead?</string>
<string name="5955">Where can I go to buy supplies?</string>
<string name="5956">Maybe I could ask you something else.</string>
<string name="5957">Where da west road go?</string>
<string name="5958">Where da east road go?</string>
<string name="5959">Me need buy stuff, yuh?</string>
<string name="5960">Me got other question.</string>
<string name="5961">Tell me about this favor.</string>
<string name="5962">You tell me &apos;bout favor, yuh?</string>
<string name="5963">What&apos;s so important about the brooch?</string>
<string name="5964">Can&apos;t you just buy the brooch from her?</string>
<string name="5965">Tell me about Constance.</string>
<string name="5966">Okay, I&apos;ll do it.</string>
<string name="5967">Why you want brooch so much?</string>
<string name="5968">Why you not just pay her for brooch?</string>
<string name="5969">Tell me &apos;bout Constance, yuh?</string>
<string name="5970">Okay, me do it.</string>
<string name="5971">I have some more questions about Constance.</string>
<string name="5972">Could give me an advance on this reward you&apos;re promising?</string>
<string name="5973">Me got some questions &apos;bout job.</string>
<string name="5974">Me want money up front to do this.</string>
<string name="5975">What&apos;s so important about this brooch again?</string>
<string name="5976">Tell me again where I can find her.</string>
<string name="5977">Tell me about Constance again.</string>
<string name="5978">Is there anything else about her you&apos;re not telling me?</string>
<string name="5979">Why you want dis brooch again?</string>
<string name="5980">You say again where Miss Constants be.</string>
<string name="5981">Tell me more &apos;bout Miss Constants, yuh?</string>
<string name="5982">There be more stuff &apos;bout dis job you not tell me?</string>
<string name="5983">I want to talk about that brooch again.</string>
<string name="5984">We talk &apos;bout dat brooch again, yuh?</string>
<string name="5985">You mentioned something about a job before.</string>
<string name="5986">You was talking &apos;bout job before.</string>
<string name="5987">I have the brooch.</string>
<string name="5988">Me got brooch here, yuh.</string>
<string name="5989">Now, about that reward you mentioned... </string>
<string name="5990">You said you give reward, yuh?</string>
<string name="5991">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; She wasn&apos;t easy to convince, you know. I think you could spare a little more.</string>
<string name="5992">You&apos;d better cough up more or you won&apos;t live long enough to regret it!</string>
<string name="5993">Thanks. It was a joy to help.</string>
<string name="5994">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me work hard for this. You give more gold, yes?</string>
<string name="5995">Me want more gold! Give more or you be sorry and dead... at da same time!</string>
<string name="5996">Thanks, yuh? Me like work for you.</string>
<string name="5997">I suppose the reward is adequate.</string>
<string name="5998">Me guess reward be okay.</string>
<string name="5999">Surely you could spare more for a fellow of &lt;race&gt; blood?</string>
<string name="6000">You give me more cause we both be &lt;race&gt; kind, &apos;kay?</string>
<string name="6001">That&apos;s a lot of money. Are you sure you can afford it?</string>
<string name="6002">That be big heap of money. How you afford it?</string>
<string name="6003">Wanev? Who&apos;s he?</string>
<string name="6004">Wanev? Who that?</string>
<string name="6005">What would your ma think about this?</string>
<string name="6006">Wha&apos; your ma think &apos;bout dis, you think... I think... </string>
<string name="6007">How do you know she doesn&apos;t want money?</string>
<string name="6008">How you know she not want money?</string>
<string name="6009">Maybe we can turn the tables: I&apos;ll flirt with her.</string>
<string name="6010">Maybe we turn da table, yuh? Me be da flirter.</string>
<string name="6011">Hey, who do you think you are barging into a man&apos;s room like that! The door was locked for a reason... </string>
<string name="6012">Ah, the charming lock-breaker. To what do I owe the pleasure of a return visit?</string>
<string name="6013">Back so soon, are you lock-breaker? I hope you&apos;re not here just to mock me and pull on heartstrings.</string>
<string name="6014">How goes the search? Have you recovered the brooch, or is there something else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="6015">*Sigh* Women... And that&apos;s all I have to say on the matter... </string>
<string name="6016">It&apos;s been good talking to you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. </string>
<string name="6017">I guess I&apos;ll see you around.</string>
<string name="6018">I&apos;m Erik, Ingo&apos;s son. Now, that&apos;s as polite as I&apos;m going to be until you tell me why you broke into my room?</string>
<string name="6019">We don&apos;t hear much out here. I saw a suspicious-looking fellow take the road to Charwood a week back or so, though. Maybe he was one.</string>
<string name="6020">I can&apos;t really tell you much else. I&apos;m sorry, but I&apos;ve got other things on my mind right now. Is there anything else you need?</string>
<string name="6021">I know much of the area around here, so I suppose I could help out. Where exactly do you need directions to?</string>
<string name="6022">The west road? That takes you by the tower of that wizard fellow, Wanev, and eventually on to Port Llast.</string>
<string name="6023">Anywhere else you need to get to?</string>
<string name="6024">Into the woods, that one. Pa says it&apos;s haunted and he&apos;d know. Apparently there used to be a village named Charwood in there but I&apos;ve never seen it... </string>
<string name="6025">Ain&apos;t much between here and Port Llast, I&apos;m afraid. We only go in at harvest season. Me, pa, and the O&apos;Deel&apos;s are pretty much on our own. The O&apos;deels live just down the road.</string>
<string name="6026">I suppose I have the time for a few questions. Try to make it quick, though.</string>
<string name="6027">No surprise there. I imagine someone like you gets lost a fair bit... </string>
<string name="6028">You? You can&apos;t be serious... </string>
<string name="6029">Hmph. I could sure use a favor right now and maybe you&apos;re a &lt;man/woman&gt; who can help. Interested in the details?</string>
<string name="6030">Your words are a little muddled, but I think I understood you. You want the details, right?</string>
<string name="6031">My pa might have told that I&apos;ve been feeling a little down, lately. Well he doesn&apos;t even know the half of it. Sure, I&apos;m a little heartbroken but... </string>
<string name="6032">It&apos;s all me pa has left to remind him of my ma... Of all the things to show Constance! *Sigh* I ought to have stuck with wildflowers... </string>
<string name="6033">She wanted to see me ma&apos;s brooch, so I brought it over for her. Now the witch won&apos;t give it back!</string>
<string name="6034">So do you think you could get the brooch? I&apos;ll reward whoever brings it to me as well as I can, I promise.</string>
<string name="6035">You don&apos;t know Constance. I don&apos;t know if anyone does. It&apos;s not money she&apos;s after. She just wants to see me beg. Well I won&apos;t do it!</string>
<string name="6036">See, she has to learn that people&apos;s hearts aren&apos;t just toys to be played with... Please? I&apos;ll reward you for the brooch, I promise.</string>
<string name="6037">Her hair&apos;s the color of cornsilk, her laugh&apos;s like the waterfall, her eyes are as blue as the sky... Her heart, though, it&apos;s sprung like a bear trap!</string>
<string name="6038">And thanks to a fool like me, she now has me ma&apos;s brooch!!! I&apos;ll reward whoever brings it back to me, I swear.</string>
<string name="6039">Will you? She&apos;s farmer O&apos;Deel&apos;s daughter, the one who keeps cattle up by the waterfalls... </string>
<string name="6040">Do whatever it takes to get me ma&apos;s brooch back, short of laying a finger on her... *Sigh* Look at me, I still worry for her, even now... </string>
<string name="6041">Return to me with the brooch and you shall have your reward.</string>
<string name="6042">Don&apos;t worry, you&apos;ll get your reward when I get the brooch. You be good on your word, I&apos;ll be good on mine.</string>
<string name="6043">So do I, so do I. But go ahead, ask what you will. I&apos;ll do my best to answer.</string>
<string name="6044">It&apos;s all me pa has left to remind him of me ma... Of all the things to show Constance! *Sigh* I should have stuck with wildflowers... </string>
<string name="6045">Anything else before you get that brooch?</string>
<string name="6046">She&apos;s farmer O&apos;Deel&apos;s daughter, the one who keeps cattle up by the waterfalls... Remember, don&apos;t hurt her. I just need that brooch back. </string>
<string name="6047">Her hair&apos;s the color of cornsilk, her laugh like the waterfall... And her eyes, they&apos;re as blue as the sky!</string>
<string name="6048">Well, I don&apos;t know that it matters but her pa&apos;s been having trouble with wolves, lately. Maybe you can get on his good side if you take care of that.</string>
<string name="6049">I already gave you a job, remember? Get me ma&apos;s brooch back from Constance, remember? Sorry, but that&apos;s the only job I had to give.</string>
<string name="6050">Is there anything else you need?</string>
<string name="6051">I don&apos;t believe it! I misjudged you. I thought you were nothing but a slack-jawed city-fool!</string>
<string name="6052">How did you ever manage to convince her!? Actually, nevermind... I probably don&apos;t want to know.</string>
<string name="6053">Yes, of course. The reward. Here you go: 500 gold pieces in exchange for me ma&apos;s old brooch.</string>
<string name="6054">I must admit, I didn&apos;t really like you when we first met but you&apos;ve proven to be a fine friend. Here you go, 400 gold pieces. </string>
<string name="6055">You&apos;ve been a good friend to a poor soul down on his luck. Here you go, 650 gold pieces in exchange for the brooch.</string>
<string name="6056">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose you did earn a little something extra. Very well, here&apos;s another 100 gold.</string>
<string name="6057">But now I must take my leave. Me pa was getting worried I&apos;d never run those errands for him... </string>
<string name="6058">N-now just settle down, there&apos;s no need to get upset. No need for unpleasantness. Here, I&apos;ve got another 100 gold, but that&apos;s it. Just take it, it&apos;s yours.</string>
<string name="6059">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Well I&apos;d rather not think about what lengths she made you go to, all right? I think I&apos;ve been more than fair with my reward.</string>
<string name="6060">I suppose it would be cruel of me not to show more gratitude to kin like you. Very well, here&apos;s another 100 gold for your troubles.</string>
<string name="6061">It&apos;s money I&apos;ve made off my own plot of land. I was saving it to marry Constance someday but that would be a foolish venture, I&apos;m afraid.</string>
<string name="6062">Still needing more directions?</string>
<string name="6063">Aw, he&apos;s all full of hot air. I&apos;ve seen him at the inn in Port Llast, trying to chat up the women.</string>
<string name="6064">I&apos;ll bet he&apos;s never done an honest day of hard work in his life.</string>
<string name="6065">It&apos;s that tease, Constance O&apos;Deel - she knows she has me wrapped around her little finger, so all she does is toy with me. Oh, I&apos;m such a fool... </string>
<string name="6066">Forget my stupid heart, if I don&apos;t get that brooch back, pa will have my hide instead!</string>
<string name="6067">If she were still alive, she probably would have given the brooch to Constance long ago. But ma&apos;s not still alive, see? That&apos;s the problem... </string>
<string name="6068">I feel like I don&apos;t know anything anymore. Go ahead, try to buy it from her, maybe it will work. *Sigh* Women are way too complicated... </string>
<string name="6069">*Sigh* She&apos;d be all over someone like you... Oh, very well. You&apos;re sure you&apos;re just trying to get the brooch back, right?</string>
<string name="6070">Hey, if it gets me the brooch and maybe teaches her a lesson or two, who am I to argue. You&apos;re sure this is just to get the brooch, though, right?</string>
<string name="6071">Uh... I really don&apos;t think you&apos;re her type. Look, all I want is that brooch, let&apos;s not get carried away.</string>
<string name="6072">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="6073">Uh... Me ask questions?</string>
<string name="6074">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6075">That cult preying on Neverwinter - know anything about it?</string>
<string name="6076">Actually I&apos;m more interested in local affairs... </string>
<string name="6077">How long have you farmed here?</string>
<string name="6078">Anything interesting about these parts?</string>
<string name="6079">Yuh, da cult. What you know of it?</string>
<string name="6080">Uh, what &apos;bout stuff in this area?</string>
<string name="6081">How long you farm &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="6082">Uh, there be any odd stories &apos;bout this place?</string>
<string name="6083">Did anything else stand out about him?</string>
<string name="6084">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Why do you say &quot;as good as gone?&quot;</string>
<string name="6085">Any other stuff about strange guy?</string>
<string name="6086">Tell me one of your father-in-law&apos;s stories.</string>
<string name="6087">Actually, I&apos;m more interested in a job, if you know of anything.</string>
<string name="6088">Are there any places you think I should visit?</string>
<string name="6089">Yuh, tell me story den... </string>
<string name="6090">Me want work.</string>
<string name="6091">There be other places to go &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="6092">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="6093">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="6094">I&apos;m curious about some recent events... </string>
<string name="6095">There be stuff happening lately, yuh?</string>
<string name="6096">I have some other questions.</string>
<string name="6097">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="6098">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="6099">Uh, me lost. You give directions, yuh?</string>
<string name="6100">Where does the west road lead?</string>
<string name="6101">Where does the east road lead?</string>
<string name="6102">Is there a place where I might rest nearby?</string>
<string name="6103">Where that west road go?</string>
<string name="6104">Where that east road go?</string>
<string name="6105">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="6106">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="6107">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="6108">I need some more directions.</string>
<string name="6109">Me need more directions.</string>
<string name="6110">A story, is it? I&apos;d love to hear it... </string>
<string name="6111">Yuh, tell me story, then.</string>
<string name="6112">Could you answer some other questions for me?</string>
<string name="6113">Me have other questions... You answer, yuh?</string>
<string name="6114">How come?</string>
<string name="6115">Yuh?</string>
<string name="6116">Who is Pete O&apos;Deel?</string>
<string name="6117">Who Pete O&apos;Deel?</string>
<string name="6118">Trouble with wolves?</string>
<string name="6119">Wolf trouble?</string>
<string name="6120">Who are the O&apos;Deels?</string>
<string name="6121">Who them O&apos;Deels?</string>
<string name="6122">What are your thoughts on the O&apos;Deel lass?</string>
<string name="6123">What you think &apos;bout that &apos;Deel girlie?</string>
<string name="6124">A good &lt;quarterday&gt; for field work, wouldn&apos;t you say, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="6125">Safe journeys, then. I&apos;ll be here in the fields if you ever feel like stopping by to chat.</string>
<string name="6126">Yes, and mind the cornstalks on the way out.</string>
<string name="6127">Aye, get out and stay out as far as I&apos;m concerned.</string>
<string name="6128">I see. A little on the slow side, are we?</string>
<string name="6129">I suppose you could. What is it you want to know, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="6130">I suppose I can answer a few questions for you... </string>
<string name="6131">Hmph. I&apos;ll answer a question or two... provided you don&apos;t take too long.</string>
<string name="6132">Hrmm... A week ago or so, my son said he met a seedy looking fellow heading into the Charwood. My son said hello and the man said some rude things. He&apos;s as good as gone, then, I suppose...</string>
<string name="6133">Other than Pete O&apos;Deel&apos;s trouble with the wolves, it&apos;s been pretty quiet around these parts. Grass grows, wind blows, nothing much of consequence...</string>
<string name="6134">Since I was a young man, I suppose. The farm came with the wife, bless her soul. Her parents homesteaded the place, but that&apos;s a story in itself... </string>
<string name="6135">Oh, my father-in-law told me a few old tales from when he first cleared the land to settle here.</string>
<string name="6136">See where the field stops and the woods begin? My father-in-law said to... never... Oh, now of all the stories, what possessed me to tell this one?</string>
<string name="6137">Well, other than cheering up my boy Erik, I&apos;m not sure what you could do. Seems that O&apos;Deel lass has broken his heart just like I said.</string>
<string name="6138">Maybe wander by Pete O&apos;Deel&apos;s up on the south bluff, there. They&apos;re friendly enough folk and wouldn&apos;t mind hearing the latest news from town. Their girl, Constance, she&apos;s a nice lass.</string>
<string name="6139">Well I suppose that&apos;s about as direct as one can get.</string>
<string name="6140">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="6141">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well if you start a story, you&apos;d better finish it, they say... The trees beyond that line, that&apos;s Charwood territory and no place for the living... </string>
<string name="6142">You can cut down a hundred of those trees but, when you wake up the next morning, they&apos;ll all be standing again like they&apos;d never known the blade.</string>
<string name="6143">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; It might and it mightn&apos;t. Just don&apos;t go into the Charwood if you treasure your sanity, all right?</string>
<string name="6144">Other than the fact that no one travels to Charwood, no. That forest is haunted so people who know generally steer clear.</string>
<string name="6145">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="6146">It&apos;s nothing but devil&apos;s business in there, mark my word, &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="6147">You&apos;ve still got more questions, don&apos;t you... I can tell.</string>
<string name="6148">Out for a jaunt, are you, &lt;mister/missus&gt;?</string>
<string name="6149">Mind you don&apos;t trample the corn, now.</string>
<string name="6150">Aye, that seems a reasonable enough thing to ask after.</string>
<string name="6151">Where are you trying to get to?</string>
<string name="6152">Very well but mind that I&apos;ve still got work that needs doing... </string>
<string name="6153">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="6154">Yes, I suppose someone like you must get lost out here fairly easy, wouldn&apos;t you... </string>
<string name="6155">That way? Take it long enough and you&apos;ll make it all the way to Port Llast. Most of the ruts along the way are mine, at least come harvest.</string>
<string name="6156">Well, now, that heads into the Charwood. Take my advice, though, you&apos;re better off thinking of my farm as the end of the road.</string>
<string name="6157">Well now, I&apos;d offer you my place but my son&apos;s grown to the point where there&apos;s not the same room that there used to be.</string>
<string name="6158">Sure. Where do you need to go?</string>
<string name="6159">Something about those woods don&apos;t take well to change. Word is there&apos;s a village of lost souls in there somewhere and people who go there never leave... </string>
<string name="6160">My father-in-law warned me never to go in there and I&apos;ve told my boy the same. You&apos;d be wise to do likewise... Now is there anything else?</string>
<string name="6161">He&apos;s locked himself in his room, &quot;to think&quot;, he says,and I&apos;m getting a little tired of doing his chores in the meantime.</string>
<string name="6162">Wade across the stream, though, and there&apos;s an old tree hollow where I camped a night or two in my younger days. It gives good shelter from the wind.</string>
<string name="6163">Now that my boy&apos;s cheered up a little and finally off to market, things are pretty good around here.</string>
<string name="6164">Pete is the farmer across the way. Mary and my wife were best friends from birth &apos;til the day she passed away. I&apos;ve known the O&apos;Deels since we first started courting. They&apos;re good folk. Pete&apos;s farm&apos;s been beset by wolves, lately.</string>
<string name="6165">Just down the road, Pete O&apos;Deel has a farm with a few head of cattle. A pack of wolves has been killing his cattle almost daily. </string>
<string name="6166">What else can I help you with?</string>
<string name="6167">Now what else be troubling you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="6168">The farmers down the road, Mary and Peter. Mary and my wife were best friends from birth &apos;til the day she passed away. I&apos;ve known the O&apos;Deels since we first started courting. They&apos;re good folk.</string>
<string name="6169">Well... You see Mary always had my wife growing up. All Constance has had is Erik. It&apos;s different, is all. She could use a woman-friend.</string>
<string name="6170">Still more questions, is it?</string>
<string name="6171">Still more questions, is it?</string>
<string name="6172">Could I ask you some questions?</string>
<string name="6173">Uh... Me ask questions?</string>
<string name="6174">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6175">Yes, the wolves. What can you tell me about them?</string>
<string name="6176">Actually I&apos;m hunting down a cult... </string>
<string name="6177">How many of you live here?</string>
<string name="6178">Anything interesting going on in these parts?</string>
<string name="6179">Yuh, da wolves. What you know of them?</string>
<string name="6180">Uh, me be huntin&apos; down a cult... </string>
<string name="6181">This be small house. How many live here?</string>
<string name="6182">You know odd things about here?</string>
<string name="6183">Maybe I can help. Know anything else about it?</string>
<string name="6184">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Cattle cost money. How bad are the finances?</string>
<string name="6185">Maybe me help, yuh? You talk more &apos;bout it.</string>
<string name="6186">Tell me about the wolves, then.</string>
<string name="6187">I&apos;d be interested in work, if you know of anything.</string>
<string name="6188">Are there any other places you think I should stop by, here?</string>
<string name="6189">Yuh, tell me story &apos;bout Peter and da Wolf!</string>
<string name="6190">Me want work.</string>
<string name="6191">There be other places to go here?</string>
<string name="6192">How is Constance?</string>
<string name="6193">How Constance be?</string>
<string name="6194">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, telling me won&apos;t do any harm.</string>
<string name="6195">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me. Will hurt nobody.</string>
<string name="6196">I&apos;m curious about some recent events... </string>
<string name="6197">There be stuff happening lately, yuh?</string>
<string name="6198">I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="6199">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="6200">Can I ask you some directions?</string>
<string name="6201">Uh, me lost. You give directions, yuh?</string>
<string name="6202">Where does the west road lead?</string>
<string name="6203">Where does the east road lead?</string>
<string name="6204">Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?</string>
<string name="6205">Where that west road go?</string>
<string name="6206">Where that east road go?</string>
<string name="6207">Me need place to buy stuff.</string>
<string name="6208">Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you about something else.</string>
<string name="6209">Me have other question.</string>
<string name="6210">I need some more directions.</string>
<string name="6211">Me need more directions.</string>
<string name="6212">Yes, I still have questions... </string>
<string name="6213">Yuh, me still got questions... </string>
<string name="6214">Why fancy having a good &lt;lord/lady&gt; like you in my own house!</string>
<string name="6215">Safe journeys, then. Perhaps we&apos;ll speak again.</string>
<string name="6216">Yes, yes. My &lt;quarterday&gt; chores are beckoning.</string>
<string name="6217">Out and good riddance, then.</string>
<string name="6218">I see. A little on the slow side, are we?</string>
<string name="6219">I&apos;d be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="6220">I suppose I can answer a question for you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Go right on ahead.</string>
<string name="6221">I&apos;ll answer a question or two... provided you don&apos;t take too long.</string>
<string name="6222">They moved in a few weeks ago and have been a terror ever since. My husband, Pete, he&apos;s too busy fretting about the cattle to sleep!</string>
<string name="6223">A cult? Goodness me, what would you expect an old farmwife to know of that? We&apos;re good hard-working folk out here. No foolish cult would get far with us!</string>
<string name="6224">Oh it&apos;s a small house sure enough, but it&apos;s home. Pete built it before we married and our darling Constance grew up in it and is with us still.</string>
<string name="6225">Other than Peter and the wolves, there&apos;s not much to say, really. What might you have in mind?</string>
<string name="6226">Do you have a speech impediment? Oh, nevermind.</string>
<string name="6227">Not wise enough to be a woman yet... but she&apos;ll get there. She means well enough. I was a young spitfire in my day too, you know... </string>
<string name="6228">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="6229">Pete says the big one, the she-wolf... her name is Silverback. He says he knows this &apos;cause... Oh I shouldn&apos;t say, you&apos;ll think him daft!</string>
<string name="6230">A helpful hand is aways appreciated around here. You should talk to Pete. No doubt he&apos;s out there protecting the herd.</string>
<string name="6231">Maybe by Ingo&apos;s place. His wife and I were so close before her passing. Something of him died with her, though. He&apos;s lost his spark.</string>
<string name="6232">Well I suppose that&apos;s about as direct as one can get.</string>
<string name="6233">Is there something else you wanted to know?</string>
<string name="6234">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well he says he&apos;s heard her talking on the wind, telling stories to her cubs. A wolf who speaks Common... </string>
<string name="6235">Pete&apos;s always had an imagination! If you ask me, he&apos;s just so caught up in protecting the herd that he&apos;s made the she-wolf into something more than she is. </string>
<string name="6236">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, Pete would tan my hide if I ever painted him a fool to a perfect stranger. He&apos;s a good man but not one to mock... </string>
<string name="6237">You&apos;d best talk to my husband Pete. He&apos;s probably out watching the herd as we speak.</string>
<string name="6238">Is there something else you need, then?</string>
<string name="6239">Pretty bad. For the most part we&apos;re self-sufficient out here but there are some things that can only be had in town... </string>
<string name="6240">We still have enough of a herd to scrape by but imagine if the wolves had taken them all! We&apos;d be left with nothing!</string>
<string name="6241">Do you have more questions?</string>
<string name="6242">Yes? What brings you here?</string>
<string name="6243">If I would&apos;ve known to expect you, I would have locked the door!</string>
<string name="6244">You&apos;re not here regarding Pete and the wolves, are you?</string>
<string name="6245">Where do you need to go?</string>
<string name="6246">Very well but don&apos;t keep me too long from my &lt;quarterday&gt; chores.</string>
<string name="6247">What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="6248">Yes, I suppose someone like you must get lost out here fairly easy, wouldn&apos;t you... </string>
<string name="6249">West? That&apos;s the road we take to Port Llast on market days. It&apos;s a long trip, though, and we usually spend the night with Pete&apos;s cousins in town.</string>
<string name="6250">Ooh, the east road leads past Ingo&apos;s fields and into the Charwood. Just ask Ingo, it&apos;s not a place meant for the living to tread... </string>
<string name="6251">We&apos;re all farmers here, not merchants or tradesfolk. Nearest shop&apos;s probably all the way back to Port Llast.</string>

<string name="6274">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe if I you gave a bit of an advance... </string>
<string name="6275">What kind of threat do these wolves pose?</string>
<string name="6276">Sure, that sounds like something I could do.</string>

<string name="6278">Uh, how me find dese wolfies?</string>

<string name="6280">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Maybe you give me gold first, yuh?</string>
<string name="6281">There be other dangers?</string>
<string name="6282">Yuh, me do it.</string>
<string name="6283">Uh, me rather not do that... </string>
<string name="6284">What was it that you had wanted me to do?</string>
<string name="6285">Actually, I have Silverback&apos;s head right here.</string>
<string name="6286">I&apos;ve changed my mind. I&apos;ll look into your troubles.</string>
<string name="6287">Sorry, it still doesn&apos;t sound like my game. </string>
<string name="6288">Uh, what you want again?</string>

<string name="6293">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think I&apos;ve earned a higher reward than that.</string>
<string name="6294">More money, fool, or I&apos;ll have your head, too! </string>
<string name="6295">Yuh, that be all right.</string>
<string name="6296">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me have hard time. You give more money, yuh?</string>
<string name="6297">You give more gold or me start taking more heads!</string>
<string name="6298">No reward necessary. The joy of the hunt was reward enough.</string>
<string name="6299">Me no need money. Me have enough fun chasing wolfies.</string>
<string name="6300">Where do I find these wolves again?</string>
<string name="6301">I&apos;ll be back after I find the wolf.</string>
<string name="6302">No. It still seems like too much trouble.</string>
<string name="6303">Where me find these wolfies?</string>
<string name="6304">Me find you big bad wolf soon, yuh?</string>
<string name="6305">No. That trouble be too much... trouble.</string>
<string name="6306">Mind if I ask you a few more questions?</string>
<string name="6307">Me ask questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="6308">I&apos;d like to ask you a few questions.</string>
<string name="6309">Me ask you questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="6310">Well I didn&apos;t kill Silverback but I did speak with her... </string>
<string name="6311">Well... Me no kill wolfie but me speak with her, yuh?</string>
<string name="6312">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; She gave me her word. She&apos;ll stick to it.</string>

<string name="6318">Regardless, I have a few questions.</string>
<string name="6319">Okay, but me still have questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="6320">More money, fool, or I&apos;ll take your head instead of the wolf&apos;s!</string>
<string name="6321">No reward necessary. That I helped both you and Silverback is enough for me.</string>
<string name="6322">You give more gold or me take your head instead!</string>
<string name="6323">Me no need money. Me just glad you an&apos; Silverback be friends now.</string>
<string name="6324">I have some questions about your troubles.</string>
<string name="6325">Me have questions &apos;bout the troubles you having.</string>
<string name="6326">All right, that&apos;s enough information to make a decision on.</string>
<string name="6327">You talk enough, yuh? Me decide now.</string>
<string name="6328">How many cattle do you have?</string>
<string name="6329">Uh, how many moo-cows you got?</string>
<string name="6330">What can an old farmer do for you, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="6331">Aye? Something amiss, traveler?</string>
<string name="6332">I don&apos;t need any trouble from you, wanderer. This farm gives me enough grief as it is, thank you very much.</string>
<string name="6333">Me? I&apos;m Farmer O&apos;Deel but you can just call me Pete, if you like. An&apos; who might you be?</string>
<string name="6334">Sorry, I have to keep an eye on my cattle. No time for distractions.</string>
<string name="6335">Stay safe, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="6336">Fare you well.</string>
<string name="6337">Yes, on your way, then.</string>
<string name="6338">No doubt you keep your name to yourself with good reason, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. But I&apos;ve been having some trouble around the farm as of late... Maybe you could help?</string>
<string name="6339">Very well. &lt;FirstName&gt; it is, then. I&apos;ve been having some trouble around the farm as of late... Think you&apos;d be fit to help out?</string>
<string name="6340">Well I&apos;ve been having some trouble around the farm as of late, &lt;FullName&gt;... Do you think you might be able to help me out?</string>
<string name="6341">As you wish. I&apos;ve been having some trouble around the farm as of late, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;... Think you&apos;d be of a mind to help me out?</string>
<string name="6342">There are some dire wolves in the hills there that have taken to preying on my herd. The pack&apos;s led by a big she-wolf I&apos;ve taken to calling Silverback... </string>
<string name="6343">I swear I&apos;ll pay 300 gold to have her head. She&apos;s already taken down two of my cattle and, left to her own devices, she&apos;ll clear the whole herd.</string>
<string name="6344">They den in a cave just past the waterfalls where my cattle like to drink. There are always a couple of them pacing in front.</string>
<string name="6345">Perhaps so but I&apos;m not a wealthy man. There&apos;s not much money in cattle these days, and less when you&apos;re losing your herd to wolves... </string>
<string name="6346">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &apos;Fraid not... Until those wolves are dead, I have to save every copper. The herd&apos;s going to be expensive to rebuild.</string>
<string name="6347">Well I&apos;ll warn you now, they aren&apos;t your everyday timber wolves. Dire wolves are a lot tougher and a lot more cunning. Smarter than old Ingo&apos;s boy at any rate... </string>
<string name="6348">That be true? Well I won&apos;t hold my breath &apos;til I see you returning with ol&apos; Silverback&apos;s head but the help&apos;s appreciated. Until then, need anything else?</string>
<string name="6349">I reckoned as much. If you&apos;ll excuse me, then, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;, I&apos;ve got a herd to watch over.</string>
<string name="6350">Hello again, &lt;mister/missus&gt;. Have you changed your mind about them wolves?</string>
<string name="6351">Then I guess we have little to talk about. Excuse me, &lt;mister/missus&gt;, I have a herd to tend.</string>
<string name="6352">By the gods, &lt;man/woman&gt;, so you do! Bravo! I imagine that could not have been a simple task!</string>
<string name="6353">Allow me to take the bloody thing off your hands. Now, then... I assume the 300 gold we discussed will be sufficient, yes?</string>
<string name="6354">Thanks for the help, then. With the she-wolf gone, the rest of the pack should be easy enough to scatter. It&apos;s been appreciated.</string>
<string name="6355">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; True, maybe the pelts aren&apos;t worth as much as I led you to believe. Here, 375 gold is all I have. The herd&apos;ll recover in a few years.</string>
<string name="6356">Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;ve got to make a trip to Port Llast to restock the herd. Thank you again, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;.</string>
<string name="6357">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The wolf pelts may be heavy but they&apos;ll be worth gold enough when you make it back to town. 300 gold was what we agreed on at the start.</string>
<string name="6358">Would you toss away a man&apos;s life so easily? Satisfy yourself with your loot, fiend, and the 300 gold I promised you... </string>
<string name="6359">Then you are more than kind, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. If only there were more such as you, a farm like this could maybe still turn a profit.</string>
<string name="6360">So you have returned, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;! Have you good news? Have you the head of the she-wolf, Silverback?</string>
<string name="6361">As you wish, &lt;mister/missus&gt;, though it&apos;s a shame you don&apos;t have the heart to help a simple dairy farmer.</string>
<string name="6362">That&apos;s good to hear. Return when you have the head and I&apos;ll give you your reward.</string>
<string name="6363">There&apos;s a cave entrance just beyond the topmost waterfall. That&apos;s where they den.</string>
<string name="6364">I really must be on my way to tell the missus. Please excuse me.</string>
<string name="6365">Now, is there anything else? Or are you going to bring me the head as you promised?</string>
<string name="6366">I&apos;m not really in the mood for questions. I&apos;ve still got to protect my cattle from the wolves.</string>
<string name="6367">I&apos;m sorry, but I don&apos;t have time for questions. Not while there are still wolves prowling about my herd, at any rate. Was there something else?</string>
<string name="6368">But those are some nice-looking wolves, if that&apos;s any consolation. At the very least, those pelts might be worth something if you brought &apos;em to town... </string>
<string name="6369">Did you say &apos;udder&apos; dangers? Ha, that&apos;s a good one! I hadn&apos;t pegged you as a &lt;man/woman&gt; of wit, but... Uh, you&apos;re not laughing, are you... *Sigh*... Nevermind.</string>
<string name="6370">You what!? Bah, who am I to argue. I&apos;ve been known to talk to my cows on occasion... Still, wolves are predators. What makes you think they&apos;ll stop?</string>
<string name="6371">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Very well, then. It may be against my better judgment but I suppose I trust you... I assume the 300 gold we discussed is sufficient?</string>
<string name="6372">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Well I don&apos;t trust her and I don&apos;t trust you, either, &lt;mister/missus&gt;!</string>
<string name="6373">Sure thing. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="6374">You&apos;ll help? You&apos;ll kill Silverback and her pack?</string>
<string name="6375">Less than I had a few weeks ago, admittedly. The herd&apos;s run into some bad trouble, lately.</string>
<string name="6376">Grovelling won&apos;t save your worthless hide! Die, dog!</string>
<string name="6377">You talk do you? Then answer my questions!</string>
<string name="6378">You beg like dog. Me kill you now.</string>
<string name="6379">Huh? You talk? Then you better answer questions, too!</string>
<string name="6380">Tell me about your hunting grounds.</string>
<string name="6381">Hmm. You tell me &apos;bout da places you hunt, yuh?</string>
<string name="6382">Who is this ranger?</string>
<string name="6383">Who be this ranger?</string>
<string name="6384">Whimpering dog! I&apos;ve decided to kill you after all.</string>
<string name="6385">Me kill you after all, stupid dog!</string>
<string name="6386">I&apos;ve got a few more questions.</string>
<string name="6387">Me got more questions</string>
<string name="6388">That I face you here should be proof that I&apos;m no coward... </string>
<string name="6389">Would coward have come here to face you? Me no coward.</string>
<string name="6390">Fine. I want to ask you something else.</string>
<string name="6391">Okay, me ask other stuff.</string>
<string name="6392">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Simply a favor, that&apos;s all I ask... </string>
<string name="6393">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Jus&apos; an itty-bitty favor, that all me ask... </string>
<string name="6394">Where did you learn to talk?</string>
<string name="6395">You&apos;ve been hunting the nearby cattle, haven&apos;t you... </string>
<string name="6396">How come you talk?</string>
<string name="6397">You been hunting da cattle &apos;round here, yuh?</string>
<string name="6398">I need you to stop hunting the cattle... and no people, either!</string>
<string name="6399">Stop hunting da cows, &apos;kay? And da people too... </string>
<string name="6400">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; It sounds like coward&apos;s food... </string>
<string name="6401">Yes but they&apos;re owned by farmers who will have you killed!</string>
<string name="6402">Yuh, but they owned by farmers who kill you!</string>
<string name="6403">Rrrrrrrrr... Who enters my den?</string>
<string name="6404">Rowf! I show my throat to you. Sink your teeth into it, it is yours... </string>
<string name="6405">Grrrrr! I am no tame and addled pet! I would rather die than face your foolish insults!</string>
<string name="6406">As you wish, manling... </string>
<string name="6407">Yelp! Rrr, you have bested me. What do you want?</string>
<string name="6408">We used to hunt in the east woods but there is something evil there. My mate preyed on a manling village but the meat was rancid on the bone.</string>
<string name="6409">Nobody. He is dead. He sent my mother to fight a demon just so he could run away. I killed him with my own teeth.</string>
<string name="6410">I will not follow you, manling, if that is what you have come to ask... </string>
<string name="6411">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Your courage has earned you that much. I will not follow you but you may ask something else of me... </string>
<string name="6412">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Grrrrr! I am no tame and addled pet! I would rather die than follow another manling!</string>
<string name="6413">There is more meat on them than a deer and they do not run as fast... Would you not hunt them?</string>
<string name="6414">My mother served a manling ranger. He taught me your foolish tongue when I was still a pup.</string>
<string name="6415">When he ate it, he said it took a piece of him away with it to an endless place. And then it took more and more until he died from the inside out.</string>
<string name="6416">That is why I&apos;ve led the pack out of the forest and to this new den... And now you come here and defile it! Grrrr... </string>
<string name="6417">It is bad enough to serve a manling. Rrrrrr, but it is worse to serve a coward... </string>
<string name="6418">Rrrrr... Their flesh is the best I&apos;ve tasted in many years but I will do as you ask. There are enough deer about for us to live on... </string>
<string name="6419">Grrrrrr... I am no coward. It is you manlings that show cowardice, wearing the skins of others, relying on more than fang and claw to fight... </string>
<string name="6420">Grrrr.... I&apos;ll make my hunting grounds where I wish! And as for manlings owning the animals, it reminds me of the ranger who taught me your foolish tongue!</string>
<string name="6421">Don&apos;t let him take me! I don&apos;t want to go to the party! Mommy!</string>
<string name="6422">Not my baby! Please! He&apos;s too young to be read to!</string>
<string name="6423">All the children must join us. It&apos;s midwinter&apos;s eve... </string>
<string name="6424">Have you come to take me to the party?</string>
<string name="6425">Who are you? You are not from Charwood?</string>
<string name="6426">Who you be? You not from Charwood?</string>
<string name="6427">Settle down. What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="6428">Ssh! What this you saying?</string>
<string name="6429">I don&apos;t have time for this. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6430">Me no got time. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6431">I seek a cult responsible for plague in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6432">Me hunt cult that bring plague to Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6433">Who are you?</string>
<string name="6434">Who you?</string>

<string name="6436">What you mean me not be here?</string>
<string name="6437">What are you looking for?</string>
<string name="6438">What you be lookin&apos; for?</string>
<string name="6439">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You can tell me. Maybe I can help.</string>
<string name="6440">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You tell me. Mebbe me help, yuh?</string>
<string name="6441">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Look, it&apos;s important that you tell me.</string>

<string name="6445">The cult? The one from Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="6446">Da cult? From Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="6447">What?! Who are you!? One of these vacuous automatons? You may as well be dead! All of you! Soon your endless story won&apos;t matter!</string>
<string name="6448">Oh no, I&apos;m not talking to more of you. I know what you are! I kill you, and then you&apos;re back! It never ends! </string>
<string name="6449">See, you tell your sorry tale to me, but then you&apos;ll forget it! Why!? YOU&apos;RE NOT HERE!!!</string>
<string name="6450">Time? This place is full of nothing BUT time! I killed them all! But they came back! I&apos;ll kill you too, a million times over if I must!!!</string>
<string name="6451">You - You seek a cult? Plague in Neverwinter?? That&apos;s recent news, that&apos;s news from the outside! I know about that! You know about that!</string>
<string name="6452">No, it can&apos;t be! It&apos;s a trick!! I know all about it but I&apos;m not telling you anything... It&apos;s mine! My secret!</string>
<string name="6453">What is it to you?! You&apos;re not here. No one is here! It&apos;s all a lie! How can I find what I&apos;m looking for if nothing is actually here? HOW?!</string>
<string name="6454">Why am I even talking to you!? You aren&apos;t here, they aren&apos;t here, and I&apos;m beginning to wonder about myself. What about me? Am I... here?</string>
<string name="6455">Away from me! Stay back!</string>
<string name="6456">It&apos;s very important that I find it. Very important! But it&apos;s a secret - I&apos;m not telling you! Go away!</string>
<string name="6457">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; What does it matter if I tell a ghost? You&apos;ll forget it before I&apos;m even halfway done telling it!</string>
<string name="6458">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; My secret! All mine!</string>
<string name="6459">Desther and the plague were just the start of things. The Cult of the Eye has bigger goals. I should know, they sent me here to look for something... </string>
<string name="6460">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; We follow the Great One, Maugrim, at the heart of Luskan. Even he is but a vessel for powers more ancient... </string>
<string name="6461">There, I&apos;ve told you. Now it&apos;s time I killed you, ghost. Again and again and again! It&apos;ll be good training for what is to come... </string>
<string name="6462">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You ask too many questions, ghost... I think, unlike the others, you might not return when I kill you.</string>
<string name="6463">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Help? Yes, use the old to find the ancient, the mad to find the maddening! </string>
<string name="6464">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; My secret! Mine!</string>
<string name="6465">The Cult of the Eye, they sent me here to find something, an ancient artifact of great importance! They sent me to this madhouse!</string>
<string name="6466">Desther and the plague were just the start of things. The Cult of the Eye has bigger goals. I should know, they sent me here to look for something... </string>
<string name="6467">Die, ghost! Again and again!</string>
<string name="6468">Gone! All gone! Like it was never there! And it wasn&apos;t! AHAHAHAH!!!</string>
<string name="6469">Gone! Where did it go!? They&apos;ll never believe me! They&apos;ll come from Luskan to see what killed us, and there is nothing!!! AHAHAHAHA!!!!!!</string>
<string name="6470">I don&apos;t think so.</string>
<string name="6471">Me no think so.</string>
<string name="6472">I spoke with you before.</string>
<string name="6473">Me speak to you before.</string>
<string name="6474">Maybe you spoke with someone else?</string>
<string name="6475">Maybe you see someone not me?</string>
<string name="6476">Farewell.</string>
<string name="6477">Byes.</string>
<string name="6478">What are you waiting for?</string>
<string name="6479">What you wait for?</string>
<string name="6480">What is wrong with this town? You&apos;re all strange.</string>
<string name="6481">This town not right. You all weird.</string>
<string name="6482">Who is Quint?</string>
<string name="6483">Who Quint?</string>
<string name="6484">What happened to all of you?</string>
<string name="6485">What happen here?</string>
<string name="6486">I have to go into the castle now.</string>
<string name="6487">Me gotta go in the castle nows.</string>
<string name="6488">I&apos;m leaving.</string>
<string name="6489">Me leaving.</string>
<string name="6490">Do I know you?</string>
<string name="6491">Oh. I can&apos;t tell anymore. My mind... it&apos;s just a blank these days... years?</string>
<string name="6492">I don&apos;t know anymore. You could be the tenth person I&apos;ve seen, you could be the first. I just don&apos;t know anymore.</string>
<string name="6493">Did you? I don&apos;t know anymore. Could have been you, could have been no one, could have been a hundred. I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="6494">I&apos;d leave if I were you. I&apos;d leave if I could.</string>
<string name="6495">I wait for something to happen, and even when it does, it never lasts. I wait, and I watch the castle. Nothing.</string>
<string name="6496">An end. I remember the beginning, but we never got the end, and I suppose we got what we deserved. Except for Quint.</string>
<string name="6497">Yes, we are, aren&apos;t we? We watched it all start, and when it didn&apos;t end, I suppose we got what we deserved. All but Quint.</string>
<string name="6498"> I can&apos;t fault him. He was the only one who fought, and he was the only one who didn&apos;t have reason to. Strange, hmm?</string>
<string name="6499">Oh, you&apos;ll find out in there. That&apos;s where it happened. I can&apos;t say. I know my mind is gone. I know there&apos;s nothing left... of any of us... </string>
<string name="6500">Yes, that&apos;s the only way. I&apos;d go, but it wouldn&apos;t matter. My mind is gone. I know there&apos;s nothing left of any of us.</string>
<string name="6501">As you will. I&apos;ll just keep waiting. Can&apos;t do much else. I know my mind is gone. I know there&apos;s nothing left... of any of us... </string>
<string name="6502">The castle is where it happened. That&apos;s where it was. Death came for everyone, and decided it would stay... </string>
<string name="6503">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="6504">Me want some informations.</string>
<string name="6505">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6506">What you mean?</string>
<string name="6507">I seek the cult that prolonged the Neverwinter plague.</string>
<string name="6508">What can you tell me about Charwood?</string>
<string name="6509">What trouble are you having?</string>
<string name="6510">Me looks for plague-pushing cult. They hurt Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6511">You tells me abouts Charwood.</string>
<string name="6512">What trouble you got?</string>
<string name="6513">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="6514">I was here before. Don&apos;t you remember?</string>
<string name="6515">Me here before now. You not remember?</string>
<string name="6516">Who are the important people in town?</string>
<string name="6517">Who important around here?</string>
<string name="6518">Something else about Charwood.</string>
<string name="6519">Me ask something else about town.</string>
<string name="6520">Why did he take your child?</string>
<string name="6521">Why he take?</string>
<string name="6522">Perhaps I can help?</string>
<string name="6523">Maybe me help?</string>
<string name="6524">Not my problem.</string>
<string name="6525">Me not care.</string>
<string name="6526">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="6527">What you mean?</string>
<string name="6528">That&apos;s enough. I don&apos;t care.</string>
<string name="6529">Whatever. Me not cares.</string>
<string name="6530">I have other questions.</string>
<string name="6531">Me ask other questions.</string>
<string name="6532">Who&apos;s Quint?</string>
<string name="6533">Who Quint be?</string>
<string name="6534">Who&apos;s Karlat?</string>
<string name="6535">Who Karlat be?</string>
<string name="6536">What happened here?</string>
<string name="6537">What happen here?</string>
<string name="6538">I still have some questions... </string>
<string name="6539">Me still have questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="6540">Where can I find this castle?</string>
<string name="6541">Where this castle be?</string>
<string name="6542">Where can I find the Mayor?</string>
<string name="6543">Where me find this Mayor guy?</string>
<string name="6544">Who are you? I can see you are reasonable, so please, leave us to our misery.</string>
<string name="6545">What reason have you for entering my home?</string>
<string name="6546">Who are you to enter this home? Some thug from away, most likely. Like we haven&apos;t suffered enough.</string>
<string name="6547">I have no desire to school you. Turn yourself around and get out. We have trouble enough, endless trouble.</string>
<string name="6548">You come to my home and bother me with your petty questions? Like I don&apos;t have trouble enough.</string>
<string name="6549">Never-what? There is nowhere by Charwood. We&apos;ve all forgotten. You won&apos;t find what you need in this town. We never did either, it seems... </string>
<string name="6550">As you will. There&apos;s little I can do to stop you... </string>
<string name="6551">It&apos;s a damned place. Anyone who strings you a story sayin&apos; it isn&apos;t is one o&apos; the people who damned it, Karlat Jhareg included.</string>
<string name="6552">This ain&apos;t the fate we bargained for, but it&apos;s our fault. We settled at the feet of demons, we did... just to be safe... safe forever... </string>
<string name="6553">Talk to the Mayor, he won&apos;t tell you. Talk to us, we won&apos;t tell you. None of us can say... none of us can finish it... it just goes on... </string>
<string name="6554">My child has been taken from me, and while no one else in town seems to care, it bothers me a great deal!</string>
<string name="6555">No doubt I&apos;ve seen you a million times by now, not that I&apos;d ever remember it. We&apos;ve got enough trouble without you.</string>
<string name="6556">Nobody here is important. Not the mayor, not me. Maybe Quint, but he&apos;s mad. Maybe you, but you don&apos;t understand. Maybe Karlat, who&apos;s to know?</string>
<string name="6557">There&apos;s nothing I can do. That Quint Jhareg has taken my son, and what can I say about it? Nothing! Not even the Mayor can say anything... </string>
<string name="6558">Nobody said it was a concern for you. You asked, and I told, but I didn&apos;t ask you to come here.</string>
<string name="6559">The Lords Jhareg do what they please, and damned if the rest of us aren&apos;t as much to blame for what happened in that castle! We&apos;re all to blame!</string>
<string name="6560">No, I won&apos;t say... I won&apos;t say... I won&apos;t let it be known... This can repeat to eternity... and I won&apos;t let it be known... </string>
<string name="6561">I won&apos;t let it be known... I won&apos;t let it... It can repeat forever, but I won&apos;t let it be known... </string>
<string name="6562">No one cares. That&apos;s the price we paid, I guess. No one cares, and it never ends... and I&apos;ll never let it be known... </string>
<string name="6563">Karlat Jhereg might know what you want, but he&apos;s beyond caring about you, me... anything. </string>
<string name="6564">Around and around. We have trouble enough without your tales and questions.</string>
<string name="6565">He&apos;s the one everyone&apos;s forgotten. He and Karlat were brothers and Lords of this place before we got... trapped here. He was a cleric of Lathander, once... </string>
<string name="6566">Karlat Jhareg? He was a wizard, and powerful too. We thought Charwood would be safe at the foot of his castle. Well we were fools, weren&apos;t we... </string>
<string name="6567">It&apos;s at the far end of town, beyond the gate. If you want to go there, go, but nothing but death awaits you there, endless death.</string>
<string name="6568">He&apos;s in the Town Hall in the heart of village... He&apos;s been in there for as long as anyone can remember, which isn&apos;t long at all... </string>
<string name="6569">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="6570">Me want some informations.</string>
<string name="6571">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6572">Charwood out in nowhere. Who keep it safe?</string>
<string name="6573">I seek the cult that prolonged the Neverwinter plague.</string>
<string name="6574">What can you tell me about Charwood?</string>
<string name="6575">Have you heard of any trouble around here?</string>
<string name="6576">Me looks for plague-pushing cult. They hurt Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6577">You tells me abouts Charwood.</string>
<string name="6578">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="6579">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="6580">Me ask different questions.</string>
<string name="6581">Charwood seems pretty isolated. Who protects you?</string>
<string name="6582">Do you have shops? Merchants?</string>
<string name="6583">You gots equipments?</string>
<string name="6584">But you saw me not long ago.</string>
<string name="6585">What you talking about? You just see me earlier.</string>
<string name="6586">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Just formed? Port Llast is years old.</string>
<string name="6587">Where are your guards? Perhaps they know?</string>
<string name="6588">You gots guards? Maybe they knows?</string>
<string name="6589">Who are the important people in town?</string>
<string name="6590">Who important around here?</string>
<string name="6591">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Are you afraid of the Lords Jhareg?</string>
<string name="6592">Who Quint?</string>
<string name="6593">Who is Quint?</string>
<string name="6594">Tell me more about Charwood.</string>
<string name="6595">Me ask something else about town.</string>
<string name="6596">Where can I find the Mayor?</string>
<string name="6597">Where me find Mayor-guy?</string>
<string name="6598">Where&apos;s this castle?</string>
<string name="6599">Where this castle be?</string>
<string name="6600">Who&apos;s Karlat?</string>
<string name="6601">Who this Karlat-guy?</string>
<string name="6602">What does the gate guard protect you from?</string>
<string name="6603">What da gate-guard-guy protect you from?</string>
<string name="6604">A well observed day to ye, friend. Charwood does not see many visitors of your refined appearance. Or at all, actually.</string>
<string name="6605">Hello there. I hope a good thought has brought you our way? Charwood has not seen a new face is a very long time.</string>
<string name="6606">What manner of roustabout are you? Charwood has not seen bandits for a long, long time. Or anyone, for that matter. </string>
<string name="6607">Well, I shall try to phrase my answers simply. Mind you, the Mayor is much better suited to explaining things and listening to peeple&apos;s stories... </string>
<string name="6608">I will answer, though I find your words very... I guess I find your speech very modern. The Mayor would probably help you better than I.</string>
<string name="6609">I don&apos;t know anything about that... Neverwinter, you say? Seems like only yesterday they were talking about that elf, Halueth Never founding the place.</string>
<string name="6610">Goodbye. Perhaps we&apos;ll talk another time... and another... </string>
<string name="6611">Oh, I&apos;m sure there is little that I could tell you. It&apos;s a simple place, really... It has too many stories as it is... </string>
<string name="6612">Just go talk to Mayor Mobley. He&apos;ll listen to your stories. You have so many... like Quint did... Things like that bring change... </string>
<string name="6613">Well, I guess you mean Castle Jhareg. Lords Karlat and Quint Jhareg founded this place, and made it safe for us to live under their will.</string>
<string name="6614">Please, you should tell your story to the Mayor. What goes on in Castle Jhareg is not to be spoken of. It might bring change, and nobody wants that.</string>
<string name="6615">We don&apos;t hear of anything. Outside news could bring change, and things must stay like this or everything ends. I... I can&apos;t talk about this. </string>
<string name="6616">Hmm? Oh, no. No commerce at all, really. Just the occasional barter for service. No one trades anything here but stories and even then... </string>
<string name="6617">I&apos;m sorry... you&apos;ll have to find somewhere else. There&apos;s a trading outpost that just formed not far from here... Port Llast, I believe?</string>
<string name="6618">I know my own mind. I haven&apos;t seen anyone new until I spoke with you right now. I&apos;m sure of it... I&apos;m sure... </string>
<string name="6619">Time moves slowly here... almost stops... He stopped it... stopped all the dying... But... But it was too late for the... for the children... </string>
<string name="6620">I&apos;m sorry... I lost my thoughts for a moment there. It&apos;s a pleasure to meet you.</string>
<string name="6621">I... No, that&apos;s not right... it&apos;s been... I don&apos;t know how long it&apos;s been. That&apos;s not right. Wait... there was something... </string>
<string name="6622">Stopped... frozen... It was a good story! Everything was going well until he brought it to an end... we all continue to live happily ever after... forever... </string>
<string name="6623">I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to go off like that. I&apos;m just confused. Anyway, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find what you need in Port Llast.</string>
<string name="6624">I&apos;m sorry, I haven&apos;t heard of any cult. We are kept isolated... Well, what I mean to say is that we prefer to keep to ourselves. </string>
<string name="6625">We have no need of guards... except the one at the castle gate, of course. The Lords Jhareg keep us safe... </string>
<string name="6626">Look, listening to people&apos;s stories is Mayor Mobley&apos;s job, now. He&apos;s got answers for every question... even the tricky ones that Quint likes to pose... </string>
<string name="6627">You don&apos;t understand. The telling of tales will lead only to trouble - Just ask Quint! Please, go talk to Mayor Mobley.</string>
<string name="6628">The Lords Jhareg are why we are here. But you should not speak of Jhareg business. It might bring change. It might end things.</string>
<string name="6629">You should be talking to Mayor Mobley. I can&apos;t say any more. People tell too many stories. People want too many things. Like that Quint.</string>
<string name="6630">Do not speak of him! He&apos;s mad! He will destroy everything, everything! And he&apos;ll trap you here like all of us... He... He will... </string>
<string name="6631">I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry, but I really don&apos;t remember what we were talking about. Isn&apos;t that strange? I really don&apos;t remember... </string>
<string name="6632">Why, he&apos;s in the town hall, like he... like he always is... Never leaving... never living... just this endless sleep... </string>
<string name="6633">Castle Jhareg? It&apos;s at the end of the road... the end of the story... the end of everything, really... We post a guard there now... For protection... </string>
<string name="6634">Lord Karlat! Oh, he&apos;s a powerful sorcerer, there with his brother Quint in the castle tower... I... I haven&apos;t seen him in years... </string>
<string name="6635">The guard? At the castle gate? I... I don&apos;t remember... He&apos;s new here... Mayor Mobley hired him... He protects us from... from change... </string>
<string name="6636">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="6637">Me want some informations.</string>
<string name="6638">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6639">I hunt a cult that prolonged the Neverwinter plague.</string>
<string name="6640">Tell me about your town.</string>
<string name="6641">Have you heard of any trouble around here?</string>
<string name="6642">Me looks for plague-cult. They hurt Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6643">You tells me abouts Charwood.</string>
<string name="6644">Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?</string>
<string name="6645">I want to go over some things you said before.</string>
<string name="6646">Me wants go over things you say before.</string>
<string name="6647">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Mayor, it&apos;s not morning. The darkness clings to this place.</string>
<string name="6648">That isn&apos;t right. Do you even know the season?</string>
<string name="6649">Mayor, if there is a threat, perhaps I can help?</string>
<string name="6650">Jhareg? Who&apos;s that?</string>
<string name="6651">What stories?</string>
<string name="6652">You sound nervous. Are your lords fair?</string>
<string name="6653">You scared. They be fair guys?</string>
<string name="6654">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come now, there&apos;s no harm in talking to me.</string>
<string name="6655">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You tell me. There no problem with me.</string>
<string name="6656">Speak! Or you&apos;ll have more immediate things to fear!!</string>
<string name="6657">Me get mad if you not keep talking!</string>
<string name="6658">You can tell me. Can&apos;t you, handsome?</string>
<string name="6659">You tell me, good looking. Me your friend.</string>
<string name="6660">I will discover what happened to your children.</string>
<string name="6661">Me find out what happen to kids.</string>
<string name="6662">Is the castle dangerous? I will likely check it out.</string>
<string name="6663">Me search castle probably. It safe?</string>
<string name="6664">Nothing to do with me. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6665">Nothing me care about. G&apos;bye.</string>
<string name="6666">I want to ask some different questions.</string>
<string name="6667">Me ask different stuff.</string>
<string name="6668">Why don&apos;t you remember anything?</string>
<string name="6669">Why you not remember stuff?</string>
<string name="6670">That not be right. You even know da season?</string>
<string name="6671">If there be threat, maybe me can help?</string>
<string name="6672">Jar-Egg? Who that be?</string>
<string name="6673">Uh, what stories?</string>
<string name="6674">Greetings, to you. I am Mobley, the mayor of Charwood. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="6675">Yes? I am Mayor Mobley. What can I help you with?</string>
<string name="6676">What does the like of you want? I am Mayor Mobley, and I daresay I have little patience for vagrants.</string>
<string name="6677">Of course, of course, I&apos;ve always time for the simpler folk. &apos;Tis a fine morn for chatting.</string>
<string name="6678">Always willing to answer questions about our fair town. It is a fine morn for a chat, too.</string>
<string name="6679">Oh, you won&apos;t find anything like that here. The Lords Jhareg keep us safe from changes like that. From everything.</string>
<string name="6680">Goodbye. Please, visit anytime. Charwood is a friendly place.</string>
<string name="6681">Well, on the whole it is a fine place. The Lords Jhareg keep us safe and we have very little to worry about. Very little... </string>
<string name="6682">There is never trouble here. The Lords Jhareg keep us safe, and that is all we need to know. That&apos;s all.</string>
<string name="6683">I&apos;m not sure I understand. I haven&apos;t laid eyes on anyone new until this very second. Have we met?</string>
<string name="6684">I mean, I&apos;m certian we haven&apos;t... I&apos;ve had no cause to hear stories for... ages... </string>
<string name="6685">I&apos;m sorry... Very unlike a statesman to go on like that. What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="6686">Oh, you are mistaken. It&apos;s a crisp fine morning that should ripen into a splendid midwinter&apos;s eve.</string>
<string name="6687">I... Look, there is nothing amiss here. Time just passes slowly in a small village. Just tell your tale and go.</string>
<string name="6688">There is no threat! I don&apos;t want you making trouble out of nothing! If you disturb the Lords Jhareg, everything will end!</string>
<string name="6689">Lord Karlat Jhareg and his brother... what was his name... they carved a castle out of the cliffside and formed this town around it.</string>
<string name="6690">We are protected, and that is all that matters. We have had to make certain sacrifices and listen to their stories... but we are protected... </string>
<string name="6691">That&apos;s not for me to say. Look, I really should&apos;nt talk about them. Do you have other questions?</string>
<string name="6692">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; I suppose, though I do not wish to make trouble. We have been safe from the stories for so long... </string>
<string name="6693">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I don&apos;t think that would be a good idea. Please, if you have no other questions, just leave us be.</string>
<string name="6694">I... have not heard... in so long... I suppose I could be enticed to speak... </string>
<string name="6695">I... don&apos;t think that I find your approach very... attractive, madam. Please, just ask your questions and leave.</string>
<string name="6696">I d-don&apos;t want trouble. I just... very well, but there is not that much to tell.</string>
<string name="6697">Quint! It was Quint who took the children... A party in the castle... He was going to read them stories but... that was a lie. </string>
<string name="6698">Something happened to them, the children, the castle. That Quint... he did it. He made it all go wrong. He&apos;s the one that ruined it all.</string>
<string name="6699">Look... I... I have nothing else to say. It&apos;s beyond me... If you don&apos;t mind... I really need to get back to... something... </string>
<string name="6700">Good. Leave. It is best left alone. Nothing must change. Nothing can change... I... I must get back to... something.</string>
<string name="6701">NO! I mean... please, leave us to our lot. This does not concern you. You can&apos;t bring change. Changes would end things.</string>
<string name="6702">Oh, perhaps I just have a carefree manner. The Lords Jhareg worry so we don&apos;t have to. Yes, that&apos;s it. That&apos;s what he said... </string>
<string name="6703">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6704">Don&apos;t you care about your child?</string>
<string name="6705">Your child is gone and there&apos;s nothing wrong?</string>
<string name="6706">Bravo, woman. I have little use for children myself.</string>
<string name="6707">You not care about your kid?</string>
<string name="6708">Your kid get took and nothing wrong?</string>
<string name="6709">Heh, me not care about kids either.</string>
<string name="6710">I&apos;ve spoken to you before. Do you remember?</string>
<string name="6711">But you seem me before, remember?</string>
<string name="6712">Does this happen often?</string>
<string name="6713">This happen lots?</string>
<string name="6714">But something took your child, and now he&apos;s back.</string>
<string name="6715">Somethings took your kid, but now he&apos;s back.</string>
<string name="6716">What trickery is this?!</string>
<string name="6717">Why you try fool me?</string>
<string name="6718">Good day to you, friend. I trust your strong features suggest a kind heart?</string>
<string name="6719">Yes? What can I do for you?</string>
<string name="6720">Please don&apos;t hurt me. Our village is so peaceful.</string>
<string name="6721">Goodbye. Perhaps we&apos;ll talk another time.</string>
<string name="6722">I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about, stranger. My child is right here. See for yourself. </string>
<string name="6723">Can&apos;t say that I do. Sorry. Not much happens around here, so I&apos;m sure I would notice, too.</string>
<string name="6724">Now, if you don&apos;t mind, I&apos;m rather busy doing... something... I&apos;m sure. Now what was it... </string>
<string name="6725">My baby... oh my baby is gone... please no... not again... </string>
<string name="6726">I&apos;m not sure what you mean. Everything is fine here. We are under the protection of the Lords Jhareg, and nothing ever happens... </string>
<string name="6727">Everything is just as it should be... though I do... seem to have trouble keeping the days straight. It doesn&apos;t matter... the deal was made... </string>
<string name="6728">See, some things happen because they must... it&apos;s like a story... but when will everything end... it&apos;s been so long... so long... </string>
<string name="6729">I want to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="6730">Me want some informations.</string>
<string name="6731">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6732">Charwood out in nowhere. Who keep it safe?</string>

<string name="6758">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; The Hall of Justice is a very old building.</string>
<string name="6759">Where can I find the Mayor?</string>
<string name="6760">Where me find Mister Mayor?</string>
<string name="6761">Do the Jharegs have a castle?</string>
<string name="6762">Them Jar-Eggs, they have castle?</string>
<string name="6763">What does the guard protect you from?</string>
<string name="6764">What da guard protect you from?</string>
<string name="6765">Well, should I bow? It&apos;s been so long since a regal presence like yours passed this way.</string>
<string name="6766">Greetings. I hope your visit to our fair village finds you well. We rarely see anyone new.</string>
<string name="6767">A shame our first visitor in so long has to be of your level. We&apos;ve no need of vagrants.</string>
<string name="6768">I&apos;ll answer if I can. Things move pretty slow here... slow as you seem.</string>
<string name="6769">I don&apos;t know if my answers will please. Your manner is so much more modern than our little village.</string>
<string name="6770">I haven&apos;t heard anything about that. Never been to Neverwinter. They still building that Hall of Justice? I imagine it will take awhile.</string>
<string name="6771">Goodbye. Perhaps we&apos;ll talk another time.</string>
<string name="6772">There isn&apos;t much to say. We&apos;re a small village. We&apos;ve a mayor and two Lords, the Jharegs... Very normal, all around.</string>
<string name="6773">You should... go tell your stories to Mayor Mobley... like Quint should have... Otherwise you&apos;ll bring change... </string>
<string name="6774">Oh, we are protected by the two Lords Jhareg: Karlat and... and I&apos;ve forgotten the other&apos;s name. They protects us. We are well protected... </string>
<string name="6775">Uh... sorry... please, you should speak with the Mayor. It&apos;s not my business to discuss this.</string>
<string name="6776">We don&apos;t listen to people&apos;s stories... We just stay here and let everyone else move on. You talk of change... change... </string>
<string name="6777">No. We don&apos;t want to attract attention, you see... well... what I mean is that we don&apos;t want to attract unsavory types... </string>
<string name="6778">We keep things just as they are... everything stays as it is... We have to keep things from changing, you know... </string>
<string name="6779">Perhaps you&apos;d be better served by camping along the Neverwinter trade route... there&apos;s a new outpost... Port Llast... ?</string>
<string name="6780">I&apos;m... not sure what you mean. I&apos;ve been here for ages and not seen a soul. It&apos;s like time just stands still... </string>
<string name="6781">Time... stands still... Nothing changes... nothing ends... </string>
<string name="6782">P-pardon me, I don&apos;t seem to be all that alert today. I&apos;m sorry. What story were you telling?</string>
<string name="6783">But that&apos;s not... no... you are mistaken... you... </string>
<string name="6784">Stopped... frozen... He did it. He brought it to an end with his stories... happily ever after... the end... </string>
<string name="6785">I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to go off like that. I&apos;m just confused. Anyway, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find what you need in Port Llast.</string>
<string name="6786">We have no need of guards... save the one at the castle gate. The brothers Jhareg founded Charwood. They keep us safe and... hold parties for the children... </string>
<string name="6787">You should go to Mayor Mobley. He&apos;ll tell the story... please let his story be enough... not like Quint&apos;s. He told too many... </string>
<string name="6788">Quint. Quint was his name. Always reading to the children! That leads to trouble. Please, I can&apos;t speak of this. Mayor Mobley will help you.</string>
<string name="6789">The brothers Jhareg are why we are here. You should not speak of Jhareg business. It might bring change. It might end things.</string>
<string name="6790">You should be talking to Mayor Mobley. I can&apos;t say any more. People talk too much, tell too many stories... Like that Quint.</string>
<string name="6791">Quint! He&apos;s mad! He read to them! He stopped us all! You leave him, and you leave us! You leave us... we... </string>
<string name="6792">I... I don&apos;t know quite what came over me... I&apos;m sorry. Please... I can&apos;t say any more about this... Is there something else?</string>
<string name="6793">Now don&apos;t go telling stories... You should go talk to the Mayor about such things. Mayor Mobley. I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll listen to your story.</string>
<string name="6794">No... no I was quite sure I heard they were just starting... Castle Never was being rebuilt, too, what with the orc wars and all... I think... </string>
<string name="6795">The hall&apos;s in the heart of the village... You can&apos;t miss it... We don&apos;t... </string>
<string name="6796">Yes, that&apos;s where... that&apos;s where Quint gives his readings... It&apos;s at the far end of town, beyond the gate... beyond everything... </string>
<string name="6797">From... From ourselves... From you... From Judgment... I don&apos;t know. What were we talking about?</string>
<string name="6798">What are you babbling about?</string>
<string name="6799">What you say, stupid?</string>
<string name="6800">Greetings. What is this place?</string>
<string name="6801">Uh, hi. What this place?</string>
<string name="6802">Move aside! I&apos;m in no mood for you!</string>
<string name="6803">Get out of way, crazy fool!</string>
<string name="6804">Tell me about your brother.</string>
<string name="6805">Who your brother be?</string>
<string name="6806">Enough. Leave me!</string>
<string name="6807">That&apos;s it. Get lost.</string>
<string name="6808">Goodbye, then.</string>
<string name="6809">Me looks for plaguer-causer guys. They plague Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6810">I seek a cult behind the plague in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="6811">Can&apos;t you give a straight answer?</string>
<string name="6812">You talk in circles, and me tired. Talk straight.</string>
<string name="6813">Welcome to where the dead lie! Or is it lay? I forget which is which when they do both. I am Quint... I think.</string>
<string name="6814">That&apos;s what my brother Karlat said! That&apos;s what he said, and I said no! He wouldn&apos;t listen, of course. He wasn&apos;t the listening type.</string>
<string name="6815">You&apos;ll see. I&apos;m alive, you&apos;re alive, but you can&apos;t change Castle Jhareg... and you can&apos;t change the dead... they never EVER listen!</string>
<string name="6816">He went ahead, but I said no! I put a stop to it, but it didn&apos;t stop! It was too late! You&apos;ll see! Maybe you&apos;ll see!</string>
<string name="6817">You walk in the Charwood, a town that is nowhere... or more, no-WHEN. What does that mean? Like I know? I&apos;m alive, but I stay!</string>
<string name="6818">Everyone stays, no matter what. That&apos;s what happened in Castle Jhareg. We made everyone stay. All for my brother. All for the children.</string>
<string name="6819">No, I&apos;ll see you again. I see everyone again. No one leaves. Not really. I stopped my brother Karlat, and he stopped everyone!</string>
<string name="6820">A brother, a monster, a lord. Take your pick. All are right, and none are left. Heh. See, that was funny because... ah, nevermind.</string>
<string name="6821">Karlat and I are Lords of this place, but this place is nowhere, and our rule is nowhere. We sacrificed it all a long time ago.</string>
<string name="6822">A plague? Ah, a bane of the living. A plague would find no purchase here. Your cult? I don&apos;t know. Maybe. Could be.</string>
<string name="6823">My brother was many things and halves of things. He may have been in touch with a cult of sorts, but all that he touched dies. And all he didn&apos;t.</string>
<string name="6824">Answers? I wish I had answers, decisions, judgments! All I have is what I took, and what Karlat won&apos;t let go! Over and over it plays!</string>
<string name="6825">You think you know what&apos;s here, but you don&apos;t! It&apos;s not right, but the dead don&apos;t listen! They don&apos;t!</string>
<string name="6826">It was Glavius who quested to fulfill the great destiny of Maegel. Tripped and broke my ankle.</string>
<string name="6827">Lost my picks. Food running out. Was prepared for the riddle, but I will not make it.</string>
<string name="6828">Watch ye well the treacherous low rocks that twist the foot, or ye may as well lay beside me now.</string>
<string name="6829">It would probably be a bad idea to sound the alarm.</string>
<string name="6830">Heeheehee! Free to annoy! Free to destroy!</string>
<string name="6831">He seems quite mad, don&apos;t he? You&apos;d best avoid him.</string>
<string name="6832">Who knows who the fellow is but he seems a wee bit barmy, wouldn&apos;t you say?</string>
<string name="6833">Who do you work for?</string>
<string name="6834">How long have you been posted here?</string>
<string name="6835">Why do you guard this gate?</string>
<string name="6836">Regardless, I need to get in.</string>
<string name="6837">Who you work for?</string>
<string name="6838">How long you stand there?</string>
<string name="6839">Why you guard this gate?</string>
<string name="6840">So? Me need in... </string>
<string name="6841">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; This place is keeping you from thinking straight... </string>
<string name="6842">What do you know about the castle?</string>
<string name="6843">What do you know about the Jharegs?</string>
<string name="6844">Where can I find the Mayor?</string>
<string name="6845">I need to pass through those gates. Will you let me?</string>
<string name="6846">What you know &apos;bout castle?</string>
<string name="6847">What you know &apos;bout da Jar-eggs?</string>
<string name="6848">Where Mayor be?</string>
<string name="6849">Me need through gates. You let me?</string>
<string name="6850">My good &lt;sir/madam&gt;, I urge you not to disturb the Lords Jhareg... They need their rest, you know... </string>
<string name="6851">Why... Why Mayor Mobley hired me... I get my first payment tomorrow: fifty coin... at sunrise, he said... tomorrow... </string>
<string name="6852">I... I&apos;m not from here... I was an adventurer. I come from somewhere far away... That&apos;s funny. I don&apos;t remember where... Isn&apos;t that funny?</string>
<string name="6853">You&apos;re a stranger to these parts, aren&apos;t you... Either way, I&apos;d advise you not to disturb the Lords Jhareg... They need their rest, you know... </string>
<string name="6854">Aye, I know the look of you. You&apos;re one of them traveling stroytellers, aren&apos;t you... Well the Lords Jhareg don&apos;t want any. They need their rest... </string>
<string name="6855">Why, May Mobley hired me just the other day... didn&apos;t he? Time seems to... just stretch on... here... </string>
<string name="6856">I... I don&apos;t know... Mayor Mobley told me it was important... Let nothing in or out, he said... Let nothing... in... or out... </string>
<string name="6857">Thinking straight? No, everything&apos;s perfectly... perfectly clear... normal... forever... </string>
<string name="6858">What? Sorry, I got... I got carried away there... What were you saying?</string>
<string name="6859">It seems so old, like it&apos;s been here forever... This entire town feels old... We all just go about our business... </string>
<string name="6860">There are two of them, Karlat and Quint, brothers... I&apos;ve never seen Karlat but Quint wanders around the town sometimes, asking about the children... </string>
<string name="6861">That&apos;s funny... He&apos;s never come through the gate, I&apos;m... I&apos;m sure of it... and I&apos;ve never seen any children here at all... Isn&apos;t that funny?</string>
<string name="6862">I found him in the town hall and I didn&apos;t ever see him leave... He&apos;s... He&apos;s probably still... in there... </string>
<string name="6863">But Mayor Mobley said... He said... What did he say again? Maybe... Maybe he told me to open the gate for you... Yes, that must be what he said... </string>
<string name="6864">That&apos;s funny. The lock seems so rusted... Isn&apos;t that funny? Mayor Mobley would want me to oil that... Yes, I&apos;ll just... go get some oil... </string>
<string name="6865">I&apos;m... I&apos;m just looking for some oil for the gate... What was I looking for again?</string>
<string name="6866">You&apos;re welcome, Mayor.</string>
<string name="6867">I did it for my own reasons.</string>
<string name="6868">Is there anything else I can do for you?</string>
<string name="6869">Yuh, you welcome.</string>
<string name="6870">Me do it for me, not you.</string>
<string name="6871">There be more me can do for you?</string>
<string name="6872">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6873">I didn&apos;t mean for this to happen.</string>
<string name="6874">You deserved it, fool... </string>
<string name="6875">Maybe I can still help.</string>
<string name="6876">Me no mean for this to happen.</string>
<string name="6877">Huh! You deserve this.</string>
<string name="6878">Mebbe me still help, yuh?</string>
<string name="6879">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="6880">Judge, it&apos;s me, Mayor Mobley!</string>
<string name="6881">Look how the light shines through the leaves again! See all you&apos;ve done? I stayed behind to thank you.</string>
<string name="6882">Curses, Judge! You have cursed us all! Even now, Karlat&apos;s minions set torches to the village. Do you see now why we did not want change?</string>
<string name="6883">Know that it&apos;s appreciated. The entire town, all of us ghosts and spirits, we&apos;re finally free now. We leave these woods to the animals... and to you.</string>
<string name="6884">Goodbye Judge. You have served us well.</string>
<string name="6885">Good deeds can come, even from ill intent. We&apos;re all free to go now, the entire town. We leave these woods to the animals... and to you.</string>
<string name="6886">You have done all that we could have ever hoped for. We can all rest now, all of us. We leave these woods to the animals... and to you.</string>
<string name="6887">You should have forseen this! How could you stand in Judgment if you did not think of the consequences? Our spirits burn for your stupidity!</string>
<string name="6888">I - I can feel the fire coming for me, even now... It burns, Judge! It burns so much!</string>
<string name="6889">We deserve a million things, all of us, even you Judge. A world without grace, without understanding, would be a charred and smoking wasteland.</string>
<string name="6890">Help? We are beyond all help now. The Judgment has been made, the court adjourned. If ever you were unsure, you should never have stood Judgment.</string>
<string name="6891">Tell me what is happening here.</string>
<string name="6892">What going on here?</string>
<string name="6893">Explain yourself! I don&apos;t trust anyone here!</string>

<string name="6907">I&apos;ll go look around, then.</string>

<string name="6952">How do I put an end to this?</string>
<string name="6953">How me end this?</string>
<string name="6954">I should destroy everything! Including you! Nobody is innocent!</string>
<string name="6955">Me stop everything! Even you! All bad!</string>
<string name="6956">I&apos;ll put an end to all of this.</string>
<string name="6957">Me stop all of this.</string>
<string name="6958">I still think I should kill you too.</string>
<string name="6959">Me still think you die too.</string>
<string name="6960">What happens if Karlat&apos;s destroyed? His spell caused this.</string>
<string name="6961">What happens if Karlat destroyed? His spell make all this.</string>
<string name="6962">Here... please... You&apos;ve come at last. So many stop at the village. So many fell in here... Talk to me... please... </string>
<string name="6963">Real live people! Real! And live! But can I trust them? I don&apos;t know about that. I&apos;ll have to see. yes, I&apos;ll have to see... </string>
<string name="6964">I have given all I can. I have done all I can. No more words can I say. The scepters are the key to his chamber.</string>
<string name="6965">You have him! You have him in the jar! Destroy him! Sanctify him! Smash him with the light of morning!</string>
<string name="6966">Someone has him! He&apos;s in the jar! Find them and make them sactify him! Make sure they smash him with the light of morning!</string>
<string name="6967">Back to me! Or not? Are you the same? I don&apos;t know! Have you the things! The stuff? I have to know if I can trust you!</string>
<string name="6968">Please, make sure he does not survive. The phylactery must be filled and then smashed by the light of morning. Use it against him!</string>
<string name="6969">I am Quint! What would you have in this place? Prithee, will you help cleanse this place?</string>
<string name="6970">Of course not, of course, of course. The troubles of others are so far away. The misery of others is not your concern. Of course.</string>
<string name="6971">Inquisitive. A good sign. Now, don&apos;t keep them waiting, Quint, you fool. Damn, I&apos;m talking to myself. Did I say that out loud? Shut up, shut up!</string>
<string name="6972">Let me explain, if I may? May I? Yes, I shall try. This is Castle Jhareg, the hell I have created. I trapped them all, you see... you see?</string>
<string name="6973">Wisely skeptical, just as I am. Good. Very good. No, don&apos;t judge. Just explain it. And stop talking to yourself! Shut up! </string>
<string name="6974">But would you... prithee... take but a moment of your time to listen to what I might say? It&apos;s not much to ask. Not much.</string>
<string name="6975">Fair enough. Yes, fair. I will not stop you. I will not goad. It&apos;s not my place to do so... however... one thing... </string>
<string name="6976">Please, explore. Confront who you will. I encourage it. Given a chance, I will help you, too. Remember that. Just ask for Quint. That&apos;s me. Quint.</string>
<string name="6977">Er, please, I don&apos;t know if I can trust you... so much trickery... if you do some things... I will know. Grant me this, will you?</string>
<string name="6978">Yes, see, the thing is, I trapped them. I trapped them here, and I don&apos;t know if you will join their evil or not. I need proof... </string>
<string name="6979">The siblings carry scepters. Keys. Bring them and I will know you are not with them. I will tell you more... I can&apos;t until then. I can&apos;t let him free.</string>
<string name="6980">That&apos;s the spirit! Fight their evil, and I will talk more about it... help you get further... help you stop it all... better than I did.</string>
<string name="6981">Yes, yes, evil all around. But what side are you on? Show me. Bring me something from someone, and I&apos;ll tell more. Really.</string>
<string name="6982">Good, good, good! Simple things, these tests. You bring back the stuff you find somewhere from someone, and I trust you. Really, that&apos;s good.</string>
<string name="6983">Not yet! It&apos;s not time yet! You need the keys from the siblings, and the stuff from the Quint. That&apos;s me, you know.</string>
<string name="6984">I put it where he couldn&apos;t get it, even if he got out! That&apos;s where he must go when it&apos;s full! When it&apos;s filled! Not yet, but hang on to it!</string>
<string name="6985">What, like there was all that much? Don&apos;t think so. I just said I needed you to bring the scepter keys... or something... to prove your intent.</string>
<string name="6986">That&apos;s about it, really. I need your honest intent. Have to have it.</string>
<string name="6987">Not ready for that, yet! Not yet! You need the things from the others! They open the way when I know you are true!</string>
<string name="6988">Careful with it until then! I put it where he couldn&apos;t get it even if he got out. When it&apos;s time, that&apos;s where it&apos;s got to go back!</string>
<string name="6989">Evil everywhere, yes, and everyone is grey from it. I don&apos;t deny, but there is worse that needs fixing, and better than I tried.</string>
<string name="6990">Please, bring the things from the siblings. Scepters, I think... don&apos;t I?</string>
<string name="6991">You do? That&apos;s a first! I mean, some other people come, but they never got a scepter! I though I should ask nicer! What do you have?</string>
<string name="6992">Don&apos;t fiddle around! There&apos;s too much dead afoot for this! Please, ask as I do... as I ask... or something. Don&apos;t jerk around!</string>
<string name="6993">The builder! The constructor! You got it! She&apos;ll be back, but that&apos;s good! Keep it! You&apos;ll need it soon enough!</string>
<string name="6994">The scortcher! The burner! Marvelous! He&apos;ll be back, of course, but that&apos;s good! Keep it! You&apos;ll need it soon!</string>
<string name="6995">The builder and the burner! Both! Well, I suppose I can trust you well enough over that! Keep them, though, because you&apos;ll need them!</string>
<string name="6996">I have seen one of the scepters of my siblings. Have you another? Do you know what I ask? Were you here before?</string>
<string name="6997">You must know... you must know some things about this place, then. I can trust you, but do you trust me?</string>
<string name="6998">Of course you do. We all do. I wish I had all the answers. I wish I had the questions... I wish I could think straight!!</string>
<string name="6999">I&apos;m sorry, I tried, but I failed. He got too far. We all let it get too far. Everyone was complicit. Everyone wanted to be powerful with him. </string>
<string name="7000">&lt;He/She&gt; doesn&apos;t care. &lt;He/She&gt; doesn&apos;t care. Why should they care. I mean, my perspective is probably biased. I mean, I failed... </string>
<string name="7001">They trust... am I worthy of it, I wonder? I wonder a lot. I wonder what would have been and what is... Frankly, &quot;what is&quot; is messed up.</string>
<string name="7002">The villagers were fuel, and protection and whatever else he wanted. He wanted lichdom, and we just let it get too far.</string>
<string name="7003">Poor villagers? There are things you don&apos;t know yet. You get another scepter and see what knowledge it carries like stench!</string>
<string name="7004">So long... You don&apos;t know what happened. You don&apos;t realize the consequence of waiting too long. Another scepter will show you. Too long... </string>
<string name="7005">You have the scepters from my siblings... you know much of what happened, but I must give you this before I continue... Please... </string>
<string name="7006">I tried to stop it. How could I know it was too late? Everyone died... except me. I don&apos;t know how long it&apos;s been... seasons... centuries?</string>
<string name="7007">Everyone dead, and trapped where they are. The villagers... Charwood... trapped by their sins... complicit... they sold their neighbors... </string>
<string name="7008">There is more you must discover. My mind... I cannot do these things... but you... I have another sibling... you must retrieve the scepters.</string>
<string name="7009">See, they are keys, and they unlock things. Bad things. Things that will need to be destroyed. Get the second, and I will give you the third.</string>
<string name="7010">Show me the second scepter, and I shall aid you as best I can. It will soon be time for the opening, and destruction soon follows!</string>
<string name="7011">That&apos;s why it went on so long. They were being killed, but not even they would stand up to fight. Why was I supposed to risk it?</string>
<string name="7012">A lottery to choose the lucky... the ones that died didn&apos;t have to live with the bargain. When I stopped Karlat... they paid the sins they owed... </string>
<string name="7013">Everyone. I attacked Karlat, but his spell was tainted... not stopped. Everyone was killed... except me. They are shades... phantoms... </string>
<string name="7014">They don&apos;t even know it, I think. Doomed to repeat the time just before, when their shame still lived. I killed them all by trying to help... </string>
<string name="7015">I don&apos;t know... I have outlived my halfelf blood... something else sustains me. How long can I live? Not as long as they will stay dead.</string>
<string name="7016">Nothing changes... but it creeps through. They live, but don&apos;t live. Everyone is trapped where they were. No hope for an end... until you came.</string>
<string name="7017">It must seem that way. I see a logic to it... but I&apos;ve been mad for years.... years! Still, you now have the means to do it.</string>
<string name="7018">The scepters... they weren&apos;t an errand to amuse. They are the keys... they are the keys to the place where he is trapped.</string>
<string name="7019">See, I knew they couldn&apos;t work together... I knew they were trapped where they were... so those were the keys.</string>
<string name="7020">When you find him... Karlat... trap his soul where he wanted. I hid it where he couldn&apos;t get it. Smash it with the light of morning when you have him.</string>
<string name="7021">You know... I haven&apos;t the foggiest. Maybe we&apos;ll all die? Maybe we&apos;ll all live? Maybe everything stays the same... wouldn&apos;t that be hell?</string>
<string name="7022">One way or another, there has to be an end. Nothing has changed here in so long... so long... </string>
<string name="7023">You have that power. Everyone else came back, but I don&apos;t know if I would. I leave it up to you. I did what I could... I did... </string>
<string name="7024">Why do you call me Judge?</string>
<string name="7025">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Did you write the notes in those chests?</string>
<string name="7026">Who are you?</string>
<string name="7027">What is this place? Who is Lord over this castle?</string>
<string name="7028">Why do you haunt this place, Spirit?</string>
<string name="7029">Why you call me Judge?</string>
<string name="7030">Huh? What this place be? Who be Lord here?</string>
<string name="7031">Why you haunt castle, ghostie?</string>
<string name="7032">Hmph. Who you be?</string>
<string name="7033">Tell me more... </string>
<string name="7034">Get to the point, will you?</string>
<string name="7035">Yuh? Ooh, you tell more... </string>
<string name="7036">Hmph. You have point, yuh? Get to it.</string>
<string name="7037">Tell me more... </string>
<string name="7038">Get to the point, will you?</string>
<string name="7039">Yuh? Ooh, you tell more... </string>
<string name="7040">Hmph. You have point, yuh? Get to it.</string>
<string name="7041">I have some questions first, Spirit.</string>
<string name="7042">Very well. I shall return to you with the oaths.</string>
<string name="7043">Uh, me have questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="7044">Yuh, okay. Me return with oaths.</string>
<string name="7045">I&apos;m not your Judge and I&apos;m *not* visiting your stupid towers!</string>
<string name="7046">Hmph. This &apos;Judge&apos; stuff is stupid. Me go now.</string>
<string name="7047">Quint&apos;s one of the accused? Didn&apos;t I see him earlier?</string>
<string name="7048">What is this crime over which I stand in Judgment?</string>
<string name="7049">Will you accept any Judgment? Any at all?</string>
<string name="7050">What if I choose to kill the brothers Jhareg?</string>
<string name="7051">All right, enough questions.</string>
<string name="7052">Quint? He trapped up there? But me see him earlier, yuh?</string>
<string name="7053">You okay with any kind of Judgment? Ooh, this be fun!</string>
<string name="7054">What if me kill da Jhareg fellas instead?</string>
<string name="7055">Okay, &apos;nuff questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="7056">Uh, what be da crime?</string>
<string name="7057">Oaths? What oaths?</string>
<string name="7058">Yes.</string>
<string name="7059">No.</string>
<string name="7060">Can you refresh my memory about what&apos;s going on here?</string>
<string name="7061">Oaths? Why you want oaths?</string>
<string name="7062">Uh, me forget da story here. You tell me again, yuh?</string>
<string name="7063">Both Quint&apos;s and Karlat&apos;s.</string>
<string name="7064">Quint&apos;s.</string>
<string name="7065">Karlat&apos;s.</string>
<string name="7066">Sorry, I was mistaken. I don&apos;t have either.</string>
<string name="7067">Uh... Oops! Me no have nothing... </string>
<string name="7068">Yes, I am ready.</string>
<string name="7069">No, I still need time to think about it.</string>
<string name="7070">Yuh, okay. Me give Judgment now.</string>
<string name="7071">No, me still need to think it through a li&apos;l.</string>
<string name="7072">I find Quint guilty. Give the phylactery to Karlat.</string>
<string name="7073">I find Karlat guilty. Destroy the phylactery.</string>
<string name="7074">I find neither Quint nor Karlat guilty of the crime.</string>
<string name="7075">Me find Quint guilty. You give philacta-thingy to Karlat, yuh?</string>
<string name="7076">Me find Karlat guilty. You destroy philacta-thingy.</string>
<string name="7077">Me find both Quint and Karlat innocent.</string>
<string name="7078">I have the written oath of the demon Belial.</string>
<string name="7079">Me have da oath of da demon-guy, Belial.</string>
<string name="7080">I have no evidence, Spirit.</string>
<string name="7081">Me no have evidence, Miss Spirit.</string>
<string name="7082">I shall take the phylactery myself.</string>
<string name="7083">You shall guard it as you always have, Spirit.</string>
<string name="7084">Uh, me take philacta-thingy meself, yuh?</string>
<string name="7085">Uh, you keep it, just like always, okay?</string>
<string name="7086">Judgment? I don&apos;t understand what&apos;s going on.</string>
<string name="7087">Judgment? Huh? Me no understand... </string>
<string name="7088">It was simple. Quint admitted his own guilt.</string>
<string name="7089">I found Karlat&apos;s cause to be most just.</string>
<string name="7090">The Judge&apos;s heart is &lt;his/hers&gt; alone. Ask no more.</string>
<string name="7091">I chose randomly between them.</string>
<string name="7092">Easy. That Quint guy say he guilty... out loud, even!</string>
<string name="7093">Uh, me think Karlat be good guy, yuh?</string>
<string name="7094">Haha! It easy! Me just flip coin!</string>
<string name="7095">That be da Judge&apos;s secret, yuh?</string>
<string name="7096">Yes, give me the Morninglord&apos;s account.</string>
<string name="7097">No. The hour is late. Let us adjourn this court.</string>
<string name="7098">Yuh, tell me what da Morning-guy say.</string>
<string name="7099">No. It be late. We all go home now.</string>
<string name="7100">Karlat&apos;s story didn&apos;t hold up to scrutiny.</string>
<string name="7101">I found Quint&apos;s cause to be most just.</string>
<string name="7102">Karlat be just a big, fat liar.</string>
<string name="7103">Uh, me think Quint be good guy, yuh?</string>
<string name="7104">We all must be free, be it to do evil or good.</string>
<string name="7105">I didn&apos;t realize this would be the consequence.</string>
<string name="7106">Evil? Good? It don&apos;t matter. Only freedom.</string>
<string name="7107">Uh, me thought this end up different... </string>
<string name="7108">In their own way, everyone is guilty.</string>
<string name="7109">In da end, everybody be guilty, yuh?</string>
<string name="7110">Greetings, Judge, and welcome to the Castle Jhareg... I hope you have learned your lessons well.</string>
<string name="7111">Not I, my child. The notes you speak of were placed there long ago by Lathander, god of the dawn, in anticipation of your coming.</string>
<string name="7112">I call you by what you are and what you may yet be, my child. Lathander, god of the dawn, has waited long for you.</string>
<string name="7113">I am a divine spirit sent by the god Lathander to watch over this place until the day of Judgment. And now that day has come... </string>
<string name="7114">This castle was once home to the brothers Jhareg. Now it stands trapped in time by Lathander, god of the dawn, in anticipation of your coming.</string>
<string name="7115">I am no mere haunting ghost, though these halls have their fair share of those... </string>
<string name="7116">Long ago did the crime take place and so great were its consequences that Lathander himself felt unfit to stand in Judgment over those accused... </string>
<string name="7117">It was a mortal crime, requiring a mortal as its Judge. So it was that this Castle and its village were placed beyond the weave of time, awaiting your arrival.</string>
<string name="7118">The accused are confined in their towers beyond the north door. They are known as the brothers Jhareg, Karlat in the west tower and Quint within the east.</string>
<string name="7119">You must learn from them the nature of the crime and from them obtain their written oath. When both oaths are in my hands, I shall hear your Judgment.</string>
<string name="7120">Here now, this key shall open the north door, revealing stairs to the two towers. Show wisdom, Judge, and compassion for us all... </string>
<string name="7121">You are the Judge. Take this key and explore the castle. When you obtain the written oaths of the brothers Jhareg, present them to me so you may stand in Judgment.</string>
<string name="7122">Then ask them and I shall answer as Lathander gives me leave.</string>
<string name="7123">Then go into the night, dear Judge, and find the dawn we have awaited for so long.</string>
<string name="7124">As you wish. We have waited this long without a dawn. We shall wait forever if we must. If you are not the Judge, the Judge shall come.</string>
<string name="7125">Before the dark befell this castle, Quint Jhareg was Lathander&apos;s cleric. When the Morninglord sealed the towers, he allowed Quint to project an image of himself into the town below.</string>
<string name="7126">Perhaps seeing the ghosts of the village was meant to be a special punishment for Quint or perhaps balm to soothe a wounded soul.</string>
<string name="7127">Lathander either loves or hates his fallen cleric. Either way, the Morninglord knew he held too great a bias to stand in Judgment over Quint&apos;s soul. </string>
<string name="7128">By Lathander&apos;s will, I cannot say. In telling you of the horror, I might sway your Judgment. No, you must learn of it from the brothers themselves... </string>
<string name="7129">How many Judgments can there be? There is guilt and there is innocence and consequences for them both.</string>
<string name="7130">You do not have the power in this place. The castle has slipped through the weave of time. In the same moment that they die, they are reborn.</string>
<string name="7131">Only I have the power to bring this place back into the weave and it is a power I cannot use until the Judge provides his Judgment.</string>
<string name="7132">Then do you accept the role of Judge and the task of Judgment?</string>
<string name="7133">Greetings, Judge. Do you bring with you the oaths of the brothers Jhareg?</string>
<string name="7134">Which oaths do you bear?</string>
<string name="7135">Thank you. Are you prepared to stand in Judgment?</string>
<string name="7136">Quint and Karlat Jhareg, I summon you unto the court of Judgment.</string>
<string name="7137">You know well the charges that the Morninglord has brought against you: On a midwinter night, long ago, the children of Charwood were brought here and slaughtered.</string>
<string name="7138">Now it is time for that Judge to decide the fate of us all... Judge, what is your ruling?</string>
<string name="7139">Karlat, you have been found innocent in the Judge&apos;s eyes. Here is the phylactery stolen from you by your brother. Take it and go.</string>
<string name="7140">I too thank you for my freedom, Judge. Long have I stood watch over this castle. I have but one question: What brought you to your Judgment?</string>
<string name="7141">When you leave, I shall seal the castle doors and you shall never return... May the Judge always know the blessings of the Morninglord.</string>
<string name="7142">Quint, you have been found innocent in the Judge&apos;s eyes. Be free from your madness and die knowing that your brother&apos;s soul shall not be tainted by undeath.</string>
<string name="7143">There is no denying that a great crime has been committed, Judge. What evidence do you bring that it was not at the hands of the brothers Jhareg?</string>
<string name="7144">Indeed... Belial, Lord of Fire, I summon you unto the court of Judgment.</string>
<string name="7145">Long have I sensed that you, too, have been trapped within this castle. The Judge has produced your written confession and found you guilty. </string>
<string name="7146">I stand guard over the phylactery by Lathander&apos;s will. The fate of that phylactery determines the fate of all who gather here. Even me. Even you.</string>
<string name="7147">By the Morninglord&apos;s power, I shall make it so, Judge. Take this vessel and guard it, unto the end of your days.</string>
<string name="7148">With your Judgment, the souls of all gathered here are finally free of this place. I have but one question: What brought you to your Judgment?</string>
<string name="7149">But - But Judge... No, I shall not argue the Judgment... Just know that, in making it, you have cursed all of us gathered here.</string>
<string name="7150">Here we shall stay, forever exiled from the weave of time to live out our endless lives in madness and decay. So have you Judged, so shall it be.</string>
<string name="7151">If you have no evidence, then you cannot make such a Judgment. I must ask you to Judge again.</string>
<string name="7152">Wise is the Judge who gives thought to his Judgment. Speak with me again when you are ready.</string>
<string name="7153">Then I shall hold it for you and keep it safe until you return with his brother&apos;s.</string>
<string name="7154">Then come speak with me once you do.</string>
<string name="7155">Well, no matter. We have waited one eternity, we can wait another... </string>
<string name="7156">Ah, then perhaps you are not familiar with the sad tale of Castle Jhareg.</string>
<string name="7157">Of course, Judge. You need but ask... </string>
<string name="7158">I hold the oaths of the brothers Jhareg and this court requires only the presence of a Judge. Are you ready to stand in Judgment?</string>
<string name="7159">You are not the only Judge in this place. But explore the castle and return to me when you obtain the written oaths of the brothers Jhareg.</string>
<string name="7160">Through the north door lie stairs to the two towers. Show wisdom, Judge, and compassion for us all... </string>
<string name="7161">Then that is both of them. Are you prepared to stand in Judgment?</string>
<string name="7162">Greetings, Lady Guardian. Greetings, Judge.</string>
<string name="7163">All of us with faces dour, waiting for the Judgment hour!</string>
<string name="7164">You, the accused, have each spoken in your defense and given your written oath to the Judge before you.</string>
<string name="7165">Our souls long for rest, Lady Guardian, and our hearts for justice.</string>
<string name="7166">Hold your tongue, Karlat Jhareg. You have had your say and given your oath. That is all this court requires of you.</string>
<string name="7167">At last! What was stolen from me has been returned and I may finally shed this half-dead form!</string>
<string name="7168">Judge, you grant me the suffering I have begged of Lathander for so long. For each child, I shall travel anew into the Abyss to do my penance.</string>
<string name="7169">That much is true. Do you wish now to hear Lathander&apos;s version of this tragedy?</string>
<string name="7170">Perhaps it was. Do you wish now to hear Lathander&apos;s version of this tragedy?</string>
<string name="7171">So be it. Sometimes Fate is the wisest Judge of all. Do you wish now to hear Lathander&apos;s version of this tragedy?</string>
<string name="7172">Very well. To all assembled, then, the Judge declares this court adjourned.</string>
<string name="7173">That a slaughter of children happened within these walls one midwinter&apos;s night is beyond refute. Less clear, however, are the events that led to such a crime. </string>
<string name="7174">Indeed, it was Quint Jhareg who gathered up the village children for a party within the castle library... </string>
<string name="7175">Yet it was his brother Karlat who tricked him into doing so and who cast the spell that caused the slaughter... </string>
<string name="7176">Karlat sought to become a noble baelnorn, you see, and had been told that the blood of innocents would be required... </string>
<string name="7177">It was the demon Belial who told him that lie, twisting Karlat&apos;s good intentions to an evil end... </string>
<string name="7178">The phylactery was at the heart of it. Karlat needed it, Belial gave it, Quint stole it, Lathander confiscated it, I guarded it, and you Judged its fate.</string>
<string name="7179">It is done. To all assembled, then, Lathander declares this court adjourned.</string>
<string name="7180">I did, Judge! Never will I forgive myself!</string>
<string name="7181">I made it quick, just a moment of pain. I was told that they would be returned to life as soon as I finished my ceremony but... I never finished... </string>
<string name="7182">Some of my finest work, might I add. Even now, the Dark Lords ride into battle with the name of Belial, Lord of Fire, on their lips!</string>
<string name="7183">No!!! The phylactery is everything!</string>
<string name="7184">At last, the madness ends... The phylactery has brought nothing but evil to this house.... Come, brother. Now we both can rest... </string>
<string name="7185">I too thank you for my freedom, Judge. Long have I stood watch over this castle. I have but one question: What brought you to your Judgment?</string>
<string name="7186">Wise is the Judge who sees beyond the surface. Do you wish now to hear Lathander&apos;s version of this tragedy?</string>
<string name="7187">Does Lathander have sudden need of my services, Lady Guardian?</string>
<string name="7188">&lt;He/She&gt; may very well find me guilty, m&apos;lady, but punishing me shall be quite another matter. You hold no power over me, Guardian... </string>
<string name="7189">Decide, Judge. What shall be the fate of the phylactery?</string>
<string name="7190">Ha! Your Judge is a fool, Guardian! The court is closed, then, the case resolved. By Lathander&apos;s own decree, we are free to go... Even me! </string>
<string name="7191">The Firelord speaks true but your decision is final. Lathander has decreed that there is no turning back.</string>
<string name="7192">Well-spoken, then, and not without merit. Do you wish now to hear Lathander&apos;s version of this tragedy?</string>
<string name="7193">Then may woe follow you, Judge, wherever you may go... Do you wish now to hear Lathander&apos;s version of this tragedy?</string>
<string name="7194">No! And be trapped in this place forever!? It cannot be!</string>
<string name="7195">You are wiser than I surmised, my Judge... We deserve nothing more than this endless penance... </string>
<string name="7196">I have but one question left: What brought this Judge to &lt;his/her&gt; Judgment?</string>
<string name="7197">Even you, Judge? *Sigh* Do you wish, at least, to hear Lathander&apos;s version of this tragedy?</string>
<string name="7198">Intruders!</string>
<string name="7199">What do you guard?</string>
<string name="7200">What you guard?</string>
<string name="7201">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I mean no harm to what you guard.</string>
<string name="7202">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me no harm to what you&apos;s guarding.</string>
<string name="7203">Die, creature!</string>
<string name="7204">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Jardak orders that you give it to me!</string>
<string name="7205">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; You give to me! Jardak order it!</string>
<string name="7206">I am summoned to protect. Speak the words of appeasement or feel my wrath!</string>
<string name="7207">Who are you? I guard for Jardak Jhereg, and will turn you to cinders if you do not offer explanation!</string>
<string name="7208">Foolish mortal! Burn!</string>
<string name="7209">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps you are no threat. Leave this place.</string>
<string name="7210">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You are not supposed to be here! You are a trespasser! Burn!</string>
<string name="7211">What I guard is of no importance to you, unless Jardak himself has directed you to receive it. It is in my otherworld domain.</string>
<string name="7212">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; As the master wills it. Your tone is steady, and does not lie.</string>
<string name="7213">Back to the grave, you undead beast!</string>
<string name="7214">Are you Karlat Jhareg?</string>
<string name="7215">Why is this tower so full of fire?</string>
<string name="7216">Why do you sound so confused?</string>
<string name="7217">Be at peace. I am the Judge you seek.</string>
<string name="7218">You be Mister Karlat, yuh?</string>
<string name="7219">Why you sound confused?</string>
<string name="7220">Yuh, me be da Judge-guy.</string>
<string name="7221">Why there so much fire here?</string>
<string name="7222">Die, Mister Undead Beast! Die again!</string>
<string name="7223">Tell me more... </string>
<string name="7224">Get to the point.</string>
<string name="7225">Yuh? Ooh, you keep talking... </string>
<string name="7226">You got point? Get to it.</string>
<string name="7227">Tell me more... </string>
<string name="7228">Get to the point.</string>
<string name="7229">Yuh? Ooh, you keep talking... </string>
<string name="7230">You got point? Get to it.</string>
<string name="7231">Will you give that as a written oath?</string>
<string name="7232">I&apos;ve spoken to Quint. He tells a different story.</string>
<string name="7233">This your journal?</string>
<string name="7234">I still have some questions.</string>
<string name="7235">You gives that as written oath?</string>
<string name="7236">Me talk to Quint already. His story different.</string>
<string name="7237">Me still have questions.</string>
<string name="7238">Why would Quint do such a thing?</string>
<string name="7239">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; A lich&apos;s phylactery, huh? Aren&apos;t liches evil?</string>
<string name="7240">Who has the phylactery now?</string>
<string name="7241">What about Lathander and the Guardian?</string>
<string name="7242">But why Quint do horrible thing like that?</string>
<string name="7243">Who has philacta-thingy now?</string>
<string name="7244">What &apos;bout da Guardian an&apos; her god?</string>
<string name="7245">All right, enough questions.</string>
<string name="7246">Okay, &apos;nuff questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="7247">You tricked your brother into the crime.</string>
<string name="7248">You sought undeath out of a greed for knowledge.</string>
<string name="7249">You acted on the advice of someone named Belial.</string>
<string name="7250">Nothing. It doesn&apos;t say anything of note.</string>
<string name="7251">You tricked Quint into da crime.</string>
<string name="7252">You greedy for knowledge. That&apos;s why you undead.</string>
<string name="7253">Some guy called Belial, he tell you to do stuff.</string>
<string name="7254">Huh? Oh, it not say anything important... </string>
<string name="7255">That&apos;s all it said. Will you give that as a written oath?</string>
<string name="7256">Uh, that&apos;s all it said. You gives that as written oath?</string>
<string name="7257">Judge? Judge, is that you? I don&apos;t remember -- it&apos;s so hard to string my thoughts together one to the next... </string>
<string name="7258">Yes. Yes, that&apos;s my name... It&apos;s been so long since I&apos;ve heard someone speak it! The last one to do so was my... my brother... </string>
<string name="7259">I just don&apos;t know whether or not we&apos;ve spoken before. I live in a constant daze. Everything&apos;s come undone since my brother... since that night... </string>
<string name="7260">Yes. Yes, I seek an end to this torment of unknowing! I do not even know if we have spoken before... Everything&apos;s come undone since my brother... </string>
<string name="7261">Fire? I - I was doing research once, trying to find something... And I found it - I did but... then my brother took it from me... </string>
<string name="7262">No, I have forgotten many things but not my power. The last time I used it was that night... the night my... my brother... </string>
<string name="7263">Quint! Yes, it was him! He was responsible! He invited all the children of the village to his tower and he began to read to them... </string>
<string name="7264">It was horrible... The blood, it was everywhere. Every one of them died, every child... He&apos;s gone mad, you know. My younger brother has gone mad... </string>
<string name="7265">I arrived there too late. I rebuked him and he groveled there before me. He said he did it for me, all for me, all for the love of an older brother!</string>
<string name="7266">I unleashed the fire against him but he fled and stole my most powerful artifact, my phylactery, and made use of it.</string>
<string name="7267">Now we are all stuck here because of him, pressed like flowers between the pages of the Book of Time.</string>
<string name="7268">I have the time, Judge, if not always the memory. Ask what you will.</string>
<string name="7269">I once had half-elven blood in my veins. Among the elves, some called Baelnorns seek lichdom that they might stand watch over their families.</string>
<string name="7270">I would have preserved our family had not my brother first destroyed it. When he interfered, I became but a half-lich, somehow.</string>
<string name="7271">If only I can recover the phylactery he stole, I can finish the ceremony and become what I was meant to be... It would free us all from this wretched place.</string>
<string name="7272">He was young and foolish, with no understanding of the arcane arts, no understanding of the world in which we wizards operate... </string>
<string name="7273">We consort with demons and keep imps as our familiars but does that make us evil?</string>
<string name="7274">Perhaps he performed the unspeakable act in an effort to earn my respect, my affection. Perhaps he wanted to prove himself before his brother.</string>
<string name="7275">Lathander gave it to the Guardian for safekeeping and she has kept it ever since.</string>
<string name="7276">If only I can recover it, I can finish the ceremony and become what I was meant to be... It would free us all from this accursed place.</string>
<string name="7277">What good is a god of the dawn if he traps us in this eternal night? My brother prayed to him before the madness came on... </string>
<string name="7278">The Guardian may claim Lathander did not stand in Judgment, yet Quint wanders the village freely while I rot in here forever, in this wretched half-form!</string>
<string name="7279">Yes, my Judge... </string>
<string name="7280">I have suffered here too long, tormented by forgetfulness amidst this endless pall of smoke. I would only be too glad... </string>
<string name="7281">Here, take it: my written oath of every word that I have uttered here. Present it to the Guardian and let us have our Judgment.</string>
<string name="7282">Of course he does! Did you expect him to confess? No doubt in his madness and shame, even he no longer knows the truth of things.</string>
<string name="7283">I have given you my story. Let him give you his. You are the Judge, not us.</string>
<string name="7284">Why yes. Yes, the hand is mine. What does it say? I have half forgotten... </string>
<string name="7285">I... I needed the blood. It was necessary. Without it, how could I protect the village? It was a high price but it would have meant a bright future... </string>
<string name="7286">Is a greed for Knowledge any different than a greed for Love, a greed for Justice? Before you Judge me, Judge yourself... </string>
<string name="7287">Belial? I - I know that name... Yes, he was a demon I consorted with. He was the one who gave me the phylactery and taught me to use it... </string>
<string name="7288">Why, the summoning room is just down the hall... Maybe he would know the truth of things!</string>
<string name="7289">Of course. Is that everything, then? Do you want my oath?</string>
<string name="7290">It was horrible... Quint killed the children and when I rebuked him, he wrested my phylactery from me, cursing us all to be trapped here forever.</string>
<string name="7291">We await your decision, Judge.</string>
<string name="7292">Bloodstained and desecrated, this statue of Lathander, god of the dawn, feels cold to the touch. It seems void of any divine presence.</string>
<string name="7293">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Attack other golems. Go!</string>
<string name="7294">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Attack living creatures. Humanoids not with me.</string>
<string name="7295">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Attack people alive, but not friends of me.</string>
<string name="7296">Do nothing.</string>
<string name="7297">&lt;StartAction&gt;The creature stares at you mindlessly, waiting for you to put some sort of thought in its head, if you have the will to command it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7298">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Attack... other... golems... </string>
<string name="7299">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Attack... attack... attack... </string>
<string name="7300">Attack... living... creatures... not... you... </string>
<string name="7301">... </string>
<string name="7302">You are a madman, that much is clear.</string>
<string name="7303">Are you Quint Jhareg?</string>
<string name="7304">Why do the undead walk these halls?</string>
<string name="7305">Didn&apos;t we meet before?</string>
<string name="7306">Be at peace. I come as the Judge.</string>
<string name="7307">You be Mister Quint, yuh?</string>
<string name="7308">We meet before?</string>
<string name="7309">No, me be da Judge-guy.</string>
<string name="7310">Why there so many undead here?</string>
<string name="7311">Hmm. You no make much sense.</string>
<string name="7312">Tell me more... </string>
<string name="7313">Get to the point.</string>
<string name="7314">Yuh? Ooh, you keep talking... </string>
<string name="7315">You got point? Get to it.</string>
<string name="7316">Tell me more... </string>
<string name="7317">Get to the point.</string>
<string name="7318">Yuh? Ooh, you keep talking... </string>
<string name="7319">You got point? Get to it.</string>
<string name="7320">Will you give that as a written oath?</string>
<string name="7321">I&apos;ve spoken to Karlat. He tells a different story.</string>
<string name="7322">This your journal?</string>
<string name="7323">I still have some questions.</string>
<string name="7324">You gives that as written oath?</string>
<string name="7325">Me talk to Karlat already. His story different.</string>
<string name="7326">Me still have questions.</string>
<string name="7327">What role did your brother play in this?</string>
<string name="7328">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You seem eager to confess... </string>
<string name="7329">Do you know what a phylactery is?</string>
<string name="7330">What Judgment do you long for?</string>
<string name="7331">What your brother do in all this?</string>
<string name="7332">What is this philacta-thingy?</string>
<string name="7333">What be da Judgment you wanting?</string>
<string name="7334">All right, enough questions.</string>
<string name="7335">Okay, &apos;nuff questions, yuh?</string>
<string name="7336">You loved the children.</string>
<string name="7337">You thought it was going to be a party.</string>
<string name="7338">You said your brother was acting strangely.</string>
<string name="7339">You&apos;re right, it doesn&apos;t say anything.</string>
<string name="7340">You loved da children, yuh?</string>
<string name="7341">You thought it was for big party.</string>
<string name="7342">You said Karlat act funny.</string>
<string name="7343">Yuh, that&apos;s right. It not say anythin&apos; important... </string>
<string name="7344">That&apos;s all it said. Will you give that as a written oath?</string>
<string name="7345">Uh, that&apos;s all it said. You gives that as written oath?</string>
<string name="7346">Stay back, dead one! I have fire to fight fire, you know! Fire to... fight fire... </string>
<string name="7347">Quint - Quaintly, Quintessentially, Quint. But not Jhareg, not anymore. My dishonor brings me too much shame to ever taint my father&apos;s name... </string>
<string name="7348">We have and haven&apos;t, hadn&apos;t and had. Maybe it was my ghost you saw, counting woes... those I created and those that created me, yes?</string>
<string name="7349">You? You&apos;ll be my Judge? But I&apos;m not ready, I&apos;ve just begun a new stage of my punishment! I&apos;m going mad, you know. It helps me feel the pain more clearly... </string>
<string name="7350">They&apos;re here to punish me, to remind me of what I&apos;ve done, to remind me of what my brother almost was. I stopped one corpse and created more!</string>
<string name="7351">Yes, clear, isn&apos;t it? The madness makes the pain more clear. It&apos;s a calculated madness, self-inflicted, and no defense, no defense, no defense, you hear?</string>
<string name="7352">Did you see a ghost stealing children from the village? That was me! Guilt is the gift that keeps on giving, you see, over and over and over.</string>
<string name="7353">Blood on the pages where I read to them... Every one of them died, every child... I&apos;ve gone quite mad, you know. Quite quintessentially mad... </string>
<string name="7354">I was too early and too late, you see? The children were dead but I stopped my brother from joining them at least!</string>
<string name="7355">I stole it, I stole his phylactery, and I ran, oh how I ran from him, lips full of prayer. I gave it to Lathander, you know, for him to destroy.</string>
<string name="7356">But it was already too late. He didn&apos;t destroy, he just tucked it away, tucked all of us away between the folds of time.</string>
<string name="7357">And I have answers! But are they to your questions, we&apos;ll just have to see... </string>
<string name="7358">Confess ten times and it becomes a habit. Confess a hundred times, it becomes an obsession... Confess forever and it becomes your destiny... </string>
<string name="7359">Karlat? He wanted death, he wanted everything. I stole it from him, of that I am sure. I stole death from all of us... </string>
<string name="7360">Yes! It is like a jewel in how it glistens, like a corpse in how it feels. I touched it, I stole it, I gave it away.</string>
<string name="7361">It is an abomination of the undead, a trap for the soul! I - I sought to destroy it but instead I destroyed us all... </string>
<string name="7362">Do what you will with me. I have my punishments planned from here unto eternity and plenty in between... </string>
<string name="7363">But destroy the phylactery! Destroy it, that is all I ask! Maybe then the souls of this place can know Lathander&apos;s peace once more.</string>
<string name="7364">Yes, and just enough answers!</string>
<string name="7365">Will the punishments of the Abyss be harsher than here in Limbo? Will I have a retinue of demons to lash me as I walk?</string>
<string name="7366">If so, I yearn for it... Take my written oath of every word I&apos;ve uttered here. Present it to the Guardian and stand in Judgment.</string>
<string name="7367">Of course he does. He protects me and he longs for his phylactery... Half alive, half dead... All any of us want is the whole of something.</string>
<string name="7368">I have given you my story. Let him give you his. You are the Judge, not us.</string>
<string name="7369">My - my journal? I wasn&apos;t mad back then, it was before the crime. Everything was different, what bearing could it have? It says nothing!</string>
<string name="7370">I - I did... I read them stories and we would laugh and play... They loved coming here and now they&apos;re trapped here forever.</string>
<string name="7371">Yes, a glorious party! No blood, no undead brother, no phylactery, no corpses. I meant well... I didn&apos;t mean for this all to happen.</string>
<string name="7372">He consorted with demons. I knew that but... I wanted this to be a happy place... I shouldn&apos;t have brought children to a house of demons!</string>
<string name="7373">See? It is my fault, my crime! A crime of negligence, a crime of blindness, a crime of folly! I am guilty, a million times guilty.</string>
<string name="7374">No, nothing of use. It is all too late. Too early and too late for all the children. Take my oath, Judge, and grant me my punishment.</string>
<string name="7375">I read to the children and saw them die. But not Karlat, no. I stole his phylactery, I gave it to Lathander to destroy but all for naught.</string>
<string name="7376">We await your decision, Judge.</string>
<string name="7377">The candelabra&apos;s dim light does not make the bloodstained pages any more legible. Judging by the pictures and size of the font, it was a children&apos;s book... </string>
<string name="7378">I am not Karlat.</string>
<string name="7379">Me not Karlat.</string>
<string name="7380">What manner of demon are you?</string>
<string name="7381">What demon kind is you?</string>
<string name="7382">Foul beast! Belay your tempting tongue.</string>
<string name="7383">Foul thing! Me not listen to your words!</string>
<string name="7384">I tell you I am not Karlat!</string>
<string name="7385">But me not Karlat!</string>
<string name="7386">Divination?</string>
<string name="7387">Divi-whasis?</string>
<string name="7388">I will not speak, demon! I will destroy you!</string>
<string name="7389">Me say nothing, demon! Me destroy you!</string>
<string name="7390">Tell me of my past. What I did to get here.</string>
<string name="7391">Talk of past for me.</string>
<string name="7392">What could go wrong in my transformation?</string>
<string name="7393">What might go bad when me change?</string>
<string name="7394">What happens if I become a lich?</string>
<string name="7395">What happens if me become lich?</string>
<string name="7396">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7397">What do you know of the Cult of the Old Ones?</string>
<string name="7398">What you know of Old One cult?</string>
<string name="7399">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7400">I am here, Karlat. Speak to Gathoth. Do not keep me waiting.</string>
<string name="7401">What form do you take now, Karlat? You do not look at all like yourself, but then, you have not summoned me in quite some time.</string>
<string name="7402">Well, your intelligence has dropped considerably since we last spoke, especially if you think a masquerade will void our deal.</string>
<string name="7403">We&apos;ve been through this before, Karlat. No masquerade will void our deal. You are Karlat, and I am here to serve, for now.</string>
<string name="7404">Will you waste further time, or are my divination powers to go unused this day? This summoning should have purpose.</string>
<string name="7405">Karlat, whatever form you may be in, I am still beyond the meager charms your fellow mortals might claim you have.</string>
<string name="7406">It would appear, Karlat, that this new form of yours is a bit too tight in the head. Your words puzzle me no end.</string>
<string name="7407">An impatient one. Please, Karlat, don&apos;t try to bypass our association with your disguises or feigned memory lapses. It doesn&apos;t suit you.</string>
<string name="7408">If that is your wish, you may be whomever you like. I take my leave, though I will still count this visit toward the debt I am owed.</string>
<string name="7409">Take care, Karlat. Even a lich has limits.</string>
<string name="7410">Really, Karlat, your memory does not serve you well. I divine information in exchange for certain services later. That is the deal.</string>
<string name="7411">And what would that serve? I am bound to this circle; an easy target. Perhaps you would come closer and give me a fighting chance?</string>
<string name="7412">The circle! The circle is broken! Free to rend these mortals! FREE!!!</string>
<string name="7413">Bah! Pose your questions for divination or dismiss me back to my home. Either way, stop wasting my time!</string>
<string name="7414">Really, Karlat, you should keep better records, though I suppose I cannot fault your mortal mind from failing after all these years.</string>
<string name="7415">Where to begin... a highwayman in Sembia... a petty lord in Cormyr, and a would-be lich with your personal stable of peasants here in Charwood.</string>
<string name="7416">Unremarkable, though the spells you have woven certainly produced some effects that are out of the ordinary.</string>
<string name="7417">You die, and are reborn as undead. At least, that is what would happen had this all gone as you originally planned.</string>
<string name="7418">Now, the spells that sustain this strange existence in Charwood would likely expire. What effect that might have... I don&apos;t know.</string>
<string name="7419">Such are the risks of the transformation you have chosen. Circumstances have made this situation... very unstable.</string>
<string name="7420">There are risks... Once your soul is contained within a phylactery, that vessel is your true body. Destroy it, and you cease to be.</string>
<string name="7421">You of course created a very strong one, but even that is not enough. It might be sanctified somehow, which would deal you grievous harm.</string>
<string name="7422">Really, Karlat, I&apos;m not sure how much safety you expect in a procedure that *begins* with your death.</string>
<string name="7423">As you will, &quot;Karlat.&quot; It has been interesting serving under you.</string>
<string name="7424">You have no cause to know that... unless... Very well, &quot;Karlat,&quot; I will say what I know. They follow the oldest of creatures. The Creators.</string>
<string name="7425">Older than the memories of demons, and even some gods as well, they will come from the north to take back what time has stolen.</string>
<string name="7426">Fear them &quot;Karlat.&quot; You will not have to search for them in the end. They will find you. With that, I leave you, false summoner.</string>
<string name="7427">Yes, goodbye &quot;Karlat.&quot; If my words negatively affect your rise as a lich, you have may appologies. It is not my intention to betray.</string>
<string name="7428">Indeed, our deal specifically states that I am prevented from harming the man called Karlat in any *direct* fashion. Hmm... hehe... heh... </string>
<string name="7429">TO THE PITS!! TO THE PITS WITH THE DAMN SUMMONER KARLAT! SCREEEEEEEEE!!!!!</string>
<string name="7430">I WILL NOT SERVE, WHATEVER YOU LOOK LIKE, I WILL NOT SERVE!! YOU CAN&apos;T JUST CALL ME HERE!!!</string>
<string name="7431">DEAL WAS DONE, DEAL WAS DONE! I WILL NOT SERVE!!!! SKREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!</string>
<string name="7432">COME CLOSER AND DIE, DIE, DIE!!!!!!!!</string>
<string name="7433">REND YOU IN THE PITS, KARLAT! REND YOU IN THE PITS!!!!!</string>
<string name="7434">NO HOPE FOR YOU IF YOU GET CLOSE TO ME, KARLAT!!! RIP OUT YOUR SPINE!!!! SKREEEEEEEEEEE!!!!</string>
<string name="7435">CIRCLE BROKEN!! CIRCLE FOULED!! FREE TO REND YOUR SPINE!!!! SCKREEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!</string>
<string name="7436">I would never deal with a creature such as you!</string>
<string name="7437">Me not deal with your kind!</string>
<string name="7438">I&apos;m listening.</string>
<string name="7439">Me listen.</string>
<string name="7440">Are you desperate? Do you fear me that much?</string>
<string name="7441">Maybe you desperate. Maybe you fear me.</string>
<string name="7442">And what would putting it on the altar do?</string>
<string name="7443">What putting it on altar thing do?</string>
<string name="7444">Are you trying to trick me?</string>
<string name="7445">You try to trick me?</string>
<string name="7446">I could just threaten you for those things now.</string>
<string name="7447">Maybe me just threaten you for them now.</string>
<string name="7448">I honestly agree, even though it is evil.</string>
<string name="7449">Me honestly agree, even if it&apos;s real evil.</string>
<string name="7450">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; I agree to your terms.</string>
<string name="7451">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Me agree to do this.</string>
<string name="7452">I have a bargain to make with whosoever holds my Phylactery. Speak to me, and let us make a deal.</string>
<string name="7453">Greetings. You will forgive me if I do not waste time on you. I will speak to the one that holds my phylactery, and no other.</string>
<string name="7454">I would suggest that you not get violent about it. I will simply reform, and we will have to go through all of this again. Pointless, really.</string>
<string name="7455">Ahh, there is my Phylactery. It does look comfortable, doesn&apos;t it? Well, perhaps not to you, but you have not been waiting uncountable years.</string>
<string name="7456">I will not waste words. You can do me a great service, and I will be generous in return. Do you wish to bargain?</string>
<string name="7457">Oh, you hurt me. You may do as you will, but I warn you, there will be a price. I have not been idle these long years.</string>
<string name="7458">My imprisonment will unleash the hells upon you. I will not go quietly. I think it best if you simply walk away.</string>
<string name="7459">Hardly. While I lack the power and mobility of a fully formed lich, I have gained the patience of the undead.</string>
<string name="7460">There will be others. You were not the first. In fact... perhaps those others would be of interest to you. I know a few things.</string>
<string name="7461">There&apos;s a good &lt;boy/girl&gt;. No harm in talk, is there? No. Listen to me, and understand my situation.</string>
<string name="7462">You possess the vessel that is to hold my soul. My son Quint ruined my transformation to lich and damned us all, but there is a way out.</string>
<string name="7463">If you agree, I will enter that container voluntarily, on the condition that you not sanctify it. Instead, you will place it on the altar in my summoning circle.</string>
<string name="7464">Heavens, no. I am quite serious. Agree to place my phylactery on that altar and I will reward you handsomely. I have much more than gold... </string>
<string name="7465">Oh, nothing much. You need only concern yourself with doing it. I woud be most generous afterward. I have things in the ether, trapped with me. </string>
<string name="7466">I also have information. You seek a group... I know things. Tell me if you agree. Do not lie. I can tell if you lie.</string>
<string name="7467">Fool! You could attack me, but like everyone else trapped here, I would simply reform if defeated. What threat is there in that?</string>
<string name="7468">You would just use up your resources in a pointless battle. There are far easier ways for us to reach an agreement.</string>
<string name="7469">Do not break our bargain. If I sense you removing the phylactery from this level, I will unleash a great violence. I promise it.</string>
<string name="7470">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes... yes I believe you. The living are so easy to read. I would have heard the slightest hesitation in your voice.</string>
<string name="7471">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; That was foolish. You cannot lie to me. The living are an open book, and I have opened many.</string>
<string name="7472">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You truly are stupid to think I wouldn&apos;t see through your pathetic ruse. The living are an open book, and I&apos;ve opened many.</string>
<string name="7473">The face or name is unimportant. All I know is that you hold my Phylactery, and I will extend my offer to you just as I did before.</string>
<string name="7474">Agree to place my vessel on the altar in the summoning circle and I will enter it willingly. Do not lie. I can tell if you are lying.</string>
<string name="7475">I choose an &quot;Item.&quot;</string>
<string name="7476">Me choose &quot;Item.&quot;</string>
<string name="7477">I choose an &quot;Item.&quot;</string>
<string name="7478">Me choose &quot;Item.&quot;</string>
<string name="7479">I choose an &quot;Item.&quot;</string>
<string name="7480">Me choose &quot;Item.&quot;</string>
<string name="7481">I was wrong to bargain! I&apos;ll kill you!</string>
<string name="7482">Me wrong to make bargain! Me kill you!</string>
<string name="7483">I have a reward for you. Speak with me, and we shall settle my debt.</string>
<string name="7484">Listen well to me, and do not walk away. If you refuse to speak with me, I will consider my debt paid and leave.</string>
<string name="7485">You have freed me, completed the spell I began so many years ago, and secured the doom of Charwood at long last. I am in your debt.</string>
<string name="7486">I will reward you with the item of your choice, be it *ITEM*, *ITEM*, or *ITEM*. You will also have information.</string>
<string name="7487">No, no I think you won&apos;t. You are no longer worth my time. If you wish to forfeit your reward, so be it. I take my leave.</string>
<string name="7488">Our deal is fulfilled, save one matter. You came this way seeking something... a cult... I know of them. You likely saw one driven mad in Charwood.</string>
<string name="7489">A few of them came here. I don&apos;t know why, but I know where they came from. Luskan. Look to Luskan... but... </string>
<string name="7490">Before I was imprisoned, I knew that there are things even I should leave alone. Others have not been as wise. Be wary.</string>
<string name="7491">I will not risk my new form on you! Test my pets, but I will have none of this!</string>
<string name="7492">Road to Charwood.</string>
<string name="7493">Make me more powerful by your magic!</string>
<string name="7494">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I require the assistance of a magic item!</string>
<string name="7495">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I command you to give me an item of the greatest power!</string>
<string name="7496">I come as the Judge and demand only answers.</string>
<string name="7497">Uh, you make me big and tuff!</string>
<string name="7498">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Uh, me need a... a magic thingy!</string>
<string name="7499">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me need a magic thingy. Somethin&apos; of great power!</string>
<string name="7500">Me be da Judge-guy. Me only want answers.</string>
<string name="7501">Then tell me the tale of the brothers Jhareg... </string>
<string name="7502">What charade do you speak of?</string>
<string name="7503">Were you a witness or a participant in this crime?</string>
<string name="7504">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; You&apos;re trapped here too, aren&apos;t you... </string>
<string name="7505">You tell me &apos;bout da Jharegs... </string>
<string name="7506">&quot;Charade?&quot; What this you speak of?</string>
<string name="7507">Did you do this crime or only watch?</string>
<string name="7508">Argue your guilt or innocence while you still can... </string>
<string name="7509">You be guilty of da crime here? Yes or no?</string>
<string name="7510">Tell me more... </string>
<string name="7511">Get to the point.</string>
<string name="7512">Ooh, you talk more... </string>
<string name="7513">You got point? Get to it.</string>
<string name="7514">Then it was you behind the slaughter!?</string>
<string name="7515">But why did you do this?</string>
<string name="7516">Why are you telling me this so openly?</string>
<string name="7517">Will you give this as your written oath?</string>
<string name="7518">Huh? You was behind da slaughter!?</string>
<string name="7519">How come you do all this?</string>
<string name="7520">Why you be so honest, all of sudden?</string>
<string name="7521">You gives this as written oath, yuh?</string>
<string name="7522">Foolish mortal, you have forgotten to cast your protection charm! Belial shall rule!</string>
<string name="7523">Speak quickly &lt;race&gt; fool. Your magic protections will not last long in this place. What do you require of the Fire Lord?</string>
<string name="7524">Karlat, is that you?... Wait! What do you want of Belial, mortal?</string>
<string name="7525">The bargain has been fulfilled. Perhaps next time, I&apos;ll summon you... </string>
<string name="7526">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Your will commands me... Take it and be done with me.</string>
<string name="7527">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; To you I shall give a gift of an entirely different sort... </string>
<string name="7528">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I had my reasons for giving it to him then. For you, I see no such advantage. Choose again, and more wisely.</string>
<string name="7529">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Your heart is not strong enough to command me so. Ask something else, for that you shall not receive.</string>
<string name="7530">I was commanded so once before, by the mortal Karlat Jhareg... To him I gave a phylactery where his soul could rest, safe from mortal threat.</string>
<string name="7531">You, fleshling? You are the Judge? Then my charade is over for you command me as none other has before... </string>
<string name="7532">Yes, my Judge. I had not bargained on Lathander&apos;s intervention in my dealings with the wizard. Like the ghosts and mortals, I am bound unto this place... </string>
<string name="7533">All of us are guilty, my Judge, and all are innocent save one... That one is I.</string>
<string name="7534">I am Belial, prince of demons! Did you believe that such a simple spell would summon me? No, I answered Karlat Jhareg&apos;s call for my own reasons, Judge... </string>
<string name="7535">Where does the crime begin? Where does it end? A crime is not an event! It is a thread that must be followed through the weave... </string>
<string name="7536">Let the brothers tell their own tales, Judge. I am here to tell my own... </string>
<string name="7537">You see, it was I who first planted the seed of slaughter in Karlat&apos;s mind. He was but a weapon and it was my hand that controlled him.</string>
<string name="7538">Quint was a weapon of a weapon, a servant&apos;s slave. It was he who brought the children in and Karlat who cast the spell that killed them... </string>
<string name="7539">It was I, alone, who stayed silent in the knowledge that the slaughter held no meaning. Karlat&apos;s ritual did not require it... but I chose to tell him otherwise...</string>
<string name="7540">I am Belial, Prince of Demons, Lord of Fire, Scourge of the Abyssal Depths... Were you ever fool enough to expect another?</string>
<string name="7541">Thus is the nature of demons, Judge. Why is there needless suffering in the world? Why is there injustice and strife and tyranny? It is because of us... </string>
<string name="7542">For one, Lathander has bound all within this castle to heed the Judge&apos;s will.</string>
<string name="7543">For another, how do you intend to punish a demon? The Abyss is home to me and I long to walk once more upon its sea of flames.</string>
<string name="7544">If it means an end to my accursed bondage in this place, then I will gladly give it... There, take it and make of it what you will.</string>
<string name="7545">Very well. Quint gathered the children and Karlat killed them... But it was I who told Karlat the deed was required, though I knew it was not.</string>
<string name="7546">&lt;StartAction&gt;Read the book... &lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7547">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave... &lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7548">&lt;StartAction&gt;Continue reading... &lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7549">&lt;StartAction&gt;Continue reading... &lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7550">&lt;StartAction&gt;Continue reading... &lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7551">&lt;StartAction&gt;Continue reading... &lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="7552">By the dim light of the candelabra, you can decipher the book&apos;s ragged text... </string>
<string name="7553">&quot;My research into the summoning of the demon Belial, Lord of Fire, continues. It is rugged work and my robes are little more than ashen rags as a result...&quot;</string>
<string name="7554">&quot;I must persevere, however, for only Belial knows of the phylactery I seek, a vessel that only the gods have power to destroy...&quot;</string>
<string name="7555">&quot;Yes, Belial is the Lord of Fire so, aside from the customary casting of Protection from Evil, it shall also take fire to summon him. I am sure that the belly of the fire beetle is the proper reagent, but what spell?&quot;</string>
<string name="7556">&quot;I have cast every high-level fire spell there is upon that brazier, to no effect! I have tried even those of mid-level, and there is nothing!&quot;</string>
<string name="7557">&quot;There is but one fire spell left of all those known but that can&apos;t be it! I haven&apos;t cast since I was a mischievous child! Still, I must try... &quot;</string>
<string name="7558">And what if I do?</string>
<string name="7559">What&apos;s it to you?</string>
<string name="7560">I take offense to that.</string>
<string name="7561">What if me do?</string>
<string name="7562">What you care?</string>
<string name="7563">Me not like what you say!</string>
<string name="7564">I would like to see what you have to offer.</string>
<string name="7565">I&apos;d like to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="7566">Me want see your stuff.</string>
<string name="7567">Me want ask you questions.</string>
<string name="7568">No thanks.</string>
<string name="7569">What&apos;s going on around here?</string>
<string name="7570">I need some directions.</string>
<string name="7571">What be goin&apos; on &apos;round here?</string>
<string name="7572">Me need you tell me where stuff be.</string>
<string name="7573">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="7574">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="7575"></string>

<string name="7577"></string>
<string name="7578">I just wanted to make you say it.</string>
<string name="7579">Me just want make you say it. Heh, heh.</string>

<string name="7583">In that case, I&apos;m yer go-to guy! I&apos;ve got the goods to make yer life easier.</string>
<string name="7584">It&apos;s just my business to notice these sorts of things. Ya might be in need of some helpful items.</string>

<string name="7587">Well, I&apos;ll tell ya what I can.</string>
<string name="7588">If ya need something, come to me, ya hear?</string>
<string name="7589">Not much. The ships come in. I have certain arrangements to procure certain types of goods. Very good stuff if ya know what I mean.</string>
<string name="7590">Do I have to spell it out? I&apos;m a smuggler. I bring in stolen property and sell it here in town. I mean look at my clothes! Obviously a smuggler! Cripes, but you&apos;re dense.</string>
<string name="7591">Yeah, thanks. Everyone&apos;s a jester.</string>
<string name="7592">But look, I have other customers, so are ya plannin&apos; to buy or not?</string>
<string name="7593">What do I look like, a bleedin&apos; map or somethin&apos;? I&apos;ve got customers waitin&apos; on some special goods, so are ya gonna place an order or not?</string>
<string name="7594">What&apos;s so dangerous about this area?</string>
<string name="7595">Where&apos;s the nearest inn?</string>
<string name="7596">Can you tell me the way to Luskan?</string>
<string name="7597">I&apos;ll be on my way.</string>
<string name="7598"></string>
<string name="7599">Why this area is dangerous, huh?</string>
<string name="7600">Me just wants find inn.</string>
<string name="7601">Me looks for Luskan. Is this way?</string>
<string name="7602">Me go now.</string>
<string name="7603"></string>
<string name="7604"></string>
<string name="7605"></string>
<string name="7606"></string>
<string name="7607"></string>
<string name="7608"></string>
<string name="7609"></string>
<string name="7610">The monster&apos;s leader, Dergiab, is dead. I have his head.</string>
<string name="7611">Me killed monster leader, Dergiab. Me got it head.</string>
<string name="7612">I have Leah&apos;s ring right here. She&apos;s dead.</string>
<string name="7613">Me gots Leah ring. She be dead.</string>
<string name="7614">The monster&apos;s leader is dead. I have his head.</string>
<string name="7615">Me killed monster leader. Me got head.</string>
<string name="7616">I&apos;ll be on my way.</string>
<string name="7617">Me go now. Bye.</string>
<string name="7618">It will do.</string>
<string name="7619">It do fine.</string>
<string name="7620">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I think killing Dergiab is worth a bit larger reward, no?</string>
<string name="7621">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Dergiab not easy kill. Me earns more, no?</string>
<string name="7622">I might have to rough you up and see what else you got in there.</string>
<string name="7623">Me thinking you gots more gold... Maybe me shake you up and looks.</string>
<string name="7624">No gold is necessary. I just wanted to let you know the deed was done.</string>
<string name="7625">Me no needs gold. Me just want to tell you Dergiab dead.</string>
<string name="7626">I see Leah made it back safely.</string>
<string name="7627">Me sees wife makes it back okay.</string>
<string name="7628">Nothing yet.</string>
<string name="7629">Me has no news yet.</string>
<string name="7630">I have some questions.</string>
<string name="7631">Me have questions.</string>
<string name="7632">Could you give me some directions?</string>
<string name="7633">Me want directions, please.</string>
<string name="7634">Hello, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. You best be careful treadin&apos; the road &apos;round these parts. A dangerous place, these days. Listen to old Gerrol.</string>
<string name="7635">The hills in this area are home to creatures of all sorts... bugbears, goblins and the like. Normally they don&apos;t trouble us much. Since Luskan stopped patrolling the area, mind you, they&apos;ve become plenty brave.</string>
<string name="7636"></string>
<string name="7637"></string>
<string name="7638"></string>
<string name="7639"></string>
<string name="7640">A pleasure meeting you. Good luck in your travels.</string>
<string name="7641">It&apos;s not much farther to the north, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Just keep on the road an&apos; you&apos;ll find it, sure enough.</string>
<string name="7642">Well, the closest inn would the Alliance Arms Inn in Port Llast. That shouldn&apos;t take you too much time to get to.</string>
<string name="7643">Most pleased to see you again, friend. Things are just about to right with Leah&apos;s return to the farm. To think, I thought her dead for sure.</string>
<string name="7644">I&apos;ll be forever grateful for what you&apos;ve done for the area, too. It&apos;s safe once more. You and yours are always welcome at our humble farm.</string>
<string name="7645">Well, hello to you. Were you the one I told about them monsters bothering us around here - the ones who took my wife, Leah? Do you bring word?</string>
<string name="7646">Hello, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I&apos;d warn you to be careful of danger near these roads. You look like you can handle yourself but better safe than sorry. Listen to old Gerrol, then and watch out.</string>
<string name="7647"></string>
<string name="7648"></string>
<string name="7649">Other than that, the only inn I can think of would be the Green Griffon Inn outside of Luskan, to the north past the hills.</string>
<string name="7650"></string>
<string name="7651"></string>
<string name="7652"></string>
<string name="7653"></string>
<string name="7654"></string>
<string name="7655">That is a relief, then, to be sure. We&apos;ll have none of his terrorizing anyone else in these parts. Thank you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;... I hope this bit of gold will do as a reward.</string>
<string name="7656">That she did. She has returned safe and sound, which is more than I even thought possible. Thank you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;... I shall be forever grateful. I hope this bit of gold will do as a reward?</string>
<string name="7657">Most pleased to see you again, friend. Things are just about to right with Leah&apos;s return to the farm. To think, I thought her dead for sure.</string>
<string name="7658">Things are just about right... but not quite. The area is still unsafe so long as Dergiab is still about.</string>
<string name="7659">May the gods bless you and look after you then, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="7660">And here I thought things would be safer with the monsters gone. Sigh... fair enough. It may be a bit greedy of you, but it&apos;s not like you didn&apos;t earn it.</string>
<string name="7661">It is the least I could do.</string>
<string name="7662">Most pleased to see you again, friend. Things seem a lot safer around here, but I do miss Leah dearly.</string>
<string name="7663">That is very kind of you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. It is good to know that adventurers like you still exist.</string>
<string name="7664">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well... while I doubt any gold I might have would compare with what the ogre mage, himself, had, I did send you that way. This is all the extra I can spare.</string>
<string name="7665">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I imagine you got plenty from Dergiab, himself, no? I would love to give you more... I just can&apos;t spare it.</string>
<string name="7666">Ah. I... I had thought as much. I suppose it is good to know, at least, though it will be difficult to tell the boy.</string>
<string name="7667">Well, come and see me when you have something to tell me. Be careful! This area is dangerous.</string>
<string name="7668">Hello. It&apos;s been mighty sad around here since you&apos;ve confirmed the worst. My wife is dead. How go things with the monsters that killed her?</string>
<string name="7669">I suppose so. What are you looking for?</string>
<string name="7670"></string>
<string name="7671"></string>
<string name="7672"></string>
<string name="7673"></string>
<string name="7674"></string>
<string name="7675"></string>
<string name="7676">I spoke with your husband, Leah. He thinks that you&apos;re dead.</string>
<string name="7677">All right. It should be safe for you to get out of here, Leah.</string>
<string name="7678">I didn&apos;t expect to find any prisoners. Can you get out on your own?</string>
<string name="7679">I&apos;ll go make sure it&apos;s safe. Can you wait here? I&apos;ll come back.</string>
<string name="7680">Me knows you husband. He think you Leah is dead.</string>
<string name="7681">Me killed lots of things, so be safe for you to go. Yuh, Leah?</string>
<string name="7682">Me not realize you is here. You make own way out?</string>
<string name="7683">Um... me go kill stuff, then come back. You go later, yuh?</string>
<string name="7684">Of course. I&apos;ll lead you to the exit. It&apos;ll be safe from there.</string>
<string name="7685">Yes. Just follow the trail of carnage and you&apos;ll be fine.</string>
<string name="7686">You be safe, if you be fast and quiet.</string>
<string name="7687">Who are you?</string>
<string name="7688">Who you is? Huh?</string>
<string name="7689">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7690">Me can help you. Take to exit, yuh? Away from monsters?</string>
<string name="7691">Leah! I need to ask you some questions.</string>
<string name="7692">You is Leah? Me got question for you.</string>
<string name="7693">What can you tell me of these caves?</string>
<string name="7694">What me can gets told of caves?</string>
<string name="7695">Why did the monsters kidnap you?</string>
<string name="7696">Why monsters take you, not kill you instead?</string>
<string name="7697">You should get out of here now.</string>
<string name="7698">Me thinks you should get out now, yuh?</string>
<string name="7699">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; I hate to keep asking questions, but did they mention anything?</string>
<string name="7700">Oh? Over here! Oh, thank the - I thought I was going to die. Everytime they came close to me, their foul smells - I was so scared.</string>
<string name="7701">You&apos;re not one of the monsters, are you? Oh, when will this all end? I just want to be free of here.</string>
<string name="7702">Please, stay back. I haven&apos;t done a thing. I&apos;ve been too scared to even breathe! Don&apos;t hurt me! I... </string>
<string name="7703">He does? He - oh... this has been so horrible. I just want to go home. Will you help me escape?</string>
<string name="7704">I... I suppose I could, yes. You did kill the monsters that were guarding me, right?</string>
<string name="7705">You want me to... wait here? In this place? I guess I have no choice in the matter, but please hurry back! Please... </string>
<string name="7706">Thank you so much, kind &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I wish I could show you my appreciation. Please come and visit me and my husband when you are done here.</string>
<string name="7707">I know we&apos;ll make it out of here. Thank you for bringing hope to me.</string>
<string name="7708">Thank you so much for all you have done!</string>
<string name="7709">Leah. My name is Leah. I was working on the farm when I was attacked by those beasts. They kidnapped me, and - oh... </string>
<string name="7710">Please, don&apos;t go! I don&apos;t want to be left in here, not alone... I&apos;m so scared. It&apos;s so dark... </string>
<string name="7711">Oh? What kind of questions? What did you want to ask?</string>
<string name="7712"></string>
<string name="7713">They just wanted to use me for some menial labor, it would seem. Nothing too heavy or exhausting, really. Though it didn&apos;t make this any easier on me... </string>
<string name="7714">Just to do some menial labor, it would seem. Nothing too heavy or exhausting, really. Though it didn&apos;t make this any easier on me... </string>
<string name="7715">I don&apos;t really know... it&apos;s pretty dark in here and I haven&apos;t been able to see too much. They generally just screamed at me and kept me in here.</string>
<string name="7716">Every once in a while, they would drag me out and force me to do something for them: menial labor, for the most part.</string>
<string name="7717">When I finished the cooking, stitching, what have you, they&apos;d throw me back in here.</string>
<string name="7718">I&apos;ve been sick, exhausted, hungry... I can&apos;t sleep anywhere, and I just want to get back to my husband.</string>
<string name="7719">Um... come to think of it... they mentioned something about their &quot;master.&quot; It was more like a threat to them, though, to keep them in line.</string>
<string name="7720">It was as if the truly heroic monsters would be rewarded by this monster some how. Well, that&apos;s the impression that I got from it.</string>
<string name="7721">(sob) I miss my family!</string>
<string name="7722">Please! Don&apos;t leave me here again, I beg of you. My name is Leah. My husband must be so worried!</string>
<string name="7723">To the Port Llast Mines.</string>
<string name="7724">The Port Llast Mine has been closed for many years, its vein of ore long since extinguished.</string>
<string name="7725">East: Neverwinter Wood. South: Port Llast. North: Green Griffon Inn and Luskan.</string>
<string name="7726"></string>
<string name="7727"></string>
<string name="7728">We kills you good for the Master!!</string>
<string name="7729">Let me ask you some questions first.</string>
<string name="7730">Me can ask question first?</string>
<string name="7731">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I accept your surrender, if the other goblins stop fighting me.</string>
<string name="7732">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me says surrender okay, if no goblins is fighting me.</string>
<string name="7733">I can&apos;t accept your surrender unless I get something out of it.</string>
<string name="7734">Me listen to offer. Me gets something, yuh?</string>
<string name="7735">Actually, I enjoy killing goblins. No deal.</string>
<string name="7736">Me likes goblin-killing too much. No deals!</string>
<string name="7737">Then I guess I&apos;ll have to kill you.</string>
<string name="7738">Me can kill you then. No problems.</string>
<string name="7739">Bye.</string>
<string name="7740">Tell me about these caves.</string>
<string name="7741">Me wants knowing what goes on in cave.</string>
<string name="7742">Where is your chieftain?</string>
<string name="7743">Where you chieftain is?</string>
<string name="7744">Master? Who&apos;s your master? Your chieftain?</string>
<string name="7745">You chieftain is master, yuh?</string>
<string name="7746">I need more than that if I&apos;m not to kill you.</string>
<string name="7747">Me needs more or me kills you.</string>
<string name="7748">That&apos;s fine. I accept.</string>
<string name="7749">Me can accept that offer. Me okay.</string>
<string name="7750">We surrender! No hurt. We not want getting killed so much!</string>
<string name="7751">We is told we not fighting with you. So me not talk, neither. You talk to chieftain. </string>

<string name="7801">What can you tell me about the master?</string>
<string name="7802">What you tells me of master?</string>

<string name="7828">Me saying we is not knowing, already. We wants caves back, live without fighting all of time. We just wants left alone, okay?</string>
<string name="7829">Great, giant ogre with powerful magic. Would defeat even you, &lt;race&gt; friend, though you very powerful.</string>

<string name="7851">No, no! You will kill I, I knows! Runs, must I!!</string>
<string name="7852">Chieftain of bugbears has imprisoned I. At order of the master, it was. I speaks against the master.</string>
<string name="7853">The master is large creature, giant maybe. Comes to the tribes in caves, takes strongest of us away. Me not knows why!</string>
<string name="7854">Be following this tunnel out of cell to north. It go a little east, then back south to tunnel down and temple. Master live down there. Never go there, I... not know more.</string>
<string name="7855">Master weakens tribes of caves. Takes strongest to own caves. No one knows why.</string>
<string name="7856">I speaks against master. Master pushes bugbears around. I say bugbears fight master. But master hears all... tells chieftain to send I to prison.</string>
<string name="7857">No, no! &lt;Race&gt; no kill I! Runs, must I!!</string>
<string name="7858">Yes, I goes... I leave this hills far, far behind. Most kind is you... </string>
<string name="7859">No! No! AAAAAGHH!!!</string>
<string name="7860">Who are you?</string>
<string name="7861">Is this an ambush? I&apos;ll not trust you.</string>
<string name="7862">Relax! I work for no one. Just tell me who you are.</string>
<string name="7863">Who you is, eh?</string>
<string name="7864">Me not likes trick. You move slow!</string>
<string name="7865">Me says stop yammering! Me wanting know name.</string>
<string name="7866">How do I know you&apos;re actually a prisoner, that this isn&apos;t some ruse?</string>
<string name="7867">You tell me some stuff, and maybe I&apos;ll let you go.</string>
<string name="7868">Can you make it worth my while to free you?</string>
<string name="7869"></string>
<string name="7870">How me know you not trying trick me?</string>
<string name="7871">Me gots questions. You answer, maybe me let go?</string>
<string name="7872">Me gets reward for freeing you?</string>
<string name="7873"></string>
<string name="7874">I don&apos;t buy that. I&apos;m killing you.</string>
<string name="7875">Me not born yesterday. Me born long before! And you die now.</string>
<string name="7876">Fine. Tell me something.</string>
<string name="7877">You&apos;re worthless. Go away.</string>
<string name="7878">Me gets stuff told to? Okay. Is good.</string>
<string name="7879">Me says go away. Me not wants you here. Go!</string>
<string name="7880"></string>
<string name="7881"></string>
<string name="7882">Why are you a prisoner here? What&apos;s this war about?</string>
<string name="7883">Can you tell me anything about these caves?</string>
<string name="7884">What can you tell me of the orcs and goblins?</string>
<string name="7885">That&apos;s enough questions. You can go.</string>
<string name="7886">How you gets in prison?</string>
<string name="7887">You tells stuff about prison? To me?</string>
<string name="7888">What you tells of orcs and goblins?</string>
<string name="7889">Me not got more questions. Me got message for you leaving. Go bye!</string>
<string name="7890">I don&apos;t understand what you mean by making strength.</string>
<string name="7891">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Who&apos;s the master?</string>
<string name="7892">Do they have leaders to their tribes?</string>
<string name="7893">What means you making strength? You get big, strong group?</string>
<string name="7894">Orcs and goblins got leaders in caves?</string>
<string name="7895">Army? What do you mean?</string>
<string name="7896">Army? What means you army?</string>
<string name="7897">I&apos;ll kill you now, monster!</string>
<string name="7898">Me kill you!</string>
<string name="7899">Help! Me is prisoner here. You release me, yuh? Or is you working with orc and goblin? Me just want leaving. Not like prisons! Help me! Please, help!</string>
<string name="7900">Me is prisoner of bugbears in this cave! Prisoner from war with orcs and goblins. Me wanting leave, but me is stuck. You help, yeah?</string>
<string name="7901">Me gots no weapons. Me gots no others bugbears. No one is here. You see? Me just wants not being prisoner. Gets back to war with orcs and goblins.</string>
<string name="7902">We not is meaning to make such fool of self, but we is desperate. Long time for we is tortured! Long time we not be in war against orcs and goblins.</string>
<string name="7903">Ah, okay. Me not knows much but prison bars, but we tries answer all questions. We wants out of prison, yeah!</string>
<string name="7904">Me gots no weapons. Me gots no others bugbears. No one is here. You see? Me just wants not being prisoner. Gets back to war with orcs and goblins.</string>
<string name="7905">Me prisoner is. Me gots nothing to give. But me knows stuff. Maybe you wants asking me questions? Me try answer?</string>
<string name="7906"></string>
<string name="7907">We is fighting with orcs and goblins. Gets beat and taken prisoner. Everyone wants pleasing master, so needs beating other forces to make strength.</string>
<string name="7908">Me can tells you that caves is home to orcs, goblins, and us bugbears. We fights so much. Not safe in caves for you outsider.</string>
<string name="7909">Orcs and goblins is everywhere. We bugbears strong, we fights tough. But we never makes advance for long. Too many foes for us.</string>
<string name="7910">If we bugbear is beating orc and goblin, then master is happy with us. Take us for his army. And we be most powerful.</string>
<string name="7911">Dergiab is master. He big ogre, but cast magics, too! He very strong warrior, and kills many who try and take his ruling away.</string>
<string name="7912">Orc chieftain and goblin chieftain in caves. If killed is they, tribes would falls apart. We not know what doing without chieftain. We bugbears got chieftain, too. But we prisoner so long, not knows where.</string>
<string name="7913">Me not lying when me say me not know... proud warriors get taken by master, but we not know where they is go, or why.</string>
<string name="7914"></string>
<string name="7915">Me in prison. You come in, me kill you, then goes back! Come, frees me so me can kill, please master!</string>
<string name="7916">No hurt me! Please!</string>
<string name="7917">Me run! Me run!</string>
<string name="7918">Intruders! Me release the beasties!</string>
<string name="7919">Die, fools!</string>
<string name="7920">Who&apos;s this Dergiab you mention?</string>
<string name="7921">And you look more like a prisoner, to me.</string>
<string name="7922">I could kill you, you know.</string>
<string name="7923">You don&apos;t seem happy to see your rescuer.</string>
<string name="7924">Then leave for the surface, and quickly.</string>
<string name="7925">I&apos;ll not give you the chance to backstab me!</string>
<string name="7926">Answer my questions, and I&apos;ll consider your fate.</string>
<string name="7927">So you&apos;re some kind of prisoner, then?</string>
<string name="7928">I don&apos;t need your help. Go on.</string>
<string name="7929">You had your chance! Prepare to die!</string>
<string name="7930">If you can help me, then do so before I kill you.</string>
<string name="7931">Why would I want to fight him?</string>
<string name="7932">Dergiab was your partner?</string>
<string name="7933">Tell me more about this cult he fell in with.</string>
<string name="7934">I don&apos;t need to hear any more. You&apos;re free to go.</string>
<string name="7935">That&apos;s enough. Time to die!</string>
<string name="7936">What were you recruiting an army for and how big has it gotten?</string>
<string name="7937">Tell me more about this cultist.</string>
<string name="7938">Do you know what purpose the cult wanted the army for?</string>
<string name="7939">You is prisoner? Ha!</string>
<string name="7940">What is Dergiab? Person?</string>
<string name="7941">What? Me here to rescue you!</string>
<string name="7942">Me can kills you too easy! If me wants!</string>
<string name="7943">Goodbye.</string>
<string name="7944">Bye-bye.</string>
<string name="7945">Why me wants fighting Dergiab?</string>
<string name="7946">Me not stopping you. Go. Leave.</string>
<string name="7947">If you answers questions, me let you live. Maybe.</string>
<string name="7948">So you is prisoner here? Why that is?</string>
<string name="7949">Me not like prisoner. Me kill prisoner!</string>
<string name="7950">Me not needs you help. You go.</string>
<string name="7951">If you gots stuff to say, saying it now!</string>
<string name="7952">That it! You say it! Me kill you!</string>
<string name="7953">Me not hear more. You go free.</string>
<string name="7954">Dergiab? Is you partner, yes?</string>
<string name="7955">Tells me on cult Dergiab in.</string>
<string name="7956">What you need army for and how big it is?</string>
<string name="7957">Me want know more of cultist.</string>
<string name="7958">What cult want army for? You know?</string>
<string name="7959">I don&apos;t recognize you. Have you come to finish what Dergiab started? No... you look more like intruders to me.</string>
<string name="7960">Ha! Are you thinking that I&apos;ll believe you actually came here to rescue me instead of simply stumbling across this cell?</string>
<string name="7961">Forgive me if I&apos;m skeptical, but I&apos;ll believe I&apos;m rescued when I taste the fresh air of the surface, not before then.</string>
<string name="7962">No need to make threats. If you have questions, I&apos;ll be more than happy to answer them... I assume you&apos;re here to fight Dergiab, no?</string>
<string name="7963">Well, yes. That&apos;s true. I am a prisoner. Dergiab betrayed me, and threw me in here when I was no longer of use to him.</string>
<string name="7964">I would have assumed the other denizens of these caves would have filled you in on this by now. The &apos;master&apos; is all they can babble about.</string>
<string name="7965">Dergiab - or &apos;the master&apos;, if you prefer - is an ogre mage of some power... He was also my former partner until he fell in with that cult and betrayed me.</string>
<string name="7966">You&apos;ll let me go just like that? I must warn you, Dergiab is not to be trifled with. I could tell you much that would aid you.</string>
<string name="7967">As I thought! Come at me, then, &lt;race&gt; fool... Let me die fighting!!</string>
<string name="7968">I&apos;ll be glad to leave all this far, far behind. I thank you for releasing me, my &lt;race&gt; friend. We won&apos;t meet again.</string>
<string name="7969">Is there any other reason for you to be down here? Dergiab still has our small army, after all, and likely lots of treasure.</string>
<string name="7970">He was. At least he was until he went away and came back with that cultist. Before that, we recruited our army together.</string>
<string name="7971">Hmph? For what else? To gain power. We wanted to do the same as Sythsillis down in Amn! Maybe even raid Luskan...</string>
<string name="7972">There aren&apos;t many soldiers, yet. I was insistent on picking only the best of the bugbears, orcs and goblins in these caves... and that&apos;s slim pickings.</string>
<string name="7973">I don&apos;t know much about it. Dergiab came back from one of his outings with a cultist beside him. He claimed there had been a change of plans.</string>
<string name="7974">Dergiab only listened to the cultist after that. Said he was preparing the army for some different purpose, something greater.</string>
<string name="7975">I objected, naturally. Foolishly, as it turns out, seeing as where it got me.</string>
<string name="7976">His name&apos;s Ganon. He&apos;s an assassin or rogue or somesuch thing. I never spoke to him much, so I couldn&apos;t tell you more.</string>
<string name="7977">No. Dergiab would only say that they needed the forces for the &quot;Return,&quot; whatever that means. The cultist wouldn&apos;t elaborate, at least, not to me.</string>
<string name="7978">I&apos;ll be here. Heck, I couldn&apos;t go anywhere if I wanted to...</string>
<string name="7979">Back again? Have you decided to finish off what Dergiab has started, after all?</string>
<string name="7980">Why are the gates closed?</string>
<string name="7981">Let me through the gates... now.</string>
<string name="7982">All right, I&apos;ll be going.</string>
<string name="7983">But the plague in Neverwinter has been cured.</string>
<string name="7984">I&apos;m sure there&apos;s some way to get inside the city.</string>
<string name="7985">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Perhaps I can help the city.</string>
<string name="7986">How about an offer, for the &quot;city,&quot; of 100 gold?</string>
<string name="7987">Why is closed? Me no come in?</string>
<string name="7988">You lets me through gate now!</string>
<string name="7989">Oh. Okay. Bye.</string>
<string name="7990">Is no more plague in Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="7991">Me figures out other way into city.</string>
<string name="7992">What sorts of &quot;internal problems?&quot;</string>
<string name="7993">Whats mean &quot;internal problems?&quot;</string>
<string name="7994">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Let me in, maybe me helps somehow?</string>
<string name="7995">Me gots 100 gold to help &quot;city&quot; out, yuh?</string>
<string name="7996">Best be turning back, traveler. Luskan&apos;s gates are closed.</string>
<string name="7997">The Green Griffon is a good place to wait out the situation. Good day, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="7998">Is that supposed to be some kind of threat? Even if you cut us down, they still won&apos;t open the gates for you, fool.</string>
<string name="7999">The gates are closed to make certain that the plague in Neverwinter doesn&apos;t spread to Luskan, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Can&apos;t be too careful.</string>
<string name="8000">Ha! Whether you speak the truth or not, we would not so easily open up our doors. We are many things but gullible isn&apos;t one of them.</string>
<string name="8001">Listen, why are you continuing down this line of questioning? Luskan isn&apos;t a safe city, there&apos;s plague looming all around us. Need you more information than that?</string>
<string name="8002">But rest assured, things will return to normal sooner or later. The gates will be open, and you may enter into Luskan then.</string>
<string name="8003">You&apos;re welcome to look, though I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find our city to be quite heavily fortified. I doubt a rat could get through this quarantine.</string>
<string name="8004"></string>
<string name="8005">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I doubt that, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Come back later when the problem has cleared.</string>
<string name="8006">I don&apos;t know how you convinced the sergeant, but if he says it&apos;s okay, go on through. Luskan&apos;s a dangerous place right now, but it&apos;s your neck to risk.</string>
<string name="8007">And get into all sorts of trouble with the sergeant? No thanks, &lt;sir/madam&gt;... the gate&apos;s being too closely watched. Best you just come back when this is all sorted out.</string>
<string name="8008">Listen. You look like a friendly enough &lt;lad/lass&gt;. If you&apos;re stuck for a place to stay, you might want to try the Green Griffon. Farewell.</string>
<string name="8009">You seem a little dirty... Perhaps a stay at the Green Griffon would liven your spirit. At the worst, you&apos;d have a place to stay for now. Farewell.</string>
<string name="8010">Aside from that, there are simply too many internal problems facing Luskan at the moment. You would be better off turning around and going back whence you came.</string>
<string name="8011">*Your* graveyard?</string>
<string name="8012">Who are you?</string>
<string name="8013">I&apos;ll be going.</string>
<string name="8014">Are there many visitors, then?</string>
<string name="8015">It&apos;s a rather small graveyard, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="8016">Er... you&apos;re a loon, you know that?</string>
<string name="8017">And just what sorts or secrets are you talking about?</string>
<string name="8018">What&apos;s the Arcane Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="8019">Oh? And what&apos;s interesting about that?</string>
<string name="8020">Where did they bury him?</string>
<string name="8021">So what&apos;s so interesting about one of them being buried here?</string>
<string name="8022">So where did they bury this wizard?</string>
<string name="8023">You haven&apos;t gone down there?</string>
<string name="8024">How about you give me that key and I&apos;ll go down there?</string>
<string name="8025">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ll give 100 gold, though I&apos;m sure this is a scam.</string>
<string name="8026">All right, then, 200 gold it is.</string>
<string name="8027">How about I take it off your dead body, gnome?</string>
<string name="8028">*Your* graveyard? Me not sees you name on it.</string>
<string name="8029">What you do here?</string>
<string name="8030">Me will go now.</string>
<string name="8031">Why this place so small?</string>
<string name="8032">Oh? You gets visitors?</string>
<string name="8033">Me say you make no sense!</string>
<string name="8034">Mmm... secrets... what kind secret?</string>
<string name="8035">Me not know what is. Arcane Brotherhood?</string>
<string name="8036">Why that good secret?</string>
<string name="8037">Where he buried?</string>
<string name="8038">Why big deal one buried in cemetary?</string>
<string name="8039">Wizard buried where?</string>
<string name="8040">You not find out yourself?</string>
<string name="8041">Me will takes key and gets stuff.</string>
<string name="8042">Me gots 200 gold! You take?</string>
<string name="8043">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me give 50 gold, and you be happy!</string>
<string name="8044">Me killer! Me *take* key from you.</string>
<string name="8045">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; 50 gold, and you can thank me for that.</string>
<string name="8046">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me give 100 gold. Me not trust you more.</string>
<string name="8047">Eh? What&apos;s this? Someone come to disturb my graveyard?</string>
<string name="8048">Yes, *my* graveyard, damn it. You think these old headstones just clean themselves, do you? Ha!</string>
<string name="8049">I take care of all these old stones, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. Keep them nice and shiny for the visitors, oh yes. &apos;Tis my job, you see.</string>
<string name="8050">Yes, well... be careful where you walk around here. Hmph.</string>
<string name="8051">Well... no, not really. Not since they moved the graveyard inside the city walls. As if *anyone* would want to be buried out here where the graverobbers could strip you of your last possessions.</string>
<string name="8052">Well, they moved the graveyard inside the city walls, smarty-pants. Nobody comes out here anymore, not that I mind.</string>
<string name="8053">Oh! But if only they knew! Hee hee! My little graveyard has its secrets, oh yes it does!</string>
<string name="8054">You think so, do you? It so happens that they buried one of the oldest members of the Arcane Brotherhood right here, they did.</string>
<string name="8055">Well... all right, then, listen close. They buried one of the oldest members of the Arcane Brotherhood here. Right here, oh yes.</string>
<string name="8056">What?! You don&apos;t know?! By Garl Glittergold&apos;s shiny arse, what kind of adventurer are you?</string>
<string name="8057">The Arcane Brotherhood is Luskan&apos;s great order of wizards, holed up in the tallest tower in the city! They control Luskan... but that&apos;s a secret, so shush.</string>
<string name="8058">This is very interesting because they carved out a whole tomb underneath the mausoleum! Full of magics and everything... or so I&apos;m told.</string>
<string name="8059">Beneath the mausoleum, of course. My pappy told me the Brotherhood was very specific about the construction and what went in it.</string>
<string name="8060">I&apos;m surprised they&apos;ve forgotten about it. None of them wizards ever visits. I&apos;ve always wondered what goes on down there, myself.</string>
<string name="8061">Oh, no no no! I have the key, of course. There&apos;s just, well, zombies down there and such. They come up from time to time... that&apos;s why I keep the mausoleum under lock and key.</string>
<string name="8062">Let you plunder the tomb? Never! Err... not for less than 200 gold pieces, anyway.</string>
<string name="8063">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. Stealing from a little old gnome, eh? Ahhhh, fine, fine. Go ahead and take it.</string>
<string name="8064">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Not on your life! The wizards entrusted me with, uh, the care of their friend. 200 gold pieces or you go about your business.</string>
<string name="8065">Fair enough. Now git and satisfy your curiosity, damn it. I have work to do.</string>
<string name="8066">What?! A graverobber?! Well, you won&apos;t get the best of me, you whipper-snapper!!</string>
<string name="8067">I&apos;ve got work to do, especially with you messin&apos; up my grounds. Leave me be, damn it.</string>
<string name="8068">Eh? What&apos;s this? Are you one of my dead come back to haunt me in my graveyard?</string>
<string name="8069">Eh? What&apos;s this? Looking so clean as you, I&apos;m left to wonder what you&apos;re doing in my graveyard.</string>
<string name="8070">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. Are you that poor that you can&apos;t afford the... bah. Fine, fine. Go ahead and take it.</string>
<string name="8071">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Not on your life, &lt;race&gt; scum! The wizards entrusted me with, uh, the care of their friend. 200 gold or you go about your business.</string>
<string name="8072">I am not content with your defeat. It is your life that I want!</string>
<string name="8073">I have come for the magic gem that you hold.</string>
<string name="8074">No defeat for you. Death for you!</string>
<string name="8075">Me want you magic gem.</string>
<string name="8076">You are free to go. I&apos;ll find what I&apos;m looking for in your room.</string>
<string name="8077">Me in room now and find gem on own. You go now.</string>
<string name="8078">Enough of this! Die!</string>
<string name="8079">No more. You die!</string>
<string name="8080">Enough lies. Just tell me where the gem is.</string>
<string name="8081">No lie no more. Me just want gem.</string>
<string name="8082">Without the gem, you are useless. I&apos;ll have to kill you now!</string>
<string name="8083">No gem, no live!</string>
<string name="8084">I know that you have the gem. The source was very sure.</string>
<string name="8085">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; Then why are you so carefully guarded and what is in that iron-bound chest?</string>
<string name="8086">Me know you have gem. Guy told me.</string>
<string name="8087">I think not. I have come to take the magic gem that I have been told you carry. Hand it over.</string>
<string name="8088">Nuh uh. Me want magic gem, not bossy lady! Give gem!</string>
<string name="8089">Thief! How dare you!</string>
<string name="8090">Though it shames me to admit it, I am defeated.</string>
<string name="8091">I die with a blade in my hand!</string>
<string name="8092">Gem? I don&apos;t have any gems! What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="8093">Enough! I give up!</string>
<string name="8094">You&apos;re taking the gem!? The shame! I have been outwitted and defeated by some petty adventurer! How can I face my women, now? The shame is too much!</string>
<string name="8095">Your source was lying! I am just a simple woman and have no wealth, let alone magic gems.</string>
<string name="8096">Fine! Take the gem! It is in this chest!</string>
<string name="8097">Please, just let me go now! The shame of defeat will ruin me in the eyes of my women, regardless! I am finished!</string>
<string name="8098">Don&apos;t kill me!! Just take the gem! It is in this chest!</string>
<string name="8099">So, now that my annoying guards are out of earshot, why don&apos;t you come and talk to me, honey?</string>
<string name="8100">Halt! You have but a moment to leave my room before I attack you!</string>
<string name="8101">Now that we&apos;re alone, don&apos;t be shy. Just follow my orders and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll be a happy man in the morning!</string>
<string name="8102">What! This was just a trick to separate me from my guards! I can&apos;t believe that I am at the mercy of a man!</string>
<string name="8103">I&apos;m not in the mood for talk right now. Perhaps later.</string>
<string name="8104">Well now you have what you came for, let me go.</string>
<string name="8105">Destroy the troublemakers! The Return cannot be stopped!</string>
<string name="8106"></string>
<string name="8107"></string>

<string name="8497">That&apos;s quite the lot of cuts you&apos;ve got there. Must have been some fight.</string>
<string name="8498">Where did you get all those wounds?</string>
<string name="8499">Dim-witted folk like yourself better watch you don&apos;t get fast-talked &apos;round here.</string>
<string name="8500">I had a cousin who was like you. A simple fellow but likeable enough.</string>
<string name="8501">I would chat, but I&apos;d probably talk too fast for you.</string>
<string name="8502">Must you brandish that about in here?</string>
<string name="8503">Haven&apos;t you got anything better to do rather than wave that about?</string>
<string name="8504">You know, you should really leave your weapons at the door. Or put them away.</string>
<string name="8505">We don&apos;t get many of you holy folk traveling through these parts.</string>
<string name="8506">Kind of odd to see a holy &lt;man/woman&gt; like yourself in a tavern like this... </string>
<string name="8507">You aren&apos;t heading to Luskan, are you? I was told they shut down all the churches there.</string>
<string name="8508">You know, wizardly folk aren&apos;t generally looked upon with kindness in these parts.</string>
<string name="8509">A magic-user on the road? Are you some kind of adventurer?</string>
<string name="8510">I&apos;ve seen a number of magical folk like you come for the con... uh, that is, nevermind.</string>
<string name="8511">It&apos;s not often I encounter another &lt;race&gt; face in these parts. How do you do?</string>
<string name="8512">It&apos;s always a delight to see another &lt;race&gt; face around here.</string>
<string name="8513">I wouldn&apos;t go into Luskan, if I were you. I hear they&apos;re rounding up everyone of &lt;race&gt; blood and putting them in prison.</string>
<string name="8514">Greetings, lass. You&apos;re a fine-lookin&apos; woman to be in the Green Griffon.</string>
<string name="8515">How about you and I find a private room upstairs, aye?</string>
<string name="8516">If I knew this tavern had women like you about, I&apos;d travel this way more often.</string>
<string name="8517">My, my. Hello there, handsome.</string>
<string name="8518">(sigh) I knew there had to be big, strong men like you somewhere.</string>
<string name="8519">I don&apos;t suppose there&apos;s a chance you&apos;d buy me a drink, handsome?</string>
<string name="8520">I wish I could get into the city. It&apos;s been pleasant enough waiting here, I suppose.</string>
<string name="8521">How do you do, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? Are you waiting for the Luskan gates to open, as well?</string>
<string name="8522">Something you need, &lt;sir/madam&gt;? I&apos;d just as soon be gone once the gates are open.</string>
<string name="8523">Can&apos;t be too careful out on the road. The Luskan guards aren&apos;t patrolling right now... there&apos;s beasts everywhere.</string>
<string name="8524">I don&apos;t have time to talk to the likes of you. I&apos;m just waiting for the city to open back up.</string>
<string name="8525">Get away, you. You could have that plague I&apos;ve heard so much about, for all I know.</string>
<string name="8526">What&apos;s that smell? Oh... it&apos;s one of you northern folk, I see.</string>
<string name="8527">You barbarians do know how to behave yourselves in a tavern, right?</string>
<string name="8528">You&apos;re on your way to Luskan? A barbarian?</string>
<string name="8529">A friend from the &lt;race&gt; lands, is it? What&apos;s with this tavern, anyway?</string>
<string name="8530">Hmph. I hear you &lt;race&gt; folk are what caused that plague in Neverwinter, you know.</string>
<string name="8531">Where I come from, they won&apos;t serve no &lt;race&gt; scum in the taverns.</string>
<string name="8532">And who might you be?</string>
<string name="8533">What competition? What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="8534">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh yeah, I know all about the competition.</string>
<string name="8535">No, I&apos;m not here for any competition.</string>
<string name="8536">Yes, I&apos;m going into the competition.</string>
<string name="8537">I&apos;ll be going.</string>
<string name="8538">And have you won yet?</string>
<string name="8539">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, I know about *that.* I was just hoping for pointers.</string>
<string name="8540">How about 100 gold to loosen your tongue?</string>
<string name="8541">And who is me? Huh? Who is you?</string>
<string name="8542">Me not know what competition you mean.</string>
<string name="8543">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Ha. Me know competition is.</string>
<string name="8544">No, I&apos;m not here for any competition.</string>
<string name="8545">Yes. Me is here to *win* competition.</string>
<string name="8546">Me say time to leave.</string>
<string name="8547">So this is Mutamin&apos;s secret? I&apos;ll ask *him!*</string>
<string name="8548">Mutamin gots secret? Me ask Mutamin!</string>
<string name="8549">But you not win yet, right?</string>
<string name="8550">Ha! I just tricked you! I didn&apos;t know!</string>
<string name="8551">Me tricked you! Me not so dumb! Haha!</string>
<string name="8552">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me know *that* already. Me ask for pointers.</string>
<string name="8553">Me gots money! Gives you 100 gold?</string>
<string name="8554">Hmm? Good day, dear &lt;sir/madam&gt;. You look like you&apos;re here for the competition, same as me.</string>
<string name="8555">The name&apos;s Dydd. My vast intelligence will see me through the competition, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;... and then everyone will know of me.</string>
<string name="8556">Oh. You don&apos;t know? Well, I&apos;m not going to be the one to tell you, then. Mutamin likes to keep it a secret. Oops!</string>
<string name="8557">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmph. I can see through your simple bluff easily. I am far too intelligent to be taken in by mere chicanery, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="8558">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Truly enough. But when I heard about Mutamin&apos;s secret dungeon crawl and the great reward, I just knew my great intelligence would let me win.</string>
<string name="8559">Well... I suspect I&apos;ll head on in soon enough. I *am* planning a brilliant strategy to make it past all the obstacles and traps, after all.</string>
<string name="8560">And I&apos;m *not* sharing any of them with you. Mutamin&apos;s reward is too high to share, so good day to you.</string>
<string name="8561">I see. Well, those of limited intelligence should really stand aside for those of us more gifted. (sniff) I plan on collecting the reward soon enough.</string>
<string name="8562">Ah. Well, I hope for your sake that you&apos;re more intelligent than you seem, my dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. It *is* brains that will bring victory, you know.</string>
<string name="8563">As you wish.</string>
<string name="8564">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Then you show uncanny sense. When I heard about Mutamin&apos;s secret dungeon and the huge reward for the one who passes through it, I knew my brilliance would win out. </string>
<string name="8565">Certainly not. I plan on entering and winning the competition, not on earning Mutamin&apos;s wrath. Good day to you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="8566">I trust I&apos;ll be seeing you again soon enough, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. Until then, please let me strategize.</string>
<string name="8567">It is pointless for you to compete against me, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. My superior intelligence will prevail in the end.</string>
<string name="8568">The name&apos;s Dydd. My vast intelligence will see me through the competition, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;... (or at least past your obvious inferiority) and then everyone will know of me.</string>
<string name="8569">Hmm? Good day, dear &lt;sir/madam&gt;. You look like you&apos;re here for the competition, same as me! Your good looks won&apos;t gain you victory here, you must realize.</string>
<string name="8570">Hmm? Good day, dear &lt;sir/madam&gt;. You look like you&apos;re here for the competition, same as me... Though it would have been nice if you&apos;d bathed first.</string>
<string name="8571">Hey! I&apos;m too busy preparing my strategies. I don&apos;t need you distracting me. Go bother someone else.</string>
<string name="8572">Just wondering who you are.</string>
<string name="8573">You look like an adventurer.</string>
<string name="8574">I&apos;ll be going.</string>
<string name="8575">The competition? What&apos;s that?</string>
<string name="8576">Right, the competition. I don&apos;t think I&apos;d want to risk it.</string>
<string name="8577">I intend to enter the competition, myself, actually.</string>
<string name="8578">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I might be up for a contest. Tell me about it.</string>
<string name="8579">How about 100 gold for you to tell me about it?</string>
<string name="8580">Ah. Well, I wouldn&apos;t be interested in such a thing, then.</string>
<string name="8581">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; My apologies. It&apos;s just something I&apos;d be interested in trying.</string>
<string name="8582">Me just wonders what you name is.</string>
<string name="8583">Is you an adventurer like me is?</string>
<string name="8584">Me go now.</string>
<string name="8585">Me not know. What is competition?</string>
<string name="8586">Oh, right. Me knows that. Me not doing competition, though.</string>
<string name="8587">Me is entering competition!</string>
<string name="8588">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me not know what contest is. You tell me now, okay?</string>
<string name="8589">Me gives 100 gold if you tells me &apos;bout contest.</string>
<string name="8590">Me not care about such thing. No big deal is contest.</string>
<string name="8591">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me sorry. Me just think competition sound fun!</string>
<string name="8592">Yes? Something I can do for you?</string>
<string name="8593">Fair enough.</string>
<string name="8594">Maybe. The name&apos;s Gam and I&apos;m here for the competition, and that should be enough for anyone.</string>
<string name="8595">My name&apos;s Gam, and I&apos;m here for the competition. That should be enough for just about anyone.</string>
<string name="8596">It&apos;s not something I&apos;m free to discuss. As I understand it, it isn&apos;t quite legal in these parts.</string>
<string name="8597">That&apos;s your choice. Me, I intend to take that reward. Anyone with that much money to place as a wager deserves to lose it.</string>
<string name="8598">Is that so? I guess you and I will be running into each other below, then. Good luck to you.</string>
<string name="8599">I&apos;m not interested in your money. Try your coin elsewhere and you&apos;ll likely find freer lips than mine.</string>
<string name="8600">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Hmmm. Well, it does look like something that you&apos;d do, anyway. I suppose there&apos;s no harm in it.</string>
<string name="8601">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; You won&apos;t hear about it from me, friend, as I said. Try someone else.</string>
<string name="8602">No? I find that surprising. Doesn&apos;t truly matter to me, though.</string>
<string name="8603">Mutamin, the owner of this place, is a retired adventurer himself. Quite wealthy, or so I hear.</string>
<string name="8604">Wealthy enough that he&apos;s set up a contest. There&apos;s a dungeon below this place full of traps and monsters... first one through wins the prize.</string>
<string name="8605">But don&apos;t ask me about it. Talk to Mutamin, if you&apos;re interested.</string>
<string name="8606">Just minding my own business, friend.</string>
<string name="8607">May the best man win.</string>
<string name="8608">If... if you could spare some healing, friend, I will tell you what I know of the danger ahead. It... very nearly killed me.</string>
<string name="8609">What... dungeon?</string>
<string name="8610">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Yeah, that&apos;s me: here for the dungeon.</string>
<string name="8611">No, I&apos;m just passing through the area.</string>
<string name="8612">Yes, of course. It should make for an interesting challenge.</string>
<string name="8613">I&apos;ll be going.</string>
<string name="8614">I can handle myself.</string>
<string name="8615">Oh, please. I&apos;ve spit out the likes of you for breakfast.</string>
<string name="8616">That sounds like a horrible contest!</string>
<string name="8617">All right, here. 100 gold.</string>
<string name="8618">Forget it.</string>
<string name="8619">Me gives 100 gold. Me not care.</string>
<string name="8620">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; How about 75 gold?</string>
<string name="8621">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me gots 75 golds enough?</string>
<string name="8622">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; I&apos;ll give you 50.</string>
<string name="8623">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me gives 50 gold?</string>
<string name="8624">You *will* tell me. NOW!</string>
<string name="8625">Me gots big killing story! Make you next!</string>
<string name="8626">Me not pay you moneys.</string>
<string name="8627">You need not worry of me. Me do this.</string>
<string name="8628">Me is tough. Me do this asleep.</string>
<string name="8629">Me not like idea of this at all! Yuckies!</string>
<string name="8630">What... dungeon?</string>
<string name="8631">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me is here for bloody dungeon. Yes, me is... *whistle*</string>
<string name="8632">Me just walk from here to there is all.</string>
<string name="8633">Me think this could be fun for all.</string>
<string name="8634">Time to go bye.</string>
<string name="8635">Aye? I s&apos;pose yer here for the bloody dungeon, too, eh?</string>
<string name="8636">Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just don&apos;t get too drunk or I&apos;ll be pullin&apos; off yer boots for you later. Ha!</string>
<string name="8637">Hmph. &apos;Interesting challenge,&apos; my arse. You knows how many nobles Mutamin charges a fortune to watch us die, eh?</string>
<string name="8638">Well... we&apos;ll jus&apos; see who makes it through an&apos; gets Mutamin&apos;s reward an&apos; who gets gutted fer the pleasure o&apos; a few jaded aristocrats, mm?</string>
<string name="8639">Izzat so? Pardon me if I don&apos;t believe you. A rogue can&apos;t be too careful when he&apos;s about to come into a big reward, ye know.</string>
<string name="8640">What do you know? You don&apos;t know nothin&apos;. Hmph. Pay me a hundred gold an&apos; I&apos;ll tell you what&apos;s what, if yer interested.</string>
<string name="8641">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; One &apos;as to wonder where Mutamin&apos;s been advertisin&apos; his contest. Nobles here from all over the place come to watch us crawl through a dungeon.</string>
<string name="8642">And you an&apos; I both know it&apos;s gonna take a good thief to see all th&apos; traps in there. An&apos; that&apos;s *me*. So ye might as well just be goin&apos; home.</string>
<string name="8643">Har har! Now *that&apos;s* the kind o&apos; spirit I like to hear in a competitor! Har har! Ye&apos;ll never get the reward with that attitude, &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="8644">Have it yer way, &lt;boy/girl&gt;. Best be runnin&apos; home to yer mother, I can hears her teats leakin&apos;.</string>
<string name="8645">Well, y&apos;see the owner there? That&apos;s Mutamin. He&apos;s a former adventurer, an&apos; a successful one, too. Has a lot of gold, so the tale goes.</string>
<string name="8646">He&apos;s put on a contest. There&apos;s a dungeon below this place, filled with monsters and traps. If someone gets through it, they gets the reward.</string>
<string name="8647">It&apos;s all illegal as hades, but the nobles love comin&apos; fer a good watch. Everyone knows a thief will take it, an&apos; that&apos;s *me.* So you should run home, &lt;boy/girl&gt;.</string>
<string name="8648">Git along. I&apos;ve got me own troubles.</string>
<string name="8649">Bah! Yer not good enough by half, &lt;boy/girl&gt;! Ye best not get in me way in yon dungeon, or I&apos;ll treat ye like any other beastie I encounter! Got that?</string>
<string name="8650">Ha! I told ye not to enter the bloody dungeon, fool! An&apos; now I be forced to hack ye down where ye stand. So be it!</string>
<string name="8651"></string>
<string name="8652"></string>
<string name="8653"></string>
<string name="8654">What? Unless I tell you about this dungeon? You wouldn&apos;t dare touch me: not here, not down below. Bugger off already.</string>
<string name="8655">Fun for all, my arse. You knows how many nobles Mutamin charges a fortune to watch us die, eh? </string>
<string name="8656">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, y&apos;see the owner there? &apos;At&apos;s Mutamin. He&apos;s a former adventurer, an&apos; a successful one, too. Has a lot of gold, so the tale goes.</string>
<string name="8657">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; No, I don&apos;t think so. Not for someone like you, at any rate. I wouldn&apos;t bargain with you if I&apos;d get rich off it.</string>
<string name="8658">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, y&apos;see the owner there? That&apos;s Mutamin. He&apos;s a former adventurer, an&apos; a successful one, too. Has a lot of gold, so the tale goes.</string>
<string name="8659">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; I thinks you be needin&apos; to clean out them &lt;race&gt; ears o&apos; yours. I said 100 gold, not 50. You want to know or not?</string>
<string name="8660">This here&apos;s the Green Griffon Inn. I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a room for you... for that, you&apos;ll have to talk to Mutamin, the owner.</string>
<string name="8661">Mind yourself while staying at the inn, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="8662">Congratulations on your victory, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I only saw part of it, but it was impressive indeed.</string>
<string name="8663">You&apos;re welcome here at the Green Griffon, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. At the very least, it&apos;s a shelter from the local vagabonds.</string>
<string name="8664">Don&apos;t make any trouble, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, or I&apos;ll be forced to eject you from the inn.</string>
<string name="8665">Probably people preparing for the competition.</string>
<string name="8666">Yes, it is. Do you know why?</string>
<string name="8667">It certainly is. Who are you?</string>
<string name="8668">I&apos;ll be going.</string>
<string name="8669">Aren&apos;t you nervous or afraid at all?</string>
<string name="8670">A puny gnome like you is entering? You&apos;ve no hope!</string>
<string name="8671">That&apos;s a long way to travel.</string>
<string name="8672">What&apos;s this competition you mention?</string>
<string name="8673">Me think busy for competition.</string>
<string name="8674">Why so busy in here?</string>
<string name="8675">Me not know who you is. What name?</string>
<string name="8676">Time for I to go.</string>
<string name="8677">You isn&apos;t nervous?</string>
<string name="8678">You gots no hope, tiny gnome man!</string>
<string name="8679">That seem like long way away!</string>
<string name="8680">What you mean of competition?</string>
<string name="8681">Oh, hullo. It&apos;s quite busy in here, isn&apos;t it?</string>
<string name="8682">My name is Kasma. I&apos;m a bard from Baldur&apos;s Gate. I&apos;ve traveled quite a ways to take part in the competition. It&apos;s quite exciting!</string>
<string name="8683">All righty, then. Good luck to ya!</string>
<string name="8684">Everyone&apos;s here because Mutamin is putting on a show... adventurers like me will be trying to get through the dungeon beneath this inn.</string>
<string name="8685">It&apos;s filled with terrible traps and monsters, I hear... and the first person to make it through gets the reward. And a bit of fame, too, naturally.</string>
<string name="8686">It&apos;s all very secretive, I understand. The noblemen are here because they like a good scandal and love to watch violence. It should make for a good story.</string>
<string name="8687">If you&apos;re truly interested, you might want to speak to Mutamin about it. He would know far more than I, of course.</string>
<string name="8688">It is, yes. But there&apos;s nothing like this in Baldur&apos;s Gate!</string>
<string name="8689">No, not really. Just determined. I want to walk away from here with a tale to tell the countryside. Now *that* would be worth any price!</string>
<string name="8690">If you say so. I wish you well, anyway.</string>
<string name="8691">Oh, yes. And people preparing to watch, as well. We should have quite a crowd. It&apos;s all very exciting! I can&apos;t wait to enter the dungeon!</string>
<string name="8692">I wish you luck, friend! Whichever of us wins the prize, I hope you at least aren&apos;t hurt.</string>
<string name="8693">Oh dear, this was harder than I thought.</string>
<string name="8694">Any news that you can tell me of?</string>
<string name="8695">For a small inn, the place sure seems busy.</string>
<string name="8696">I&apos;d like to ask you about this competition of yours.</string>
<string name="8697">How about a room?</string>
<string name="8698">I&apos;ll be going.</string>
<string name="8699">Why are Luskan&apos;s gates closed?</string>
<string name="8700">Is that why the inn is so busy?</string>
<string name="8701">There wouldn&apos;t be some *other* reason, would there?</string>
<string name="8702">The patrons seem to say that something else is going on.</string>
<string name="8703">I&apos;d like to know some more about it, first.</string>
<string name="8704">What&apos;s the reward?</string>
<string name="8705">Yes, I&apos;d like to take part.</string>
<string name="8706">No. Not interested.</string>
<string name="8707">I think your contest is barbaric!</string>
<string name="8708">Could you explain all that again?</string>
<string name="8709">You gots news for me?</string>
<string name="8710">Why so busy? All people here to sleeps?</string>
<string name="8711">Me gots question about you competition.</string>
<string name="8712">Me wants to get a room, please.</string>
<string name="8713">Me goes bye.</string>
<string name="8714">Thank you. It was quite the experience.</string>
<string name="8715">Me says thanks for gold. Dungeon was good.</string>
<string name="8716">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Come on? That&apos;s it? Throw in another 300.</string>
<string name="8717">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me do good! Me gets... 300 gold more?</string>
<string name="8718">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; How about just 200 gold more?</string>
<string name="8719">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me gets 200 more, me goes away.</string>
<string name="8720">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Make it 100 more, and I&apos;ll leave satisfied.</string>
<string name="8721">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Me just wants 100 gold is all! Please?</string>
<string name="8722">I want more gold, and I&apos;m taking it.</string>
<string name="8723">Me wants more gold! Now! Me takes! Now!</string>
<string name="8724">Bye.</string>
<string name="8725">Why is gates to Luskan is closed?</string>
<string name="8726">So that is why inn so busy?</string>
<string name="8727">That only reason is so busy? No other reason?</string>
<string name="8728">Me hears other say some things different.</string>
<string name="8729">Yes. Me do this.</string>
<string name="8730">Tell more. Me not know what is it.</string>
<string name="8731">What happens if me wins? What me get?</string>
<string name="8732">No, me is not doing this.</string>
<string name="8733">Me not hear all you say. Say again?</string>
<string name="8734">Me think you make people as animal! Meanie!</string>
<string name="8735">You&apos;re right. Tell me about your contest, then.</string>
<string name="8736">Okay. Me re-thinks. Say about contest, then.</string>
<string name="8737">Welcome to the Green Griffon Inn, friend. Something I can get you?</string>
<string name="8738">Come back if you need anything.</string>
<string name="8739">I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m all booked up at the moment, friend. There&apos;s a lot of people waiting for Luskan to open its gates again. I do have a selection of other goods I sell, if you care to take a look.</string>
<string name="8740">Well, the Neverwintan plague might be over, but you can never be for certain, you know? I don&apos;t want to risk my life like that.</string>
<string name="8741">But still, this seems a little different. I think they&apos;re taking advantage of the plague to keep them gates up. It just seems fishy is all. </string>
<string name="8742">I&apos;ve heard rumors that there&apos;s some worse problem in Luskan, something terrorizing the streets that the city doesn&apos;t want anyone to know about.</string>
<string name="8743">But that&apos;s just rumor. Either way, they&apos;re not letting anyone in or out.</string>
<string name="8744">Yes, well, there&apos;s a lot of people traveling through the area, people who can&apos;t get into Luskan. And I&apos;ve a fine inn here, after all.</string>
<string name="8745">I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ve heard, friend, but the gates to Luskan are closed up. They&apos;re not letting anyone in or out of the city.</string>
<string name="8746">Listen, if you have a point, make it. Otherwise, I&apos;d prefer to keep out of trouble. I&apos;m not one for all of this game playing.</string>
<string name="8747">No, there is no other reason. Just people passing through, waiting to get into Luskan or what-have-you.</string>
<string name="8748">So someone told you about it, did they? Blasted fools. If word keeps spreading about this contest, I&apos;ll have the militia on my head in no time.</string>
<string name="8749">*sigh* But nevertheless... you know and that&apos;s that. Are you interested in taking part, friend?</string>
<string name="8750">Then why bring it up? If you&apos;re not interested in the contest, there&apos;s little reason to be here, is there?</string>
<string name="8751">Hmph. Then tell the militia... if you can get inside Luskan, that is. Now, if you&apos;ll excuse me, I have patrons to attend to.</string>
<string name="8752">Half my wealth, which is considerable, as I&apos;ve come off of a long and prosperous adventuring career. Interested?</string>
<string name="8753">Well, there are two doors in the back hall, just behind me. The right one&apos;s locked up tight and leads down into the basement, where I&apos;ve rigged up a dungeon.</string>
<string name="8754">First one to get through alive, past all the traps and critters I&apos;ve managed to get down there wins. It&apos;s that simple.</string>
<string name="8755">You&apos;re free to come back out any time an&apos; try again, but of course someone might make it through first if you take too long. So, still interested?</string>
<string name="8756">Don&apos;t kid yourself, though: it&apos;s bloody dangerous. If you go down, chances are you don&apos;t come out. And that&apos;s the reason for all the secrecy.</string>
<string name="8757">Right, then. Here&apos;s a key for the back door. Remember that you&apos;ll have to pay Jaroo 500 gold to be allowed into the dungeon. Good luck!</string>
<string name="8758">It costs you 500 gold pieces to enter. You don&apos;t pay me, though. I just give you a key. Jaroo will explain things more down there. You can pay him.</string>
<string name="8759">So! It seems you&apos;re the one who&apos;s won my little contest, eh? Congratulations are certainly in order!</string>
<string name="8760">Why, sometimes I long for the days when I used to travel and adventure as you do... but I&apos;m sure you didn&apos;t come here to hear me talk. Heh heh.</string>
<string name="8761">Here you go: half my fortune for your troubles. I hope it was worth it for you. Once again, congratulations!</string>
<string name="8762">Sorry, but since the competition&apos;s been won, the dungeon&apos;s going to need some re-tooling. Maybe next spring or so she&apos;ll re-open.</string>
<string name="8763">Until then, I&apos;m afraid the Green Griffon is back to being a regular inn. Heh heh.</string>
<string name="8764">Well, I&apos;d love to ask you all about it, but I&apos;m sure you&apos;re busy, and I saw well-enough with my own eyes. Farewell.</string>
<string name="8765">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Generally, the pay-outs are set and immutable. But what the heck, I like your style and I&apos;m feeling generous. Here you go, pal.</string>
<string name="8766">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, maybe if you were asking for a little extra, I might be inclined to give it to you. You looked good out there. But 300 gold?</string>
<string name="8767">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; 200 gold? Well... all right, fine. Here you go. I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m giving it to you, though. Now, you take this and move on, all right?</string>
<string name="8768">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; First I give you half, then I throw in another 200? Where does it end? You&apos;re nice, and you&apos;ve got some skill, but you&apos;re trying my patience.</string>
<string name="8769">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Well, I guess 100 more is something I can afford to give, and it was a good show. All right, here you go.</string>
<string name="8770">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Some people just can&apos;t be happy, they always want more. Well, I ain&apos;t giving you more. You take what you got and stop bothering me.</string>
<string name="8771">Fine! Take your stinking gold. Here&apos;s 100 coins to add to what I gave you already. But you bother me again, and I&apos;ll have your throat slit.</string>
<string name="8772">Yeah, now that&apos;s what I like to see. Some adventurer spirit and an open mind! Gotta keep your smarts about you. What do you want to know?</string>
<string name="8773">The price I&apos;ve had to pay to come to this... this place... is simply appalling! You are in the same boat I expect, yes?</string>
<string name="8774">Yes? I&apos;m afraid that I&apos;m only here for one purpose, &lt;sir/madam&gt;... and general revelry is not one of them.</string>
<string name="8775">Do be off, before I foist a manservant upon you. I am only here until the gates are re-opened, you see.</string>
<string name="8776">I won&apos;t discuss anything with someone who&apos;s not even properly dressed!</string>
<string name="8777">You certainly cannot run about without clothes on, &lt;sir/madam&gt;!</string>
<string name="8778">Err... forgot to put on your clothing to&lt;day/night&gt;, did you?</string>
<string name="8779">You can&apos;t run about bleeding all over the place! It&apos;s not decent.</string>
<string name="8780">Gods have mercy! Those are quite the wounds you have, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="8781">Have you been in some manner of... of combat? You appear quite hurt.</string>
<string name="8782">Oh... it&apos;s another of these slow ones.</string>
<string name="8783">Excuse me, but I&apos;ve no wish to talk with slow-witted peasants.</string>
<string name="8784">(sigh) I don&apos;t suppose someone with your intelligence would actually have something useful to ask.</string>
<string name="8785">Must you brandish that thing about? Can&apos;t you put it away?</string>
<string name="8786">I really must ask you to stop waving that thing about!</string>
<string name="8787">Please put your weapon away. It&apos;s practically indecent.</string>
<string name="8788">Oh? A holy &lt;man/woman&gt;? Here?</string>
<string name="8789">I didn&apos;t think they had many holy folk coming to the Green Griffon.</string>
<string name="8790">You must be on your way to Luskan, yes? The people there need all the spiritual advice they can get.</string>
<string name="8791">Another magic-user, I see. Hmph.</string>
<string name="8792">I must say I&apos;ve never trusted you magical folk much.</string>
<string name="8793">Are you on your way to Luskan? I hear there&apos;s quite a number of you magic folk at the Host Tower in the city.</string>
<string name="8794">A fellow of the &lt;race&gt; people? How wonderful!</string>
<string name="8795">After meeting one brutish human after another, it&apos;s quite pleasant to meet someone from the &lt;race&gt; lands!</string>
<string name="8796">The humans around these parts haven&apos;t a clue how to treat &lt;race&gt; kind, you know.</string>
<string name="8797">You&apos;re a fine looking specimen of womanhood, I must say... care to join me?</string>
<string name="8798">I am a wealthy man. You could do so well to spend time with me, m&apos;lady.</string>
<string name="8799">Ah, such a fair picture of beauty! Come, sit with me, lass!</string>
<string name="8800">What a darling man you seem! Do sit with me, sir.</string>
<string name="8801">I am a woman of taste and distinction. Perhaps you&apos;ll do me the favor of visiting my room tonight, sir?</string>
<string name="8802">Hmmm... ignore my husband, wherever he is... I&apos;d rather talk to a man like you.</string>
<string name="8803">A pleasure to meet you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Have you come out from Luskan, as well?</string>
<string name="8804">(sigh) What one has to do for one&apos;s entertainment... Personally, I can&apos;t wait to be back in Luskan when the gates are opened.</string>
<string name="8805">You are a frequent visitor to this inn, then? This is my first time.</string>
<string name="8806">I cannot wait until the Luskan gates are re-opened. I&apos;m rather eager to be off.</string>
<string name="8807">Oh, do leave me be. I&apos;m not accustomed to being approached by your kind.</string>
<string name="8808">More lower-class travellers cluttering up this dingy inn, I see.</string>
<string name="8809">Ugh... a smelly barbarian. Of all the luck... </string>
<string name="8810">Excuse me, but I&apos;d rather not chat with you smelly, uncivilized barbarian types.</string>
<string name="8811">I&apos;m a noble&lt;man/woman&gt;, not a barbarian like yourself.</string>
<string name="8812">What&apos;s this? More &lt;race&gt; rabble? Are you one of the local servants, then?</string>
<string name="8813">You there! &lt;Race&gt; commoner, you must be one of the servers. Go fetch me a drink, &lt;lad/lass&gt;.</string>
<string name="8814">I don&apos;t have time to be chatted up by just any old &lt;race&gt; beggar, excuse me.</string>
<string name="8815">Excuse me, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, but I&apos;m simply waiting for... ah... someone.</string>
<string name="8816">I&apos;ve no time to speak, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Excuse me.</string>
<string name="8817">Good day to you, my &lt;lady/lord&gt;.</string>
<string name="8818">Do not come too near, peasant! It&apos;s bad enough that I have to come to such a dreadful place!</string>
<string name="8819">Excuse me, peasant... I&apos;ve more important matters to attend to.</string>
<string name="8820">Do not speak to me. I&apos;ve not come for the company, I can assure you.</string>
<string name="8821">Welcome to the Green Griffon, &lt;mister/missus&gt;. If ye needs something, ye&apos;d best talk to Master Mutamin. He&apos;s the owner, he is.</string>
<string name="8822">I am just one of the servants for the inn, &lt;mister/missus&gt;. Please leave me to my work.</string>
<string name="8823">You... you&apos;re the one that won Master Mutamin&apos;s contest, aren&apos;t you? Err... congratulations, &lt;mister/missus&gt;. You must be very proud.</string>
<string name="8824">I&apos;m just one of the servants, m&apos;&lt;lord/lady&gt;. I will fetch your serving lass for you right away.</string>
<string name="8825">Don&apos;t bother me. I&apos;m just one of Master Mutamin&apos;s servants, here, and I&apos;ve plenty o&apos; work to be done.</string>
<string name="8826">Can I just ask you a quick question?</string>
<string name="8827">Very well. I&apos;ll wait.</string>
<string name="8828">Do you know anything about what&apos;s going on in Luskan?</string>
<string name="8829">What are all these people here for?</string>
<string name="8830">Anything interesting about the patrons?</string>
<string name="8831">Nevermind.</string>
<string name="8832">Who owns this place?</string>
<string name="8833">What&apos;s so strange about Zamithra?</string>
<string name="8834">Oh. Do you feel the same as she does?</string>
<string name="8835">Me just gots quick question me ask.</string>
<string name="8836">Okay, me wait.</string>
<string name="8837">Me gots questions about Luskan. You know anything?</string>
<string name="8838">Why these people is in here?</string>
<string name="8839">You see any people in here? Seem different?</string>
<string name="8840">Me ask who owner is.</string>
<string name="8841">Me not ask anything.</string>
<string name="8842">Why Zamithra strange to you? What you see?</string>
<string name="8843">Me wonders if you feel same way? Hates men?</string>
<string name="8844">A minotaur? Tell me about him.</string>
<string name="8845">What you mean minotaur? Tell.</string>
<string name="8846">What was so strange about Zamithra?</string>
<string name="8847">Why Zamithra strange to you? What you see?</string>
<string name="8848">If you desire anything, &lt;sir/madam&gt;, I&apos;ll just be a moment.</string>
<string name="8849">So long as it *is* quick.</string>
<string name="8850">Talk to Mutamin if you need anything right away, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. It might be a while before I can get to you.</string>
<string name="8851">I&apos;ve no idea, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. I just serve them.</string>
<string name="8852">Aside from the fact that its gates are closed due to the plague? No, not really. We&apos;re always busy, here, though, so that makes no difference.</string>
<string name="8853">No, these are all regular folk in here. Nothing too unique about any of them except for that Zamithra woman, perhaps.</string>
<string name="8854">Not strange, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. She&apos;s got guts, and I admire her. Zamithra is a famous mercenary captain, renowned for her revilement of men.</string>
<string name="8855">I think men could use a swift kick sometimes, certainly.</string>
<string name="8856">Oh, of course not. You&apos;ve nothing to worry about, dear man. Ha ha!</string>
<string name="8857">Mutamin. You&apos;ll find him behind the counter near the back hall, more as like.</string>
<string name="8858">Was that a question? Do you want to know who the owner is? Is that what you mean?</string>
<string name="8859">But I do think of her as a good example for what women can accomplish if we set our minds to it, don&apos;t you think?</string>
<string name="8860">Not that I can think of. </string>
<string name="8861">No, these are all regular folk in here. Nothing too unique about any of them except for that Zamithra woman, perhaps. Or the minotaur. He&apos;s a frightening one.</string>
<string name="8862">No, these are all regular folk in here. Nothing too unique about any of them except maybe for the minotaur. He&apos;s a scary one.</string>
<string name="8863">Well, a short time ago, a minotaur arrived during the night and demanded a room. His name was Gor or Zar or something like that. </string>
<string name="8864">He&apos;s been holed up in a room upstairs. He only unlocks the door to take food and ale. A LOT of food and ale. I don&apos;t know what he&apos;s hiding from. He seems to be having a good time getting drunk, regardless.</string>
<string name="8865">Any other questions?</string>
<string name="8866">Greetings. The side rooms are viewing rooms... if you&apos;re here to watch the event.</string>
<string name="8867">If you&apos;re an adventurer, the preparation room is at the end of the hall. Only adventurers are allowed in the preparation room, please.</string>
<string name="8868">Congratulations on your win, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="8869">You&apos;re not a contestant, are you? No... I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen you.</string>
<string name="8870">Rather a titillating little sport, don&apos;t you think?</string>
<string name="8871">Have you entered the dungeon? No, you&apos;re a nobody, I see.</string>
<string name="8872">Excuse me, but I&apos;m rather wrapped up in the proceedings.</string>
<string name="8873">I&apos;ve no time to talk, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="8874">I saw you in the dungeon earlier, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Quite impressive.</string>
<string name="8875">Do you think you might be re-entering soon? I&apos;ve a wager on you.</string>
<string name="8876">Too bad you left so soon. I was interested in your progress.</string>
<string name="8877">Ha! I knew you would leave the dungeon! Nobody&apos;s made it, yet.</string>
<string name="8878">You show marvelous skills, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;. It&apos;s a good thing you didn&apos;t die in there.</string>
<string name="8879">You completed the dungeon! Astounding! Absolutely amazing!</string>
<string name="8880">Hurrah for the hero! Tell us a first-hand account of your victory, yes?</string>
<string name="8881">I won quite the wager on you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! Bravo! Bra-vo!!</string>
<string name="8882">So you won half of Mutamin&apos;s fortune, did you? You earned it, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;!</string>
<string name="8883">It was quite exciting to watch you finish! Congratulations!</string>
<string name="8884">Yes, but is 500 gold pieces really necessary?</string>
<string name="8885">Yes, I am. Here is your 500 gold.</string>
<string name="8886">No, not yet.</string>
<string name="8887">Me do, but me not wants spending 500 gold!</string>
<string name="8888">Me gots 500 gold. Is here. You take.</string>
<string name="8889">Me not wants entering dungeon yet.</string>
<string name="8890">So... *this* is the latest group of entrants, is it? Very well. My name is Jaroo - Master of the Games. Allow me to explain how this will work:</string>
<string name="8891">It shall cost you 500 gold pieces to be teleported into the dungeon. You&apos;ll appear in one of five alcoves located in the southern end.</string>
<string name="8892">If you wish to return, simply use the platform that you appeared on, or any other platform. But it&apos;ll cost you 500 gold pieces to be teleported back.</string>
<string name="8893">Neither I nor Mutamin are responsible for your deaths or the deaths of your companions. If you enter, it is your risk to take.</string>
<string name="8894">Now, then, should anyone wish to enter, approach me with your gold and I&apos;ll teleport you within.</string>
<string name="8895">Yes, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? Are you ready to enter the dungeon?</string>
<string name="8896">As you desire. I shall remain here, should you change your mind.</string>
<string name="8897">Excellent. Prepare yourself, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! And let the contest begin!!</string>
<string name="8898">It is. Each entry is added to the total that will be given to the winner who makes it through the dungeon.</string>
<string name="8899">Since you have an equal chance of succeeding, I&apos;m afraid it wouldn&apos;t be fair to offer a discount. So are you ready for the competition?</string>
<string name="8900">You&apos;ve won the competition. Congratulations! Speak to Mutamin to collect your reward!</string>
<string name="8901">The competition has been won. Come back another time, when the dungeon has been re-worked for the sequel!</string>
<string name="8902">I&apos;m sorry, but all contestants must pay the 500 gold. Each entry is added to the total that&apos;s given to the one who survives the dungeon.</string>
<string name="8903">A female wizard lived to see her great great grand daughters. She had 4 daughters, 5 grand daughters, 7 great grand daughters and 11 great great grand daughters. How many great great great grand daughters would she have?</string>
<string name="8904">I&apos;d rather kill you now!</string>
<string name="8905">Ask me your riddle, then.</string>
<string name="8906">Nevermind, then. I&apos;ll go elsewhere.</string>
<string name="8907">Could you repeat that?</string>
<string name="8908">Err... I&apos;ll get back to you on that.</string>

<string name="8918">Err... nevermind.</string>

<string name="8922">14 trinkets, 5 girls.</string>
<string name="8923">9 trinkets, 4 girls.</string>
<string name="8924">8 trinkets, 5 girls.</string>
<string name="8925">Me not like riddles. Me like fighting!</string>

<string name="8949">After ssslaying a dragon, a group of knightsss gave sssome of the trinketsss from a treasure horde to a group of fewer than ten human girlsss to divide.</string>
<string name="8950">While the trinketsss could have been divided equally amongssst the girlsss, they argued over how to divide it.</string>
<string name="8951">One sssuggesssted that they divide it by family inssstead of by individual. In the group, there were two groupsss of two sssisssterss, the ressst unrelated.</string>
<string name="8952">This division would mean that the trinketsss per family were five more than the trinketsss per girl.</string>
<string name="8953">Before a decision was made, one girl sssaid she desired nothing. Ssso her share wasss divided amongssst the othersss. The sharesss were equal once again.</string>
<string name="8954">The sssuggestion of dividing the trinketsss by family wasss then withdrawn, asss all were sssatisfied. How many girlsss shared in the division and how many did each get?</string>

<string name="8994">I am a member of Zamithra&apos;s Blackguards! You can talk to her if she&apos;s in the mood for conversation.</string>
<string name="8995">I suspect the mistress will be happy in the morning. She always gets what she wants from men. </string>
<string name="8996">Mistress Zamithra&apos;s gem has been stolen. I have failed the mistress!</string>

<string name="9010">Dumb dumb! We go right now!</string>

<string name="9016">You safe now. You go back to you dad.</string>
<string name="9017">Yesgar told me that you were the one who planned this and wanted the money.</string>
<string name="9018">Bad guy say you take money. You trick father.</string>
<string name="9019">Hmm. Well, you seem sincere, but it&apos;s your father&apos;s problem now. You can go home to him.</string>
<string name="9020">Yuh, probably. You go to dad now.</string>
<string name="9021">(sob) Huh? Who are you?</string>
<string name="9022">I&apos;ll be good! Please don&apos;t hurt me!</string>
<string name="9023">By the gods! Haven&apos;t you monsters tortured me enough? Just leave me alone!</string>
<string name="9024">Rescue? (sob) Wait, you... you&apos;re the one who saved Neverwinter. Does this mean the gods have forgiven me? Is it possible, despite my stupidity?</string>
<string name="9025"></string>
<string name="9026">I will. (sob)</string>
<string name="9027">I shouldn&apos;t have believed him! It was going to be a grand adventure and I would be a true hero... like you. Oh, gods! I&apos;ll never be able to return home. </string>
<string name="9028">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *Sob* I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m calm now and I&apos;ll tell you what happened.</string>
<string name="9029">I... I&apos;m sorry. I don&apos;t think I can talk about it. I&apos;ll be safe now if I just go home.</string>
<string name="9030">I didn&apos;t mean for anyone to get hurt! I just want to go home! (sob)</string>
<string name="9031">Home! This town means everything to me! Thank you for saving me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will never do anything so foolish again!</string>
<string name="9032">I must be going. My father wishes me to stay in our house for awhile. I can&apos;t really say I blame him. Goodbye!</string>
<string name="9033">(sob) I&apos;m so afraid to face my father. I... I wish I had listened to him in the first place. Thank you for rescuing a foolish child. Goodbye and good luck &lt;sir/madam&gt;.</string>
<string name="9034">I&apos;l tell you! Please don&apos;t hurt me!</string>
<string name="9035">After you started returning with the ears of the other prisoners, I was approached by a man in a cloak. He said that he knew I was looking for adventure. He talked strangely but he was nice to me.</string>
<string name="9036">It all seemed so mysterious and exciting. He gave me wine and we talked about how he was a Count from Waterdeep who was framed for a crime he didn&apos;t commit and had escaped from prison.</string>
<string name="9037">I don&apos;t know why I believed him. Maybe it was the wine. I guess he just fit my childish image of a noble hero. We snuck away at night and travelled to the mines.</string>
<string name="9038">There were all these horrible orcs waiting for us and when I went to ask him what was going on, he just laughed and knocked me down. Then he... he did things to me... I... I can&apos;t talk about it.</string>
<string name="9039">I figured out who he was. I had heard my father talk about him. Yesgar told me that he was going to hold me for ransom and once he had bled the town dry, he was going to take me away to sell into slavery.</string>
<string name="9040">I should never have gone with him! My father must be so worried! (sob) I&apos;m sorry... so sorry. (sob)</string>
<string name="9041">What?! I would never do something like that to my father or to Port Llast! I know I had a bad attitude, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but they are still my family and friends. I would never wish them ill.</string>
<string name="9042">Help me!</string>
<string name="9043">How, exactly, can you help me?</string>

<string name="9263">You kills her? How could you?!</string>
<string name="9264">That is very sad. I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="9265">That&apos;s the love of your life? A woman you seduced and assassinated?</string>
<string name="9266">I can&apos;t believe you did that. How callous and selfish!</string>
<string name="9267">Why did you do it?</string>
<string name="9268">Is very sad. Me is sorry.</string>

<string name="9280">Sorry, Aarin. I&apos;m not interested.</string>
<string name="9281">But you still look uncomfortable.</string>
<string name="9282">Go on, out with it.</string>
<string name="9283">Ha! Actually, I like you better this way.</string>
<string name="9284">You needn&apos;t fear: I will always return.</string>
<string name="9285">Don&apos;t be so foolish.</string>
<string name="9286">You fear for me? That is sweet of you.</string>
<string name="9287">Don&apos;t make me gag. What are you getting at?</string>
<string name="9288">Thank you, Aarin. I shall keep it safe.</string>
<string name="9289">I... don&apos;t know what to say... </string>
<string name="9290">No. I don&apos;t want it.</string>
<string name="9291">Hail, friend. You were instrumental in ridding Neverwinter of the Wailing Death, I understand. Allow me to congratulate you on a job well done.</string>
<string name="9292">You have shown yourself to be possessed of remarkable courage and resourcefulness. That is fortuitous, for both these qualities will be needed if you are to complete your mission.</string>
<string name="9293">But that is not how we should begin. I am known as Aarin Gend, and I have served our Lord Nasher for some time. Hopefully I may be of similar use to you now.</string>
<string name="9294">You have not spoken to Aribeth, then? Perhaps it would be better if you did so, and then returned to me, for I have much that I need to tell you of.</string>
<string name="9295">Indeed. I know who you are. There are many who whisper your name right now, and it is my business to listen to them all.</string>
<string name="9296">My place lies in the shadows. I have many eyes and ears throughout the northern lands, and it is my place to inform Lord Nasher where the vipers lay in wait.</string>
<string name="9297">If only I had foreseen the actions of this cult, I could have prevented the disaster. But these men move skillfully, out of my sight and hearing.</string>
<string name="9298">Instead of recriminating myself for my failure, I must do what I can to repair the damage... and that is to offer what information I have to you so that you may find where this new nest of vipers hides.</string>
<string name="9299">You have spoken to the paladin, then? Excellent. It is for her to pass on the commands of Lord Nasher and not I.</string>
<string name="9300">I have much to pass onto you, friend... but first you should speak to our lady Aribeth. Once you have done so, return to me.</string>
<string name="9301">So impatient to get on with business? You are obviously a &lt;man/woman&gt; of action and are a courageous warrior. Only one such person is needed to change the world.</string>
<string name="9302">Aribeth has informed you of where you must search, yes? She has told you of how you may root out these fiends?</string>
<string name="9303">Many of Lord Nasher&apos;s forces make haste to restore order to the city we have left. Neverwinter&apos;s chaos is obvious, and there are many predators in the hungry north.</string>
<string name="9304">It falls to us, then... to you... to track down the location of the cult which was responsible for starting this disease in the first place.</string>
<string name="9305">We know precious little of them. We do not know who they are, where they are based, why they began the plague... or what other devilry they have yet planned for us.</string>
<string name="9306">Unearthing the cult will not be a simple task. What few whispers I have collected, however, have allowed me to narrow your search to this region.</string>
<string name="9307">It is vital that the cult&apos;s exact location be found, and that we are certain any leads we discover are not attempts at deception. Aribeth will not be satisfied until we find at least two separate leads that point to the same locale... that is your task.</string>
<string name="9308">I do know of one possible lead for you. There has been strange news regarding a series of caves that lie north of Port Llast. Investigation may reveal the cult to be hidden there.</string>
<string name="9309">I suggest, however, that looking into the caves first would still be your wisest choice.</string>
<string name="9310">Impatient for the kill, are we? Just be wary, friend. Running forward too fast is a good way to find a cliff.</string>
<string name="9311">Have you more questions, friend? I shall aid you all I can.</string>
<string name="9312">The gods smile on us that you remain yet unharmed for your efforts. With luck, success shall soon follow.</string>
<string name="9313">Greetings, my dear friend. The presence of such a charming woman as yourself is always welcome. How may I serve?</string>
<string name="9314">We are fortunate that you have found the location of this cult, hiding amongst the wizards of Luskan&apos;s Host Tower. It is now clear how they possess so much power and stealth.</string>
<string name="9315">It is my understanding that you were of immense aid to the druid, Aawill, and indeed the entire Neverwinter Wood. Well done, my friend.</string>
<string name="9316">A little bird has informed me that someone has actually won Mutamin&apos;s little contest. Such a person must be mighty and clever, indeed, don&apos;t you agree?</string>
<string name="9317">Even though Luskan is sealed to outsiders, I hear whispers that you have gained admittance. Be most cautious in traveling its perilous streets, my friend.</string>
<string name="9318">It... is good to see you at last, my friend. I fear I have terrible news. It seems that the good lady Aribeth... has disappeared. We can find no trace of her.</string>
<string name="9319">Aye, a city of pirates and base villainy. The city itself will be closed to you now... but it will be worth your while to go in that direction anyway. You should seek out the humanoid caves by the Green Griffon.</string>
<string name="9320">One of the deepest and most ancient woods of the north, my friend. It is filled with life both beautiful and dangerous, and is tended to by the order of druids.</string>
<string name="9321">The road leads eventually home to Neverwinter... but before that lay many miles of wildlands as well as the village of Charwood. The cult could hide in many places, there.</string>
<string name="9322">There are locals who could tell you more of this town, my friend... my knowledge of it is limited.</string>
<string name="9323">Aye? What would you have of me, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="9324">May the luck of the gods be yours, my friend.</string>
<string name="9325">Aye, I shall hope that the gods keep you safe, my friend.</string>
<string name="9326">I shall await your return, then. Be safe, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and godspeed.</string>
<string name="9327"></string>
<string name="9328"></string>
<string name="9329">The road north will lead you along the coast and directly to the city&apos;s gates. As I said. getting into the city will be more of a problem than reaching it. I will attempt to remedy that as soon as possible.</string>
<string name="9330">It is known as the City of Sails, home to pirates and far worse ilk, and ruled by five High Captains who maintain an uneasy balance of power.</string>
<string name="9331">True power, however, lies in the hands of the mages of the Arcane Brotherhood within the Host Tower. Even I know little of these men.</string>
<string name="9332">The city is powerful, anarchic and dangerous. Luskan has challenged the Lords&apos; Alliance more than once... be careful when you walk its streets, for many within see strangers as easy prey.</string>
<string name="9333">Evil men are common as coins in Luskan, my friend. This cult could walk the streets unnoticed, and find many allies who would heed gold above all else.</string>
<string name="9334">Additionally, I have been troubled by reports of humanoid banditry taking place on the road between Neverwinter and Luskan. This is unusual... and while it may simply be caused by Luskan&apos;s ignorance, it should be investigated.</string>
<string name="9335">Follow the road east of Port Llast. The lands are wild and sparsely populated there... and when you reach the boundaries of the great forest, you will know.</string>
<string name="9336">Like Neverwinter, the forest is warmed by the magically heated waters of the river that runs through it. It is a grand and beautiful place, I am told.</string>
<string name="9337">Few journey through its boundaries, however, as it is said that the wood has a life of its own... and is unwelcoming to outsiders.</string>
<string name="9338">The druids of the wood, watched over by the Archdruid Aawill, are aware of all that passes within their charge. It is my hope that they can provide you aid.</string>
<string name="9339">The Archdruid Aawill has sent several letters to Lord Nasher as of late, begging for aid against some unknown force that assails the wood.</string>
<string name="9340">Lord Nasher would have provided the help the Archdruid required, but could not due to the chaos within the city. Neverwinter must come first.</string>
<string name="9341">Aawill has sent no more messages in recent days, and it is possible that the druids exist no more. The exact danger that was being faced was not explained... this cult may not even be involved.</string>
<string name="9342">It may, however, so this may be an excellent avenue for you to search. Whatever has occurred, my friend... expect the worst.</string>
<string name="9343">The southern road is not so much a place you go to, my friend, as it is a route you take. It will lead you eventually to Neverwinter... but it is the region itself that concerns me.</string>
<string name="9344">Very little. There has been little news from the village of Charwood for many years, I understand. It may have been deserted, for all I can tell.</string>
<string name="9345">Ruins will be common, and it is said that other, stranger, creatures have made these wildlands their home. A powerful wizard is even said to have taken residence.</string>
<string name="9346">I have no reports from this area. None. This disturbs me perhaps more than it should, as the cult could exist openly here and I would not even know.</string>
<string name="9347">I offer the South Road as a possibility mostly out of speculation, my friend. I simply would not wish to leave it out entirely... just in case my suspicions have good reason.</string>
<string name="9348">The fact that the city remains sealed even now that the plague has ended, and so little word escapes its walls, also has me worried of what events transpire there.</string>
<string name="9349"></string>
<string name="9350"></string>
<string name="9351">Lady Aribeth has arranged for the hiring of several skilled adventurers. They are here with us... if you require their aid, you need only ask one of them.</string>
<string name="9352">I did my best to investigate Port Llast before we made our base here, my friend... but what you suggest is not impossible.</string>
<string name="9353">There may have been things ongoing in this place which escaped my notice. An investigation on your part is not without merit.</string>
<string name="9354">I still serve as Lord Nasher&apos;s master of spies, my friend... and his need for proper information is more vital now than even before.</string>
<string name="9355">My ear must remain to the ground, even if my efforts must be co-ordinated from here rather than deeper in the shadows.</string>
<string name="9356">I shall continue to seek word on the cult that might aid your quest... though I have my doubts in that. You will have far more success than I, I think.</string>
<string name="9357">Let me see what you have. Yes... excellent. I had full confidence in your abilities, my friend. Bring the information to Aribeth quickly... she will be eager to see it.</string>
<string name="9358">The noble paladin earns my pity, friend. Her heart has been broken and her faith shaken... I do not think &apos;well&apos; is a word that will describe her ever again.</string>
<string name="9359">I am informed that she has been plagued by terrible nightmares that keep her from rest. She speaks horrid things in her sleep, frightening the servants.</string>
<string name="9360">I can only imagine what the elf sees when she closes her eyes. She will not confide in me, nor will she agree to return to Neverwinter. I worry for her, truly.</string>
<string name="9361">I... would not normally speak of this, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I am told that you and the lady paladin have formed a bond of friendship.</string>
<string name="9362">Aribeth has stirred from her grief, but not as I&apos;d hoped. She has replaced it with a frightening rage that she almost cannot contain.</string>
<string name="9363">She storms about, brooding and filled with bitterness and lashing out at all who come near her. I do not know if anything can even be done... perhaps you could speak to her.</string>
<string name="9364">Grim. Lord Nasher reports that many of our armed forces have perished from the plague... and even more are needed to restore order to the city.</string>
<string name="9365">The worst is perhaps over now that the plague is cured, but still we reel from a crippling blow. It will be some time before things return to what they were.</string>
<string name="9366">What do you wish to know?</string>
<string name="9367">The tower lies on an island, reachable by a bridge on the northwestern shore. There are rumors of other entrances... but I have been able to find none.</string>
<string name="9368">The bridge, however, is guarded well by both armsman and sorcery. The wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood value their privacy.</string>
<string name="9369">Little enough, if the truth be told. The wizards search diligently for spies at every turn, so I receive only questionable news from outside the tower itself.</string>
<string name="9370">It is known, however, that the Arcane Brotherhood are the true power in Luskan. The High Captains rule the city, but only with the wizards&apos; leave.</string>
<string name="9371">How the cult gained its foothold there can only be guessed at. The wizards may be allies... or, indeed, even members of their cause.</string>
<string name="9372">If you do gain entrance, use extreme caution and find out all you can about their plans. Assaulting them directly may not be an option.</string>
<string name="9373">I believe I know of a way... though it is a risky path, to say the least. The bridge to the tower&apos;s island is guarded by magic that is not easily by-passed.</string>
<string name="9374">Those who wish admittance to the tower must be granted the proper pass by the wizards... papers which are affixed with a magical seal that allows the possessor to pass unhindered by the wards.</string>
<string name="9375">Unfortunately, the only persons which I am sure possess such a pass are the High Captains, themselves.</string>
<string name="9376">If you were somehow to acquire one of these documents for me, with its seal, I could easily use it to forge a similar pass for you.</string>
<string name="9377">Excellent work, my friend. I have already managed to put together a forgery that will claim the bearer as an ambassador of Mulhorand.</string>
<string name="9378">It is then a simple matter of moving the seal from one document to the other... as so... and it is done.</string>
<string name="9379">This forgery, then, should allow you to by-pass any guards at the bridge, as well as the magical wards. Once inside, however, I would not rely on it.</string>
<string name="9380"></string>
<string name="9381">The lady paladin had been quite silent since you left Port Llast. I thought perhaps that she had found contentment now that the cult was located.</string>
<string name="9382">So my eye was not as close upon her as it might otherwise have been. Regardless, she used considerable skill to vanish without notice sometime after our arrival in the city.</string>
<string name="9383">All of her gear and armor is gone, as well. She prepared well and left of her own volition, though I can scarce believe it.</string>
<string name="9384">She has not returned to Neverwinter. Part of me wonders if... if perhaps she seeks to exact her own brand of vengeance upon the cultists.</string>
<string name="9385">I cannot be certain. Aribeth was acting so strangely before her disappearance. She had an icy calm, as if the lady paladin had accepted an unpleasant fate.</string>
<string name="9386">I worry for her safety. She is not in her right mind, I fear.</string>
<string name="9387">As you wish. I am concerned for the lady paladin, even if you are not. I thought at the least you should know.</string>
<string name="9388">Your most important task is to find your way into the Host Tower, my friend. The cult must be dealt with. If you find Aribeth there, all the better.</string>
<string name="9389">If she is not within the Host Tower, a true search will have to wait until after your own mission is complete, no matter how much we might wish otherwise. So, then... let us discuss your mission.</string>
<string name="9390"></string>
<string name="9391">I shall pray for your success, my dear friend. Be safe, for I could not bear your loss.</string>
<string name="9392"></string>
<string name="9393">That is a curious question, my friend. Nor does it have a simple answer, if the truth be known, and is not a tale that I care to often tell.</string>
<string name="9394">Aye, so I did, though I had not expected that you would be truly interested in hearing the rest of the tale. Are you sure I am not boring you?</string>
<string name="9395">I... did. That I mentioned her at all was by accident, my friend. I have been determined to avoid those memories for many years, now.</string>
<string name="9396">Do I seem uncomfortable to your eyes? I shall amend my stance, then, &lt;FirstName&gt;, for I do not wish you to feel ill at ease.</string>
<string name="9397"></string>
<string name="9398">I can only imagine what the elf sees when she closes her eyes. She will not confide in me, nor will she agree to return to Neverwinter. I worry for her, truly.</string>
<string name="9399">She storms about, brooding and filled with bitterness and lashing out at all who come near her. I do not know if anything can even be done... perhaps you could speak to her.</string>
<string name="9400"></string>
<string name="9401">I mean that it is more than one tale. How I became a spymaster is quite different from how I met and came to serve our Lord Nasher.</string>
<string name="9402">I am no drunken bard to spill the story of my life at a moment&apos;s notice, however, so either story is usually one I keep to myself.</string>
<string name="9403"></string>
<string name="9404">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *Sigh* As you wish, my friend... though I&apos;ll not be held responsible should you nod off during the telling of it.</string>
<string name="9405"></string>
<string name="9406">Let me see... perhaps it is best if I ask you a question, first. You are a &lt;man/woman&gt; of your god, &lt;FirstName&gt;, are you not?</string>
<string name="9407">Let me see... perhaps it is best if I ask you a question, first. You are a &lt;man/woman&gt; possessed of wondrous magics, &lt;FirstName&gt;, are you not?</string>
<string name="9408">Let me see... perhaps it is best if I ask you a question, first. You are a &lt;man/woman&gt; of great skill, are you not?</string>
<string name="9409">Let me see... perhaps it is best if I ask you a question, first. You are a &lt;man/woman&gt; of great fighting prowess, &lt;FirstName&gt;, are you not?</string>
<string name="9410">Let me see... perhaps it is best if I ask you a question, first. You are a &lt;man/woman&gt; of nature and the wild, &lt;FirstName&gt;, are you not?</string>
<string name="9411">How is it that you came into your calling? Was it an accident? Was it born purely of talent? Do you believe you were fated to be what you are?</string>
<string name="9412">Aye, and no doubt the same could be said for many. Few know that the path they start upon will lead where it does.</string>
<string name="9413">It must be a fine thing to be sure of one&apos;s abilities. I envy you that. For most, the destination is never clear until they arrive.</string>
<string name="9414">Fate is an odd thing, wouldn&apos;t you agree? Crystal clear when behind you, yet evasive and unknowable when before you.</string>
<string name="9415">Ha ha! Well spoken, my friend! What is truly best is only known once it is done, is that not the way of it?</string>
<string name="9416">I, myself, started life as a slave in the southern deserts of Calimshan. Never would I have foreseen that I might become who I am today.</string>
<string name="9417">I knew of the lush and wild jungles of my homeland, Chult, only through the bedtime tales of my mother. I have never laid eyes upon its shore.</string>
<string name="9418">My mother was owned by a most vicious and cruel caliph. As a slave child, one learns to stay out of sight and to move silently, lest one be beaten.</string>
<string name="9419">Moreover, I learned to listen. I listened to the chatter of the servants, the bored talk of the guards. For many, many years I was the shadow in the caliph&apos;s halls.</string>
<string name="9420">For all my hiding, however, I proved of no use to anyone but myself. I could not save my mother when the caliph beat her to death for spilling a tankard of his mead, for instance.</string>
<string name="9421">Aye, though in truth it was I who learned the lesson. I blamed myself for not warning my mother, for not stopping the caliph&apos;s blow.</string>
<string name="9422">I blamed myself, regardless, as the young often do.</string>
<string name="9423">Aye, but such is the life of a slave. I was the caliph&apos;s shadow, however, and I blamed myself for not stopping his blow... young and foolish as I was.</string>
<string name="9424">In grief and anger I stabbed and killed the caliph, and was subsequently chased into the streets of Calimport.</string>
<string name="9425">I am not proud of what I did, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is very easy to say that the man deserved it. Deserved it more than my mother did, at the very least.</string>
<string name="9426">Who am I to say that this is so, however? I was no righteous judge that day... I acted out of retribution and became a wanted murderer in truth. There is no denying that.</string>
<string name="9427">I fled into the shadows of the city... and was not alone, there. I found many who I will call allies and not friends, for we acted in unison only to survive.</string>
<string name="9428">The law pursued me, so always I remained hidden and listened as I once had. The fact that I was a thief to remain alive did not help... and eventually even the shadows of the city were no longer safe for me.</string>
<string name="9429">I sought passage out of the city... and eventually a captain took pity on me and gave me a position aboard his ship. Perhaps you have heard of Randall the Red?</string>
<string name="9430">Aye, that he was... a pirate who&apos;s reputation along the Sword Coast was more than deserved. I joined his crew, though I was no pirate in truth.</string>
<string name="9431">Randall the Red deserved his reputation as a violent and cunning pirate of the swordcoast. While I joined his crew, I was not a pirate as you think of it.</string>
<string name="9432">No? Randall the Red once held quite the reputation as a bloodthirsty pirate of the Sword Coast. I was a member of his crew, though not a pirate as you think of it.</string>
<string name="9433">I was not fond of drink as the other sailors were, and instead spent my time at each port making new contacts, and listening.</string>
<string name="9434">Over the years, Randall grew to depend on my skill. He gave me gold to establish informants throughout the coast, and I heard news the instant it happened.</string>
<string name="9435">It was I who kept Randall safe and one step ahead of his pursuers, for always would I know before the chase was on us.</string>
<string name="9436">Aye. I was his master of spies, though I would not have put a name to it at the time. I was grateful for Randall&apos;s kindness... for despite his reputation, he was an easy man to like.</string>
<string name="9437">I was not truly a pirate. I was his master of spies, though I did not put a name to what I did. And while Randall was indeed a pirate, he was an easy man to like.</string>
<string name="9438">I was not fond of the looting and pillaging Randall indulged in... and did my best to subtly steer him away from the worst of it.</string>
<string name="9439">Randall knew what I was doing and permitted it only because I was otherwise invaluable to him. He cared not if I cringed and turned a cheek when the crew plied the worst of their bloody trade.</string>
<string name="9440">As the years past, I came into a certain amount of my own fame along the Sword Coast. My life was my life, and I was satisfied with it and discharged my duty as best I knew.</string>
<string name="9441">It was not until I encountered Lord Nasher that my life would change forever. That, however, is another tale. Ask me of it some time, my friend.</string>
<string name="9442">And thank you for listening, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As I said, it is not a tale I tell often.</string>
<string name="9443">Ha ha! Perhaps another time, my friend. You made for a fine audience.</string>
<string name="9444">I am sorry you think that. Perhaps that is why I do not tell the tale often.</string>
<string name="9445">Ha ha! Well, my friend... you did ask.</string>
<string name="9446"></string>
<string name="9447"></string>
<string name="9448">Ha! Of that I have no doubt.</string>
<string name="9449"></string>
<string name="9450">Is that so? I have not had someone eagerly asking me such since... well, never. Usually I am not so, how shall we say, available?</string>
<string name="9451">So be it. You will recall, I hope, that I made the majority of my early fame as the spymaster for the infamous Randall the Red, aye?</string>
<string name="9452">That life continued much unabated. Our ship found safe harborage in Luskan, and Randall plagued the Neverwinter trade lines endlessly.</string>
<string name="9453">Lord Nasher was not always the aged man you know now. When I first encountered him he was a man in his prime... a veteran of the sword and in possession of a brilliant mind.</string>
<string name="9454">Lord Nasher vowed to end Randall&apos;s reign over the waterways. He personally sailed from Neverwinter to seek and destroy our ship.</string>
<string name="9455">Perhaps. Once, however, Lord Nasher was reknown as the greatest lord of the north. The very idea that he was personally chasing us frightened the crew and gave Randall pause.</string>
<string name="9456">I was still a young man at the time, my friend. Our Lord Nasher already had a lifetime of adventure behind him and was the greatest lord of the north.</string>
<string name="9457">Of course not. I owed him much, and did not know this Lord Nasher at all. He was, however, the greatest lord of the north... and his personal attention gave Randall pause.</string>
<string name="9458">Not at first, no. Lord Nasher was the greatest lord of the North at the time, however, and his personal attention frightened the crew and gave Randall considerable pause.</string>
<string name="9459">For two years we sparred, he and I. It was all I could do to discover his ingenious plots to find Randall just in time to avoid them. Never had I labored so.</string>
<string name="9460">Once he even disguised himself and his men as Waukeenar priestesses shipping gold to Amn, knowing that would draw Randall like a moth to the flame.</string>
<string name="9461">Only at the last moment did I give in to my suspicions and warn Randall from their ship. It was a very close thing, however.</string>
<string name="9462">In the end, it was I who betrayed Randall. He grew more desperate and more violent, plundering ships and killing all aboard. This he had never done before.</string>
<string name="9463">When next the shadows told me of Lord Nasher&apos;s latest plot, I... did nothing. I waited silently and watched as Nasher&apos;s men sprung from Randall&apos;s latest target.</string>
<string name="9464">Randall was no true friend. I owed him much, and had repaid that and more. I had a choice to make, however... would you have done differently?</string>
<string name="9465">Randall was no true friend. He made use of me, and I had needed him. It was a choice I had to make, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and it was no easy one.</string>
<string name="9466">Truly? I am surprised, then, for I could not do other than what I believed to be right. You and I must be very different people.</string>
<string name="9467">I am no longer in the mood for tales, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It is enough for you to know that I came to serve Lord Nasher after that.</string>
<string name="9468"></string>
<string name="9469">I suppose that is all I can expect. I, myself, could not do other than what I believed to be right. It was not an easy choice to make.</string>
<string name="9470">I am glad to hear that. It was not a simple choice to make.</string>
<string name="9471">I fully expected to be executed, and waited grimly as I was rounded up with the rest of Randall&apos;s men. My fate, as I saw it, was sealed.</string>
<string name="9472">I waited a long time in the dungeons of Castle Never. The first man who came to my dark prison, however, was none other than Lord Nasher himself.</string>
<string name="9473">He was very intense and charismatic... and suspicious. I was, after all, a well-known pirate, yes? He asked me only one question:</string>
<string name="9474">&quot;Why did you not warn Randall the Red of my attack?&quot;</string>
<string name="9475">I told him that even though I served Randall I could not allow what he was doing to continue. Lord Nasher seemed surprised by my answer.</string>
<string name="9476">&quot;So you would betray any man you served if you did not agree with his actions?&quot; he asked me. And I had only one answer.</string>
<string name="9477">I said I would betray any man who I felt was wrong, and my only regret was that I had waited as long as I did with Randall.</string>
<string name="9478">He smiled at me... and said that he only hoped that if he did something wrong that I would tell him first.</string>
<string name="9479">I asked him if this meant I was to serve him now. To that he said no... I was to serve Neverwinter. That was to be my sentence.</string>
<string name="9480">I am twenty years into my sentence now, my friend, and I have been thankful for each year of it.</string>
<string name="9481">That he is, my friend, that he is. And Neverwinter is a place I love. I could not have found a prison that suited me better.</string>
<string name="9482">Not truly, my friend. I have come to admire Lord Nasher and love Neverwinter with all my heart. It is a prison that suits me well.</string>
<string name="9483">Perhaps. I am glad I did not, for Lord Nasher is the best of men, and Neverwinter a prison that I have grown to love.</string>
<string name="9484">And had I left, I never would have met my Calli... I... </string>
<string name="9485">It is not your concern, and I should not have mentioned her. Regardless, my tale is done.</string>
<string name="9486">It is... nothing, my friend. Something best forgotten that I... should not have brought up.</string>
<string name="9487"></string>
<string name="9488"></string>
<string name="9489"></string>
<string name="9490">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *Sigh* I suppose one cannot leave the story unfinished. As you wish, then, my friend.</string>
<string name="9491"></string>
<string name="9492">Calli is short for Calliara. She was of elven blood, as you are... a woman of extraordinary beauty and adventuresome spirit.</string>
<string name="9493">Calli is short for Calliara. She was of elven blood... a woman of extraordinary beauty and adventuresome spirit.</string>
<string name="9494">She ran the guild of thieves in Neverwinter, you see, when I first began my sentence. She was also the first task Lord Nasher set me to.</string>
<string name="9495">I was to see to her capture, and to reduce the power of the guild in the city... and I was eager enough to do so, though I did not know what I was up against.</string>
<string name="9496">Not at all. For quite some time, she and I were the most dire of foes. Calliara stirred her entire guild against me, and assassins stalked my every step.</string>
<string name="9497">Not at first. She and I became the most dire of foes. Calliara stirred the guild against me, and assassins stalked my every step.</string>
<string name="9498">You joke, although you should know it was no romance at first. Calliara and I were the most dire of enemies, and she stirred her entire guild against me.</string>
<string name="9499">The thieves had been used to holding power in the city and did not care to be dislodged. I used every trick I knew to no avail.</string>
<string name="9500">Finally I chose to disguise myself and infiltrate her guild, determined to look upon my foe and end her life personally.</string>
<string name="9501">It took me a great deal of time to do so. Calliara trusted few, and I had to work my way up in the ranks over time until I was able to enter her inner circle.</string>
<string name="9502"></string>
<string name="9503">No, not at all. I killed her.</string>
<string name="9504">Not at first, no. Not until I killed her.</string>
<string name="9505">Aye. I should have done it sooner, when I was first trusted enough to be alone in her presence... but I was too intrigued and foolish.</string>
<string name="9506">She enthralled me. I found her soul so similar to my own, and we drew together immediately. Despite my misgivings, I gave in and allowed myself to love her.</string>
<string name="9507">I knew it would not last. I discovered her plan to kill Lord Nasher, and knew that the time had come to tell her who I was. It was my hope to dissuade her from her life.</string>
<string name="9508">No, I didn&apos;t. I didn&apos;t think I could. She was not angry, as I thought she would be... merely disappointed as she drew her sword.</string>
<string name="9509">She was not angry, as I thought she would be. Merely disappointed, perhaps, as she drew her sword.</string>
<string name="9510">I had little choice. My heart sank because I knew she would never surrender. She was not angry with me, as I thought she would be... merely disappointed as she drew her sword.</string>
<string name="9511">To strike her down was almost unthinkable. As we parried, I begged her to reconsider, to leave her life... to stay with me, and I would protect her from Lord Nasher&apos;s wrath.</string>
<string name="9512">&quot;I will not change for you, Aarin... even as you would not change for me. Let it end here.&quot;</string>
<string name="9513">Though tears blurred my eyes, upon those words I ran her through. She died moments later, as we exchanged one... final kiss.</string>
<string name="9514">Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have... never told another that tale.</string>
<string name="9515">I did not expect you to understand. Perhaps I should have known better than to share my tale.</string>
<string name="9516"></string>
<string name="9517">She would not leave, my friend. Nor stop her plans. It was not in her to do so, just as I would not have were our roles reversed. And I could not let her succeed.</string>
<string name="9518">Though it broke my heart, my path was clear and fated to be. I must... accept that. Can you understand, my friend, even if you do not agree?</string>
<string name="9519">I am glad to have shared it with you. You are an intriguing woman, yourself... I consider myself fortunate to have been assigned to you.</string>
<string name="9520">Perhaps in time we might get to know one another better. As... as good friends. Would you... would you care at all for that, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="9521">There are few that I would call friend, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I would be pleased to name you amongst them.</string>
<string name="9522"></string>
<string name="9523"></string>
<string name="9524"></string>
<string name="9525">Now you make fun of me. So be it, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I shall speak plainly.</string>
<string name="9526">Aye, perhaps I do at that. Perhaps to maintain what dignity I have, then, I should speak plainly.</string>
<string name="9527">(sigh) I see you know me too well, now. Very well, then... I shall speak plainly.</string>
<string name="9528">I am... not accustomed to dealing closely with others. I am too used to the shadows, remaining unknown and unknowable.</string>
<string name="9529">You, however, have forced me to re-examine that part of myself. I... find myself keenly aware of you... of your absence when you leave, and I fear for your safety... I fear that you might not return.</string>
<string name="9530"></string>
<string name="9531">Aye, for you are a marvel of a woman. Powerful, competent and full of courage... easily the equal of any man, and I admire you for it.</string>
<string name="9532">Though I need not fear for you. Indeed, you are a marvel of a woman... powerful, competent and full of courage. Easily the equal of any man, and I admire you for it.</string>
<string name="9533">But I fear there are still dark times ahead where even your power and courage will be tested.</string>
<string name="9534">The shadows about you may become such that you fear you are alone and cannot find your way out of them.</string>
<string name="9535">Take this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It was given to me by my mother long ago, so that she knew I would always find my way out of the shadows. Take it and be reminded that there is one who prays for your safe return.</string>
<string name="9536"></string>
<string name="9537">Then say nothing, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Take it in the spirit with which it is meant.</string>
<string name="9538">Aye, I know that you will.</string>
<string name="9539"></string>
<string name="9540">As you wish. Is there something else I could answer?</string>
<string name="9541">Then why did you ask? Surely you must have better things to do.</string>
<string name="9542">Back to more important matters, is there something you needed?</string>
<string name="9543">Of course. What else would you have of me?</string>
<string name="9544">I am not here to amuse you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, nor are you here to amuse me. Ask me of something other than myself.</string>
<string name="9545">Your original question has been answered, I hope. Let us return to the topic of your mission and... speak no more of me, today.</string>
<string name="9546">I appreciate your kindness, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps another time I will be more willing to speak of it.</string>
<string name="9547">Since I do not wish to speak of it, I have no trouble with that.</string>
<string name="9548">Then allow me to end it here. You need hear no more, I am sure.</string>
<string name="9549">Regardless, let us return to the topic of your mission and speak of me no more.</string>
<string name="9550">Perhaps, in time, I might come to hear your tale. For now, however, there is much to do.</string>
<string name="9551">I... I see. Please excuse me if I seemed... forward. Perhaps it is best if we turn to another subject, then.</string>
<string name="9552">I am pleased. Of course, there is much else that needs to be done. Perhaps we can speak of this another time.</string>
<string name="9553">I... nothing, my friend. Please... ignore that I said anything. I have clearly overstepped my bounds. Let us speak of something else.</string>
<string name="9554">I... I see. Please forgive me, my friend. Clearly I have overstepped my bounds. Let us... speak of something else.</string>
<string name="9555">Let us speak of other things, then... for you have much to do.</string>
<string name="9556">What exactly are Lord Nasher&apos;s orders?</string>
<string name="9557">What be Lord Nasher&apos;s orders?</string>
<string name="9558">I am more concerned about how you are holding up.</string>
<string name="9559">Me more concern about you, not orders.</string>
<string name="9560">What do you think I should do now?</string>
<string name="9561">What you think me should do?</string>
<string name="9562">I have some questions about this mission.</string>
<string name="9563">Me has questions about mission.</string>
<string name="9564">How are you feeling? This must be a terrible strain.</string>
<string name="9565">How you feel? This all big headache, no?</string>
<string name="9566">Do you have any advice for me?</string>
<string name="9567">You haves advice, maybe?</string>
<string name="9568">You want to find this cult badly, do you?</string>
<string name="9569">You wants to find cult badly, huh?</string>
<string name="9570">I&apos;ll go now.</string>
<string name="9571">Me go now.</string>
<string name="9572">What are you and Aarin Gend going to be doing here while I search?</string>
<string name="9573">What you and spymaster doing here while me searches?</string>
<string name="9574">How do you propose I look for this cult?</string>
<string name="9575">How does I looks for cult?</string>
<string name="9576">What should I do if I discover something?</string>
<string name="9577">What me do if I finds something out?</string>
<string name="9578">Why are we not searching more in Neverwinter?</string>
<string name="9579">Why we not searching more in city?</string>
<string name="9580">Just what do we know about this cult?</string>
<string name="9581">What we knows about cult, anyway?</string>
<string name="9582">I want to ask something else.</string>
<string name="9583">Me has other question.</string>
<string name="9584">I have located some information about the cult.</string>
<string name="9585">Me find out stuff about cult.</string>
<string name="9586">That sounds like a dangerous task.</string>
<string name="9587">Enter tower? It sound mighty dangerous.</string>
<string name="9588">Can I expect some help? Will you be coming with me?</string>
<string name="9589">Me get help? You coming, too?</string>
<string name="9590">How will I get into the tower?</string>
<string name="9591">How me get into tower? You know?</string>
<string name="9592">I&apos;ll do my best.</string>
<string name="9593">Me go now, then.</string>
<string name="9594">What do you mean? What plans?</string>
<string name="9595">What you mean? What you plan?</string>
<string name="9596">You look tired. Have you not been sleeping well?</string>
<string name="9597">You looks tired. You not sleeps good?</string>
<string name="9598">Aarin says you have been having disturbing dreams.</string>
<string name="9599">Aarin say you haves bad dreams.</string>
<string name="9600">You said I should ask you how you became a paladin.</string>
<string name="9601">You say me should ask how you become paladin.</string>
<string name="9602">You seem angry. Is something wrong?</string>
<string name="9603">You looks angry. Is something wrong?</string>
<string name="9604">Aarin mentioned that you&apos;ve been very short of temper.</string>
<string name="9605">Aarin say you very angry all the time.</string>
<string name="9606">Everyone can make a mistake, Aribeth, even for the best reasons.</string>
<string name="9607">Fenthick was a fool to follow his duty so blindly.</string>
<string name="9608">It is very sad, what happened to him. I am sorry for your loss.</string>
<string name="9609">Don&apos;t be so naive. Not everyone is as caught up in duty and goodness as you are.</string>
<string name="9610">Even a paladin has a heart, Aribeth... you can&apos;t be the avatar of justice all the time.</string>
<string name="9611">I don&apos;t really have anything to say about that.</string>
<string name="9612">All can makes mistake, even me knows that.</string>
<string name="9613">Fenthick was dummy to only see duty.</string>
<string name="9614">Yes, is all very sad. Me sorry.</string>
<string name="9615">Pfft. You naive. Nobody thinks duty everything like you.</string>
<string name="9616">You haves heart, Aribeth... you not be perfect.</string>
<string name="9617">Me not haves anything to say &apos;bout that.</string>
<string name="9618">Don&apos;t let feelings blind you to the truth about Fenthick, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="9619">You feelings is blinding you &apos;bout Fenthick, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="9620">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; No, go on. Tell me what you were going to say.</string>
<string name="9621">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; No, you speak. Tells me what you going to say.</string>
<string name="9622">Just make sure this doesn&apos;t come up again.</string>
<string name="9623">You makes sure this don&apos;t come up again, then.</string>
<string name="9624"></string>
<string name="9625"></string>
<string name="9626">Yes, it is. You should pull yourself together.</string>
<string name="9627">No, you&apos;re being too hard on yourself, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="9628">It is never wrong to question. What&apos;s important are your answers.</string>
<string name="9629">I can&apos;t answer that for you, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="9630">Yes. You shoulds get head together.</string>
<string name="9631">You be too hard on youself.</string>
<string name="9632">Is not wrong to ask. What answer is, is important.</string>
<string name="9633">Me cannot answer for you, Miss Aribeth.</string>
<string name="9634">No, he didn&apos;t.</string>
<string name="9635">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes, he did, actually.</string>
<string name="9636">No, he no tell me anything.</string>
<string name="9637">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes, he dids.</string>
<string name="9638">No, it&apos;s not surprising at all.</string>
<string name="9639">These dreams are disturbing enough to keep you from sleep?</string>
<string name="9640">What sorts of things do the servants claim you say?</string>
<string name="9641">Perhaps you&apos;ve gone mad. Completely cracked.</string>
<string name="9642">No, is no surprise.</string>
<string name="9643">Dreams is disturbing and you no sleep?</string>
<string name="9644">What servants say you speak in sleep?</string>
<string name="9645">Maybe you gone mad, a crazy woman.</string>
<string name="9646"></string>
<string name="9647">You don&apos;t sound very convinced.</string>
<string name="9648"></string>
<string name="9649">You no sounds convinced.</string>
<string name="9650">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Why don&apos;t you tell me about these dreams? Maybe it will help.</string>
<string name="9651"></string>
<string name="9652">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Why don&apos;t you tell me about these dreams? Maybe it will help.</string>
<string name="9653">Have you considered that maybe it&apos;s more serious than that?</string>
<string name="9654">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me &apos;bout dreams. Maybe it help.</string>
<string name="9655">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; Tell me &apos;bout dreams. Maybe it help.</string>
<string name="9656"></string>
<string name="9657">You think maybes it more serious?</string>
<string name="9658">That&apos;s understandable. They would frighten me, as well.</string>
<string name="9659">Obviously something is seriously wrong with you.</string>
<string name="9660">It is only fears and worries dredged up by your mind, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="9661">I don&apos;t know what to say about that.</string>
<string name="9662">Is okay. Me would be scared, too.</string>
<string name="9663">Something big wrong with you, maybe.</string>
<string name="9664">It only you mind full of fear and worry, me think.</string>
<string name="9665">Me not know what to say.</string>
<string name="9666">Perhaps I&apos;m wrong, then. I&apos;m sorry.</string>
<string name="9667">Deny it if you wish, Aribeth, it&apos;s not natural.</string>
<string name="9668">I&apos;m no fool, Aribeth... and neither should you be!</string>
<string name="9669">Maybe me wrong. Me sorry.</string>
<string name="9670">You say it wrong if you likes... it not normal.</string>
<string name="9671">Me no fool. You should no be fool, neither.</string>
<string name="9672">No, I want to hear it.</string>
<string name="9673">I&apos;ll let you know if I get bored, don&apos;t worry.</string>
<string name="9674">Maybe some other time, then.</string>
<string name="9675">No, me wants to hear it.</string>
<string name="9676">Me let you know if I gets bored, you no worry.</string>
<string name="9677">Okay, me hears later.</string>
<string name="9678">That doesn&apos;t sound like you at all.</string>
<string name="9679">How did you become a paladin after that?</string>
<string name="9680">Okay, getting bored now... </string>
<string name="9681">That no sound like you.</string>
<string name="9682">How you be paladin after that?</string>
<string name="9683">Okay, me gettings bored... </string>
<string name="9684">Who was the man who saved you?</string>
<string name="9685">The man who saved you... that was Tyr?</string>
<string name="9686">You&apos;re right, this is a long story.</string>
<string name="9687">Who man that save you?</string>
<string name="9688">Man who save you... is Tyr?</string>
<string name="9689">You is right, is long story.</string>
<string name="9690">No, I&apos;m only joking.</string>
<string name="9691">Yes, maybe I&apos;ll hear this later.</string>
<string name="9692">No, me just joke.</string>
<string name="9693">Yes, me hear later.</string>
<string name="9694">What happened then?</string>
<string name="9695">You became a cleric, then, like Fenthick?</string>
<string name="9696">So you think Tyr, himself, commanded you to worship him?</string>
<string name="9697">What happen then?</string>
<string name="9698">You becomes cleric? Like Fenthick?</string>
<string name="9699">So you thinks Tyr tell you to worships him?</string>
<string name="9700">I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to sadden you.</string>
<string name="9701">So were those dreams like the ones you have now?</string>
<string name="9702">You&apos;re not going to cry again, are you?</string>
<string name="9703">Okay, story over. Let&apos;s talk about something else.</string>
<string name="9704">Me sorry... not mean to make you sad.</string>
<string name="9705">Those dreams like dreams now?</string>
<string name="9706">You not goings to cry again, me hope.</string>
<string name="9707">Okay, story is done. We talk &apos;bout something else.</string>
<string name="9708">What has changed?</string>
<string name="9709">What change?</string>
<string name="9710">I do.</string>
<string name="9711">I don&apos;t need another friend.</string>
<string name="9712">Whoa... slow down there, lady!</string>
<string name="9713">Does this mean we can go to bed soon?</string>
<string name="9714">Me does.</string>
<string name="9715">Me need no more friends.</string>
<string name="9716">Whoa! You be very forward!</string>
<string name="9717">Uhh... this mean we goes to bed soon?</string>
<string name="9718">But Fenthick was involved in the deaths of thousands of people!</string>
<string name="9719">Perhaps it&apos;s Fenthick you should be angry at.</string>
<string name="9720">And what should have happened, do you think?</string>
<string name="9721">Maybe you should be angry.</string>
<string name="9722">I don&apos;t like hearing you talk like this.</string>
<string name="9723">But Fenthick help kill many people!</string>
<string name="9724">Maybe you shoulds be mad at Fenthick.</string>
<string name="9725">What you thinks should have happen?</string>
<string name="9726">Maybe is okay you are angry.</string>
<string name="9727">Me no like hearing you speaks like this.</string>
<string name="9728">You sound as if you&apos;re losing your faith.</string>
<string name="9729">What brought this on, all of a sudden?</string>
<string name="9730">Don&apos;t talk like that! Stop it, this isn&apos;t like you!</string>
<string name="9731">Finally I think you&apos;re seeing the light!</string>
<string name="9732">You sounds like you loses faith.</string>
<string name="9733">Why you act like this now?</string>
<string name="9734">You no talk like that! This not you!</string>
<string name="9735">Finally me thinks you sees the light!</string>
<string name="9736">The dreams have gotten worse?</string>
<string name="9737">This is bad. Perhaps we should return to Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="9738">I think you really may be going mad!</string>
<string name="9739">I have almost had enough of your constant angst.</string>
<string name="9740">Dreams worse now?</string>
<string name="9741">This bad. We shoulds go to Neverwinter.</string>
<string name="9742">Me thinks you go mad!</string>
<string name="9743">Me have almost enough of you bellyacheing.</string>
<string name="9744">I promise.</string>
<string name="9745">I can&apos;t promise that, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="9746">I don&apos;t think that will help you.</string>
<string name="9747">You are mad!</string>
<string name="9748">Me promise.</string>
<string name="9749">Me can no promise that!</string>
<string name="9750">I no think this helps you, Aribeth.</string>
<string name="9751">You is mad!</string>
<string name="9752">What do you mean?</string>
<string name="9753">Very well, I will take it.</string>
<string name="9754">No, I don&apos;t want it.</string>
<string name="9755">What you mean?</string>
<string name="9756">Okay, me take it.</string>
<string name="9757">No, me not want it.</string>
<string name="9758">It is good to see you here in Port Llast, my friend. If we are to have any luck in tracking down this strange cult behind the plague, it will be with your aid I am sure.</string>
<string name="9759">I do not know how much you have been told about Lord Nasher&apos;s orders. I shall help you understand whatever I can, certainly.</string>
<string name="9760">Perhaps allow me to explain exactly what Lord Nasher wishes of us. Yes, perhaps that would make our path more plain.</string>
<string name="9761">You know, of course, that Desther and... and Fenthick... were associated with some manner of religious cult that was behind the Wailing Death in the city.</string>
<string name="9762">We know so little about this cult... and it would be foolish in the extreme to suppose that simply because their activities in Neverwinter have been stopped, that they have been defeated.</string>
<string name="9763">Lord Nasher commands that we track down the headquarters of this cult, and discover their plans... and stop them, before another atrocity is committed.</string>
<string name="9764">Aarin Gend, Lord Nasher&apos;s spymaster, is here in Port Llast to help us do this... and has brought reports of many strange activities throughout the northern lands.</string>
<string name="9765">It is possible that agents of the cult may be behind some of these activities. If so, we may be able to find them and discover where their base is located. Your aid in this, &lt;FirstName&gt;, will prove invaluable.</string>
<string name="9766">How I feel is... unimportant, &lt;FirstName&gt;, next to the mission we have been given. Please, allow me to explain what is required of us.</string>
<string name="9767">Of course. Ask what you will of me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9768">I am here to see that Lord Nasher&apos;s commands are carried out, while Aarin continues to use his network of spies to gain more information beyond Neverwinter&apos;s walls.</string>
<string name="9769">Admittedly, my own role seems sparse. Part of me thinks that my Lord Nasher simply wishes someone he trusts in this role... while another believes he does not wish to be reminded of Fenthick or my pain.</string>
<string name="9770">Regardless, we will do all that we can to help you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Do not think your efforts go unrecognized.</string>
<string name="9771">Aarin has several ideas on places where the cult may be hidden. Currently he is working on finding a way into the city of Luskan... its gates have been sealed since the plague in Neverwinter began.</string>
<string name="9772">I suggest you talk to Aarin about where these places might be. Search for any clues about the rise of ancient cults or odd activities. Once a way into Luskan is found, you can search there, as well.</string>
<string name="9773">If we are fortunate, you will perhaps encounter some part of the cult and gain information as to who they are and where they are based.</string>
<string name="9774">Any information you discover should be brought to Aarin and myself. Once we know more about the cult, Lord Nasher can decide what to do next.</string>
<string name="9775">The search does continue within the city, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Indeed, Lord Nasher is having Neverwinter scoured thoroughly for more traces of the cult.</string>
<string name="9776">It is his feeling, however, that the true force of the cult lies outside of Neverwinter... and that it is your efforts here that will prove the most valuable.</string>
<string name="9777">Desther appears to have been their link in Neverwinter, as you discovered, but of the cult itself we have been able to ascertain little.</string>
<string name="9778">Aarin is positive that its true heart lies outside of Neverwinter, and that it has yet to show us the extent of its strength.</string>
<string name="9779">The task ahead of us will, no doubt, be most dangerous... but that makes it all the more necessary that we do not remain ignorant of what this cult is and what it intends.</string>
<string name="9780">Certainly.</string>
<string name="9781">I would suggest you speak to Aarin Gend and find out where to focus your efforts in finding evidence of the cult.</string>
<string name="9782"> I wish there were better leads we could send you on, &lt;FirstName&gt;, to track down the cult... but Aarin&apos;s information is the best we have.</string>
<string name="9783">All I can suggest is that you visit the locales Aarin has mentioned and keep your ears open for unusual activities.</string>
<string name="9784">Not everything that is unusual will be the doing of this cult, obviously... but they are out there, and active, so there is always a good chance you will discover them if you are alert.</string>
<string name="9785">Your information tells us that the cult likely lies within the Host Tower in Luskan. You need to find a way to gain entrance into Luskan and into the tower, itself.</string>
<string name="9786">Aarin should be able to help you toward that end. We will both meet you in the city, afterwards, to help you further.</string>
<string name="9787">Then I wish you luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9788">As you wish.</string>
<string name="9789">Go with Tyr&apos;s blessing, then, &lt;FirstName&gt;... and be safe.</string>
<string name="9790">Then I wish you well, my friend. Return to me as soon as you can.</string>
<string name="9791"></string>
<string name="9792"></string>
<string name="9793"></string>
<string name="9794">You will need to get into Luskan and enter the Host Tower, itself. Speak to Aarin... hopefully he will have some ideas on how you can go about this. </string>
<string name="9795">Without a doubt. You have faced tasks of similar danger, however, and excelled... and will no doubt face much worse before this threat is ended.</string>
<string name="9796">You did agree to aid Lord Nasher, did you not? Whatever your reasons, I find it hard to believe that you expected this to be very simple.</string>
<string name="9797">Both Aarin and I will join you in Luskan, of course. Aarin will be there to help you enter the tower, &lt;FirstName&gt;. As for me, I have... other plans.</string>
<string name="9798">I am sorry, but I... cannot tell you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Please do not ask me to.</string>
<string name="9799">My plans are my own. You have your own mission to worry about, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9800">I wish I could tell you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I cannot. I have... little choice in the matter. Please just... do as you are asked to.</string>
<string name="9801">Speak to Aarin Gend, as I said. With luck, he will have a plan to not only get you into the city but into the tower, itself.</string>
<string name="9802">Very well. Go and speak to Aarin, then. May... Tyr watch your path, &lt;FirstName&gt;. May Tyr watch over us all.</string>
<string name="9803">Go, then, and speak to Aarin. I hope that... I wish... no, nevermind. Be safe, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9804">It is of vital importance that you complete Lord Nasher&apos;s mission, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Much depends on you discovering what else Desther&apos;s allies have planned.</string>
<string name="9805">I am pleased to see that you remain safe, my friend. Lord Nasher tells me he is confident of your success, though I do worry at the danger in which you place yourself.</string>
<string name="9806">It is good to see you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. At times I worry that you have taken on too much responsibility yourself, yet always you surprise me with your resourcefulness and success.</string>
<string name="9807">Have you yet discovered any new information on the cult?</string>
<string name="9808">We need to gain admittance into Luskan to follow your lead about the Host Tower. Speak to Aarin Gend... he has a plan to get you into the city.</string>
<string name="9809">My strain should not surprise you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My only love lies dead, and while it was my lawful Lord who executed him, his true murderers remain beyond my reach.</string>
<string name="9810">Are you a fool to ask me that? My only love lies dead, executed as a traitor, and his true murderers lie completely beyond my reach!</string>
<string name="9811">Aye, it is, as I am sure you can well imagine. Fenthick... my only love... dead at the hands of my lawful liege. His true murderers, however, lie invisibly beyond my reach.</string>
<string name="9812">Would you not feel the same, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I remained passive while my love was executed, and this wretched cult remains invisible and impervious to my wrath.</string>
<string name="9813">Do you believe me without feelings, without a heart? I wish I could descend upon these madmen with all my pain and fury... yet they are invisible and beyond my reach.</string>
<string name="9814">You would never understand, I am sure! My heart cries out with the pain of watching my true love murdered, it wishes justice and is denied!</string>
<string name="9815">I wish, with such fervor that it frightens me, to see those allies of Desther pay - to see Tyr visit them with terrible justice!</string>
<string name="9816">But... perhaps you mean well enough by your question. I apologize if I have misjudged your intent.</string>
<string name="9817">I am a paladin of Tyr, sworn to uphold good and justice... yet somehow I cannot condemn Fenthick in my heart. He meant only to do what he saw was his duty, I am sure of it.</string>
<string name="9818">Aye, a mistake... but it is more than that, isn&apos;t it? Fenthick was hanged for treason, disgraced in the eyes of his lord and his god.</string>
<string name="9819">Harsh words, but... but perhaps there is a ring of truth to them. It was Fenthick&apos;s own dedication that led to his downfall.</string>
<string name="9820">A fool, you say? What do you know of him? You judge him like all the others have judged him, without stopping to consider what was truly in his heart!</string>
<string name="9821">I... thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That is kind of you to say. My own loss seems insignificant, however, compared to Fenthick&apos;s disgrace.</string>
<string name="9822">Naive, am I? I am a paladin, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and my duty is part of who I am, not some trivial preoccupation!</string>
<string name="9823">I would expect that you, above all others, would be aware of that. I would have hoped that you would not judge Fenthick like all the others have.</string>
<string name="9824">But of course you do not understand me any better than Fenthick, so you judge him just like all the others have!</string>
<string name="9825">But of course I should expect such a response from someone of your creed. How could I expect you to understand me, nevermind Fenthick?</string>
<string name="9826">But as a paladin I am supposed to hold myself above such earthly concerns. I am supposed to know my path and be sure of it... just as Fenthick did. Or thought he did.</string>
<string name="9827">Is it I who am blind, &lt;FirstName&gt;? If I am, to which truth am I blind about? Fenthick was hanged for treason, but I know there was no treason in his heart.</string>
<string name="9828">I am not blinded, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If anything, my eyes have been opened. You judge Fenthick just as everyone else has.</string>
<string name="9829">No, of course not. Nor would I expect you to. Please forgive me, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I have a duty of my own to attend to, and I should remain focussed on it.</string>
<string name="9830">It... ah, but I should not be distracting you from your task, &lt;FirstName&gt;. My own problems are unimportant and of no interest to you, I am sure. Please forgive me.</string>
<string name="9831">If what&apos;s in our hearts does not matter, then what happened to Fenthick could happen to anyone... you, me, anyone.</string>
<string name="9832">Then all our time spent dedicating ourselves to... ahhh, this gets me nowhere. There are far more important events to attend to than my own ills.</string>
<string name="9833">Let us return to the matter at hand, &lt;FirstName&gt;... namely, your task. That is far more important and I will not distract you from it further.</string>
<string name="9834"></string>
<string name="9835">Then I will be sure not to. Let us return to the topic of your task, then.</string>
<string name="9836"></string>
<string name="9837">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; It... it is just that Fenthick&apos;s fate could have been mine. Or yours. Or anyone&apos;s. How do you know that the path you walk is the correct one?</string>
<string name="9838">I have never questioned my faith or my duty before. But neither did Fenthick. I feel... doubt, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I am ashamed to admit it.</string>
<string name="9839">Perhaps I am merely wallowing in my sorrow, perhaps I know my path better than I think I do, but I am no longer sure. Is it wrong for me to think such thoughts?</string>
<string name="9840">Yes, I... I suppose you are correct, &lt;FirstName&gt;, this is getting me nowhere. I should put these questions out of my mind for the time being.</string>
<string name="9841">Am I? All my training and instincts as a paladin tell me I am not being hard enough. Perhaps it is best if I put these thoughts out of my mind, for now.</string>
<string name="9842">Yet I have no answers, only more questions. (sigh) Thank you for allowing me to unburden my heart, but perhaps it is best if I put these thoughts out of my head, for now.</string>
<string name="9843">No, I suppose not. It is something I must think on... but not now. It is best if I put these thoughts out of my head for the time being.</string>
<string name="9844">The safety of Neverwinter relies on your mission, and my duty regarding that is more than clear. Let us speak of that, instead.</string>
<string name="9845">Why do you ask me that, &lt;FirstName&gt;? The spymaster put you up to this, didn&apos;t he?</string>
<string name="9846">I see. I suppose my state is obvious enough. Aarin is far more concerned than is warranted, however... certainly a few bad dreams are not a reason to become alarmed.</string>
<string name="9847">Aarin is a dear man, but I find his concern over my lack of sleep to be somewhat unnecessary. Surely a few dreams are nothing to be alarmed of.</string>
<string name="9848">The servants claim I speak in my sleep and say frightening things. They creep about me cautiously like I have gone mad, and Aarin pays their superstitious twitterings far more heed than he should.</string>
<string name="9849">After all that has happened with the plague and... and Fenthick, I think a disturbing dream or two is not so surprising, wouldn&apos;t you agree, &lt;FirstName&gt;?</string>
<string name="9850">Finally, someone with some sense! I keep telling Aarin that these strange dreams are nothing to be concerned over, but he insists on treating me like an invalid.</string>
<string name="9851">These dreams shall... they shall pass, in time. There are far more important matters to worry over than how I am sleeping.</string>
<string name="9852">Gone mad, have I? Some restless nights caused by more sorrow than my heart can bear and suddenly I am some raving harpy to be handled with padded gloves?</string>
<string name="9853">I should have known better than to discuss such a matter with you. Let us return to the topic of your mission and speak of this no more.</string>
<string name="9854">The dreams are simply dreams, no doubt caused by more sorrow than my heart can bear. I will not discuss them... especially not with you.</string>
<string name="9855">Let us return to the topic of your mission, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and speak of this no more.</string>
<string name="9856">Now you, too? Has the world gone mad, or is it me? These dreams are... disturbing and frightening, but... they shall pass! They are my burden to bear and no one else&apos;s.</string>
<string name="9857"></string>
<string name="9858">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; *Sigh* Perhaps you are right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Having the perspective of another on these dreams may not be a bad idea.</string>
<string name="9859"></string>
<string name="9860">These dreams are... strange. I&apos;ll grant you that. But these are not exactly normal times for me, either.</string>
<string name="9861">I... I am falling, in the dream. Always falling. Surrounded by a heavy blackness which chokes and drowns me. Grasping hands reach out to me, and the voices... a cacophony of whispers that plead to me for help.</string>
<string name="9862">And... and then I see a shrouded figure. It is Fenthick. He is walking away from me and I run to catch him, but always he eludes me in the darkness.</string>
<string name="9863">The voices get so much louder. They are accusing me, blaming me, and I... I feel ashamed, though I do not know what I am being blamed for. I cry out for help, for them to stop their assault, but I go unheeded.</string>
<string name="9864">And then I catch up to the figure... and I see that it is not Fenthick. He turns and gazes at me with sad eyes... and I know it is Tyr... and then my god turns his back on me.</string>
<string name="9865">These... these are my dreams, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps now you can understand why I have not wished to discuss them. I am... frightened... of what they may mean.</string>
<string name="9866">That&apos;s kind of you to say, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I am glad I told you, at least... it makes the dreams seem a bit smaller, now.</string>
<string name="9867">I do feel better for it, thank you. Hah... I am reminded, a little, of how I was introduced to the paladin life. You should ask me to tell you the tale, sometime.</string>
<string name="9868">Until then, however, let&apos;s return to the subject of your task. That is something we can focus on, at least.</string>
<string name="9869">It&apos;s all right, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There isn&apos;t much that can be said, is there? But... I am glad I told you. It makes the dreams seem a bit smaller, somehow.</string>
<string name="9870">Such as? I am going mad? Or I am under the influence of evil magic, perhaps? Don&apos;t tell me you subscribe to the same superstitious prattle as the servants!</string>
<string name="9871">No... I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I should not be so... quick to find my temper. I do want you to be honest, and it is good to talk about the dreams, at least.</string>
<string name="9872">I think you are over-reacting... but I do want you to be honest. Perhaps I should consider what you say. It does feel better to talk about the dreams, at least.</string>
<string name="9873">I deny nothing. But I do feel sorry for having discussed this in the first place. Let us return to the topic of your mission and not speak of my dreams again.</string>
<string name="9874">If I&apos;m a fool, it is only for discussing my dreams with you in the first place! Let us return to the topic of your mission and not speak of this further.</string>
<string name="9875">I did say that, didn&apos;t I? Are you sure you wish to hear the tale? It is not an exciting one, and I would not wish to bore you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.</string>
<string name="9876">That would probably be best. What can I do for you, then?</string>
<string name="9877">Ha ha! Of that, I somehow have little doubt. All right then, &lt;FirstName&gt;... if you truly want to hear my tale, then I shall tell it.</string>
<string name="9878">As you wish. Do not complain later, however, if you find the tale does not live up to your expectations. I am, after all, no bard.</string>
<string name="9879">Where should I begin? My family lived in a human village in the wildlands of the northern mountains, and I once longed for nothing more than to be a skilled hunter, as my father was.</string>
<string name="9880">The village was destroyed when the orcs massed and attacked the southlands. My family was killed, though I survived.</string>
<string name="9881">For years, I thought of little but wreaking bloody vengeance upon the orcs. I stalked the crags with my bow, mercilessly killing all I crossed.</string>
<string name="9882">Indeed, I was much different then. My vengeance consumed me, and I dealt death at every turn... but I had no peace.</string>
<string name="9883">It was not an easy thing. My lust for vengeance consumed me. I was no better than the beasts I hunted, to be truthful.</string>
<string name="9884">Shush, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have barely begun my tale. Control your attention span for a moment.</string>
<string name="9885">On the fifth winter of my hunt, I stalked an orc tribe deep into the Spine of the World and encountered a blizzard so terrible I could do naught but camp and pray.</string>
<string name="9886">The blizzard was merciless and lasted days, and as I lay dying in the snow and wind I spotted a human man approaching. I thought I was mad.</string>
<string name="9887">He was tall and strong, though I noticed he was missing his right hand. The cold did not seem to affect him... and he looked down at me kindly and picked me up from the snow without effort.</string>
<string name="9888">I remember nothing beyond that. When I awoke, I found myself at a small Ilmateri monastery near the city of Silverymoon. The monks told me I had nearly died.</string>
<string name="9889">I have often thought that he was none other than an avatar of Tyr, himself, the Lord of Justice. Though perhaps that is persumptuous of me.</string>
<string name="9890">I have often thought him thus. An avatar of the Maimed God, himself. Though perhaps that is presumptuous of me.</string>
<string name="9891">(sigh) You did ask to hear this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Do you want me to stop?</string>
<string name="9892">Very funny. Perhaps I am just not in the mood for levity. Let me return to the topic of the man who saved me.</string>
<string name="9893">Whoever he was, the Ilmateri monks had not seen him bring me... and I never saw him again. Or perhaps I should say I never saw him in person.</string>
<string name="9894">He came to me time and time again in my dreams for many months afterwards, telling me that my vengeance would bring no true justice.</string>
<string name="9895">I refused him at first, determined to return to my bloody hunt. The dreams came more frequently, and the man grew more stern with me.</string>
<string name="9896">The path lay elsewhere, I was told, and reluctantly I left the mountains and came to Neverwinter and entered the service of Tyr. The dreams never came again.</string>
<string name="9897">Not right away. I did not meet Fenthick until later, in fact.</string>
<string name="9898">I do not know. I did not worship him at all, at first. I was resentful of the dreams and bitter over giving up my hunt of the orcs.</string>
<string name="9899">Tyr&apos;s clerics took me in and over time I learned their ways and grew to admire the Maimed God. I chose to champion justice instead as his paladin, and found peace at long last.</string>
<string name="9900">My dedication saw me rise through the ranks, and it was much later that I encountered the young acolyte, Fenthick, and knew that I... had found... my true path at last... </string>
<string name="9901">No. No... I am done with crying.</string>
<string name="9902">Aye. Let us... talk about something else.</string>
<string name="9903">No. No, they are not alike at all. The dreams in the mountains never frightened me as much. They didn&apos;t make me feel so helpless and alone.</string>
<string name="9904">I only compare the current ones to them because they are so strong, and disturb me so profoundly. I feel as if... something has changed. Something has changed inside of me.</string>
<string name="9905">No, I... thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Thank you for listening to my tale. You have been a great comfort to me.</string>
<string name="9906">I do not know. Not yet. But... I thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, for listening to my tale. You have been a great comfort.</string>
<string name="9907">Let us talk of something else.</string>
<string name="9908">I... am glad that you have come to work for Lord Nasher. You have so many admirable qualities, he could not be better served.</string>
<string name="9909">I am glad to call you a friend, and hope that we can remain thus in the future. For now, however, perhaps our attention should return to your mission.</string>
<string name="9910">I would be glad to call you a... a friend, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Tyr only knows that finding a friend in times like these is difficult enough. I hope you feel the same.</string>
<string name="9911">I... I see. That is too bad, then, for a true friend is a grand thing to have. Let us return to the topic of your mission, then.</string>
<string name="9912">Oh, I meant no... no disrespect! I was suggesting only... that is, I only was... oh, do not mind me, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Let us forget I said anything, please.</string>
<string name="9913">... I shall forget you said that, sir. Perhaps we should forget that I said anything, either.</string>
<string name="9914">I am glad, my friend. Let us return to the subject of your mission, then.</string>
<string name="9915">Aye, I am angry. I have been thinking more and more of how Fenthick met his end... and how I did nothing to stop it... and I grow even more angry!</string>
<string name="9916">Fenthick devoted his entire life to the service of justice and the performance of his duty, just as I have. And what did he get for it?</string>
<string name="9917">Discarded. Discarded by his liege lord to appease the witless masses, discarded by his god for one foolish mistake. Tell me why I shouldn&apos;t be angry, &lt;FirstName&gt;!</string>
<string name="9918">You make him sound like a murderer! It was not Fenthick who created the plague, nor Fenthick that betrayed the city! He was merely too trusting and too devoted to duty!</string>
<string name="9919">Aye. Fenthick deserves plenty of my ire, as well. The stupid, stupid fool! If only he had been less trusting, less devoted, he never would have ended as he did!</string>
<string name="9920">What should have happened? Perhaps he should have received some recognition of his long service and his good intentions! Or perhaps he should have been less trusting and more selfish!</string>
<string name="9921">Aye. I should be angry at those who condemned Fenthick for the wrong reasons. I should be angry at Fenthick, too, for being a good man and a trusting fool!</string>
<string name="9922">And why shouldn&apos;t I talk like this? If Fenthick had questioned more and been less trusting, less devoted, perhaps he would be alive today!</string>
<string name="9923">And so Fenthick got his final reward. Thank you, Tyr, Lord of Justice, for aiding your faithful servant! Shall I be next, then?</string>
<string name="9924">Shall I, too, end my life a traitor, executed for being too adhered to my duty to question an injustice when I see it? Will Tyr abandon me then, too?</string>
<string name="9925">I... I don&apos;t know, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Tyr brought me here, put me on this path. I want to know why. Why teach me true justice and then throw it in my face?</string>
<string name="9926">And what *is* like me, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Tyr brought me to this place and put me on this path and taught me the meaning of justice... only to throw it in my face. I want to know why!</string>
<string name="9927">I have had no revelation... only questions upon questions. Tyr put me on this path, taught me true justice... only to throw it in my face. I want to know why!</string>
<string name="9928">All I know is that... I am tired of being sad. I am tired of feeling helpless. I feel guilty for questioning myself... but I feel I must be questioned.</string>
<string name="9929">Vengeance is not Tyr&apos;s way, but I... I fear I see no justice being done, here. There is no justice to be had for Fenthick, only vengeance... and I cannot do it.</string>
<string name="9930">Perhaps it is just... the dreams. They continue to come, and get worse each night, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hear voices crying out, so many voices... </string>
<string name="9931">Aye. I see Fenthick killed before me, over and over. I hear laughter, and so many crying out to me for help. I almost cannot bear it.</string>
<string name="9932">No. No, there is nothing for me there. And doing so would only hinder your mission... and I will not do that.</string>
<string name="9933">Perhaps I am, at that. I can think of only one thing that would soothe my thoughts.</string>
<string name="9934">And I thought you were a friend. I see that no one understands what I am going through... aye, so be it.</string>
<string name="9935">Leave me be, then, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and return to your mission. We need discuss my feelings no further.</string>
<string name="9936">Promise me, &lt;FirstName&gt;... promise me as my dearest friend that you will find this cult and visit upon them the vengeance that I cannot!</string>
<string name="9937">I see. It is all I can think of that will silence the dreams. Perhaps... perhaps you are right. Perhaps all I need is some rest to put this into proper perspective.</string>
<string name="9938">Thank you, my friend. It... it is all I can think of to silence the dreams. I must do something, and to have you help me brings me great relief.</string>
<string name="9939">You have been a fine friend, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Here... take this. It is a ring that belonged to my father. I want you to have it.</string>
<string name="9940">Let it symbolize our friendship. Perhaps if... something were to happen to me... it would remind you of me in days to come... </string>
<string name="9941">Then throw it away, if our friendship means nothing to you. I hope that is not the case.</string>
<string name="9942">I don&apos;t mean anything, my friend. It is... simply fatigue and worry that make me speak such. Please... take the ring.</string>
<string name="9943">That makes me glad. You do me a great honor by carrying it.</string>
<string name="9944">Let us speak more later. Go, &lt;FirstName&gt;... find where the heart of this cult resides and return to me. I wish you luck with all my heart.</string>
<string name="9945">Please listen, I have some very important information for you.</string>
<string name="9946">When was he here?</string>
<string name="9947">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; What kind of equipment did he carry?</string>
<string name="9948">Did he leave a name?</string>
<string name="9949">What was he? Human? Dwarf?</string>
<string name="9950">Thanks for telling me.</string>
<string name="9951">When he talk to you?</string>
<string name="9952">He have name?</string>
<string name="9953">What he be? Human? Dwarf?</string>
<string name="9954">Yuh? Okay, me go now.</string>
<string name="9955">Be calm! What are you talking about?</string>
<string name="9956">Explain. Me not know what you mean.</string>
<string name="9957">Oh my, you&apos;re the one! You must be! You look just as the horrible beast said! </string>
<string name="9958">Listen to me! Just a short time ago, someone came here looking for you or, at least, someone who matches your exact description. He said he was going to slaughter you and he demanded to know where you were. Nearly slit my throat, too!</string>

<string name="9962">He was some sort of orc and a huge one at that! </string>
<string name="9963">It was the least I could do. I suggest you run away and never return! I think I might!</string>
<string name="9964">There is a monster looking for you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;! A beast! He&apos;s going to kill you! Oh, gods, he almost killed ME!</string>
<string name="9965">I must be leaving now.</string>
