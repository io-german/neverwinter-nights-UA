<resources><string name="90000">Tomi regards you with narrowed eyes for a long moment. &quot;It&apos;s taken me a while to realize it, but I&apos;m thinkin&apos;... you look a lot like this &lt;lad/lass&gt; who owes me a whole lot o&apos; coin.&quot;</string>
<string name="90001">&quot;An old friend. Blonde hair, green eyes, rugged complexion, wild eyes. Never did pay me back, neither.&quot; His expression grows even more suspicious.</string>
<string name="90002">&quot;So ya admit ya owes me, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="90003">Tomi frowns deeply. &quot;Ya know, ya don&apos;t *have* ta keep saying that.&quot; With that he turns away, muttering to himself.</string>
<string name="90004">&quot;Right.&quot; He glares at you for a long moment, as if considering his option, and then finally turns away, muttering. &quot;I&apos;ll be watching you.&quot;</string>
<string name="90005">&quot;Is it? What if ya came ta Waterdeep and changed yer appearance?&quot;</string>
<string name="90006">&quot;Ha! That&apos;s what *&lt;he/she&gt;* said, too!&quot; He gives you one last withering glare before finally turning away, muttering under his breath.</string>
<string name="90007">&quot;I said ya looked a *lot* like &lt;him/her&gt;... not *just* like &lt;him/her&gt;.&quot; Tomi gives you one last withering glare before turning away, muttering suspiciously under his breath.</string>
<string name="90008">He eyes you suspiciously. &quot;Are ya sure? I never forgets a face, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="90009">&quot;I got a question for ya: ya ever run into a halfling fella named Sammy? Anywhere along yer travels?&quot;</string>
<string name="90010">&quot;Aye, he&apos;s got a last name. Bumbleheart! Samuel Bumbleheart! Me lifelong nemesis!&quot; He shakes his fist at the heavens suddenly, as if cursing the gods for his ill luck.</string>
<string name="90011">&quot;My childhood friend, he was, and constant companion... until he betrayed me!&quot; Again Tomi shakes his fist at the heavens.</string>
<string name="90012">&quot;Well, it can&apos;t be said enough! Me whole life I&apos;ve been tormented by that bugger!&quot;</string>
<string name="90013">&quot;Well maybe not me entire life, then, but enough o&apos; it! I&apos;d still be safely tucked away, a legendary thief in Calimshan if it weren&apos;t fer him!&quot;</string>
<string name="90014">&quot;Oh... and if ya sees him, it&apos;s important ya don&apos;t listen to none o&apos; his blather about his wife. Or that time he got arrested. Errr... or that other time he got arrested.&quot;</string>
<string name="90015">Tomi thinks for a moment. &quot;Or that time he accidentally got sold into slavery. Don&apos;t listen to none o&apos; that.&quot;</string>
<string name="90016">&quot;Ya don&apos;t need ta *slaughter* him, per se... on top o&apos; bein&apos; me nemesis, the poor fella just seems ta have this urge to rush at me screamin&apos; with a dagger in his hand. Unnerving as all hell.&quot;</string>
<string name="90017">&quot;Aye, well... let&apos;s get back to yer business, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="90018">&quot;Well, don&apos;t you go believin&apos; any of it. Damn fool has gone crazy... on top o&apos; being my nemesis, he has this urge now to rush at me screamin&apos; with a dagger in his hand every time he sees me. Unnerving as all hell.&quot;</string>
<string name="90019">&quot;That&apos;s not important. What&apos;s important is that he did.&quot; Tomi looks at you indignantly. &quot;Damn unprofessional of him, I tell ya. And ungrateful, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="90020">&quot;And now, on top o&apos; bein&apos; my nemisis, he has to come rushin&apos; at me screaming with a dagger in his hand every time we meet. Unnerving as all hell, that is.&quot;</string>
<string name="90021">&quot;He&apos;s tormented me fer me entire life, that&apos;s what!&quot;</string>
<string name="90022">&quot;Not really. Me whole life I&apos;ve been tormented by that bugger!&quot;</string>
<string name="90023">&quot;I&apos;m just wonderin&apos;... you&apos;re the same &lt;lad/lass&gt; that was mentioned in that book, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="90024">&quot;Yeah, I don&apos;t blame ya.&quot; Tomi shakes his head and whistles appreciatively.</string>
<string name="90025">Deekin stares at Tomi with confusion, scratching his head. &quot;You, ummm, you wants Deekin to writes book about you, now?&quot;</string>
<string name="90026">&quot;Naw. I get plenty of character assassination from other sources, thanks. Don&apos;t need it none in writin&apos;.&quot;</string>
<string name="90027">Tomi scrunches up his face, looking entirely like he&apos;s about to broach an unpleasant subject. &quot;Yeah, well... I was just wonderin&apos;... did ya ever actually read the thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="90028">&quot;Well that would explain it, then. Ya see, there was somethin&apos; a little... strange... about it...&quot;</string>
<string name="90029">&quot;Ya did, aye?&quot; He looks mildly surprised. &quot;Ya didn&apos;t find somethin&apos; a little... strange... in it? Not at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="90030">&quot;Well, ya see... there&apos;s this &apos;tension&apos; that develops between the hero and &lt;his/her&gt; &apos;erstwhile kobold companion&apos;...&quot;</string>
<string name="90031">&quot;Is that so? Don&apos;t ya remember when the kobold gave ya flowers?&quot;</string>
<string name="90032">&quot;And then he says, you know... how yer the best boss *ever*...&quot;</string>
<string name="90033">&quot;Aye, but then you go on and on about how *grateful* and *appreciative* you are fer him...&quot;</string>
<string name="90034">&quot;I knew it! Damn bloody books... can&apos;t trust &apos;em! Full of lies, they are!&quot;</string>
<string name="90035">He looks apologetic. &quot;I had ta ask, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="90036">&quot;Maybe.&quot; He shrugs, looking apologetic. &quot;I had ta ask, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="90037">&quot;Right! Dropped it is.&quot; He looks apologetic. &quot;I had ta ask, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="90038">He shrugs. &quot;I dunno. It just seemed, to me, that the book strongly hinted that you an&apos; the kobold were *really close*.&quot;</string>
<string name="90039">Tomi looks like he is about to continue, but then purses his lips and decides against it. &quot;Well, alrighty then. Let&apos;s just move along, shall we?&quot;</string>
<string name="90040">&quot;That&apos;s what the book says, it does.&quot;</string>
<string name="90041">&quot;Ya know... tension. Like as in an attraction, aye? Like as when two folks like one another?&quot;</string>
<string name="90042">&quot;Err... I&apos;m not talkin&apos; about *that* sort of tension.&quot;</string>
<string name="90043">Tomi stares at you, his jaw dropping open. After a moment, he remembers to close it again. &quot;Right. I, ah... ahhhhh... right.&quot;</string>
<string name="90044">Tomi stares at you, his jaw dropping open. After a moment, he remembers to close it again. &quot;Maybe this little partnership will work out better than I bloody well thought,&quot; he mutters.</string>
<string name="90045">&quot;Oh. Right. I knew that.&quot;</string>
<string name="90046">Tomi looks away, whistling innocently. A moment later he sprays something into his mouth that smells faintly of mint...</string>
<string name="90047">&quot;What do I have ta do, grow scales?&quot; He pouts. &quot;Blast it, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="90048">&quot;That doesn&apos;t bother ya?&quot;</string>
<string name="90049">&quot;Well, *I* would be mad, I would. Tomi Undergallows has a reputation to maintain. But if you don&apos;t mind,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;Let&apos;s get on with it, then. Got ta provide for the sequel, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="90050">He rolls his eyes. &quot;Oh, ho ho. Yer funny, ye are. So ye&apos;re aware of the &apos;tension&apos; between the hero and &lt;his/her&gt; &apos;erstwhile kobold companion&apos;, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="90051">&quot;It did?&quot; For a moment he looks confused, then he just shakes his head. &quot;I&apos;m not talkin&apos; about that. Ya see... there&apos;s this &apos;tension&apos; that develops between the hero and &lt;his/her&gt; &apos;erstwhile kobold companion&apos;...&quot;</string>
<string name="90052">&quot;Oh, you know... the little thing that kobold fella wrote. Urinetide somethin&apos;, I don&apos;t know.&quot;</string>
<string name="90053">&quot;Ummm... Deekin is right here, you knows...&quot;</string>
<string name="90054">--------- Random Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="90055">&quot;I think I know how to get by that portal, if ye&apos;re interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="90056">&quot;Supposedly, whenever ya go through that doorway, the chains pop off an they go to other places around this level. Then ya gots ta collect &apos;em up again an&apos; put them back on the door.&quot;</string>
<string name="90057">&quot;Sounds like someone just wanted t&apos; make it a bit harder to move through the dungeon. I tell ya, that wizard bloke who made this place is a real nutter.&quot;</string>
<string name="90058">&quot;Yeah, well, if I meets up with one more puzzle my head&apos;s goin&apos; ta crack wide open, I tell ya.&quot;</string>
<string name="90059">&quot;Naw. I didn&apos;t get all that far in here, remember?&quot;</string>
<string name="90060">&quot;The drow mentioned it, they did. They had one o&apos; the chains an&apos; were tryin&apos; to figure out where the rest went.&quot;</string>
<string name="90061">&quot;Suit yerself. I&apos;ve got better things t&apos; do, anyways... like watchin&apos; for some more halfling-killin&apos; drow, that&apos;s what.&quot;</string>
<string name="90062">&quot;Brandobaris&apos;s hairy feet! There&apos;s more thrones in here than in a bloody Calimshani urinal!&quot;</string>
<string name="90063">&quot;Heh... well, Tomi does his best thinkin&apos; on more than just his feet.&quot;</string>
<string name="90064">&quot;Come to think of it, I do remember hearin&apos; about this place. It&apos;s, errrr, the Hall of Sleeping Kings or some such. Or that&apos;s what this drunk bloke once told me.&quot;</string>
<string name="90065">&quot;I guess the wizard who built this place has a fondness fer collectin&apos; ancient northern Kings an&apos; such. Puts &apos;em on display here, I guess.&quot;</string>
<string name="90066">He shrugs. &quot;I dunno. You human folk got all sorts of Kings an&apos; Queens lyin&apos; around, maybe the wizard scooped up a few extra. All I know is I wouldn&apos;t go ticklin&apos; them any... they don&apos;t look *that* dead to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="90067">&quot;Oy! Watch where yer flingin&apos; accusations like that! I&apos;m hurt, I am.&quot;</string>
<string name="90068">&quot;Good. I don&apos;t think they&apos;re the giggling type anyhow.&quot;</string>
<string name="90069">&quot;Anytime, mate!&quot;</string>
<string name="90070">&quot;None that I can see, but I wouldn&apos;t go an&apos; tickle any o&apos; these fella either. They don&apos;t look all *that* dead, if ya ask me.&quot;</string>
<string name="90071">He shrugs. &quot;How should I bloody know? Just don&apos;t go an&apos; tickle them or anythin&apos;, that&apos;d be my advice.&quot;</string>
<string name="90072">&quot;You know, I think this is what they call the Hall of Mirrors. Bloody famous, this part is.&quot;</string>
<string name="90073">&quot;Alright, fine. Have it your way. Tomi&apos;ll just stay out of sight and a bit further away, if it&apos;s all the same to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="90074">&quot;Alright, fine. Have it your way. Tomi&apos;ll just keep out of sight, if it&apos;s all the same to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="90075">&quot;Could be because of all the mirrors lined up. Just a thought, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="90076">&quot;I might be. What&apos;s it to ya?&quot;</string>
<string name="90077">&quot;Hey! Hey! Let&apos;s not get personal-like, all of a sudden, aye? Tomi didn&apos;t mean anything by that comment. Just warnin&apos; ya about these mirrors.&quot;</string>
<string name="90078">&quot;Right. Respect. Got it, aye. Now about the hall...?&quot;</string>
<string name="90079">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Tomi rolls his eyes visibly, sighing. &quot;Right. Anyway, do ya want to hear about the hall, or don&apos;t ya?&quot;</string>
<string name="90080">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Tomi looks at you and he gulps audibly, obviously unnerved. &quot;Ummm... aye. I didn&apos;t mean nothin&apos; by that, no offense. Just warnin&apos; about the hall, is all.&quot;</string>
<string name="90081">&quot;Well, I&apos;ve heard tale of a place in Undermountain where there&apos;s rows of mirrors... some of them magical, some of them not. Some of them are real dangerous like, or so the stories go.&quot;</string>
<string name="90082">&quot;Had a friend who said he looked in one of the mirrors and his image just bloody well stepped out and attacked him! Don&apos;t like the idea of another Tomi runnin&apos; around, myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="90083">&quot;Oh... one other thing: my friend also said that he broke a bunch of mirrors and found good treasure behind some of them. Ended up with a lot o&apos; bad luck, though. Seven years per mirror adds up, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="90084">&quot;An&apos; that&apos;s a lot.&quot; Tomi scratches himself. &quot;Poor fella. Ended up stabbed, he did. I really had no choice, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="90085">&quot;Speaking of which, ya want me to stay outta sight? Just in case?&quot;</string>
<string name="90086">He looks at you dubiously. &quot;Well... alright. I got a bad feelin&apos; about this, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="90087">&quot;Right! Good luck to ya!&quot;</string>
<string name="90088">He nods, grinning. &quot;Aye, that&apos;s what it was called. It ain&apos;t the only magical mirror here, either, so you&apos;ve got to be cautious.&quot;</string>
<string name="90089">&quot;Ho ho ho. Ye&apos;re too bloody funny, ye are.&quot;</string>
<string name="90090">&quot;Right. Well, I don&apos;t exactly like the idea of having another one o&apos; *you* runnin&apos; around, either, so let&apos;s be careful what we look into, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="90091">His thoughts wander for a moment on that subject, and then he suddenly smiles broadly. &quot;But enough o&apos; that. Ya need me ta join up with ya, I expect?&quot;</string>
<string name="90092">&quot;You brought me back just ta leave me here? Not that I&apos;m complainin&apos;, but that seems just silly.&quot;</string>
<string name="90093">------- This line must be placed at the end of inter-party banter ---------</string>
<string name="90094">&quot;So I hears tellin&apos; that yer some kind o&apos; talespinner, Sharwyn. That true?&quot;</string>
<string name="90095">&quot;It&apos;s true enough. I&apos;m a bard, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="90096">&quot;So ye&apos;ve heard of the great Tomi Undergallows, then, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="90097">&quot;No, sorry. I&apos;ve only heard of famous people.&quot;</string>
<string name="90098">&quot;Oh! Stabbed right in the gut, that one!&quot;</string>
<string name="90099">&quot;If it makes you feel better, I actually have heard of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="90100">&quot;Ya have?&quot;</string>
<string name="90101">&quot;I&apos;ve heard you&apos;re an utter pig.&quot;</string>
<string name="90102">Tomi thinks about it for a moment, and then grins. &quot;Better&apos;n nothin&apos;.&quot;</string>
<string name="90103">&quot;So-oooo... Sharwyn, is it? That&apos;s a pretty name fer a pretty lass.&quot;</string>
<string name="90104">&quot;Don&apos;t even think about it, halfling.&quot;</string>
<string name="90105">&quot;What? I didn&apos;t even hardly say nothin&apos;! Why are ya gettin&apos; all defensive?&quot;</string>
<string name="90106">&quot;You think I&apos;m not aware of your reputation? For such a small man you are certainly a huge misogynist.&quot;</string>
<string name="90107">&quot;Really? Well... I&apos;m bloody glad ya noticed.&quot;</string>
<string name="90108">&quot;What exactly do you think a misogynist is?&quot;</string>
<string name="90109">&quot;Ya just want me ta say? Out loud an&apos; everything?&quot;</string>
<string name="90110">&quot;Oh, never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="90111">&quot;Daelan? I gots a question I need ta ask ya. Don&apos;t mean to offend ya none, though...&quot;</string>
<string name="90112">&quot;With you, that practically guarantees I will be. But go on.&quot;</string>
<string name="90113">&quot;Well, it&apos;s just that... I&apos;ve met a few half-orcs in my time, ya know? And ye&apos;re the first one in all me life I&apos;ve ever met who wasn&apos;t... you know...&quot;</string>
<string name="90114">&quot;A complete moron?&quot;</string>
<string name="90115">&quot;There ya go.&quot;</string>
<string name="90116">&quot;You&apos;re right, Tomi. How could I possibly be offended by such a question?&quot; Daelan sighs heavily. &quot;What, exactly, do you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="90117">&quot;Well...&quot; Tomi taps his chin thoughtfully. &quot;I just want ta know one thing... does yer smarts give ya an easier time with the ladies... or *worse*?&quot;</string>
<string name="90118">&quot;Tomi...&quot;</string>
<string name="90119">&quot;Yeah, big fella?&quot;</string>
<string name="90120">&quot;Perhaps it would be better if you focused on the adventure at hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="90121">&quot;Right-o! Focusing.&quot;</string>
<string name="90122">&quot;Hmmm. Ye&apos;re a rather large fella there, aren&apos;t ya, Daelan?&quot;</string>
<string name="90123">&quot;Your point being?&quot;</string>
<string name="90124">&quot;My point being that large folk such as yerself need to be kept entertained! Let Tomi do a trick for ya! How about you hand me that ring of yours?&quot;</string>
<string name="90125">&quot;Very well. I want this back, however, halfling.&quot; Daelan removes his ring and hands it over. &quot;You understand, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="90126">&quot;Heh heh... would I try to trick you? That&apos;s not very fair of ya, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="90127">&quot;Perhaps not, though it is sensible.&quot;</string>
<string name="90128">&quot;Err... yeah. Anyhow...&quot; Tomi takes the ring and passes his hand over it a few times. Some flashy hand movements and he tosses the ring up... only it has vanished! &quot;Ta-da!&quot;</string>
<string name="90129">&quot;You have three seconds to return the ring, halfling.&quot;</string>
<string name="90130">&quot;Ye&apos;re not much of an audience, is ya?&quot; Grudgingly, Tomi reaches into a pocket and fetches out the ring, handing it back. Daelan grins broadly but says nothing in return.</string>
<string name="90131">&quot;So... I&apos;ve been watchin&apos; ya fer a little while, Linu...&quot;</string>
<string name="90132">&quot;You&apos;re a thief. I hate thieves. I&apos;m not listening to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="90133">&quot;Well, I was thinkin... ye&apos;re always goin&apos; on about how clumsy ye are an&apos; such. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the case at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="90134">She looks away from him. &quot;I&apos;m still not listening. I won&apos;t let your insults and jibes get to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="90135">&quot;I&apos;m just tryin&apos; to tell ya that I don&apos;t think ye&apos;re clumsy at all. In fact, I think ye&apos;re graceful just like every other bloody elf I&apos;ve seen.&quot;</string>
<string name="90136">&quot;R-really? You... you mean that?&quot; Linu&apos;s smiles in disbelief, her eyes tearing.</string>
<string name="90137">&quot;Naw. Ye&apos;re pretty much clumsier&apos;n a troll with two left feet.&quot;</string>
<string name="90138">Linu sighs and glares at Tomi. &quot;I hate you, you little fiend.&quot;</string>
<string name="90139">&quot;Correction: *dextrous* and *agile* little fiend! Ha ha ha ha-ha!!&quot;</string>
<string name="90140">&quot;Linu, ye&apos;re a healer, right? I&apos;ve got some... aches... from old battles, hurtin&apos; somethin&apos; fierce!&quot;</string>
<string name="90141">&quot;Oh, that&apos;s terrible, dear! Where does it hurt? Maybe I can help.&quot;</string>
<string name="90142">&quot;Oh, all over. I think I need some hands-on attention, if ya know what I mean...&quot;</string>
<string name="90143">&quot;I think I do, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="90144">&quot;And?&quot; Tomi waggles his eyebrows at her, grinning.</string>
<string name="90145">&quot;AND I SAY I HATE THIEVES!!&quot; Linu suddenly grabs Tomi&apos;s earlobe and pinches it hard. &quot;Rotten scoundrels, all of you! And especially you!!&quot;</string>
<string name="90146">&quot;OW! OW! Hey, what&apos;s yer problem?! Sheesh!&quot;</string>
<string name="90147">&quot;You think I would forget that YOU were the one that stole my holy chalice? The one that forced me to travel all the way to Neverwinter in the first place?&quot;</string>
<string name="90148">&quot;Oh... that.&quot;</string>
<string name="90149">&quot;Yes. THAT.&quot;</string>
<string name="90150">&quot;Heh... I guess a little healin&apos;s out o&apos; the question, then, eh?&quot;</string>
<string name="90151">&quot;Just pray I&apos;m never in a position to decide whether or not you need to be raised.&quot;</string>
<string name="90152">&quot;Ya know... I was lookin&apos; through yer notes, Deekin. The ones fer that book ye&apos;re writin&apos;.&quot;</string>
<string name="90153">&quot;YOU gots Deekin&apos;s notes? Gives them back!&quot;</string>
<string name="90154">&quot;Oh, you can have &apos;em back. I&apos;m just wonderin&apos;... what&apos;s with all the doodles?&quot;</string>
<string name="90155">&quot;That be none of mean halfling&apos;s business.&quot;</string>
<string name="90156">&quot;All the hearts an&apos; such, an&apos; some of &apos;em looked a little... ummm... risque, if ya ask me.&quot;</string>
<string name="90157">&quot;Deekin not asks you, now gives Deekin&apos;s notes back!&quot;</string>
<string name="90158">&quot;And what&apos;s with that writing? I could barely read it... it looked like a dyin&apos; man writin&apos; out his will or somethin&apos;...&quot;</string>
<string name="90159">&quot;BO-OOOSSSSSS!!&quot;</string>
<string name="90160">&quot;Alright, alright, have yer damn notes back, ya big baby.&quot;</string>
<string name="90161">&quot;They is all here? Good.&quot;</string>
<string name="90162">&quot;And, ummm... let me know when you finish the chapter...&quot;</string>
<string name="90163">&quot;Hmmm... so tell me, kobold... just how tall are ya, anyhow?&quot;</string>
<string name="90164">&quot;Is that why you keeps lookings at Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="90165">&quot;Just tell me how tall ya are, dammit! Come here, let me measure ya...&quot;</string>
<string name="90166">&quot;You smells like cheese! Boss! Bo-oossss! Smelly halfling is bothering Deekin again!&quot;</string>
<string name="90167">&quot;I am not, ya bloody liar! Can&apos;t ya answer a simple question?&quot;</string>
<string name="90168">&quot;Bloody squealer.&quot;</string>
<string name="90169">&quot;Nyah nyah!&quot;</string>
<string name="90170">&quot;I just want ta bloody well know! Why&apos;s that so hard ta understand!&quot;</string>
<string name="90171">&quot;He just mad &apos;cause Deekin is taller.&quot;</string>
<string name="90172">&quot;That&apos;s it! Ye&apos;re in fer a world o&apos; hurt now, ya scuttling lizard thing, you!&quot;</string>
<string name="90173">&quot;Oh... sorry, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="90174">&quot;Hah! Serves you right!&quot;</string>
<string name="90175">&quot;You could always buys taller shoes, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="90176">&quot;Oh, shut up.&quot;</string>
<string name="90177">&quot;You gets the boss mad. You is awful henchman.&quot;</string>
<string name="90178">&quot;I&apos;m going to kick yer bloody arse, just you watch --&quot;</string>
<string name="90179">&quot;Sorry, boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="90180">&quot;Yeah, sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="90181">&quot;Never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="90182">&quot;I think we need to part ways.&quot;</string>
<string name="90183">&quot;No, never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="90184">&quot;Wait here until I return.&quot;</string>
<string name="90185">&quot;I need to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="90186">&quot;I want to change your tactics.&quot;</string>
<string name="90187">&quot;I don&apos;t want to change anything else right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="90188">&quot;I want you to leave any traps that you see alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="90189">&quot;I want you to disarm any traps that you see.&quot;</string>
<string name="90190">&quot;I want to move faster and not bother with searching or stealth.&quot;</string>
<string name="90191">&quot;I need you to be stealthy right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="90192">&quot;Don&apos;t help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.&quot;</string>
<string name="90193">&quot;Help me if I fail to open a locked door or chest.&quot;</string>
<string name="90194">&quot;I want to change the distance you stay away from me.&quot;</string>
<string name="90195">&quot;Stay a long distance away.&quot;</string>
<string name="90196">&quot;Keep a medium distance.&quot;</string>
<string name="90197">&quot;Stay close.&quot;</string>
<string name="90198">&quot;Go ahead and attack as soon as you see enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="90199">&quot;Defend me and don&apos;t attack until I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="90200">&quot;I want to adjust your equipment.&quot;</string>
<string name="90201">&quot;Can you identify my equipment?&quot;</string>
<string name="90202">&quot;Can you summon one of your shadows?&quot;</string>
<string name="90203">&quot;I need you to blend into the shadows.&quot;</string>
<string name="90204">&quot;What was it you wanted to say earlier?&quot;</string>
<string name="90205">&quot;Let&apos;s stop and talk a moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="90206">&quot;We&apos;re done talking.&quot;</string>
<string name="90207">&quot;No, nothing else.&quot;</string>
<string name="90208">&quot;How is everything?&quot;</string>
<string name="90209">&quot;I wish to discuss your training.&quot;</string>
<string name="90210">&quot;Go back to splitting your time up between rogue and Shadowdancer.&quot;</string>
<string name="90211">&quot;Continue with what you&apos;re doing now.&quot;</string>
<string name="90212">&quot;Focus on being a Shadowdancer.&quot;</string>
<string name="90213">&quot;Focus on being a rogue.&quot;</string>
<string name="90214">&quot;What&apos;s a Shadowdancer?&quot;</string>
<string name="90215">&quot;Do you have plans for what you&apos;re going to do after all this?&quot;</string>
<string name="90216">&quot;Icewind Dale? What kind of vacation is that?&quot;</string>
<string name="90217">&quot;Good plan. I might just have to join you.&quot;</string>
<string name="90218">&quot;And if this drow proves to be too tough for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="90219">&quot;I think I did hear that somewhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="90220">&quot;You&apos;re a very odd little halfling.&quot;</string>
<string name="90221">&quot;So what happened after you helped save Neverwinter?&quot;</string>
<string name="90222">&quot;Suddenly I don&apos;t want to know...&quot;</string>
<string name="90223">&quot;Yes, before that.&quot;</string>
<string name="90224">&quot;What misunderstanding?&quot;</string>
<string name="90225">&quot;I see where this is going...&quot;</string>
<string name="90226">&quot;So he kicked you out of the city?&quot;</string>
<string name="90227">&quot;What kind of businesses?&quot;</string>
<string name="90228">&quot;You started a thieves&apos; guild.&quot;</string>
<string name="90229">&quot;I don&apos;t need to hear any more.&quot;</string>
<string name="90230">&quot;It&apos;s no wonder Lord Nasher kicked you out of the city!&quot;</string>
<string name="90231">&quot;And how did that go?&quot;</string>
<string name="90232">&quot;Who&apos;s Lord Nasher again?&quot;</string>
<string name="90233">&quot;And you had a misunderstanding with him?&quot;</string>
<string name="90234">&quot;You said you came from Neverwinter, correct?&quot;</string>
<string name="90235">&quot;I was in Hilltop when that happened, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="90236">&quot;So you must be very popular in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="90237">&quot;Why am I not surprised?&quot;</string>
<string name="90238">&quot;So I&apos;m told.&quot;</string>
<string name="90239">&quot;How is Neverwinter now?&quot;</string>
<string name="90240">&quot;Tell me about this Lady Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="90241">&quot;I thought I heard someone else was responsible for curing the plague?&quot;</string>
<string name="90242">&quot;What happened to this hero?&quot;</string>
<string name="90243">&quot;Who is this Lady Aribeth?&quot;</string>
<string name="90244">&quot;Poor lass? You mean Lady Aribeth?&quot;</string>
<string name="90245">&quot;What happened to her?&quot;</string>
<string name="90246">&quot;No, stay here for the moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="90247">&quot;Yes, come with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="90248">&quot;Not right now. I&apos;m busy.&quot;</string>
<string name="90249">&quot;You don&apos;t need to be rude, you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="90250">&quot;Maybe later.&quot;</string>
<string name="90251">&quot;That&apos;s better.&quot;</string>
<string name="90252">&quot;What is it, Tomi?&quot;</string>
<string name="90253">&quot;Gold? Not much.&quot;</string>
<string name="90254">&quot;Gold? I have lots of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="90255">&quot;Lemons?&quot;</string>
<string name="90256">&quot;Enough, Tomi. I&apos;m not interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="90257">&quot;A sour fruit? Who would want such a thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="90258">&quot;How is this an investment, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="90259">&quot;Maybe you could make some kind of juice drink out of it, even.&quot;</string>
<string name="90260">&quot;About what?&quot;</string>
<string name="90261">&quot;Sounds great.&quot;</string>
<string name="90262">&quot;I&apos;ll get back to you on that.&quot;</string>
<string name="90263">&quot;Ri-iiiiggghht.&quot;</string>
<string name="90264">&quot;That&apos;s a rather rude question.&quot;</string>
<string name="90265">&quot;Why do you need to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="90266">&quot;You can ask, but I don&apos;t have to answer.&quot;</string>
<string name="90267">&quot;No, you can&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="90268">&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;</string>
<string name="90269">&quot;And who is this &lt;lad/lass&gt; who owes you money, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="90270">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh.]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;And I never will, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="90271">&quot;Sounds like me, alright.&quot;</string>
<string name="90272">&quot;That doesn&apos;t sound anything like me. That&apos;s stupid.&quot;</string>
<string name="90273">&quot;You can try to collect, but I wouldn&apos;t recommend it.&quot;</string>
<string name="90274">&quot;Perhaps I should have left you dead where I found you...&quot;</string>
<string name="90275">&quot;I admit to nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="90276">&quot;Sure thing. Bring it on, short stuff.&quot;</string>
<string name="90277">&quot;That&apos;s ridiculous.&quot;</string>
<string name="90278">&quot;You&apos;re insane.&quot;</string>
<string name="90279">&quot;Fine, you got me. I thought I had you fooled, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="90280">&quot;If I look different, then how could I look just like this person?&quot;</string>
<string name="90281">&quot;No, I&apos;ve never been to Calimshan.&quot;</string>
<string name="90282">&quot;I don&apos;t even know where Calimshan is.&quot;</string>
<string name="90283">&quot;You think we&apos;ve met before?&quot;</string>
<string name="90284">&quot;I&apos;m quite certain I&apos;ve never been to Calimshan, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="90285">&quot;Sammy? Does he have a last name?&quot;</string>
<string name="90286">&quot;No, I&apos;ve never met anyone by that name.&quot;</string>
<string name="90287">&quot;What, he owes you money?&quot;</string>
<string name="90288">&quot;Dare I even ask?&quot;</string>
<string name="90289">&quot;Right. He&apos;s your enemy. I got that part.&quot;</string>
<string name="90290">&quot;I thought you said he was your childhood friend and companion?&quot;</string>
<string name="90291">&quot;Slaughter him on sight. Got it.&quot;</string>
<string name="90292">&quot;I bet.&quot;</string>
<string name="90293">&quot;Are you kidding? I&apos;d love to hear what he has to say, suddenly.&quot;</string>
<string name="90294">&quot;Why did he betray you, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="90295">&quot;What did he do, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="90296">&quot;A bit overdramatic, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="90297">&quot;Why are you asking?&quot;</string>
<string name="90298">&quot;I don&apos;t really want to talk about that.&quot;</string>
<string name="90299">&quot;Mentioned? It was a chronicle of my adventure.&quot;</string>
<string name="90300">&quot;Hardly. Why would I?&quot;</string>
<string name="90301">&quot;No, I never got around to it.&quot;</string>
<string name="90302">&quot;I have no doubt about that. What&apos;s your point?&quot;</string>
<string name="90303">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="90304">&quot;Yes, I did.&quot;</string>
<string name="90305">&quot;No, nothing strange at all. Why?&quot;</string>
<string name="90306">&quot;I&apos;m sure you&apos;re imagining things.&quot;</string>
<string name="90307">&quot;What about it?&quot;</string>
<string name="90308">&quot;So? He says that stuff all the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="90309">&quot;Well, that&apos;s just a big lie!&quot;</string>
<string name="90310">&quot;Hmph. I agree.&quot;</string>
<string name="90311">&quot;I think you&apos;re reading too much into it, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="90312">&quot;Let&apos;s just drop the topic, all right?&quot;</string>
<string name="90313">&quot;What are you trying to say, Tomi?&quot;</string>
<string name="90314">&quot;You&apos;re insane. Now drop it.&quot;</string>
<string name="90315">&quot;We were friends. I still don&apos;t understand what you mean.&quot;</string>
<string name="90316">&quot;I *was* grateful and appreciative of him.&quot;</string>
<string name="90317">&quot;I *am* the best boss ever.&quot;</string>
<string name="90318">&quot;Deekin never gave me flowers. That&apos;s silly.&quot;</string>
<string name="90319">&quot;So what about it, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="90320">&quot;I don&apos;t understand. What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="90321">&quot;Tension? Well, I did find him annoying.&quot;</string>
<string name="90322">&quot;Oh, that. Well, he *is* one cute kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="90323">&quot;I was joking.&quot;</string>
<string name="90324">&quot;If you&apos;re lucky.&quot;</string>
<string name="90325">&quot;You&apos;re no kobold, Tomi.&quot;</string>
<string name="90326">&quot;So? So what?&quot;</string>
<string name="90327">&quot;Why would it? Deekin is one cute little kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="90328">&quot;It&apos;s not true, so I&apos;m not concerned.&quot;</string>
<string name="90329">&quot;It&apos;s just a book. What do I care?&quot;</string>
<string name="90330">&quot;I&apos;d hate to think what you&apos;d consider strange.&quot;</string>
<string name="90331">&quot;It had completely atrocious grammar.&quot;</string>
<string name="90332">&quot;Other than the fact a kobold wrote it?&quot;</string>
<string name="90333">&quot;Mentioned in which book?&quot;</string>
<string name="90334">&quot;Tell me what you know, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="90335">&quot;Chains. Got it. Just a simple puzzle.&quot;</string>
<string name="90336">&quot;Do you know where the chains are?&quot;</string>
<string name="90337">&quot;How do you know about that?&quot;</string>
<string name="90338">&quot;I don&apos;t need help with that, thanks.&quot;</string>
<string name="90339">&quot;If you don&apos;t have anything useful to say, be silent.&quot;</string>
<string name="90340">&quot;Who do you suppose these skeletons are?&quot;</string>
<string name="90341">&quot;That&apos;s pretty gross, Tomi.&quot;</string>
<string name="90342">&quot;What northern Kings?&quot;</string>
<string name="90343">&quot;You just watch your sticky fingers here, halfling.&quot;</string>
<string name="90344">&quot;I don&apos;t plan on tickling them.&quot;</string>
<string name="90345">&quot;Gee. Thanks for the advice.&quot;</string>
<string name="90346">&quot;Any traps that you can see?&quot;</string>
<string name="90347">&quot;Do you think they&apos;ll come to life?&quot;</string>
<string name="90348">&quot;I don&apos;t need to hear about it, Tomi.&quot;</string>
<string name="90349">&quot;Why do they call it that?&quot;</string>
<string name="90350">&quot;Are you mocking me?&quot;</string>
<string name="90351">&quot;I don&apos;t need this. Keep your comments to yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="90352">&quot;Nothing at all. Now... let&apos;s talk about your treasure share...&quot;</string>
<string name="90353">&quot;I&apos;d like a little more respect if we&apos;re to travel together.&quot;</string>
<string name="90354">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Do you want to die now, halfling?&quot;</string>
<string name="90355">&quot;Fine, fine. What do you know about it?&quot;</string>
<string name="90356">&quot;I meant why does it need a special name, smart mouth?&quot;</string>
<string name="90357">&quot;Right. I&apos;ll be careful.&quot;</string>
<string name="90358">&quot;No, stay in sight.&quot;</string>
<string name="90359">&quot;Sure, do that.&quot;</string>
<string name="90360">&quot;There&apos;s a Mirror of Duplication in here?&quot;</string>
<string name="90361">&quot;It&apos;d be nice to have a back-up for the next time you die.&quot;</string>
<string name="90362">&quot;I don&apos;t like that idea, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="90363">&quot;You know something about it?&quot;</string>
<string name="90364">&quot;Yes, let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="90365">&quot;No, just stay here for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="90366">&quot;Tomi...&quot;</string>
<string name="90367">&quot;Leave him alone, Tomi.&quot;</string>
<string name="90368">&quot;Why do you want to know, Tomi?&quot;</string>
<string name="90369">&quot;Don&apos;t taunt him, Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="90370">&quot;He&apos;s taller, Tomi. Get over it.&quot;</string>
<string name="90371">&quot;Stop it, you two!&quot;</string>
<string name="90372">&quot;Enough!&quot;</string>

<string name="90452">Mask of the Skull</string>
<string name="90453">A recent decision by Archmage Szass Tam has led to the creation of these masks, which all necromancers in the borders of Thay are required to wear. Those wearing the mask have access to powerful magics, but are also subject to Tam&#8217;s control. Any wizard caught practicing necromancy while not wearing such a mask is killed and turned into a ghoul to serve Tam in death better than they did in life.</string>
<string name="90454">Spellchain</string>
<string name="90455">Drow spellswords often wear this light armor. It is formed of an unusual, lightweight metal, that makes the armor more flexible. These properties reduce the difficulty for arcane spellcasters to cast spells while wearing these suits.</string>

<string name="90459">Shield of Prator</string>
<string name="90460">Dethin Prator was a hero of Unther, who led one of the most successful uprisings against the new Magocracy, run by the Mulhorandi conquerors.  His rebellion lasted two months, during which time his army swelled to total over 1500 men. His army came to the attention of a dissatisfied Unther mage, who began to supply his army with magical assistance, including this shield. When the army was finally destroyed, Prator was found dead, but his shield was gone.</string>

<string name="90467">Darson the master smith constructed this mighty shield out of the bones and scales of an ancient wyrm. While Darson, never afraid of bragging, claims he slew the beast himself, few believe it. Most likely he came upon the corpse of the great beast and salvaged what he could. Whatever the truth may be, the protections on this shield are formidable enough to please the bravest of knights.</string>
<string name="90468">Lathar&apos;s Last Belt</string>
<string name="90469">Lathar was a wizard of little renown who thought himself worthy to test a powerful archmage in a magical duel. Knowing his rival&apos;s penchant for death magic, Lathar crafted this special belt to grant himself immunity against such wizardry. 
The day of the duel came and the two wizards squared off against each other. The archmage flung nasty fingers of death and invoked powerful power word kills left and right and all the while Lathar laughed. 
&quot;Do your worst!&quot; Lathar said, mocking his rival.
The archmage frowned. Then with a clever smile he snapped his fingers and summoned forth a dire bear which promptly swallowed poor Lathar in just one bite.

<string name="90470">Fiendforged Plate</string>
<string name="90471">This malevolent armor tingles as you run your hand over it. It is not uncommon for lesser devils or demons to be bound by a higher entity into armor or weapons. One such servant of evil is trapped within this finely forged armor and his will is now bound to the wearer of this armor. He is able to anticipate the wearer&apos;s movements, decreasing the chance of arcane spell failure.</string>
<string name="90472">Souldrinker&apos;s Sire</string>
<string name="90473">Thirsting for fresh blood, usually only a warrior intent on death and destruction wields such an evil blade. Some warriors claiming to be doing good have attempted to master the souldrinker and use it for noble purposes, but more often than naught, they are found surrounded by carnage and death too horrible to bear. One such warrior was found in a cathedral, surrounded by the corpses of priests and resting on the end of his own blade, where he had thrown himself in a fit of guilt.</string>

<string name="90478">Bindings of Blood</string>
<string name="90479">This clothing is worn only by warriors of exceptional skill, who survive by agility and luck. Anyone wearing this armor is extremely difficult to hold in one place and is able to move more swiftly than is natural.</string>

<string name="90481">There is something unwholesome in the black spikes and muted glint of this armor that is disturbing.</string>
<string name="90482">The plates of blackened steel are fashioned with a slaver&apos;s cruelty to fit only those who seek the foul things of the world. This armor was known to be worn by Lord Casiel the Vile in his campaign against the Purple Dragon Knights of Cormyr. Upon Lord Casiel&apos;s death the armor was said to be destroyed.</string>

<string name="90489">Last Words</string>
<string name="90490">A set of dark clothing that fits snugly over the skin.</string>
<string name="90491">This is the uniform of the assassin elite. Only one very sure of his abilities would even dare to wear such a costume in public. Most will not recognize this mark of a trained and professional killer but those who do will heed its message.</string>
<string name="90492">Shiver-ring</string>
<string name="90493">This ring is warm to the touch. When worn it will accelerate the body&apos;s natural  warming process. This increase in shivering makes the character a little more clumsy and also weakens their constitution. However, the ring keeps out all but the coldest cold, so the side-effects of wearing it may sometimes be worthwhile.</string>
<string name="90494">Robes of the Dark Maiden</string>

Hammered into the most intricate of shapes by the finest dwarven smiths, this armor speaks of the dwarven culture&apos;s most honored companions: the Defenders. None shall pass their shield wall, and none shall withstand their charge.</string>
<string name="90502">The Iron Skeleton</string>
<string name="90503">This armor seems to be a collection of metal bones over leather.</string>
<string name="90504">It is not clear what darkness possessed the talented smith who created this unsettling armor. The steel seems to slither along the wearer&apos;s limbs; reshaping itself into a new suit with each new wearer. It acts as protection against the darkness but also seems to call to the shadows themselves.</string>
<string name="90505">Volkarion&apos;s Robe</string>
<string name="90506">Fists of Balance</string>

Though many have searched for this fabled contradiction, for the most part, only rumors have been recovered. Yet a few crazed adventurers have stumbled into this tavern or that tavern clutching a pair of these gloves -- keeping the legend from fading away and the curious searching for the elusive order.</string>

<string name="91082">Relic of the Reaper</string>
<string name="91083">You discovered this artifact many years ago when you were briefly trapped in the Plane of Shadows. Ever since you first picked it up, it has refused to leave your possession. Drop it, throw it away, crush it... always it immediately reappears in your hand, pulsing warmly with power as it ever does.
Its main ability that you know of is that it can teleport you to a pocket dimension ruled over by a mysterious being that calls itself the Reaper. The Reaper&apos;s dimension is a nexus of sorts.
The Reaper, not an unfriendly sort, allows you to use the relic to &quot;bind&quot; a location to a door in the dimension, allowing instant transportation back to that point. The Reaper will also teleport you to the dimension upon the moment of your death, saving you. The relic may only be used in this fashion, however... to bind a point or save you from death... if you have a Rogue Stone in your possession. The Reaper uses the power inherent within the gem to power the relic, destroying the gem in the process. Naturally this makes Rogue Stones even more valuable to you than they would be otherwise.
Where the Reaper comes from or how the relic stone was created has never been revealed to you. You suspect that one day it&apos;s mysterious history will catch up with you. For the moment, however, it has been far more of a boon.</string>

<string name="91095">Thomas Alvanthorn led the Circle of Flame, a group of druids dedicated to the use of fire as a tool to replenish the forests. Their actions often led them into direct opposition with other, more traditional druids, who strive to keep the forest free of flame. Still Alvanthorn perservers and many druids wield his Renewal sickles, spreading both flame and the cause.</string>

<string name="91104">Sentinel +8</string>
<string name="91105">When the heroes of Neverwinter became famous, the dwarven smith of Neverwinter crafted a special axe in honor of their deeds. During the crafting of this weapon, a fever consumed the smith and drove him to work such magical forces as he had never crafted before. Afterwards he claimed that a god had come upon him and blessed his work.  Mysteriously, the weapon disappeared while on display in the Halls of Justice and has never been seen again.</string>

<string name="91112">Ice Reaver +8</string>
<string name="91113">When the barbarian tribes north of Icewind Dale encountered a fierce band of fire giants, lost and alone, their Ice Reaver hand axes made short work of them. Finding a vast sum of gold on the giants, the chieftain commemorated the battle by having new, more powerful reavers crafted for his warriors. Over time, most of these axes disappeared, and occasionally a young warrior will set off to quest for one of the legendary items.</string>

<string name="91117">Jorag Muthkik was the champion of the gladiator pits in Chessenta. His owner, a mage of dubious reputation, made certain that Jorag always had the latest in equipment. He made this club as a gift when Jorag&#8217;s win made the mage a fortune in bets. Jorag eventually retired and became a teacher at one of the top gladiator schools in Chessenta. His club was a feared disciplinary weapon.</string>

<string name="91119">Heavy Flail +7</string>
<string name="91120">Reaver +8</string>
<string name="91121">The chaotic nature of the denizens of the Elemental Plane of Fire has led to an increased interest in these icy weapons. Despite the dangers of handling such weapons, the increased damage makes reavers perfect for assassinating rivals.  Merchants who travel the planes have made massive fortunes smuggling the much-coveted flails.</string>

<string name="91123">Light Flail +7</string>
<string name="91124">Foundation +8</string>
<string name="91125">The High Inquisitor of Auril was a bitterly cold woman with a penchant for crushing her enemies&#8217; skulls with her magical mace.  This diabolical fetish led her to hunt for better, more effective weapons, until she found the Foundation mace. Armed with the ultimate mace, the inquisitor led her soldiers in an attack on a clan of ogres who refused to work for her army. While the mace destroyed many ogres, it disappeared along with its owner, when she was taunted into following an ogre mage into the caverns the ogres called home.</string>

<string name="91129">In the city-states of Chessenta, a mythic war hero called Cevalias figures prominently in the rise of the city Cimbar, as the nation&#8217;s capital. Legends claim that Cevalias with his sparking war hammer became the champion of the city when he fell in love with the ruler&#8217;s daughter, a young woman called Saphia.  Saphia quickly learned to manipulate the champion, and with her father&#8217;s guidance, turned him into a tool of destruction who killed over ten thousand warriors of other cities.</string>

<string name="91131">The blind smith Izu passed away during a particularly brutal winter in the Silver Marches and it was only after his death that his family discovered his connections with the Harpers.

Sadly, the scout disappeared while mapping the upper reaches of the Underdark.</string>

<string name="91133">Warhammer +7</string>
<string name="91134">Rune Hammer +8</string>
<string name="91135">Glittering with silver runes, capable of absorbing powerful spells, this mighty war hammer was the holy artifact of a dwarven tribe known as the Broodhull Clan. For centuries the Broodhulls ruled the mountains of Vilhon Reach. Then, in only a single year, the entire clan of over two hundred dwarves disappeared entirely. Only their empty halls remain, although some claim that the ghosts of the past can still be heard, echoing through what became their tomb.</string>
<string name="91136">Fiendfoe</string>
<string name="91137">A divine champion of Selune, Ashen Harcall, wielded this warhammer against the fiendish forces of darkness many times. His last mission sent him into the bowels of the Underdark, searching for news of a possible outsider invasion. No word of him has reached the church and they fear him dead.</string>

<string name="91139">Mace +7</string>
<string name="91140">Mace of Disruption +8</string>
<string name="91141">The bane of all undead, the mace of disruption, interferes with the magic animating undead. Sometimes this means that it does increased damage to undead, while other times it destroys the creature entirely. These weapons are often highly sought after by the priests of Lathander, who hunt undead with great zeal. Those who distinguish themselves as undead hunters are occasionally rewarded with one of these powerful maces.</string>

<string name="91143">Morningstar +7</string>
<string name="91144">Drone +8</string>
<string name="91145">The deaf master, Vondin Clatch, was a ruthless warrior who learned to use his infirmity to his advantage. The glowing, vibrating morningstar he used would create a magical warping of its immediate area to create a sonic burst that could stun enemies it hit. The piercing sound could also cause damage to those around him; a problem that was not fixed until the master&#8217;s apprentice inherited the weapon. Being unable to use the weapon, he paid a wizard to focus the sonics to only damage those who were hit.</string>

<string name="91150">North Wind Bow +8</string>
<string name="91151">These bows seem primitive at first glance, but behind the crude sinew and hide is a powerful weapon. They are most often found in the far North, but unfortunately, they are also most often found in the hands of a devotee of Auril, the Icemaiden. Most observers will get a good look at the point of the arrows before ever seeing the bow.</string>
<string name="91152">Forever</string>
<string name="91153">This elegant bow quivers with magic when touched. Engraved, ancient elven runes tell the tale of the arcane archer Meadow Everleaf and how she found this bow growing in the forests of Cormanthor. She plucked this gentle weapon and carried it with her but could never find any material to string the bow with. One fateful evening trolls attacked her and she soon depleted her arrows. Tossing away her mundane bow she pulled out Forever...and saw a magical bow-string appear. Knocking an imaginary arrow she let loose and slew the trolls. The bow has been kept in her tomb since her death but rumors suggest that drow thieves may have taken it.</string>

<string name="91158">Battle Legion Bow</string>
<string name="91159">No one remembers much about the mighty battle legions of ancient Unther, but if this bow is a representative of their armament, then it is no wonder the Mulhorandi feared them so. Now that time has passed, and Unther is weak, these bows are rarely found within her borders. Occasionally one turns up in the black markets of Mulhorand, where it will sell for as much as a legion of modern mercenaries. </string>

<string name="91161">Sling +7</string>
<string name="91162">Bane of the Undead</string>
<string name="91163">One of Kelemvor&apos;s first gifts to his church was this sling, a mark of favor for priests who showed ability at hunting undead. While these slings are protected and treasured above all earthly treasures, the risk involved in hunting the undead has caused the disappearance of a small number of slings. The church of Kelemvor offers large rewards for the return of these powerful and holy weapons.</string>

<string name="91165">Heavy Crossbow +7</string>
<string name="91166">Crossbow of the Seer</string>
<string name="91167">Taigen Bladekin became a master assassin in Calimshan when she proved to be able to anticipate where her competitors would be and how they would try to kill her. Though great at her job, her social skills were weak, since she never went anywhere without her powerful crossbow. Employers frequently were too nervous to meet with her in person and sent contacts to set up jobs. The contacts would soon grow wary of meeting with the deadly young woman who stroked her crossbow as if it were a loved one, rather than a weapon.</string>

<string name="91171">&quot;Load faster! Aim faster! Fire faster!&quot;
These are the words that haunted the dreams of Lord Bishik, whose training in the militia seemed a never-ending nightmare. Putting all of his energies into overcoming his slowness in combat, Bishik finally accepted a magical solution to his problems. The mage who created Bishik&apos;s crossbow appeared from nowhere, gave the weapon to Bishik and disappeared into the night. Only the powerful magic of the crossbow was left behind to prove that Bishik hadn&apos;t simply dreamed up the wizard.</string>
<string name="91172">Double Axe +6</string>
<string name="91173">Double Axe +7</string>
<string name="91174">Axe for the Tall Kin +8</string>
<string name="91175">The warriors of Rashemen have a legend of a giant king called Kirsk, who carried an axe that could split a mountain in twain. This axe was supposedly lost when the king split a mountain that held back the sea and all of the giants were drowned. It is commonly agreed in more civilized lands that the warriors of Rasheman are a very strange lot.</string>
<string name="91176">Dire Mace +6</string>
<string name="91177">Dire Mace +7</string>
<string name="91178">Ironwood Mace +8</string>
<string name="91179">Legends of this mace being used to crush a dragon&#8217;s skull may have been exaggerated by the bard Duss Dorien. According to his &quot;Song of King Ethos&quot;, the king was battling a ferocious black dragon and had lost his spear to the dragon&#8217;s thick hide. When the king cried out to Torm, a dire mace appeared in his hands, and Ethos brought it down on the dragon&#8217;s head with a very satisfying crunch.</string>
<string name="91180">Quarterstaff +6</string>
<string name="91181">Quarterstaff +7</string>
<string name="91182">Aiedo Wither-Stick +8</string>
<string name="91183">From the Lhespenbog reed-fields of east Shaar come Aiedo Wither-Sticks, the craft of Meng Aiedo. Though accustomed to working with tall grass bamboo, this eastern craftsman traveled across the inner plains plying his trade with whatever local materials were available. Swamp products tend to be darker in nature than his usual fare, however.</string>
<string name="91184">Fiery Power Quarterstaff</string>
<string name="91185">Rumors tell of Baalzebul forging a deal with a wizard of Faerun, which traded minor demons for large numbers of innocent mortal souls. Each demon was captured in the magical wood of rare, ancient fire oak trees. Their spirits give birth to the blazing powers of these weapons. Whether this tale is true or not, the power of these quarterstaffs cannot be denied.</string>
<string name="91186">Thornshield</string>
<string name="91187">This heavy staff was hand-carved by Winh of the Ivy Lake, an ancient shifter who was truly the master of a thousand shapes. Thousands of thin, barb-like thorns from an exotic vine that grew in Winh&apos;s protectorate grow along this wooden staff. The thorns snare and deflect any attacks made against the staff&apos;s wielder. Winh died fighting a horde of drow skirmishers who were invading his lands some time ago.</string>

<string name="91191">When he returned to his tribe, Daelan Red Tiger crafted a weapon that could match his power and skill as a warrior. When he was finished, he lay down beside his forge to rest, but when he awoke, instead of one sword, he found ten. Thanking the gods, he gave each weapon to the mightiest warriors of his tribe. Each of the warriors then set out on a quest to improve themselves and strengthen their tribes. So far, only a few have returned.</string>

<string name="91216">Dwarven Waraxe +7</string>
<string name="91217">Axe of the Dwarf Lord</string>
<string name="91218">This waraxe was created in ancient times for the dwarven lord Grundy Ironfist. He had trouble leading his troops into battle, they grumbled at his orders and laughed at the way his knees knocked together. Once this waraxe was placed in his hand, his troops saw Grundy in a new light and he went on to be a celebrated hero of his clan.</string>
<string name="91219">Harvest Axe</string>
<string name="91220">Its name suggests that this waraxe was for peaceful chores. This could not be further from the truth. It is known as the Harvest Axe because it has a penchant for harvesting the heads of its enemies. Some swear that the waraxe itself controls the weilder, and not the other way round.</string>
<string name="91221">Spellsmasher</string>
<string name="91222">The Battleroarer family maintained an inn alongside the river Delimbiyr, frequented mainly by adventurers. A trio of red robed Thayan wizards blasted the inn and all within it to dust over a disagreement resulting from the Battleroarer&apos;s refusal to offer service to the distrustful wizards. Hagan Battleroar, just a young dwarf at the time, was tending to the family&apos;s herd of sheep on a nearby hill and saw the massacre. Hagan abandoned his family&apos;s peaceful ways and with steadfast perseverance became a dwarven defender. He crafted this weapon to aid him in a vendetta against all users of magic, specifically Thayans. His clan recently began asking for news of Hagan&apos;s whereabouts, after he disappeared recently tracking several red wizards near the mouth of the Underdark.</string>
<string name="91223">Withering</string>
<string name="91224">This ghastly magical staff is the legbone of the evil Khonderous Vilemoth, a wickedly evil Pale Master who lost this limb and his life to a brave but nameless paladin. Vilemoth&apos;s pupils took the limb, polished it and enchanted it with the magic of their master.</string>

<string name="91226">Halberd +7</string>
<string name="91227">Ravager +8</string>
<string name="91228">The guards upon the walls of the evil fortress, Darkhold carry halberds of ancient, demonic creation. The halberds were purchased from the forges of hell in trade for the souls of captured heroes, so each halberd is a valued possession. Those who wield these weapons outside the walls of Darkhold do so at their own peril, for the master of the hold is said to be linked to each one.</string>

<string name="91230">Scythe +7</string>
<string name="91231">Sea Reaver +8</string>
<string name="91232">Legends tell of how the mighty hero, Igulik, was blessed by a visit from the great water spirit of Lake Ashane. The stories tell of how the warrior was given the holy Sea Reaver to defend his people from an evil wizard, who sought to enslave the tribes of the north using summoned elementals. In the traditional fashion of Rashemi legends, the hero was successful, but died valiantly after killing the treacherous wizard. When he died, the holy weapon was returned to the water spirit, to return when another hero was needed.</string>

<string name="91236">During a recent crisis, when the Spirit of the Neverwinter Woods was wounded, several dryads and nymphs worked together to create a weapon, which they hoped would help them protect their home. Before they could find a hero to give this weapon to, the crisis was ended, and the fey folk forgot about their weapon, leaving it lying in the woods.</string>
<string name="91237">Kama +6</string>
<string name="91238">Kama +7</string>
<string name="91239">Imaskari Kama +8</string>
<string name="91240">A palpable aura around this item marks it as tainted, perhaps rightly so, for all that is known of the Imaskari civilization points to a depth of depravity unmatched in modern times. Of course, such condemnation has had many years to fester, and while a goodly number of Imaskari may have been involved in necromantic studies, it is likely that their vilification springs from later societies elevating themselves through the slandering of others.</string>
<string name="91241">Kukri +6</string>
<string name="91242">Kukri +7</string>
<string name="91243">Cutting Star +8</string>
<string name="91244">These blades are occasionally brought to civilization by adventurers, along with tales of ruined temples and the gods of old.

<string name="91246">Sickle +7</string>
<string name="91247">Golden Sickle +8</string>
<string name="91248">In recent years, powerful druids have quit their groves and begun searching for the golden sickle. Once considered merely a legend, rumors say that the weapon has reappeared in the realms. Having been hidden by the goddess Chauntea, many centuries ago, no one knows what its return might portend. A prophet of the druids claims that the one to bear the Golden Sickle will restore balance to Faerun.</string>

<string name="91250">Bastard Sword +7</string>
<string name="91251">Bloodletter +8</string>
<string name="91252">Forged in smoldering brimstone fires and cooled in the blood of its creator, a Bloodletter blade is a typically evil weapon, the kind of sword that has inspired more than a little diabolical laughter while being waved in the face of one or another virtuous knight. It is possessed of thoroughly heinous life-stealing energies, but if the fates of its previous owners are any indication, its major characteristic could well be the attraction of &quot;comeuppance.&quot;</string>

<string name="91257">Risktaker</string>
<string name="91258">Damien Oneknife, an assassin of great skill who traveled the breadth of Faerun to claim his targets, refused only one quest. A man known only as the Dockman, sent him against the legendary Drizzt. Damien knew he was not the equal of the famed drow warrior and declined. The next day Damien received this dagger from the Dockman as a gift with a gentle request to reconsider the offer. His facilities clouded by the dagger, Damien accepted the offer. He died, never even reaching Drizzt himself, but falling instead to the ranger&apos;s loyal companions.</string>

<string name="91260">Greatsword +7</string>
<string name="91261">Harbinger Kin +8</string>
<string name="91262">The illithid brain known as Kwukgixrin sent its followers to scouring the Underdark for an artifact that it discovered when it absorbed the mind of a powerful human warrior. The warrior had hidden the sword when he realized that he was too wounded to survive another attack from the illithid thralls. Before the illithid thralls could find the sword, the warrior&#8217;s twin brother discovered it. The twin was in strong health and he made short work of the thralls and many illithids before leaving the Underdark.</string>
<string name="91263">Katana +6</string>
<string name="91264">Katana +7</string>
<string name="91265">Sword Saint Legacy +8</string>
<string name="91266">With death being the ultimate challenge for a great warrior to overcome, powerful and noble warriors have begun to sacrifice their physical bodies, so that their spirits can inhabit an ancestral Katana.  The more powerful the warrior was in life, and the more noble his spirit, the more powerful the sword. It is told that the great Master Kendai Kousra inhabits a weapon so powerful that a god claimed it as his weapon of choice.</string>
<string name="91267">Radiant Death</string>
<string name="91268">This finely crafted katana belonged to the renowned swordsman Viromoto, a weapon master from the East who fought a hundred duels before finally dying. The keen blade shatters through any opponent&apos;s defenses, but it is so sharp and light that it is difficult for even a master to wield. Viromoto gradually became distrustful of the weapon and for his final duel he favored a different weapon -- only to fall in battle, his first and only defeat.</string>
<string name="91269">Longsword +6</string>
<string name="91270">Longsword +7</string>
<string name="91271">Aramil&apos;s Blade</string>
<string name="91272">Aramil the Triumphant was a gladiator famed for his great strength and his brutish lack of grace. Near the end of his career, the fading champion requisitioned the creation of a special sword on the eve of what was to be his final match, even contributing a vial of his own blood so that the weapon&apos;s magic would draw upon and amplify his own legendary strength. However, Aramil&apos;s scheduled opponent - Unferth the Cunning - convinced the wizard crafting the blade to use the blood to imbue the weapon with *all* of Aramil&apos;s traits, including his oafish clumsiness.

An awkward combatant at the best of times, the sword&apos;s drawback turned Aramil into a stumbling buffoon and he was easily dispatched by Unferth. The poor performance left an ugly stain on an otherwise glorious career, and Aramil  - along with the magical blade that had been his downfall - was quickly forgotten.</string>
<string name="91273">Astral Blade +8</string>
<string name="91274">On an exploration into the ruins of Northkeep, the bard Leldor claimed to have found and identified this powerful magic longsword; yet he could offer no proof of its existence. According to the fanciful tale he wove, the ghosts of the original defenders came to him whilst he slept and claimed the sword belonged to the Lady of the North. When he asked who this Lady was, a beautiful apparition appeared, and Leldor immediately fell in love and returned her weapon.</string>
<string name="91275">Holy Avenger</string>
<string name="91276">The dream of every paladin is to claim his own Holy Avenger. These blessed weapons are found only amongst the most elite paladins, whose lives have been fully dedicated to the pursuits of their gods. One famous paladin described his weapon as his best and last friend in every situation. When peace fails, the Holy Avenger becomes the embodiment of the law.</string>
<string name="91277">Rapier +6</string>
<string name="91278">Rapier +7</string>
<string name="91279">Namarra (Neversleep) +8</string>
<string name="91280">Feckle Raspude was considered one of the most unusual gnomes of his generation. A swashbuckler with a flair for attracting attention, Feckle drove the young, gnomish ladies wild, with his lopsided grin and impudent behavior. Many a young glory-hunting gnome challenged Feckle to a dual, but the magic of his rapier quickly dispatched his naysayers into gentle slumber. A consummate prankster, Feckle humbled his opponents with practical jokes that were simply unbeatable.</string>
<string name="91281">Scimitar +6</string>
<string name="91282">Scimitar +7</string>
<string name="91283">Desert Wind +8</string>
<string name="91284">If rumors of Calimshite ancestry are true, then this scimitar is likely the product of the genies that founded the city long ago. All of the raging heat of the desert seems to be captured within the blade of the sword. Tales of enemies surrendering after merely a scratch only seem untrue until one has tasted the blistering pain the Desert Wind causes a wound.</string>
<string name="91285">Short Sword +6</string>
<string name="91286">Short Sword +7</string>
<string name="91287">Feyduster +8</string>
<string name="91288">The twisted mind of Nolls the evil enchanter, created the Fey Duster short sword. His masterwork was made by crushing the bodies of captured pixies to gather the dust that enhances this weapon. While it is widely believed that the dust itself causes some opponents to fall insensate, some druids claim that it is the death screams of the mutilated pixies, overpowering the minds of those struck down.</string>
<string name="91289">Shadowsilk</string>
<string name="91290">During one of her frequent sojourns into the realm of shadows, Cendra -- a shadowdancer who could slip in and out of the shadows even during the brightest of days -- became ensnared on the webs of a wraith spider. Luckily for her, if being captured in the first place could be considered lucky, she found this shortsword stuck beside her. With a dexterous tug she pulled the blade free and punctured the wraith spider&apos;s belly with it. She used the keen blade to shave herself free of the webs. She and the blade were lost when she joined an expedition into the Underdark.</string>

<string name="91406">Since before the founding of the city of Waterdeep, an infamous dungeon known as Undermountain has existed beneath it. While full of many dangers, Undermountain has never threatened the city... until now.</string>
<string name="91407">For reasons unknown, Waterdeep is now suddenly under siege from forces originating within Undermountain. A call has gone out for heroes to deal with this mysterious threat, and it is to this call that you have responded.</string>
<string name="91408">Upon your arrival in Waterdeep late in the night, you were ushered to the Yawning Portal, an inn which holds access to Undermountain itself. Here you and other adventurers are to meet with the proprietor, Durnan, to organize yourselves for what is to come.</string>
<string name="91409">However, you have a choice to make before you sleep for the night. You have enough experience to become a 15th level character. You may choose to let your package -- chosen when you first created your character -- level you up, or you can level yourself up manually.</string>

<string name="91444">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Teleport]&lt;/Start&gt; Yes.</string>
<string name="91445">&quot;I thought... I thought I was capable of handling anything, even the terrors of Undermountain. But it turns out I&apos;m no match for the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="91446">&quot;Maybe a hero of your stature can survive in Halaster&apos;s dungeon, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But I&apos;ve learned my lesson. I&apos;m staying right here in the inn. I&apos;m not going anywhere near Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="91447">Dark days stalk this city. I feel as if someone is walking across my grave.</string>
<string name="91448">I wish I could tell the drow about the love of my goddess, but I fear their evil minds would not accept the faith.</string>
<string name="91449">May peace find this city soon. So many lives are wasted in war.</string>
<string name="91450">So much death in this city, it is a shame I wasn&apos;t here to help.</string>
<string name="91451">I don&apos;t mind the waiting so much, but I look forward to practicing the healing arts when I have the chance.</string>
<string name="91452">I long to spread the teachings of my goddess in the Underdark.</string>
<string name="91453">&quot;I came here to prove myself in Undermountain, but those drow made short work of me. If not for that priestess I would still be nothing but a corpse.&quot;</string>
<string name="91454">&quot;Maybe... maybe it&apos;s time for me to give up my adventuring ways and settle down. At the very least, I won&apos;t be using that well of Durnan&apos;s to go into Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="91455">Don&apos;t bother me.  No one&apos;s getting in to the well room till Durnan says its ok.</string>
<string name="91456">&quot;Squawk, squawk.&quot;</string>
<string name="91457">The raven has been watching a chicken with a bit of a limp. She wishes the stupid beast would hurry up and die.</string>
<string name="91458">The raven wonders why any rational creature, would want to live in such a dark and desolate place.</string>
<string name="91459">The raven is unsure if the number of corpses to feed on really makes up for the lack of flying room here in Undermountain.</string>
<string name="91460">The raven insists that it is fully in keeping with the laws of the universe that a raven can hover in one spot.</string>
<string name="91461">The raven hurriedly tells you that something has happened to the sky and it expects you to make the problem go away... now!</string>
<string name="91462">The raven is rather confused about a pun involving foul and fowl. It decides that puns must be some kind of foolish earthbound humor.</string>
<string name="91463">&quot;Hello raven.&quot;</string>
<string name="91464">Help, help, a monster, a monster!</string>
<string name="91465">I&apos;m scared. Do you think the armies will come again when it gets dark?</string>
<string name="91466">I never got to be in the fighting, but I bet I could have killed a bunch of duergar.</string>
<string name="91467">If I kill a drow, I&apos;m going to steal his sword and become a powerful warrior.</string>
<string name="91468">Can we play a game? I&apos;ll be the soldiers and you be the drow. That way I get to win.</string>
<string name="91469">Do I have to play in here? I want to go outside.</string>
<string name="91470">My dad was wounded in the fighting. Are those monsters coming back?</string>
<string name="91471">You look more like a monster than a hero. I&apos;m still glad you&apos;re on our side though.</string>
<string name="91472">I&apos;m so glad to see a hero here to help. We&apos;ll need every weapon we can get when the armies return.</string>
<string name="91473">You look like a true hero. I feel safer already.</string>
<string name="91474">I wanted to go out and visit a temple, but with the streets closed I guess I&apos;ll have to pray right here.</string>
<string name="91475">When my home was destroyed, this was the only place I could turn to. Thank the gods for this refuge!</string>
<string name="91476">They came in the night and left before morn. How can we stop the darkness?</string>
<string name="91477">Durnan has always been a great man; surely he will save us. I hear you are a hero too. You should help him.</string>
<string name="91478">They burned down my house. We should invade their caves and burn them all out.</string>
<string name="91479">I&apos;m not sure who you are, but I&apos;m trying to get a look at the new hero Durnan summoned. Please excuse me.</string>
<string name="91480">You could shatter my heart with a smile. You must truly be a hero.</string>
<string name="91481">Like staring too long at the sun&apos;s beauty; I am blinded by your handsome features.</string>
<string name="91482">With the face of an angel he comes, the hero of our fair city. My chest heaves with a mighty sigh; oh, that he could love me.</string>
<string name="91483">The sweetest face in a crowd always belongs to the &lt;race&gt; people. Good to see you, friend.</string>
<string name="91484">How many &lt;race&gt; adventurers are there? Well, there can never be enough, I always say.</string>
<string name="91485">How heartening to meet another of my race. I am glad to see I am not alone here.</string>
<string name="91486">Never trust &lt;race&gt; adventurers! That what my mother always taught me.</string>
<string name="91487">Oh look, another &lt;race&gt; adventurer! I always love meeting different races.</string>
<string name="91488">Another &lt;race&gt; adventurer? I was really hoping for another of my kind.</string>
<string name="91489">Don&apos;t wave your weapon in my face. There&apos;s enough danger around here without you adding to it.</string>
<string name="91490">I know it&apos;s hard to know who to trust, but you can probably put your weapon away in the inn.</string>
<string name="91491">I hope you&apos;re gonna use that weapon to teach those monsters a lesson about invading Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="91492">There is a time and place for everything, but this is neither the time nor place for removing your clothes.</string>
<string name="91493">I&apos;ve heard of the heat of battle, but it&apos;s not really warm enough to run naked through the streets.</string>
<string name="91494">This is no time for games of pleasure. This is war; go put some clothes on.</string>
<string name="91495">The monsters are back! Mommy help me!</string>
<string name="91496">I could hear the fighting from my bedroom. Mommy hid me in the closet, but it was scary in there.</string>
<string name="91497">Are you a hero? I have a friend who&apos;s a hero. He&apos;s invisible!</string>
<string name="91498">I want my mommy! Where did my mommy go?</string>
<string name="91499">Mister Durnan will save us. He&apos;s letting us stay here.</string>
<string name="91500">My doll&apos;s name is Snaffy and she isn&apos;t afraid of any dark monsters.</string>
<string name="91501">My mom says that daddy isn&apos;t coming back. Where did he go?</string>
<string name="91502">You&apos;re a nasty looking &lt;lad/lass&gt;. I hope I never get on your bad side.</string>
<string name="91503">I hope you know how to fight. We&apos;re going to need all the help we can get.</string>
<string name="91504">I have heard great things about you. I hope they were not lies.</string>
<string name="91505">I feel trapped in here. I hope they open the streets soon, so that I can go rebuild my home.</string>
<string name="91506">Durnan and Mhaere are good people to take us in when we have lost everything. I only hope I can someday repay their kindness.</string>
<string name="91507">They must pay for their savage crimes! We should invade and destroy them utterly!</string>
<string name="91508">My home was destroyed, my family massacred; who shall stop this dark tide?</string>
<string name="91509">You have quite the reputation. I hope you are here to help us.</string>
<string name="91510">Life has become so dark and the future, so clouded, that hope seems lost.</string>
<string name="91511">We huddle in here, while the streets are patrolled by the guard, but who patrols the dark passages beneath us?</string>
<string name="91512">I&apos;ve heard that Durnan has called for a powerful hero to save the city. Have you seen one?</string>
<string name="91513">I would die for a woman like you, if I wasn&apos;t such a coward.</string>
<string name="91514">The most beautiful flower becomes plain in the company of your stunning looks.</string>
<string name="91515">You stole my breath when I saw your fair face. Can such beauty be revealed in the face of a hero?</string>
<string name="91516">We &lt;race&gt; folk must stand together. Good to see you, friend.</string>
<string name="91517">How many &lt;race&gt; adventurers are there? Well, there can never be enough, I always say.</string>
<string name="91518">Glad I am to meet another of my race. We shall stand together against the enemy.</string>
<string name="91519">Didn&apos;t see too many of you &lt;race&gt; folk until the Lords of Waterdeep announced that big reward!</string>
<string name="91520">Hmph, another &lt;race&gt; adventurer. Don&apos;t expect me to protect your back.</string>
<string name="91521">Don&apos;t get that many &lt;race&gt; adventurers these days. I suppose every &lt;man/woman&gt; helps.</string>
<string name="91522">Don&apos;t wave your weapon in my face. There&apos;s enough danger around here without you adding to it.</string>
<string name="91523">You are obviously well prepared for battle, but you don&apos;t need to wave your weapons at me, good &lt;man/woman&gt;.</string>
<string name="91524">You just about hit me with your weapon. Please put it away.</string>
<string name="91525">There is a time and place for everything, but this is neither the time nor place for removing your clothes.</string>
<string name="91526">I&apos;ve heard of the heat of battle, but it&apos;s not really warm enough to run naked through the streets.</string>
<string name="91527">I love the sight of a beautiful naked body; in a brothel, not here.</string>
<string name="91528">A dark frown covers this woman&apos;s face as she surveys her displays of weapons and armor. As you approach her, she cocks her head to the side and arches an imperious eyebrow.</string>
<string name="91529">She pauses and examines your bearing. &quot;Great pardon. Now that Argali looks upon you, she sees that you have more of the look of an adventurer than a common looter.&quot;</string>
<string name="91530">&quot;How can Argali Silth be of assistance today?&quot;</string>
<string name="91531">&quot;Ah, the famed adventurer Durnan spoke of. How can Argali Silth be of assistance today?&quot;</string>
<string name="91532">&quot;Argali&apos;s Arms will be open to you whenever you return.&quot;</string>
<string name="91533">&quot;Although Argali&apos;s purpose is the making of money, she does make time to assist those who have need of information.&quot;</string>
<string name="91534">&quot;Yes, Argali doesn&apos;t blame you for wanting to know more about her. Argali&apos;s father was Typhonus Silth, former Pasha of Calimshan, and a wealthy merchant.&quot;</string>
<string name="91535">&quot;He taught Argali that thinking one is the best is part of actually becoming one of the best. Typhonus Silth was a great man, but a great man has enemies. It was these enemies who brought Typhonus down.</string>
<string name="91536">&quot;Argali lost everything when her father fell - everything but her pride. Though poor, she still knew she was the best, and she vowed to build herself up again.&quot;</string>
<string name="91537">&quot;Argali left Calimshan and came to Waterdeep. Argali became a merchant, like her father the great Typhonus. She started with nothing but pride, but now Argali is as wealthy as her father ever was.&quot;</string>
<string name="91538">&quot;Calimshan is full of corruption and greed. Argali was only ten when her father&apos;s cousin poisoned him.&quot;</string>
<string name="91539">&quot;Typhonus held her hand as he died and told her to be strong and calculating; to trust no one, not even kin. The only one Argali can trust is Argali herself.&quot;</string>
<string name="91540">&quot;Argali learned her lesson well. She is now wealthy, healthy and most importantly alive.&quot;</string>
<string name="91541">Argali sneers at you before replying. &quot;It was hard, but now Argali has all she was ever striving for. Her father would be proud.&quot;</string>
<string name="91542">&quot;Now enough of this topic, Argali does not want to speak of it anymore. What can she do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="91543">&quot;Argali has strong guards and powerful defenses, so no raiders get into her shop. But Argali is angered by this war on her city. She wishes to help those who defend her.&quot;</string>
<string name="91544">&quot;That is why she stays open, even when business is bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="91545">&quot;Special items? You have been talking to Mother Salinka, haven&apos;t you? Argali knows. The old wench always tries to make trouble for Argali by mentioning this to adventurers.&quot;</string>
<string name="91546">&quot;Argali does have a special item. But Argali hates Mother Salinka; why should she sell the special item to a friend of the Mother?&quot; </string>
<string name="91547">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Argali will not be intimidated! Not even by one as important as you, &lt;FullName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="91548">&quot;Her guards are brave and strong and she is friends with Durnan, who hired you. If you would buy something from Argali, then do so now or leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="91549">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; She appears to be slightly shaken, but recovers quickly. &quot;Argali&apos;s guards will protect her, but you are very powerful, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Argali doesn&apos;t want any trouble.&quot;</string>
<string name="91550">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;As Argali said, fame is nothing new to her. You are free to look through my inventory and buy whatever you can afford.&quot;</string>
<string name="91551">&quot;Argali thinks her selection is very good and needs no special additions to make it better.&quot;</string>
<string name="91552">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Argali has no secret dealings. Everyone knows Argali&apos;s reputation, they will know your lies for what they are. If this is your only business with Argali, then you should leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="91553">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; She looks at you with a calculating eye. &quot;Argali makes no such deals. But Argali thinks you are the kind of &lt;man/woman&gt; who would spread lies about Argali&apos;s reputation.&quot;</string>
<string name="91554">&quot;You like to cause trouble, like that she-dog Mother Salinka. But Durnan says you are important to the city, so Argali will help you anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="91555">She considers your proposal for a minute. &quot;Argali&apos;s fame is great, but it can always be greater. Yes, Argali will show you her special item, and you will tell all your friends about the greatness of her shop.&quot;</string>
<string name="91556">&quot;If you have an appreciation for items that are wonderful, yet flawed, you might enjoy this magical cloak I have.&quot;</string>
<string name="91557">She pulls out a solid black box and opens it just slightly. A glittering, swirling shaft of light comes out of the box.</string>
<string name="91558">&quot;It&apos;s a Cloak of Bedazzlement. The patterns of light distract your enemies, making it much harder for them to hit you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91559">&quot;The lights can also be controlled, so that several times a day it can be used to charm your enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="91560">&quot;But, most of the time the brilliance of the cloak bothers people and makes it harder for them to like you. Argali understands this all too well.&quot; </string>
<string name="91561">&quot;That is your choice of course. Argali will still have the cloak, unless she finds another worthy buyer first.&quot;</string>
<string name="91562">&quot;Argali would part with the cloak for a mere 10000 gold, a pittance compared to what it is worth.&quot;</string>
<string name="91563">&quot;Then Argali cannot sell it to you at this time. She could not possibly go lower in price.&quot;</string>
<string name="91564">&quot;Argali hopes you take good care of this cloak. It has special meaning to her, but she no longer needs it and it should be used by one who will appreciate its value.&quot;</string>
<string name="91565">&quot;Argali is sorry, but she already sold her special item to another. Perhaps once the city reopens, new items will be available.&quot;</string>
<string name="91566">&quot;Argali Silth is a great merchant. She has generously agreed to keep her shop open and make her arms and armor available for purchase despite all dangers.&quot;</string>
<string name="91567">&quot;It is a sad day when the streets are closed and the people too scared to flock to buy Argali&apos;s magnificent goods. Would you be interested in seeing Argali&apos;s goods? They are very high quality.&quot;</string>
<string name="91568">&quot;Argali has no problem with war in general, but she has a problem with a war that comes to her home and burns it down.&quot;</string>
<string name="91569">&quot;Argali would much sooner sell her goods to adventurers. Then it is reasonable to assume that her goods will be used to slay monsters and spread her fame.&quot;</string>
<string name="91570">&quot;Selling to those who would murder children and other innocents does not make for a reputable arms dealer. Argali knows this is not a popular opinion among her peers.&quot;</string>
<string name="91571">&quot;That is what most who sells arms and armor would do, but Argali is better than most. She does not want fame for her weapons slaying children, though there is not much she can do to stop it.&quot;</string>
<string name="91572">&quot;Alas, no one, not even Argali Silth, can be positive that the use of her merchandise will be for good.&quot; </string>
<string name="91573">&quot;Argali knows only that she must try. Argali has been told that some might come who would try to help the city. You are one of those.&quot;</string>
<string name="91574">&quot;So, famed adventurer, tell Argali what your needs are.&quot;</string>
<string name="91575">&quot;Argali sells only the best.&quot;</string>
<string name="91576">&quot;Argali speaks as she does. Who are you to judge her words when she deigns to speak to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="91577">&quot;You may count yourself fortunate indeed that you have been graced by her presence and that you shall be blessed with her goods, should you have the coin.&quot;</string>
<string name="91578">&quot;Should you have need for some of the finest weapons and armor in Faerun, then return and Argali shall satisfy yet another customer.&quot;</string>
<string name="91579">&quot;Argali recognizes that there are some who do not care for her, but such is the price for being the best. Argali thinks that personal feelings should not interfere with business.&quot;</string>
<string name="91580">&quot;While Argali does not expect all to think as clearly as she does, she hopes that you are more discerning than so many small-minded folk.&quot;</string>
<string name="91581">&quot;Argali knows that when you discover a need for her powerful weapons and magical armor, you will return to sing a different tune. Then Argali shall smile.&quot;</string>
<string name="91582">&quot;Now, how can Argali Silth be of assistance to you today?&quot;</string>
<string name="91583">&quot;Argali is who she is and needs to change for no one. If Argali told you to give up the adventurer&apos;s life and become a simple farmer, would you do it? Argali thinks not.&quot;</string>
<string name="91584">&quot;Argali bids you farewell.&quot;</string>
<string name="91585">&quot;Is that how you greet all your customers?&quot; </string>
<string name="91586">&quot;No protections could stop me, if I wanted to rob you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91587">&quot;I&apos;m not some petty thug. I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="91588">&quot;Goodbye.&quot; </string>
<string name="91589">&quot;May I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="91590">&quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="91591">&quot;How did your father lose his position?&quot;</string>
<string name="91592">&quot;I have other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="91593">&quot;Obviously your father was a trusting fool. Good thing you learned better.&quot; </string>
<string name="91594">&quot;That&apos;s a bitter lesson.&quot;</string>
<string name="91595">&quot;Tell me about the attacks.&quot;</string>
<string name="91596">&quot;I was told to ask about your special items.&quot;</string>
<string name="91597">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You seem like a nice person, Argali. I&apos;d hate to see you get hurt.&quot; </string>
<string name="91598">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You can tell others that the great hero &lt;FullName&gt; always shops here.&quot;</string>
<string name="91599">&quot;Fine. Keep your secrets.&quot;</string>
<string name="91600">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I have heard rumors about some shady deals you&apos;ve made. If that got out, it could hurt business.&quot; </string>
<string name="91601">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;How about I tell my adventuring friends how good your store is?&quot;</string>
<string name="91602">&quot;Just a cloak? That&apos;s it?&quot; </string>
<string name="91603">&quot;What is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="91604">&quot;I&apos;m not interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="91605">&quot;How much do you want for it?&quot;</string>
<string name="91606">&quot;That&apos;s too much. I won&apos;t pay it.&quot; </string>
<string name="91607">&quot;I don&apos;t have that much.&quot;</string>
<string name="91608">&quot;Deal.&quot;</string>
<string name="91609">&quot;I&apos;m not sure. What do you sell here?&quot;</string>
<string name="91610">&quot;I thought a war would be good for your business.&quot;</string>
<string name="91611">&quot;You should welcome a war. It will boost your profits.&quot;</string>
<string name="91612">&quot;You make it sound noble, but how do you know they aren&apos;t evil?&quot;</string>
<string name="91613">&quot;That is a noble philosophy.&quot;</string>
<string name="91614">&quot;Nothing right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="91615">&quot;Let me see your inventory.&quot;</string>
<string name="91616">&quot;Wait a minute - are you talking about yourself in the third person?&quot;</string>
<string name="91617">&quot;I think I&apos;ll be going.&quot;</string>
<string name="91618">&quot;Well &lt;FullName&gt; doesn&apos;t like stuck up merchants, so &lt;FullName&gt; will go away.&quot;</string>
<string name="91619">&quot;You&apos;re an idiot. I&apos;m leaving now.&quot;</string>
<string name="91620">&quot;I guess you have a point.&quot;</string>
<string name="91621">&quot;Okay, have it your way... Argali.&quot;</string>
<string name="91622">&quot;You certainly are full of yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="91623">&quot;I&apos;ve changed my mind. Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="91624">&quot;I want to buy that cloak you mentioned before.&quot; </string>
<string name="91625">&quot;Tell me about that cloak you mentioned before.&quot;</string>
<string name="91626">The dark skin of the drow blends her into the shadows, but still you can see the twisted hatred clearly upon her face.</string>
<string name="91627">She holds up a small dagger that glows with an evil, green aura... and she snarls. &quot;Oloth plynn dos!&quot;</string>
<string name="91628">You stand shivering in the chill night air, sweat coursing down your body. You were somehow woken suddenly from your slumber, leaping from your bed to face, what?</string>
<string name="91629">The memory of your strange dream still rings clearly in your head, along with an inner alarm that tells you all is not right. Suddenly you notice a drow elf!  She appears to be trying to break into the chest with your personal belongings.</string>
<string name="91630">&quot;These barricades have been erected to contain the invaders.  I&apos;m sorry, but no one may pass until the Lords of Waterdeep give permission.&quot;</string>
<string name="91631">&quot;If you see one of the enemy, know that there are more about. They travel in groups, and usually have a spellcaster with them.&quot;</string>
<string name="91632">&quot;Sometimes I can hear the enemy moving through the shadows. We&apos;ve been told to hold these barricades, otherwise I would attack the villains myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="91633">&quot;Do not attempt to cross the barricades, citizen. We must contain the invaders, by order of the Lords of Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="91634">&quot;Be wary, citizen. There are things moving around out here more dangerous than your typical cutpurse.&quot;</string>
<string name="91635">&quot;These barricades have been erected to contain the invaders.  I&apos;m sorry, but no one may pass until the Lords of Waterdeep give permission.&quot;</string>
<string name="91636">You open the chest that currently houses your possessions, some of them powerful objects in their own right gained after years of adventuring since leaving your home of Hilltop long ago.</string>
<string name="91637">The most powerful of all your possessions, however, is the only one you can never store. The Relic of the Reaper, an artifact that bonded itself to you during a time you spent in the Plane of Shadows, remains in your hand as always.</string>
<string name="91638">You know little of the stone beyond its power to transport you through the planes... an ability that allowed you to escape the Plane of Shadow originally and since has allowed you to cheat death on more than one occasion.</string>
<string name="91639">You rub the stone absently, feeling the familiar pulsing of its magic beneath your touch, before considering what other equipment you need for the moment.</string>
<string name="91640">&quot;You&apos;re the one that Master Durnan&apos;s waiting for, aren&apos;t you? Thank heavens! Now everyone can get started!&quot;</string>
<string name="91641">&quot;They say that Master Durnan is waiting for some famous adventurer who arrived last night. I wonder who that is.&quot;</string>
<string name="91642">The cook swats at a fly that buzzes around a pot of soup. &quot;How am I supposed to work in such conditions?&quot;</string>
<string name="91643">The cook waves a wooden spoon in your face. &quot;If you are the one who is filching biscuits, you had better stop!&quot;</string>
<string name="91644">The cook samples a dish and then spits on the floor. &quot;This is horrible! There is far too much garlic in here. What are we trying to do, keep away vampires?&quot;</string>
<string name="91645">The cook looks at you and throws his hands in the air. &quot;The food is not prepared yet! Go away!&quot;</string>
<string name="91646">The cook, a man with a greasy apron and a long, thin mustache growls at his kitchen helpers and moves quickly from one dish to another.</string>
<string name="91647">He sees you and yells, &quot;Get out of my kitchen. You&apos;re in the way!&quot;</string>
<string name="91648">&quot;We&apos;re under attack! They must have come up from the Well in the basement!&quot;</string>
<string name="91649">The half-orc bristles with muscles and tribal tattoos that mark him as a member of one of the northern tribes, though you notice he is quite clean and comfortable in civilized environs. He regards you with mild annoyance as you approach.</string>
<string name="91650">&quot;Indeed. The way the innkeeper has been keeping everyone waiting breathlessly for the ever-famous &lt;FullName&gt;, one would wonder why the rest of us came at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="91651">&quot;Enough, both of you. This &lt;man/woman&gt; deserves our respect. &lt;He/She&gt; is an adventurer of worth, and the fact that &lt;he/she&gt; is here is a boon to our cause.&quot;</string>
<string name="91652">&quot;Huh. There ain&apos;t no cause that I know about that&apos;s gonna pay me a hundred thousand gold like this one will, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="91653">&quot;I agree with Tomi. Gold speaks louder than any cause I&apos;ve ever heard of.&quot;</string>
<string name="91654">&quot;That is an odd thing for a bard to say, Sharwyn. Have you no sense of the epic? I wonder if our friend here would agree with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91655">&quot;Then why do we not ask &lt;him/her&gt;? What of it, &lt;FirstName&gt;? What has brought you to Waterdeep in its hour of need?&quot;</string>
<string name="91656">The half-orc relaxes a bit and nods, pleased. &quot;I am pleased to hear that. The city of Neverwinter was once saved by one who chose to do the right thing, as you say.&quot;</string>
<string name="91657">He studies you a moment longer before finally sighing. &quot;Please forgive my earlier aggravation. My temper is shorter than usual, it seems, after our long trip. I have heard much of you... Waterdeep is fortunate that you are here.&quot;</string>
<string name="91658">He studies you a moment longer before finally sighing. &quot;Please forgive my earlier aggravation. My temper is shorter than usual, it seems, after our long trip. You are a fine warrior, I hear, and Waterdeep is fortunate to have you here.&quot;</string>
<string name="91659">&quot;Your deeds do not require flattery, but I&apos;ll not argue the point with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91660">&quot;Then I wish you fortune and a strong arm in Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="91661">&quot;You may not wish to keep the innkeeper, Durnan, waiting much longer. He is most anxious to speak with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91662">He shrugs. &quot;If you wish, certainly.&quot;</string>
<string name="91663">&quot;He is in the next room, I believe. He is looking for you, so he will be difficult to miss.&quot;</string>
<string name="91664">&quot;It appears that the city is attacked by the forces of Undermountain every few nights. Creatures appear out of nowhere about the city, burning and killing. There has, however, been no concerted invasion.&quot;</string>
<string name="91665">&quot;The Lords have closed Waterdeep up tight, so as to prevent any attacks from having access to the entire city. This has slowed the city to a stand-still as well, of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="91666">&quot;Once Waterdeep runs out of supplies, I fear things will quickly become much worse. Of course, should these forces begin a true invasion supplies will be the least of this city&apos;s worries.&quot;</string>
<string name="91667">&quot;I met most of my companions in Neverwinter, after the business with the plague had ended. They have proven stalwart, if somewhat misguided, though it is not really my place to judge them.&quot;</string>
<string name="91668">&quot;Beware of the halfling, Tomi, for he will pick your pockets without even knowing he is doing so. The lady Sharwyn is little better, I&apos;m afraid, though a brave woman by any measure.&quot;</string>
<string name="91669">&quot;I am most fond of the elven woman, Linu. She is a woman of faith who has always provided us fair guidance.&quot;</string>
<string name="91670">&quot;Perhaps I might. For the moment, however, I am committed to these companions and I will not abandon them.&quot;</string>
<string name="91671">&quot;Fortunately, I have had the opportunity to participate in many noble deeds. Reward or no, coming to Waterdeep may afford me the chance to continue in that vein.&quot;</string>
<string name="91672">&quot;You have not heard? The Lords of Waterdeep are anxious for this invasion to be halted, naturally. Waterdeep is the most prosperous city of the north... its danger is everyone&apos;s.&quot;</string>
<string name="91673">&quot;The Lords seek information, and should someone actually prove able to halt the attacks a total of one hundred thousand gold has been offered as a reward.&quot;</string>
<string name="91674">&quot;Anyone could do much with that much gold, even a barbarian such as I. To tell the truth, however, I have come for the challenge of Undermountain, itself.&quot;</string>
<string name="91675">&quot;I know it is a place of tunnels that reach deep under the earth, created by the mad mage Halaster long ago. More adventurers lie dead in its halls than anywhere else in Faerun.&quot;</string>
<string name="91676">&quot;How such a place of danger and monsters has lived in peace underneath Faerun&apos;s largest city for so long is difficult to say. Perhaps it was only a matter of time before this happened?&quot;</string>
<string name="91677">He nods to you, obviously pleased, but says nothing further.</string>
<string name="91678">The half-orc avoids your gaze, scowling, but says nothing further.</string>
<string name="91679">He scowls ruefully. &quot;And a half-orc barbarian, no less.&quot; He shrugs. &quot;You are no doubt correct. I have traveled much in my years away from the tribe.&quot;</string>
<string name="91680">The assorted group looks at you uncomfortably for a moment. The half-orc stares at you openly before speaking. &quot;It appears that the tales of heroes such as yourself do not always tell the truth. So be it.&quot;</string>
<string name="91681">The half-orc looks away and snorts with obvious derision, but does not push the topic further.</string>
<string name="91682">The half-orc grins suddenly, showing a full set of sharp teeth. &quot;I read a book about you, once. It never said that you were humble.&quot;</string>
<string name="91683">The half-orc nods at you, looking relieved. &quot;The innkeeper is right to wait for you, then. You are not only a hero, you also have a valiant heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="91684">The half-orc looks away, sighing with resignation. &quot;A mercenary, then. Looks like there will be less money for you, Tomi.&quot;</string>
<string name="91685">&quot;Bloody hell.&quot;</string>
<string name="91686">The muscled barbarian nods to you in quiet acknowledgement.</string>
<string name="91687">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="91688">&quot;Durnan called for heroes. I&apos;m here to do the right thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="91689">&quot;Save the flattery, half-orc.&quot;</string>
<string name="91690">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="91691">&quot;Can I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="91692">&quot;Where do I find Durnan?&quot;</string>
<string name="91693">&quot;Do you know anything about what&apos;s going on in Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="91694">&quot;Tell me about these friends of yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="91695">&quot;Why don&apos;t you join me, instead?&quot;</string>
<string name="91696">&quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="91697">&quot;What is this reward again?&quot;</string>
<string name="91698">&quot;What do you know about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="91699">&quot;Thank you. I appreciate it.&quot;</string>
<string name="91700">&quot;Just keep your temper in check or I put you in your place.&quot;</string>
<string name="91701">&quot;You&apos;re quite well-spoken for a barbarian.&quot;</string>
<string name="91702">&quot;If there&apos;s a chance to kill something, I&apos;ll always take it.&quot;</string>
<string name="91703">&quot;If it ever becomes your business, I&apos;ll let you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="91704">&quot;To be honest, I don&apos;t really know why I&apos;m here.&quot;</string>
<string name="91705">&quot;I care what happens to Waterdeep, even if you don&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="91706">&quot;I&apos;m always looking for adventure, if the reward is right.&quot;</string>
<string name="91707">Furiously writing away in a small tome, the small kobold is not aware of your approach.  When he glances up and notices you, he smiles broadly.</string>
<string name="91708">&quot;You not remembers Deekin? How you say that to Deekin, boss? Deekin remembers the great hero who save Deekin so long ago! Deekin remembers forever!&quot;</string>
<string name="91709">&quot;Deekin dead?&quot; The kobold scratches his head, confused. &quot;No, Deekin not be dead. Boss really think Deekin be dead all this time?&quot;</string>
<string name="91710">&quot;How can boss say that? Little Deekin be so sad now! Deekin be happy to see boss, after all! It be very long time!&quot;</string>
<string name="91711">&quot;Why boss be surprised? Deekin remember boss die once or twice, too, and that not take, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="91712">The kobold scratches his head, confused. &quot;Who raises Deekin? Deekin&apos;s mother raise little Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="91713">&quot;Is boss not happy to sees Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="91714">&quot;You remembers Deekin! Deekin so happy now! Deekin not sees you for so long since he writes book, Deekin think you not remember him at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="91715">&quot;You try to forgets Deekin? Everyone always say to Deekin that he not so easy to forget. Not that anybody ever say they actually try.&quot;</string>
<string name="91716">&quot;Yes, it has been long time, boss. Deekin be real busy for long time traveling and writing book. Deekin be famous bard, now!&quot;</string>
<string name="91717">Deekin chuckles and looks away from your gaze, shrugging. &quot;Maybe Deekin not be so famous. Most people who reads book not even know Deekin be kobold, Deekin thinks. But it not be so bad. Deekin still gets to do lots of things he never thinks he gets to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="91718">&quot;Ooo! You gets book? Deekin so very pleased! Did you reads it, boss? Did you likes it?&quot;</string>
<string name="91719">The kobolds shrugs, not meeting your eyes. &quot;It not so bad, Deekin guesses. Deekin travels just like he says he would... but he not gets as far as he thinks he would. Deekin not be big complainer.&quot;</string>
<string name="91720">The kobold gives you a big, toothy grin. &quot;Deekin happy, too. Deekin travels lots, just like he says he would. Deekin still not believes his eyes that human cities be so big!&quot;</string>
<string name="91721">&quot;Deekin finish his great epic story about boss, too, just like Deekin say he would! Did you sees it? Did you likes it?&quot;</string>
<string name="91722">&quot;Oohhh,&quot; Deekin&apos;s eyes go wide and he stares at the ground, crestfallen. &quot;Deekin thought that you like epic story, maybe...&quot;</string>
<string name="91723">&quot;Good news be that Deekin work on new book, now. See? Deekin not gots title for it, yet, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="91724">&quot;Oh.&quot; Deekin quietly closes up the mostly-empty tome and puts it away. &quot;That be why Deekin come to Waterdeep, to be great hero like boss was.&quot;</string>
<string name="91725">He takes out a small lute and begins strumming it experimentally. &quot;Deekin learn to play songs, lately, a little. Maybe Deekin practice here? It keeps people calm, maybe.&quot;</string>
<string name="91726">Deekin claps his hands together excitedly. &quot;Yay! Deekin think you never ask, boss! This be just like old adventure... but sequel!&quot;</string>
<string name="91727">Deekin claps his hands together excitedly. &quot;Yay! Deekin think you never ask, boss! We make great team, you and Deekin, just you waits and sees!&quot;</string>
<string name="91728">The kobold looks at your companions closely and then shrugs. &quot;Deekin would be glad to help boss, but... boss got lots of help already. You not needs little Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="91729">&quot;It not good place for nobody, Deekin thinks. Big races gets killed just as fast as small ones. Where it say that kobold not allowed to help?&quot;</string>
<string name="91730">The kobold shakes his head, grinning. &quot;Deekin not so silly! Deekin not go in Undermountain by himself, no... Deekin just get killed that way. Deekin great kobold hero, but still just little kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="91731">&quot;Deekin come and hope that he find other adventurers, maybe they takes Deekin with them. But,&quot; here the kobold sighs sadly, &quot;nobody wants to take little kobold along.&quot;</string>
<string name="91732">&quot;Deekin know lots. Deekin is bard, after all, and Undermountain be great legend.&quot;</string>
<string name="91733">&quot;Deekin not only knows things about Undermountain, Deekin know plenty of things about drow and Underdark, too. Old Master Tymofarrar used to speak about it all the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="91734">&quot;Deekin knows, for instance, that Undermountain was made by human named Halaster waaaay back before city was here. Was just little dungeon back then, maybe, but humans get so carried away.&quot;</string>
<string name="91735">&quot;Deekin know lots about Undermountain inside, too... before Deekin come to city, Deekin collect tales of adventurers who go inside and come out.&quot;</string>
<string name="91736">&quot;Deekin just try to be helpful. Otherwise some hero only take Deekin along to carry stuff, maybe, and Deekin still got bad back.&quot;</string>
<string name="91737">&quot;There be call for heroes, so Deekin come. Deekin be great kobold hero, after all... and it make great plot for second epic story, too! Even better if Boss be in it.&quot;</string>
<string name="91738">&quot;Ummm... no. It could be, though. Boss come to Waterdeep just like Deekin, because there be call for heroes? Second book be about Waterdeep and heroes like boss and Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="91739">&quot;Maybe. That why Deekin come to Waterdeep... there be call for heroes and Deekin want to be hero like boss was! It make for good book, Deekin thinking.&quot;</string>
<string name="91740">&quot;You likes it? Deekin soooo happy!&quot;</string>
<string name="91741">&quot;Deekin read that! It not gots kobolds, though, so Deekin think it very boring. Dumb elven lady no substitute for good kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="91742">Deekin shrugs. &quot;Deekin and boss be in big flying city at end, remember? There be lots of, ummm, screaming and running... not so much time to take notes, so Deekin tries to remember as much as he can.&quot;</string>
<string name="91743">Deekin shrugs, sighing. &quot;Lots of epic story gets cut out. Lots of stuff gets change, too, even though it not true. &apos;More epic&apos;, publisher say. Deekin thinks publishers be very strange.&quot;</string>
<string name="91744">The kobold is strumming a small lute, appearing a bit bored, but suddenly perks up as he realizes you want to talk. He quickly puts away the lute and waves to you excitedly.</string>
<string name="91745">He sighs dejectedly. &quot;Okay. Deekin stay here, then, and... maybe work on book, though Deekin not gots much to write about...&quot;</string>
<string name="91746">&quot;Am I supposed to know you?&quot;</string>
<string name="91747">&quot;Nope, don&apos;t remember a thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="91748">&quot;Aren&apos;t you supposed to be dead?&quot;</string>
<string name="91749">&quot;Hoping, more like.&quot;</string>
<string name="91750">&quot;I do seem to recall you writing a book.&quot;</string>
<string name="91751">&quot;Well, the last time I saw you you were dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="91752">&quot;Yes, but who raised you?&quot;</string>
<string name="91753">&quot;No, I --- never mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="91754">&quot;Not exactly, no.&quot;</string>
<string name="91755">&quot;Of course I&apos;m happy to see you!&quot;</string>
<string name="91756">&quot;To be honest, I barely remember you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91757">*groan* &quot;Not you again.&quot;</string>
<string name="91758">&quot;Deekin? As in that kobold bard from near Hilltop?&quot;</string>
<string name="91759">&quot;I&apos;ve been trying hard to forget.&quot;</string>
<string name="91760">&quot;Well, it *has* been quite a long time.&quot;</string>
<string name="91761">&quot;Deekin! I haven&apos;t seen you for ages!&quot;</string>
<string name="91762">&quot;A famous kobold bard? You&apos;re kidding, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="91763">&quot;I have a copy of that book, actually.&quot;</string>
<string name="91764">&quot;So has it been everything you hoped, Deekin?&quot;</string>
<string name="91765">&quot;Congratulations, Deekin. I&apos;m happy for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91766">&quot;I hated it! What gave you the right to publish anything about me?&quot;</string>
<string name="91767">&quot;I couldn&apos;t care less about your new book.&quot;</string>
<string name="91768">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="91769">&quot;How about we join forces?&quot;</string>
<string name="91770">&quot;I don&apos;t think this is any place for a kobold.&quot;</string>
<string name="91771">&quot;So you came here expecting to go into Undermountain? By yourself?&quot;</string>
<string name="91772">&quot;What do you know about the situation here, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="91773">&quot;You know things about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="91774">&quot;That&apos;s pretty smart.&quot;</string>
<string name="91775">&quot;Is that why you&apos;re here in Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="91776">&quot;Is that one about me, as well?&quot;</string>
<string name="91777">&quot;I&apos;m sure it will be suitably epic.&quot;</string>
<string name="91778">&quot;It&apos;s about my first adventure. What&apos;s not to like?&quot;</string>
<string name="91779">&quot;It was better than this book I read about the plague in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="91780">&quot;It started off good but got rushed towards the end.&quot;</string>
<string name="91781">&quot;It was a bit shorter than I expected.&quot;</string>
<string name="91782">&quot;Forget it. I don&apos;t need your help.&quot;</string>
<string name="91783">&quot;Sure, I could use your help. Join up with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="91784">&quot;You can join me... but you do what I say, is that clear?&quot;</string>
<string name="91785">&quot;How could you be of help, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="91786">With long dried splatters of blood across his face and an ale in hand, the dwarf looks contented... and very drunk.</string>
<string name="91787">&quot;I tell ye true, I&apos;ve a taste fer blood an&apos; I&apos;m goin&apos; to taste more. Nothin&apos; could hold me back from this here Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="91788">&quot;Soon as I&apos;m done me drink, I&apos;m goin&apos; huntin! I&apos;ve got a hankerin&apos; fer some monster brains, served on me axe. How&apos;d ye like a taste of that fare, &lt;lad/lass&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="91789">&quot;Tall tales? Every word I say is the whole, pure truth! I&apos;ve half a mind to...&quot; The dwarf trails off and his eyes roll back into his head as he succumbs to the effects of his drinking binge.</string>
<string name="91790">&quot;A weak stomach serves a weak mind, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Now me, I&apos;ve eaten my way through a dragon&apos;s intestines to escape a delicate predicament.&quot;</string>
<string name="91791">&quot;And I don&apos;t mind tellin&apos; ye that a dragon&apos;s spleen is the juiciest meal a dwarf could enjoy, particularly while the dragon is still alive.&quot;</string>
<string name="91792">&quot;And a much more enjoyable experience than havin&apos; to eat me way through me brother&apos;s partly digested corpse, I promise ye that.&quot;</string>
<string name="91793">&quot;I&apos;ve no interest in yer questions, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, but as me ale is not quite finished, ye&apos;ve got me undivided attention.&quot;</string>
<string name="91794">&quot;Now ain&apos;t that the sweetest offer me ears have heard in a long time. But I&apos;m not ready to go quite yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="91795">&quot;I&apos;ll tell ye what. I&apos;m goin&apos; to have one more ale, and you can start down there. I&apos;ll catch up to ye soon as I finish up here.&quot;</string>
<string name="91796">The dwarf&apos;s eyes roll back in his head and he passes out.</string>
<string name="91797">&quot;They please me well, they do! Perfect opportunity for me to show me skills with the axe. If&apos;n I cut enough of them dark dwarves apart, it can only help me reputation.&quot;</string>
<string name="91798">&quot;Some of me kin think we should try to rescue our cousins from their dark destiny. To my mind, me axe be the rescuer &apos;n they be saved in death.&quot;</string>
<string name="91799">&quot;N&apos;er trust a dark dwarf, &lt;lad/lass&gt;! Them would turn on ye fer the sound of a single gold coin. That&apos;s all there is to say &apos;bout that.&quot;</string>
<string name="91800">&quot;Only that it is supposed to be the largest grave for adventurers in all the lands. T&apos;would have made a fine home, but now... ah, &apos;tis too much for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="91801">&quot;Ask me &apos;bout somethin&apos; else, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. There be no good in lookin&apos; to the past.&quot;</string>
<string name="91802">&quot;Fine then get out of me way. I&apos;ve got some more drinkin&apos; to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="91803">&quot;I should be thinkin&apos; that&apos;d be obvious. He ate me in one big gulp.&quot;</string>
<string name="91804">&quot;Me and me family was lookin&apos; for a new home, and we heard tell &apos;bout this huge dungeon, what was under Waterdeep, don&apos;t ye know.&quot;</string>
<string name="91805">&quot;We figured the mage that stocked the place could use a good dwarf or two to keep things goin&apos; so we came lookin&apos; fer Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="91806">&quot;Hold yer tounge, ye mangy cur. I&apos;m almost there. Ye see, we never found the mage, as we was attacked by this big black dragon first.&quot;</string>
<string name="91807">&quot;Sure, sounded like a right cozy little place to me family. Sadly we never found the mage, as we was set upon by one big black dragon.&quot;</string>
<string name="91808">&quot;He ate me brother and me pa, though he refused to eat me mother; I suppose she looked right bitter to him and all. He just spit his acid and melted her on the spot.&quot;</string>
<string name="91809">&quot;Finally he grabbed me and swallowed me whole. Unlike me poor family, I was wearin&apos; proper magical armor that protected me from the dragon&apos;s acid.&quot;</string>
<string name="91810">&quot;Are ye callin&apos; me a liar? Every word of that tale be pure truth. And I don&apos;t expect to have much trouble with this here dungeon neither.&quot;</string>
<string name="91811">&quot;Thank ye, &lt;lad/lass&gt;, but don&apos;t go thinkin&apos; I made it up. Every word is pure truth. And I don&apos;t suspect we&apos;ll be havin&apos; much more trouble with this dungeon here.&quot;</string>
<string name="91812">&quot;We&apos;ll carve that mountain up and massacre our enemies, striking terror into their hearts with maniacal laughter.&quot;</string>
<string name="91813">&quot;And I&apos;ll bet I can beat ye to the bottom, I do! I&apos;ll even let ye have a head start.&quot;</string>
<string name="91814">&quot;Aye. Don&apos;t go getting&apos; eaten by no dragons now.&quot; The dwarf&apos;s eyes roll back in his head and he passes out, succumbing to the effects of his drinking binge.</string>
<string name="91815">&quot;Well, don&apos;t count on too many kindnesses, but ye seem to have some qualities about yerself worth knowin&apos;.&quot;</string>
<string name="91816">&quot;Ha! That&apos;s the attitude, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. Ye&apos;ve some spark in ya, and I like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="91817">&quot;If ye get in some trouble down there and I wander by, I might even consider helpin&apos; ye.&quot;</string>
<string name="91818">&quot;But fer now, I wish ye the best o&apos; luck. I&apos;m just goin&apos; to have one more ale before I head down.&quot;</string>
<string name="91819">He slaps your shoulder and laughs, &quot;Aye, I thought ye might. And call me Drezzy, won&apos;t ye? Now me, I&apos;ve eaten my way through a dragon&apos;s intestines to escape a delicate predicament.&quot; </string>
<string name="91820">&quot;I can&apos;t waste my time listening to a drunk&apos;s tall tales.&quot;</string>
<string name="91821">&quot;That&apos;s disgusting!&quot; </string>
<string name="91822">&quot;Some other time, thanks anyways.&quot;</string>
<string name="91823">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="91824">&quot;I have no more questions.&quot; </string>
<string name="91825">&quot;Do you want to join me?&quot;</string>
<string name="91826">&quot;What do you think about these attacks?&quot;</string>
<string name="91827">&quot;What do you know about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="91828">&quot;I really don&apos;t care.&quot;</string>
<string name="91829">&quot;Start at the beginning. How did you get inside a dragon?&quot;</string>
<string name="91830">&quot;Hurry up and get to the dragon part.&quot;</string>
<string name="91831">&quot;You wanted to live in Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="91832">&quot;You really ate your way out of a live dragon?&quot;</string>
<string name="91833">&quot;A good tale, friend.&quot;</string>
<string name="91834">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="91835">&quot;That&apos;s mighty kind of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91836">&quot;I don&apos;t need a head start.&quot;</string>
<string name="91837">&quot;I&apos;ll join you in that feast, friend dwarf.&quot;</string>
<string name="91838">Durnan studies you appraisingly for a moment before nodding. &quot;Greetings. I trust you are here to aid Waterdeep against its attackers, yes? You wish to journey into Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="91839">&quot;If so, then I&apos;m glad. We can use all the help we can get. Is there something I can do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="91840">Durnan turns towards you as you enter the common room. A stern and solid man who is rumored to have once been a great warrior, the relief now on his face is clearly visible.</string>
<string name="91841">Durnan nods, his features grim. &quot;Tamsil tells me you dealt with the drow thief swiftly enough. I must apologize to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="91842">Durnan&apos;s smile is a grim one, belying a deep anger held barely in check. &quot;You are kind to joke about it so, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I must apologize nevertheless.&quot;</string>
<string name="91843">Durnan&apos;s features harden, a deep anger suddenly evident. &quot;Aye. Tamsil told me what happened. I cannot apologize enough, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="91844">&quot;Once I would have been able to ensure the safety of my guests, but no longer. The damnable drow come and go as they please, it seems. These are dark times for our city.&quot; </string>
<string name="91845">&quot;The enemies of Waterdeep must have learned you had answered our call for heroes. Given your reputation, it&apos;s not surprising that they targeted you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91846">&quot;Hold on a sec, there. A drow thief came in and stole all your equipment? Ha-ha-ha! If I&apos;d a known ye were such an easy mark I mighta nicked your stuff meself! Ha-ha-ha!&quot;</string>
<string name="91847">Durnan silences Tomi&apos;s laughter with a cold glare. &quot;This is no joking matter. The drow don&apos;t play games; I&apos;m guessing the theft was only the first step in their mission.&quot;</string>
<string name="91848">&quot;The drow likely figured you&apos;d be more vulnerable without your equipment. A drow assassin would probably have shown up a few seconds later to finish you off in your sleep.&quot;</string>
<string name="91849">&quot;Fortunately you woke up and thwarted their plan. Others in Waterdeep haven&apos;t been so lucky; there are several reports of prominent citizens slain in their beds.&quot;</string>
<string name="91850">&quot;Waterdeep is under attack, its people live in fear. That&apos;s why I made the call you all responded to... we&apos;re going to do something about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="91851">&quot;Yes, Durnan. Tell us what must be done.&quot;</string>
<string name="91852">&quot;But Undermountain has existed for centuries. Why hasn&apos;t there been any trouble before? &quot;</string>
<string name="91853">&quot;Undermountain was built hundreds of years ago, but Halaster is an archmage. Time doesn&apos;t mean the same to him as it does to us. I&apos;m certain he&apos;s still alive... and that he&apos;s involved in these attacks.&quot;</string>
<string name="91854">&quot;Time is of the essence here, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but only a fool would rush into Undermountain unprepared. That&apos;s why I called you all here together.&quot;</string>
<string name="91855">&quot;As many of you know, this inn is built around one of the entrances to Undermountain: a magical well that descends thousands of feet down into the very depths of that ever-changing labyrinth.&quot;</string>
<string name="91856">&quot;Now, I don&apos;t intend to send anyone into Undermountain unprepared. That would be suicide. I&apos;ll offer you what advice and equipment I can. In fact, I think it might be a good idea if --&quot;</string>
<string name="91857">&quot;Wait! What&apos;s that noise, Father?&quot;</string>
<string name="91858">&quot;Eh? It&apos;s coming from the well room.&quot; Durnan listens intently for a moment... before his eyes go wide with the realization of what is about to happen...</string>
<string name="91859">&quot;Anyone willing to risk the dangers of Undermountain is welcome. Waterdeep needs all the help it can get. Whether you all work together or alone is up to you, I suppose.&quot;</string>
<string name="91860">&quot;It is odd that Halaster has aligned himself with the dark elves. He&apos;s never been too fond of them. But the drow are attacking through Undermountain, and that means Halaster must be involved.&quot;</string>
<string name="91861">&quot;It&apos;s possible something happened to take Halaster out of the picture, I guess. But I find that hard to believe. He&apos;s a wizard of incalculable power; you don&apos;t just get rid of someone that powerful.&quot;</string>
<string name="91862">&quot;The Lords of Waterdeep have their hands full protecting the city. I have experience with Undermountain, so I have been placed in charge of organizing this venture.&quot;</string>
<string name="91863">&quot;Tomi&apos;s willin&apos; to help. Just so long as that 100,000 gold piece reward stays on the table.&quot;</string>
<string name="91864">&quot;The Lords of Waterdeep have offered 100,000 gold pieces to anyone who can end these attacks. That should be more than enough gold to tempt any &lt;man/woman&gt;, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="91865">&quot;I know that. None of you have agreed to anything. But coming here shows that you&apos;re interested in at least listening to my offer.&quot;</string>
<string name="91866">&quot;That 100,000 gold piece reward the city is offering doesn&apos;t hurt interest none, either!&quot;</string>
<string name="91867">&quot;Not all of us are here because of the gold, Durnan. Some of us truly want to help. Please, tell us what must be done.&quot;</string>
<string name="91868">This man is obviously a veteran warrior, and he looks at you with a distracted air. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, &lt;sir/madam&gt;... we can&apos;t start until everyone&apos;s in the common room.&quot;</string>
<string name="91869">Looking around, scowling, Durnan&apos;s eyes suddenly turn to you and harden. &quot;If I didn&apos;t know better, I&apos;d have to wonder which side you&apos;re on, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You watch who you hurt, you hear me?&quot;</string>
<string name="91870">&quot;I really should thank you for your help, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I doubt me or my kin would have survived that attack, had you not been here.&quot;</string>
<string name="91871">He sighs, staring towards the large well that forms the inn&apos;s famous entrance into Undermountain. &quot;It seems obvious now that whatever protections I had up to prevent this no longer work. Blasted magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="91872">&quot;Please... go back upstairs and make sure there are no more enemies lurking. Inform Tamsil that she must tell the city guard about the attack at once.&quot;</string>
<string name="91873">&quot;The Lords will want to know about this. I will stay down here with these other four and secure the well for the moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="91874">&quot;Thank you. I&apos;ll begin checking the well... don&apos;t be gone long, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I need you now more than ever.&quot;</string>
<string name="91875">Durnan scowls deeply. &quot;Of course I suspected this could happen! I sealed the well and posted guards down here, but it wasn&apos;t enough, was it?&quot;</string>
<string name="91876">&quot;Please, just go and tell Tamsil as I asked. There&apos;s nothing for you to do down here until I check the well, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="91877">&quot;Not just yet. It&apos;s too dangerous until I check the well and get some more men down here. Don&apos;t worry... I&apos;ll unseal the well for you soon enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="91878">Durnan scowls deeply. &quot;Argue with me later, &lt;man/woman&gt;, if you feel you must. Until I check the well and get some more men, there&apos;s nothing for you to do down here anyway. So go.&quot;</string>
<string name="91879">&quot;Is everyone all right? Where is &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;? Get &lt;CUSTOM1003&gt; down here right away!&quot;</string>
<string name="91880">The man is obviously furious, though his rage does not seem directed at you. &quot;Those fools! Damn them! Where is &lt;CUSTOM1001&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="91881">Durnan wipes the dust off his clothing brusquely, having just recovered from the effects of the beholder&apos;s ray. His expression is a clear mix of helpless frustration and rage.</string>
<string name="91882">&quot;I don&apos;t want you rushing off in a blind rage like those others, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You have to be smart about this: you&apos;ll need to be properly prepared before you go into Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="91883">&quot;You&apos;re the only one we can turn to now, &lt;FirstName&gt;. None of the other adventurers here can measure up to you... not even close. You&apos;re Waterdeep&apos;s last hope.&quot;</string>
<string name="91884">&quot;I won&apos;t lie to you: it won&apos;t be easy. But the key is to go in prepared. Talk to White Thesta; she has some items that will help you out. And you&apos;ll need all the help you can get.&quot;</string>
<string name="91885">Durnan scowls. &quot;There&apos;s the reward money, of course. But I thought you&apos;d want to get even with whoever was behind that thief in your room. You want to get your equipment back, right?&quot; </string>
<string name="91886">&quot;I&apos;m guessing that thief was just the beginning, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s obvious you&apos;re a target... that&apos;s the price of being a living legend. They stole your equipment to weaken you, but this isn&apos;t over.&quot;</string>
<string name="91887">&quot;Whoever&apos;s behind the attacks knows you&apos;re Waterdeep&apos;s only real hope. Next time they&apos;ll send an assassin. And they&apos;ll keep sending them until they finally kill you. Unless *you* stop them.&quot;</string>
<string name="91888">&quot;The four that chased after the beholder will have to survive as best they can. Maybe you can meet up with them later, but I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if all that&apos;s left of them are smoking corpses.&quot;</string>
<string name="91889">&quot;And after the attack on the inn here, I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s anyone who&apos;d be willing to help you. Well, except for that kobold bard Deekin. He&apos;d probably go with you... if you can stand him.&quot;</string>
<string name="91890">&quot;That&apos;s up to you, of course. Still, it would be a good idea to have someone by your side. Even an annoying little guy like that kobold bard could come in handy.&quot;</string>
<string name="91891">The innkeeper gives you a strange look, trying to determine if you&apos;re serious. &quot;Really? You like him? No accounting for taste, I guess. Maybe he grows on you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91892">&quot;If I honestly thought it would help, I&apos;d go with you. But my adventuring days are long behind me. Besides, I&apos;ve a family now.&quot;</string>
<string name="91893">&quot;Undermountain took what luck I had long ago, and I barely escaped. Going back would be foolish. So now I&apos;m doing my part, and I&apos;m just asking you to do yours. Is that not enough?&quot;</string>
<string name="91894">Durnan nods, relieved. &quot;I am glad to hear that. I truly wish I did not have to place all our hopes on your shoulders... but it appears we have little choice.&quot;</string>
<string name="91895">&quot;The well will lead you down into Undermountain. Once you&apos;ve talked to White Thesta and stocked up on equipment, I can help you up and down. I suspect you have many questions first, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="91896">&quot;You&apos;d be smart to stock up on equipment before you go down there, &lt;FirstName&gt;. There&apos;s a couple stores out in the city still up and running. Just tell Grayban I said it was okay for you to leave the inn.&quot;

</string>
<string name="91897">&quot;And make sure you speak to White Thesta. Her inventory of healing magic comes in handy in Undermountain. She&apos;s even got magic to raise the dead, if you need it. Of course by then it&apos;s usually too late.&quot;</string>
<string name="91898">&quot;I&apos;ll be here if you need me. I&apos;ve got to make sure we get some more guards set up around this well to prevent another attack.&quot;</string>
<string name="91899">&quot;Just speak to me again when you&apos;re ready to enter Undermountain and I&apos;ll lower you down the well myself. Good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We&apos;re all counting on you, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="91900">&quot;Of course. What would you like to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="91901">&quot;All right. Anything else you&apos;d like to discuss?&quot;</string>
<string name="91902">&quot;A temple? No, not one you can get to with the streets blocked off. Go talk to White Thesta if you need healing or any other temple services. I&apos;m sure she can help you out.&quot;</string>
<string name="91903">&quot;There are creatures of various intelligence that you&apos;ll encounter... some smart enough that they might have some idea of what&apos;s going on, even if you have to question them at sword-point.&quot;</string>
<string name="91904">&quot;But the real goal is to find Halaster himself. He&apos;s the key to Undermountain, always has been and always will be. Until you find the mad mage we won&apos;t really know what we&apos;re up against.&quot;</string>
<string name="91905">&quot;If you do find him be very, very careful. Halaster&apos;s legendary power is only matched by his rampant insanity. The mind of a madman and the power of an archmage are a dangerous combination.&quot;</string>
<string name="91906">&quot;The attacks on Waterdeep? I know more than most, I suppose. What do you want to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="91907">Durnan thinks about this for a long moment, his brow furrowed. &quot;I don&apos;t know, to tell the truth. Their attack isn&apos;t a co-ordinated one. So far it&apos;s only been random raiding parties.&quot;</string>
<string name="91908">&quot;It could be that they&apos;re simply sowing chaos and fear for the moment. If so, they&apos;re very successful at it. But I think they&apos;re building up to something.&quot;</string>
<string name="91909">&quot;These raiding parties are probably just the advance forces of an enormous army. Thousands and thousands of drow could be marshalling in the depths of Undermountain, preparing for a mass invasion.&quot;</string>
<string name="91910">&quot;Our only saving grace might be Undermountain itself. It won&apos;t be easy to march an entire army through it&apos;s narrow, twisting halls. Of course, we won&apos;t really know anything until you find Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="91911">&quot;Easier said than done. There are numerous entrances we don&apos;t know about and, as you can see, the entrances are more than just holes in the ground. There&apos;s powerful magic involved here; Halaster&apos;s magic.&quot;</string>
<string name="91912">&quot;Not to mention that our attackers seem to teleport in and out of Undermountain at will. Halaster never used to allow that to happen. I didn&apos;t even know if it was possible.&quot;</string>
<string name="91913">Durnan scowls deeply. &quot;Once you enter Undermountain, any kind of teleportation doesn&apos;t work. That&apos;s the way Halaster designed it.&quot;</string>
<string name="91914">&quot;Even spells that take you to the planes... even the most powerful traveling spells... none of them work. That&apos;s the way it&apos;s always been.&quot;</string>
<string name="91915">&quot;Only Halaster&apos;s own devices have ever allowed someone to teleport about Undermountain... and even then, never out of it. If that&apos;s changed... well, it would be very bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="91916">&quot;Three weeks, now. The first battles were the worst, as they took the city completely by surprise. The Lords have organized our forces since then.&quot;</string>
<string name="91917">&quot;There&apos;s simply no way for us to strike back, however. You can lose an entire army in Undermountain easily. The same should be said for our opponents, however, so why isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="91918">&quot;We can only shut down the city for so long before our problems mount. The Lords estimate another two weeks, maybe, before drastic measures will be required.&quot;</string>
<string name="91919">&quot;Collapsing the mountain. If we can. But that&apos;s a last resort: half of Waterdeep would be destroyed along with it. And that&apos;s assuming Halaster doesn&apos;t have some kind of spell protecting Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="91920">&quot;No, though it would be fair to say that they&apos;re the ones in charge of these raiding parties. They almost always seem to be leading the attacks.&quot;</string>
<string name="91921">&quot;If they are behind all this, however, how is it that they are able to bring their army through Undermountain unscathed? That is something Halaster has never allowed before. Why now?&quot;</string>
<string name="91922">&quot;I suppose I&apos;m as much an authority on that topic as one can be... short of Halaster himself, of course. Ask away and I&apos;ll do my best to help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91923">&quot;None that would do you any good. The layout of Undermountain... changes every now and again.&quot;</string>
<string name="91924">&quot;Sometimes the rooms are the same but they aren&apos;t where they once were. Sometimes the traps within them have changed completely.&quot;</string>
<string name="91925">&quot;I imagine it&apos;s all part of Halaster&apos;s mad scheme to keep intruders out. If you&apos;re lucky, the layout won&apos;t change while you&apos;re within. If not... well... you&apos;ll have to make do.&quot;</string>
<string name="91926">&quot;Well, should you return to the spot that the well ends at, I can certainly haul you back up. It&apos;s a long way down, but we&apos;ve rigged up a system to get adventurers like you in and out.&quot;</string>
<string name="91927">&quot;Aside from that, getting out of Undermountain can be much harder than getting in. You can&apos;t teleport about in there, you understand... or at least you never could before.&quot;</string>
<string name="91928">&quot;Aye. Any magic that took you from one place to another... even if you traveled via the planes... was completely forbidden by Halaster&apos;s magics.&quot;</string>
<string name="91929">&quot;Only his own devices - magical rings and strange pads that would take you from one part of the dungeon to the other - worked inside that madman&apos;s dungeon.&quot;</string>
<string name="91930">&quot;Well, then, if it works consider yourself lucky. Either its magic is more powerful than Halaster&apos;s or the protections are truly gone. Either way, you&apos;ve got an advantage no one else has ever had.&quot;</string>
<string name="91931">&quot;Now that&apos;s not an easy question to answer. Remember, the designer was completely insane. Even the creatures that take up the many lairs Halaster has provided change almost constantly.&quot;</string>
<string name="91932">&quot;Some have been brought to Undermountain willingly... some by force. Still others are trapped within, wandering about until they are killed. I suspect Halaster gets some mad enjoyment from this.&quot;</string>
<string name="91933">&quot;One thing I do know, however... while you can find every creature from the kobold to the dragon in Undermountain, things get more dangerous the deeper you go.&quot;</string>
<string name="91934">&quot;Ah. Well, now, let&apos;s see... Halaster was a powerful mage who lived in this area before Waterdeep was even established. His laboratories and such were inside the mountain here.&quot;</string>
<string name="91935">&quot;Some people say he grew mad and paranoid as the years passed and burrowed his treasures deeper and deeper into the mountain, placing traps and monsters in the way of intruders.&quot;</string>
<string name="91936">&quot;By the time the city appeared, the mad wizard ruled over a deadly labyrinth that snakes all the way down to the Underdark itself.&quot;</string>
<string name="91937">&quot;I expect Undermountain is something you have to see for yourself to truly understand. Anything else you want to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="91938">&quot;That&apos;s a bit like calling the Underdark a cave with a few monsters in it. Undermountain is as dark, twisted and deadly as its creator.&quot; </string>
<string name="91939">&quot;Halaster has spent centuries entombed in there, his madness driving him to create a bizarre, ever-changing realm that sane minds can hardly comprehend.&quot;</string>
<string name="91940">&quot;Elminster called it the largest graveyard of heroes anywhere. That&apos;s as good a description as any. Let your guard down in Undermountain for a single second, and you will soon be very dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="91941">&quot;Aside from the odd incident, no. Halaster was content to leave Waterdeep in peace; the only real danger that Undermountain posed was to those who chose to venture into its depths.&quot;</string>
<string name="91942">&quot;Obviously things have changed quite drastically. I don&apos;t know why the drow and other Underdark creatures are able to pass through Undermountain now, but you have to find out.&quot;</string>
<string name="91943">&quot;They say if you go down deep enough you&apos;ll leave Undermountain entirely and you&apos;ll end up in the underground realms of the drow, though I don&apos;t know anyone who&apos;s ever gone that deep and come out alive.&quot;</string>
<string name="91944">&quot;We think the raiders are originating in the Underdark and coming up through Undermountain to attack the city. In the past, however, they&apos;ve been no more safe in Halaster&apos;s realm than anyone else.&quot;</string>
<string name="91945">&quot;So why is it that they can pass through Undermountain now? It&apos;s a question that needs answering.&quot;</string>
<string name="91946">&quot;Hmm. Most of the stores in the district are closed, seeing as there&apos;s very little traffic coming through with the curfew.&quot;</string>
<string name="91947">&quot;Argali&apos;s the type who would be stubborn enough to remain open, regardless. You&apos;ll find her shop just to the south when you go outside.&quot;</string>
<string name="91948">&quot;And you could probably convince Sobray to open up for you, as well. He sells wizardly goods across the street.&quot;</string>
<string name="91949">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Eh... you may be broke, but you&apos;ve all the equipment you need, I&apos;m sure. Any gold I could give you certainly wouldn&apos;t be much help with that.&quot;</string>
<string name="91950">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Broke, are you? Well, I suppose some gold to get you some equipment is only reasonable. Here&apos;s 500 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="91951">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You&apos;re an experienced adventurer, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I&apos;m sure whatever I could offer you personally is a pittance next to what you already have.&quot;</string>
<string name="91952">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I suppose it&apos;s only fair that you get something up front for what we&apos;re asking of you. Here you go... 500 gold. That&apos;s all I have on hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="91953">&quot;That should tide you over for the moment, I hope. Is there any other help I can provide, supply-wise?&quot;</string>
<string name="91954">&quot;Keeping my inn safe, naturally. Overseeing the guards watching this well, trying to round up more adventurers in the city... though I have my doubts on that point.&quot;</string>
<string name="91955">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, however... I won&apos;t go too far. I&apos;ll be here to bring you back up the well when you need me to.&quot;</string>
<string name="91956">Durnan raises a quizzical eyebrow. &quot;A dream? What sort of dream?&quot;</string>
<string name="91957">&quot;As you wish. Is there something else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="91958">He listens as you describe the dream and the drow matron, intensely interested. When you finish, he scratches his beard thoughtfully. &quot;Aye... interesting.&quot;</string>
<string name="91959">&quot;I&apos;ve never been one to put much stock in prophetic dreams, but I doubt you would be telling me this if you thought it nothing more than your imagination.&quot;</string>
<string name="91960">&quot;I&apos;ve seen enough to know that having a powerful ally in your corner is something to be grateful for... usually. If someone sent you that dream, it might be a good idea to find out who.&quot;</string>
<string name="91961">&quot;Aye, I can only imagine. Still... if someone were to send me beneficial dreams, I can&apos;t say that I would ignore it just out of fear.&quot;</string>
<string name="91962">&quot;At this point, I wouldn&apos;t turn away an ally... even an unknown one. In Undermountain, you&apos;ll need all the allies you can find.&quot;</string>
<string name="91963">&quot;No? I can&apos;t claim to know much about these things, but it seems to me that if someone powerful were willing to help me I wouldn&apos;t write it off so simply.&quot;</string>
<string name="91964">&quot;Well, the dream did save your life. You could chalk it up to luck, but it sounds to me like someone - or something - is interested in your well being.&quot;</string>
<string name="91965">&quot;Why not? You&apos;re a &lt;man/woman&gt; of religious conviction, aren&apos;t you? Divine intervention wouldn&apos;t be such a hard thing to believe, would it? At least you know someone&apos;s watching out for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91966">Durnan nods, relieved, though he still looks at you apprehensively. &quot;I can&apos;t help but think I&apos;m making a deal with a devil, here, considering your reputation.&quot;</string>
<string name="91967">&quot;To rely on you so heavily for Waterdeep&apos;s future...&quot; he shrugs, sighing. &quot;But I have no choice. I can only hope for the best and wish you well.&quot;</string>
<string name="91968">He glares at you with disgust. &quot;Why, thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. That&apos;s *exactly* what I needed to hear, how I&apos;m responsible for all this.&quot;</string>
<string name="91969">&quot;An eye tyrant, it&apos;s called. A beholder, unleashing more magic out of each of its eyes than any wizard can even dream up. And those fools have chased after it into Undermountain!&quot;</string>
<string name="91970">He spits in disgust. &quot;They&apos;re likely to get themselves killed, running off like that. I wanted an organized foray into Undermountain, not this mess!&quot;</string>
<string name="91971">He considers your words for a moment, nodding. &quot;The drow thief in your room, now this attack. Seems like our enemy has a plan: the others probably ran right into a trap or ambush.&quot;</string>
<string name="91972">&quot;Okay, you have my permission to enter the well. There is a lever that should lower the shield doors for you. Good luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="91973">&quot;You better go speak to White Thesta first, &lt;FullName&gt;. She&apos;s got something she wanted to give you. Come back to me after you&apos;ve talked to her and we&apos;ll get you into the well.&quot;</string>
<string name="91974">&quot;The Valsharess... I&apos;m no expert on the drow, but if I remember right doesn&apos;t that mean &apos;Empress&apos; in their language? She sounds like another Matron Mother with dreams of grandeur.&quot;</string>
<string name="91975">&quot;Even so, I would have thought someone powerful enough to capture Halaster would have earned a reputation even here on the surface. This Valsharess seemed to rise up out of nowhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="91976">&quot;Nobody else could have survived Undermountain to bring us this information, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We still need to stop the drow, but I think you deserve a reward for all you&apos;ve done for us already.&quot;</string>
<string name="91977">&quot;The full reward of 100,000 gold pieces can only be given out once the threat of the Valsharess is defeated, but this small sum is a token of Waterdeep&apos;s appreciation.&quot;</string>
<string name="91978">&quot;Of course, the city will not truly be safe until the drow are defeated or Undermountain is once again sealed against them. There is no one else I can turn to for help in this, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot; </string>
<string name="91979">&quot;When you&apos;re as powerful as you are, everybody wants your help. That&apos;s the burden of being a hero. But don&apos;t forget: your fate is bound up in all this as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="91980">&quot;The Valsharess must have been the one who sent that drow thief into your room. She knows about you, she&apos;s targeted you. She&apos;s not just going to forget about you after all this.&quot;</string>
<string name="91981">&quot;The Valsharess is using Undermountain to attack the city. The best way to stop her is to take control of Undermountain away from her. And the person who can best do that is Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="91982">Durnan shrugs. &quot;Once again, the mad mage is the key, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Undermountain is his. If you can find him and free him, he&apos;ll put things back to the way they were. At least, I hope he will.&quot;</string>
<string name="91983">&quot;You have a truly noble spirit, &lt;FirstName&gt;. On behalf of the entire city, I thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="91984">Durnan&apos;s brow furrows as he tries to make sense of this latest information. &quot;I find that hard to believe, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Halaster is one of the most powerful wizards in all of Faerun.&quot;</string>
<string name="91985">&quot;If he has been captured, that might explain how those dark elves have been able to come up through Undermountain to attack the city. But the drow have never had the power to challenge him before.&quot;</string>
<string name="91986">&quot;I&apos;m not saying I don&apos;t believe you, &lt;FirstName&gt;... but if this information is accurate, it raises more questions than it answers. Questions that can only be answered by finding Halaster himself.&quot;</string>
<string name="91987">&quot;Who&apos;s in charge of these drow? How did they manage to capture Halaster? And why are they attacking Waterdeep? You need to find out more, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="91988">Durnan&apos;s face turns into a scowl. &quot;I should have expected something like this. It seems that the tougher times get, the more expensive heroes become.&quot;</string>
<string name="91989">&quot;Or should I just call you what you really are - a mercenary! People are starving, the city is under assault but all you care about is your gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="91990">Durnan nods, though he is obviously surprised by your information. &quot;So the mad mage has vanished, has he? But where has he gone? And why?&quot;</string>
<string name="91991">&quot;I don&apos;t like this, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;ve got a bad feeling about this. Halaster may be up to something. This is good to know, but you need to find out more.&quot;</string>
<string name="91992">&quot;Good. Let me know if you find anything more out. Now, is there anything else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="91993">Durnan sighs and shakes his head. &quot;I had hoped you were doing this because you felt some concern or compassion for Waterdeep and her people. Are you really only in this for the gold?&quot;</string>
<string name="91994">&quot;The city is in a desperate state right now; food and supplies are expensive. Any reward I give you will only take away from all those people in the city who are truly in need.&quot; </string>
<string name="91995">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;So you&apos;re just going to abandon us, then? If that&apos;s the kind of &lt;man/woman&gt; you are, then maybe we shouldn&apos;t be relying on you to help us in the first place.&quot;</string>
<string name="91996">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Don&apos;t abandon us, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Not now. You&apos;re the only one strong enough to survive in Undermountain. We need you.&quot; Durnan rubs his temples in frustration.</string>
<string name="91997">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You&apos;ll learn I&apos;m not one to give in to threats easily, &lt;FullName&gt;. You&apos;d have better luck if you save that anger for the monsters down the well.&quot;</string>
<string name="91998">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You&apos;re... you&apos;re threatening me? I guess I should have seen this coming. Okay, &lt;FirstName&gt;, there&apos;s no need to get upset.&quot;</string>
<string name="91999">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;It&apos;s true the Lords of Waterdeep have given me the authorization to spend their gold if I think it will help. But the information you gave me isn&apos;t really that useful by itself.&quot;</string>
<string name="92000">&quot;If you actually end the threat against Waterdeep we&apos;ll gladly give you the full 100,000 gold piece reward. But until then, I think I&apos;ll just hang onto the city&apos;s money.&quot;</string>
<string name="92001">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Well, the Lords of Waterdeep have given me the authorization to distribute their funds if I think it will help. And your information could be helpful.&quot;</string>
<string name="92002">*sigh* &quot;Very well, here&apos;s a small reward. But the 100,000 gold pieces will still go to the person who actually ends this threat. Now, is there something else I can do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="92003">&quot;I&apos;m glad to hear you say that, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Now, is there anything else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="92004">&quot;I have no complaints.&quot;</string>
<string name="92005">&quot;The bed was hard as a rock, and I don&apos;t remember requesting the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="92006">&quot;Are you joking, man? I was robbed of everything I own!&quot;</string>
<string name="92007">&quot;Aside from the thief in my room, very much so.&quot;</string>
<string name="92008">&quot;The drow will pay for this! I want my stuff back!&quot;</string>
<string name="92009">&quot;But why would they steal my equipment?&quot;</string>
<string name="92010">&quot;What do you have planned?&quot;</string>
<string name="92011">&quot;Would Halaster still even be alive?&quot;</string>
<string name="92012">&quot;Enough talking, already. Let&apos;s go!&quot;</string>
<string name="92013">&quot;And how are we supposed to do that?&quot;</string>
<string name="92014">&quot;So who&apos;s all going on this mission?&quot;</string>
<string name="92015">&quot;The attackers are drow. Why do you think Halaster is involved?&quot;</string>
<string name="92016">&quot;Maybe something happened to Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="92017">&quot;Why you? Why don&apos;t the Lords of Waterdeep deal with this?&quot;</string>
<string name="92018">&quot;And what&apos;s the reward if we do?&quot;</string>
<string name="92019">&quot;I haven&apos;t agreed to anything just yet, Durnan.&quot;</string>
<string name="92020">&quot;Very well. I will be right back.&quot;</string>
<string name="92021">&quot;Are you saying you didn&apos;t anticipate this could happen?&quot;</string>
<string name="92022">&quot;I&apos;d like to go down into the well now. Maybe I can find something.&quot;</string>
<string name="92023">&quot;I&apos;m not your errand &lt;boy/girl&gt;. Go upstairs yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="92024">&quot;Do you want me to go after them?&quot;</string>
<string name="92025">&quot;And how am I supposed to survive Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="92026">&quot;And what do I get in return for this?&quot;</string>
<string name="92027">&quot;Surely there are others who can help!&quot;</string>
<string name="92028">&quot;I&apos;ll take my chances on my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="92029">&quot;Hey, I like Deekin!&quot;</string>
<string name="92030">&quot;All right. I&apos;ll do it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92031">&quot;Why don&apos;t you come with me, Durnan?&quot;</string>
<string name="92032">&quot;I&apos;ll do my best.&quot;</string>
<string name="92033">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92034">&quot;I&apos;m ready to go into Undermountain now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92035">&quot;I&apos;d like some questions answered.&quot;</string>
<string name="92036">&quot;I don&apos;t have any more questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="92037">&quot;Is there a temple in the area?&quot;</string>
<string name="92038">&quot;What should I be looking for when I&apos;m down there?&quot;</string>
<string name="92039">&quot;I&apos;d like to know more about these attacks.&quot;</string>
<string name="92040">&quot;I want to ask something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="92041">&quot;What are the attackers trying to accomplish?&quot;</string>
<string name="92042">&quot;Why aren&apos;t the entrances to Undermountain simply closed?&quot;</string>
<string name="92043">&quot;Why shouldn&apos;t it be possible?&quot;</string>
<string name="92044">&quot;How long have these attacks been going on?&quot;</string>
<string name="92045">&quot;What drastic measures?&quot;</string>
<string name="92046">&quot;Is it only the drow who have been attacking the city?&quot;</string>
<string name="92047">&quot;I&apos;d like to know more about Undermountain, itself.&quot;</string>
<string name="92048">&quot;Are there any maps of Undermountain that exist?&quot;</string>
<string name="92049">&quot;How do I get out of Undermountain once I&apos;m in?&quot;</string>
<string name="92050">&quot;You can&apos;t teleport in Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="92051">&quot;I have a relic that allows me to teleport through the planes.&quot;</string>
<string name="92052">&quot;What can I expect to face when I&apos;m down there?&quot;</string>
<string name="92053">&quot;Tell me more about Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="92054">&quot;I think I get it now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92055">&quot;So it&apos;s a dungeon full of traps, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="92056">&quot;Has Undermountain been a problem before?&quot;</string>
<string name="92057">&quot;You said it goes down to the Underdark?&quot;</string>
<string name="92058">&quot;Where can I get some supplies?&quot;</string>
<string name="92059">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;m broke. Some coin up front would be helpful.&quot;</string>
<string name="92060">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Some gold for equipment could really help out my quest.&quot;</string>
<string name="92061">&quot;What are you going to be doing while I&apos;m down there?&quot;</string>
<string name="92062">&quot;I had a dream, before the thief came...&quot;</string>
<string name="92063">&quot;Actually, never mind. It was probably nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="92064">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Tell him about the dream.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="92065">&quot;I don&apos;t care for having my head messed with.&quot;</string>
<string name="92066">&quot;I&apos;m not all that concerned about it, really.&quot;</string>
<string name="92067">&quot;You think the dream was sent by an ally?&quot;</string>
<string name="92068">&quot;Perhaps you&apos;re more out of practice at this than you thought.&quot;</string>
<string name="92069">&quot;What was that thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="92070">&quot;What now, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="92071">&quot;Hmm. Do you think that maybe this was planned?&quot;</string>
<string name="92072">&quot;I&apos;m ready to enter Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="92073">&quot;The drow are led by someone called the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="92074">&quot;A reward? That&apos;s the kind of talk I like to hear!&quot;</string>
<string name="92075">&quot;Seems like I&apos;m the only one good for anything around here.&quot;</string>
<string name="92076">&quot;Fine, I&apos;ll help you *again*.&quot;</string>
<string name="92077">&quot;I guess you have a point. What do you want me to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="92078">&quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="92079">&quot;No, Durnan, use your gold to help the people of the city.&quot;</string>
<string name="92080">&quot;I think Halaster has been captured by the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="92081">&quot;I think I deserve a reward for what I&apos;ve done so far.&quot;</string>
<string name="92082">&quot;Never mind, Durnan. Save your gold to help those in need.&quot;</string>
<string name="92083">&quot;It sounds like Halaster has disappeared.&quot;</string>
<string name="92084">&quot;I&apos;ll look into this some more.&quot;</string>
<string name="92085">&quot;So, is there some kind of reward for this information?&quot;</string>
<string name="92086">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Persuade - Bluff &lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;m not going back into Undermountain until I get some kind of reward!&quot;</string>
<string name="92087">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Persuade - Intimidate&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I came up with some info, now you better come up with some gold... if you know what&apos;s good for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92088">&lt;StartCheck&gt;Persuade&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Surely this information is worth something, Durnan.&quot;</string>
<string name="92089">&quot;Keep your reward, Durnan. Use it to help others.&quot;</string>
<string name="92090">Diddelysquat.</string>
<string name="92091">&quot;I wish I could go with you, but I suppose I&apos;m needed here. Best of luck.&quot;</string>
<string name="92092">&quot;I could do just as well as you, I&apos;ll bet. If only they&apos;d give me a chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="92093">&quot;Perhaps you really are the hero everyone says you are. Good luck, you&apos;ll need it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92094">&quot;You fought very bravely. You obviously have the skills Durnan has been waiting for. Good luck.&quot;</string>
<string name="92095">&quot;Get going. Durnan&apos;s waiting for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92096">&quot;Durnan asked for your help. You&apos;d better get moving.&quot;</string>
<string name="92097">The guard just shakes his head and motions towards the well room.</string>
<string name="92098">&quot;I don&apos;t know why Durnan called for your assistance instead of mine, but you&apos;d better get down there now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92099">&quot;Durnan has been organizing things and should be ready to explain his plan very soon.&quot;</string>
<string name="92100">This huge, one handed half orc stares at you with a grimace. &quot;Boss want speak. Him want no one leave. You stay. You listen.&quot;</string>
<string name="92101">This huge, one handed half orc stares at you with a grimace, trying to decide if he recognizes you or not. &quot;You no allowed out. There be ban on streets.&quot;</string>
<string name="92102">He nods and looks away at the other customers.</string>
<string name="92103">He frowns at you. &quot;Me no like to say. It bad story.&quot;</string>
<string name="92104">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You think you threaten me? Me no be scared of you! Now go away.&quot;</string>
<string name="92105">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You be funny &lt;man/woman&gt;! Me likes you, tough &lt;man/woman&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="92106">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;That be big lie! Me never be coward. Me just about die!&quot;</string>
<string name="92107">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You just want make fun of me, like others do. Go away. Me no want to talk to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92108">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Me have few friends. Guess me would like to have new friend.&quot;</string>
<string name="92109">&quot;Me lost all me friends when me lose me arm. We was most liked group for go into Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="92110">&quot;We go real deep and make lots of gold, which me spend real fast. Then one day we meet girl.&quot;</string>
<string name="92111">&quot;Me trying. You be patient. It no long story.&quot;</string>
<string name="92112">&quot;She pretty lady, tell us she help us find treasure if we fetch her cape. We think that good deal.&quot;</string>
<string name="92113">&quot;So we go where she tell us, but it be trap. She is vampire and she work with slaads in dungeon. Them jump us and kill mage quick.&quot;</string>
<string name="92114">&quot;Her get our cleric from behind and tear him throat out.&quot;</string>
<string name="92115">&quot;That come next. Just wait.&quot;</string>
<string name="92116">&quot;I killed many slaads, but see me friends all die one by one.&quot;</string>
<string name="92117">&quot;When sweet Orah, me thief, get caught by vampire and her back get broke, me go berserk.&quot;</string>
<string name="92118">&quot;Me not remember what happen, but slaads and vampire be gone and me arm and shield too. Me find me way out and here me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="92119">&quot;Me lost all me had. Money, arm, magic shield, friends. Life not that special now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92120">&quot;Durnan feel sorry for Grayban. Him hire me as guard. He is good boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="92121">&quot;Me better keep working. You should go now. You want to go out door?&quot;</string>
<string name="92122">&quot;You be good listener. Maybe we be friends.&quot;</string>
<string name="92123">His eyes narrow in thought. &quot;Me not remember boss say you go out.&quot;</string>
<string name="92124">He scratches his head. &quot;You must want go out bad. Right, me let you use door for 10 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="92125">&quot;Then it not worth me time to let you out. You come back when you gots gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="92126">&quot;You no tell boss me lets you out. Me no want to get in trouble.&quot;</string>
<string name="92127">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Oh, you no tell boss that. Him trust me and be nice to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92128">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt; His face darkens with anger. &quot;Me no forget! You no try to fool Grayban!&quot;</string>
<string name="92129">&quot;Now go away. Me no let you leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="92130">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; Oh, thank you. You be nice &lt;man/woman&gt;. Me do sometimes forget stuff.</string>
<string name="92131">&quot;You be careful if you go out. There be bad stuff out there. Many streets closed, shops closed, and sometimes looters.&quot;</string>
<string name="92132">He unlocks the door, then slips the key back inside his shirt. He gives you a big, toothy grin and waves goodbye.</string>
<string name="92133">The half-orc&apos;s mind slowly churns over this information, then his face brightens in recognition. &quot;&lt;FullName&gt;! Yeah, boss say it okay for you to go out. Me remember now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92134">The guard wrinkles his forehead in concentration as he recognizes you. &quot;You back. What you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="92135">&quot;That be me shield! Oh, you good, good &lt;man/woman&gt;! You be best person in world!&quot;</string>
<string name="92136">&quot;If only me had gold for me get arm fixed. But me doesn&apos;t. Me only has 50 gold, which means maybe in couple of years.&quot;</string>
<string name="92137">&quot;Unless you takes me 50 gold for find shield. That be all me gots left, but you deserving it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92138">&quot;Oh, you be the kindest &lt;man/woman&gt; me ever meet.&quot;</string>
<string name="92139">&quot;Maybe someday me can pay you back. You be careful. There be dangerous stuff in Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="92140">&quot;Thank you. That be good.&quot;</string>
<string name="92141">&quot;Now just one more year. One more year.&quot;</string>
<string name="92142">&quot;Okay. Me understand. Maybe me get arm back someday.&quot;</string>
<string name="92143">This huge, one handed half orc stares at you with a grimace. &quot;Boss call you for to go down and help him. You go now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92144">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="92145">&quot;What happened to your arm?&quot;</string>
<string name="92146">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Tell me what happened or maybe you&apos;ll lose that other arm.&quot;</string>
<string name="92147">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I heard some customers say you lost it because you&apos;re a coward.&quot;</string>
<string name="92148">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;d like to be your friend. Please tell me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92149">&quot;I don&apos;t need your life story. Hurry up.&quot;</string>
<string name="92150">&quot;What girl is that?&quot;</string>
<string name="92151">&quot;That still doesn&apos;t tell me how you lost your arm.&quot;</string>
<string name="92152">&quot;Go on.&quot;</string>
<string name="92153">&quot;At least you survived.&quot;</string>
<string name="92154">&quot;So how did you end up working here?&quot;</string>
<string name="92155">&quot;I thought I wasn&apos;t allowed.&quot; </string>
<string name="92156">&quot;Yes, please.&quot;</string>
<string name="92157">&quot;I&apos;m allowed to leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="92158">&quot;I will pay you to let me out.&quot;</string>
<string name="92159">&quot;No way.&quot;</string>
<string name="92160">&quot;It is a deal.&quot;</string>
<string name="92161">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You let me out, or I&apos;ll tell Durnan you forgot his instructions.&quot;</string>
<string name="92162">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You must have forgotten. Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t tell anybody you forgot.&quot;</string>
<string name="92163">&quot;I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;. Durnan said you&apos;d let me out.&quot;</string>
<string name="92164">I found this shield with your name on it.</string>
<string name="92165">&quot;Here, take this 50 gold and get your arm back.&quot;</string>
<string name="92166">&quot;No, you keep your gold. You need it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92167">&quot;I&apos;ll be taking the gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="92168">The halfling pauses to catch her breath. &quot;Every one of these dishes needs more spice. I am not sure what that cook is thinking.&quot;</string>
<string name="92169">The halfling looks serious for a moment. &quot;I fear for Waterdeep. It is one of the few cities in Faerun that welcomes halflings.&quot;</string>
<string name="92170">The halfling giggles. &quot;We call the cook big bottom, but not to his face.&quot;</string>
<string name="92171">The halfling glares at the cook. &quot;He is a misery to work for.&quot;</string>
<string name="92172">The halfling assistant flashes you a quick grin behind the cook&apos;s back. &quot;When the biscuits are finished we will help you snitch one, if you want.&quot;</string>
<string name="92173">&quot;We&apos;re under attack! They must have come up from the Well in the basement!&quot;</string>
<string name="92174">The halfling pauses to catch her breath. &quot;The other assistant keeps adding too many spices to the food.&quot;</string>
<string name="92175">The halfling looks serious for a moment. &quot;I fear for Waterdeep. It is one of the few cities in Faerun that welcomes halflings.&quot;</string>
<string name="92176">The halfling sighs. &quot;I wish I could live up to the cook&apos;s exacting standards.&quot;</string>
<string name="92177">The halfling glares at the other halfling. &quot;She does not appreciate the cook&apos;s genius!&quot;</string>
<string name="92178">The halfling assistant smiles at the cook. &quot;He is an artist with food. I have learned so much from him.&quot;</string>
<string name="92179">&quot;We&apos;re under attack! They must have come up from the Well in the basement!&quot;</string>
<string name="92180">&quot;Be careful... there could be an enemy around every corner!&quot;</string>
<string name="92181">&quot;Greetings citizen. There are enemies about, so you should probably head back indoors.&quot;</string>
<string name="92182">He shrugs. &quot;You have been warned. Use caution, citizen.&quot;</string>
<string name="92183">&quot;&lt;FullName&gt;? I&apos;m sorry, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I didn&apos;t recognize you. Uh... carry on then, I guess.&quot;</string>
<string name="92184">&quot;I can take care of myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="92185">&quot;Don&apos;t you recognize me? I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="92186">This elven woman has a pleasant aura about her as she nods her head to you respectfully. You notice a silver amulet around her neck, marking her as a cleric of the elven goddess, Sehanine Moonbow.</string>
<string name="92187">&quot;The innkeeper has refused to acknowledge the rest of us until &lt;FullName&gt; makes an appearance. I, for one, did not journey so far to render aid only to be ignored.&quot;</string>
<string name="92188">&quot;There is no need to be unkind, Daelan. This &lt;man/woman&gt; deserves our respect. &lt;He/She&gt; is an adventurer of worth, and the fact that &lt;he/she&gt; is here is a boon to our cause.&quot;</string>
<string name="92189">&quot;Huh. There ain&apos;t no cause that I know about that&apos;s gonna pay me a hundred thousand gold like this one will, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="92190">&quot;I agree with Tomi. Gold speaks louder than any cause I&apos;ve ever heard of.&quot;</string>
<string name="92191">&quot;That is an odd thing for a bard to say, Sharwyn. Have you no sense of the epic? I wonder if our friend here would agree with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92192">&quot;Then why do we not ask &lt;him/her&gt;? What of it, &lt;FirstName&gt;? What has brought you to Waterdeep in its hour of need?&quot;</string>
<string name="92193">The half-orc relaxes a bit and nods, pleased. &quot;I am pleased to hear that. The city of Neverwinter was once saved by one who chose to do the right thing, as you say.&quot;</string>
<string name="92194">The elven cleric regards you for another moment. &quot;I have heard of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I must admit I know little in the way of details. Perhaps we will get a chance to adventure together.&quot;</string>
<string name="92195">She smiles ruefully. &quot;Ah. Then I imagine you wouldn&apos;t want us getting in your way. I quite understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="92196">The elven cleric regards you for another moment. &quot;I am told you are a &lt;man/woman&gt; of faith, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It will be a pleasure to adventure together and get to know you better.&quot;</string>
<string name="92197">&quot;Well, perhaps once you speak to Durnan we shall have that chance. I look forward to it, dear.&quot;</string>
<string name="92198">&quot;Aye. I wish you well.&quot;</string>
<string name="92199">&quot;I believe Master Durnan is waiting for you in the other room, dear. Good luck!&quot;</string>
<string name="92200">&quot;Of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="92201">&quot;I believe he is in the next room. He should not be hard to locate.&quot;</string>
<string name="92202">&quot;Not much, no. I am hoping that when Durnan begins he will be able to enlighten all of us as to what exactly is occurring.&quot;</string>
<string name="92203">&quot;As I understand it, the forces of Waterdeep have been besieged from within for several weeks, now. Creatures from Undermountain have been appearing everywhere and wreaking havoc.&quot;</string>
<string name="92204">&quot;The city itself has been brought to a stand-still. No-one is allowed to move about freely... the very streets are blockaded. They cannot go on much longer like this.&quot;</string>
<string name="92205">&quot;They are... not friends, exactly. At first I voyaged with them out of necessity because our goals coincided even if our hearts did not.&quot;</string>
<string name="92206">&quot;They have proven themselves to be champions of good regardless of their intentions, however, so I have remained with them. It is a satisfactory arrangement.&quot;</string>
<string name="92207">&quot;That is a... tempting offer, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. But I would be leaving my companions without proper healing, and on short notice. I cannot.&quot;</string>
<string name="92208">&quot;But thank you anyhow. I still hope that we will be able to assist each other once we are in Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="92209">&quot;No, thank you, dear. I suspect you and I would have our differences. And besides that, I cannot abandon my companions on such short notice.&quot;</string>
<string name="92210">&quot;Oh,&quot; she blushes slightly. &quot;I am no-one important, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. My name is Linu La&apos;neral, servant to Sehanine Moonbow. Pleased to make your acquaintance.&quot;</string>
<string name="92211">&quot;My companions are good people, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, despite how they might often talk. Unlike myself, I suspect they have mostly come for the reward.&quot;</string>
<string name="92212">&quot;Would that the Lords of Waterdeep could merely make a call for champions of honor and stout heart to come to their aid at this dire hour and it would be so.&quot;</string>
<string name="92213">&quot;But no, of course they must offer coin if they are to attract adventurers. One hundred thousand gold pieces to anyone who can put a stop to the menace.&quot;</string>
<string name="92214">&quot;I must admit, even I am tempted to think what good could be done with so much gold. I must steel myself only to think about the threat that lies ahead in Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="92215">&quot;Very little, dear. They say a mad wizard has created a massive dungeon underneath Waterdeep&apos;s mountain, filled with evil I cannot even describe. How they have co-existed together until now I have no clue.&quot;</string>
<string name="92216">&quot;Perhaps not, but that&apos;s no reason for us not to get along. I have always enjoyed a healthy debate between believers.&quot;</string>
<string name="92217">Her smile falters and she looks disappointed. &quot;So it appears.&quot;</string>
<string name="92218">She nods her head. &quot;I cannot argue with that. If you do require assistance in the dungeon, however, I hope we are in a position to give it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92219">The assorted group looks at you uncomfortably for a moment. The half-orc stares at you openly before speaking. &quot;It appears that the tales of heroes such as yourself do not always tell the truth. So be it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92220">The half-orc looks away and snorts with obvious derision, but does not push the topic further.</string>
<string name="92221">The half-orc grins suddenly, showing a full set of sharp teeth. &quot;I read a book about you, once. It never said that you were humble.&quot;</string>
<string name="92222">The half-orc nods at you, looking relieved. &quot;The innkeeper is right to wait for you, then. You are not only a hero, you also have a valiant heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="92223">The half-orc looks away, sighing with resignation. &quot;A mercenary, then. Looks like there will be less money for you, Tomi.&quot;</string>
<string name="92224">&quot;Bloody hell.&quot;</string>
<string name="92225">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="92226">&quot;Durnan called for heroes. I&apos;m here to do the right thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="92227">&quot;I have my own companions to worry about.&quot;</string>
<string name="92228">&quot;I&apos;d like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="92229">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92230">&quot;Can I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="92231">&quot;Where do I find Durnan?&quot;</string>
<string name="92232">&quot;Do you know anything about what&apos;s going on in Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="92233">&quot;Tell me about these friends of yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="92234">&quot;Why don&apos;t you join me instead?&quot;</string>
<string name="92235">&quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="92236">&quot;What is this reward again?&quot;</string>
<string name="92237">&quot;What do you know about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="92238">&quot;I don&apos;t think our faiths have much in common.&quot;</string>
<string name="92239">&quot;You think I want to adventure with you? That&apos;s assuming a lot.&quot;</string>
<string name="92240">&quot;I work better on my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="92241">&quot;If there&apos;s a chance to kill something, I&apos;ll always take it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92242">&quot;If it ever becomes your business, I&apos;ll let you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="92243">&quot;To be honest, I don&apos;t really know why I&apos;m here.&quot;</string>
<string name="92244">&quot;I care what happens to Waterdeep, even if you don&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="92245">&quot;I&apos;m always looking for adventure, if the reward is right.&quot;</string>
<string name="92246">The woman smiles at you politely and nods. She appears matronly, but has a strength and pride to her bearing that tell of a much different history.</string>
<string name="92247">She stares at you coldly. &quot;How dreadful that my husband&apos;s call should bring such a wretch to our aid.&quot;</string>
<string name="92248">&quot;If you wish to be a savage, so be it... so long as you deal death to the enemy and not to the innocents in our tavern.&quot;</string>
<string name="92249">&quot;Now, please. I have plenty of people here who need looking after. Excuse me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92250">&quot;So what? You&apos;re here to help these poor people... not get so carried away with your bloodlust that you hurt them as much as you do our attackers.&quot;</string>
<string name="92251">&quot;Are you truly oblivious to your actions or do you simply choose to ignore the fact that you hurt innocents when we were attacked?&quot;</string>
<string name="92252">&quot;You could be careful, that&apos;s what you could do. Perhaps we should just be thankful that you will be going into Undermountain and away from us.&quot;</string>
<string name="92253">She stares at you a long moment, finally grudgingly giving you the benefit of the doubt. &quot;Very well. Though you would do well to exercise more caution in the future.&quot;</string>
<string name="92254">She stares at you for a long moment, finally relenting. &quot;The tales they tell of you say you are a good &lt;man/woman&gt;. I suppose anyone can make a mistake.&quot;</string>
<string name="92255">She nods slowly. &quot;Very well. Perhaps you can make up for your mistake by helping with healing the injured.&quot;</string>
<string name="92256">&quot;Tyr&apos;s favor to you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="92257">&quot;Any of the rooms upstairs that are vacant are yours to use, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. Treat this as you would your home, though I am sure it is a poor substitute.&quot;</string>
<string name="92258">&quot;If you wish, certainly.&quot;</string>
<string name="92259">&quot;Speak to my husband... he should have some goods to sell you. Beyond that, you might want to consider going outside.&quot;</string>
<string name="92260">&quot;With the roads blockaded, you will not be able to travel far, but there are shops about. Argali&apos;s Arms specializes in armor and weapons... she will surely not close even for all this.&quot;</string>
<string name="92261">&quot;Very little, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I met my husband long after he had made his last venture into that place, and he speaks only rarely of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92262">&quot;I should warn you, however... my husband and his companion, Mirt, were as powerful as you when they went there. They escaped only barely and the experience haunts him still.&quot;</string>
<string name="92263">&quot;I am both mother and wife, but that does not mean I have been always so. Once I was a paladin of Tyr, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, before I met good Durnan.&quot;</string>
<string name="92264">&quot;What courage I have may not be the equal of your power and experience... but I will do what I must. I can no more stand by and watch my city fall than my husband can.&quot;</string>
<string name="92265">&quot;They have been going on for several weeks now. Subterranean creatures of all sorts appearing out of nowhere to assault the guard.&quot;</string>
<string name="92266">&quot;Some areas have been hit far more worse than here. Had you not been here, however, the attack on the inn would have changed that of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="92267">&quot;My name is Mhaere, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I am Durnan&apos;s wife. I... should add my apology to his for the attack in your room. We were not careful enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="92268">Her back stiffens. &quot;Indeed. Once I could have sensed any evil that crept into our inn, but now it is all around us. Still, it is good you were unharmed.&quot;</string>
<string name="92269">&quot;My husband is a skilled warrior, and I was once a champion of Tyr. We are not helpless, yet these attacks make us feel so.&quot;</string>
<string name="92270">&quot;Still... you were unharmed, and we should be thankful for that. Your presence at this dire hour is most welcome.&quot;</string>
<string name="92271">&quot;Don&apos;t aggravate me or I just might.&quot;</string>
<string name="92272">&quot;So I got carried away during the battle. So what?&quot;</string>
<string name="92273">&quot;What do you mean? I didn&apos;t do anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="92274">&quot;I&apos;m good at killing, and that&apos;s what&apos;s important.&quot;</string>
<string name="92275">&quot;If people get in my way, there&apos;s nothing I can do.&quot;</string>
<string name="92276">&quot;It wasn&apos;t my intention to harm anyone but the enemy, my lady. I apologize.&quot;</string>
<string name="92277">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92278">&quot;Is there somewhere I can rest?&quot;</string>
<string name="92279">&quot;Can I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="92280">&quot;Where can I get some supplies?&quot;</string>
<string name="92281">&quot;Do you know anything about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="92282">&quot;Did I see you fighting during the battle here?&quot;</string>
<string name="92283">&quot;What do you know about the attacks on Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="92284">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="92285">&quot;Damn right you weren&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="92286">&quot;Don&apos;t worry about it... I&apos;m alive.&quot;</string>
<string name="92287">&quot;There&apos;s nothing you could have done.&quot;</string>
<string name="92288">A pretty, but quiet elf sips wine carefully from her glass before speaking, &quot;With all that is out of balance in this age, let my hospitality welcome and comfort you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92289">&quot;Times of stress and war do not exempt one from good manners; you might want to keep that in mind in the future.&quot;</string>
<string name="92290">&quot;Times of stress and war do not exempt one from good manners; hold tight to this lesson and you shall find peace in the midst of conflict.&quot;</string>
<string name="92291">&quot;Times of stress and war do not exempt one from good manners; a lesson I am glad to see you understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="92292">&quot;My name is Parley. I am a druid out of Vaasa. And you would be &lt;FullName&gt;, correct?&quot;</string>
<string name="92293">&quot;Then so is everyone else in this tavern. Would you try to make me feel like a fool?&quot;</string>
<string name="92294">&quot;Good day to you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="92295">&quot;I have heard a few tales about you since I came to this part of the world. I used to dream of having tales told about me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92296">&quot;It was another &lt;class&gt; such as yourself that convinced me to leave my homeland and enter this &apos;civilized&apos; world.&quot;</string>
<string name="92297">&quot;But I am sure you have no interest in hearing about my struggles. You must have enough of your own.&quot;</string>
<string name="92298">&quot;Goodbye, &lt;sir/madam&gt;. May your paths be ever changing.&quot;</string>
<string name="92299">&quot;I will do my best to give you the truth of things.&quot;</string>
<string name="92300">&quot;I do not think so. Please do not take this personally, it is just that I had promised an old friend that I would meet him here and we would work together.&quot;</string>
<string name="92301">&quot;He is late, but I am patient. I will wait for him here, rather than go rushing off into adventure without him. But thank you for your kind and generous offer.&quot;</string>
<string name="92302">&quot;They frighten me, and I think that should I remain here too long, my path can only lead to death. Perhaps you have the strength that I lack; perhaps not.&quot;</string>
<string name="92303">&quot;A good question, and one that strikes to the heart of my troubles. I was content to live in my forest and tend to nature, solitary, yet not lonely; until I met Faragati.&quot;</string>
<string name="92304">&quot;Then I shall shoulder my burden alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="92305">&quot;That is very kind. It is just such a response that is the source of my problems though. I was content to live in my forest and tend to nature, solitary, yet not lonely; until I met Faragati.&quot;</string>
<string name="92306">&quot;He was a half-elf from the city who found me meditating by a small brook. I motioned for him to join me, and he sat at my side, simply staring at me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92307">&quot;I see that patience is not your greatest strength. I will waste no more of your time then.&quot;</string>
<string name="92308">&quot;You must have thought I had some quest or job for you, but I have only a philosophical quandary, which I am sure would not interest you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92309">&quot;That is... frightening. I shall try to remember not to look at you too much.&quot;</string>
<string name="92310">&quot;Once I had finished my meditations, we spoke at length. He told me how he had left the city to see the unfamiliar wonders of the forest, and he raved about the beauty of my world.&quot;</string>
<string name="92311">&quot;After a time, I asked him about the life he had left behind. I thought he would disparage the city as an ugly, filthy place, but he did not. The city, he said, had its own unique beauty.&quot;</string>
<string name="92312">&quot;After he left, his words stayed with me. I realized I needed to emerge from my retreat and sample the world and all it had to offer, so I came here. And you know what I have found?&quot;</string>
<string name="92313">&quot;Then why did you ask me?&quot;</string>
<string name="92314">&quot;As much as I love nature, I love the bustle of the city as well. Everyone leads a life that is as important to him or her as storing nuts is to a squirrel.&quot;</string>
<string name="92315">&quot;And so I find myself in a quandary. How can I reconcile my life as a druid, to a life in the city?&quot;</string>
<string name="92316">&quot;I am not looking for an answer from you. The answer must come from within me. But thank you for your time.&quot;</string>
<string name="92317">&quot;You must have thought I had some quest or job for you, but I have only a philosophical quandary, which obviously does not interest you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92318">&quot;Not everything needs an outer reward. sometimes the reward is entirely internal. I am sorry to have wasted your time.&quot;</string>
<string name="92319">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;, it has been a great pleasure talking to you. Please allow me to give you a small gift.&quot;</string>
<string name="92320">&quot;May your travels make you wiser and your life be rich and full. For the stretch of a day, I gift you the strength of the bull. The balance favor you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="92321">&quot;Durnan asked for your help. Some of us will stay up here in case they come from outside as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="92322">&quot;Good friend, may all your tender roots find purchase, that you may grow in greatness.&quot;</string>
<string name="92323">&quot;Look inside yourself and try to find improvements. Only then will you find contentment.&quot;</string>
<string name="92324">&quot;I speak to those who show they have manners, not to children who have learned none.&quot;</string>
<string name="92325">&quot;I heard that Durnan is going to be making an announcement soon. I hope this means I will be able to head down into Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="92326">This pretty elf looks up at you with sad eyes as you approach. &quot;Are you going on into Undermountain, &lt;FirstName&gt;? If so, I wish you luck. I, however, want nothing more to do with that unnatural place.&quot;</string>
<string name="92327">&quot;As a druid I know death is part of the natural order, but I&apos;m glad that cleric raised me back to life. I wasn&apos;t ready to become part of the natural order quite yet.&quot;</string>
<string name="92328">She lets out a forlorn sigh. &quot;Perhaps my attitude is a sign that this city is changing me. Once the streets of Waterdeep are open again, I think I will return to the wilderness.&quot;</string>
<string name="92329">&quot;No thanks. Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="92330">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="92331">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92332">&quot;No. You are mistaken.&quot;</string>
<string name="92333">&quot;Yes, how did you know?&quot; </string>
<string name="92334">&quot;Yes, that is I.&quot;</string>
<string name="92335">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="92336">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="92337">&quot;Would you like to work with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="92338">&quot;What do you think of these attacks?&quot;</string>
<string name="92339">&quot;What brought you to Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="92340">&quot;True. I really do not want to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="92341">&quot;Sometimes it helps to share your troubles with someone else.&quot;</string>
<string name="92342">&quot;Hurry up and explain your problem.&quot;</string>
<string name="92343">&quot;I kill things that stare at me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92344">&quot;That would be strange.&quot;</string>
<string name="92345">&quot;I don&apos;t care.&quot;</string>
<string name="92346">&quot;You hate it.&quot; </string>
<string name="92347">&quot;You like it?&quot; </string>
<string name="92348">&quot;I have no idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="92349">&quot;That is it? I listened to all that for no reason?&quot;</string>
<string name="92350">&quot;You are welcome, I guess.&quot; </string>
<string name="92351">The beautiful, red-haired woman regards you with a slight smirk, sizing you up for a long moment before finally speaking.</string>
<string name="92352">&quot;Indeed. The way the innkeeper has been keeping everyone waiting breathlessly for the ever-famous &lt;FullName&gt;, one would wonder why the rest of us came at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="92353">&quot;There is no need to be unkind, Daelan. This &lt;man/woman&gt; deserves our respect. &lt;He/She&gt; is an adventurer of worth, and the fact that &lt;he/she&gt; is here is a boon to our cause.&quot;</string>
<string name="92354">&quot;Huh. There ain&apos;t no cause that I know about that&apos;s gonna pay me a hundred thousand gold like this one will, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="92355">&quot;I agree with Tomi. Gold speaks louder than any cause I&apos;ve ever heard of.&quot;</string>
<string name="92356">&quot;That is an odd thing for a bard to say, Sharwyn. Have you no sense of the epic? I wonder if our friend here would agree with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92357">&quot;Then why do we not ask &lt;him/her&gt;? What of it, &lt;FirstName&gt;? What has brought you to Waterdeep in its hour of need?&quot;</string>
<string name="92358">The half-orc relaxes a bit and nods, pleased. &quot;I am pleased to hear that. The city of Neverwinter was once saved by one who chose to do the right thing, as you say.&quot;</string>
<string name="92359">The human woman regards you for a moment longer, tapping her chin thoughtfully. &quot;I don&apos;t know. It might be fun to adventure with the famous &lt;FirstName&gt;. A chance to see the legend in action. What do you say to that, hmm?&quot;</string>
<string name="92360">The human woman regards you for a moment longer, tapping her chin thoughtfully. &quot;I hear you&apos;re something of a tale-spinner yourself, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps we could swap a few stories while we&apos;re in Undermountain? Could make for a pleasant trip.&quot;</string>
<string name="92361">The woman chuckles. &quot;An interesting proposal, but in all honesty I should probably stay with my friends here. I don&apos;t know what they&apos;d do without me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92362">&quot;Leaving so soon? Very well. Don&apos;t do anything I wouldn&apos;t do.&quot;</string>
<string name="92363">&quot;Well, don&apos;t forget that poor Durnan is simply dying to see you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92364">She grins and shrugs. &quot;Go ahead.&quot;</string>
<string name="92365">&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t know. Somewhere in the other room, I suppose.&quot;</string>
<string name="92366">&quot;Isn&apos;t it obvious? It is a city under siege by the forces of shadow and darkness. Drow elves, spider-men, humanoids of all shapes and sizes... all spill from Undermountain&apos;s portals, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92367">&quot;It is not constant, of course, but the carnage has been severe. And naturally the very thought of a concerted counter-strike into Undermountain is ludicrous. So enter us.&quot;</string>
<string name="92368">&quot;I just wish the city streets were not closed off. I have not been to Waterdeep in years, now, and there are a number of old friends I would look up. I suppose it will just have to wait.&quot;</string>
<string name="92369">&quot;Each one of them has their own story, of course, though they frustratingly keep them mostly to themselves. I&apos;ll crack them open one day.&quot;</string>
<string name="92370">&quot;You talk too much, bard.&quot;</string>
<string name="92371">&quot;Hmph. It&apos;s been interesting adventuring with them, but hardly the kind of epic that&apos;ll match the Shadows of Undrentide just yet, right &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="92372">She laughs heartily but doesn&apos;t comment.</string>
<string name="92373">&quot;A worthy offer, but I haven&apos;t given up on this group just yet. We shall have to see.&quot;</string>
<string name="92374">She laughs and arches an eyebrow. &quot;The book. Written about you. Surely you know of it? Ah, well.&quot;</string>
<string name="92375">&quot;It&apos;d be interesting to follow your journey, &lt;FirstName&gt;... but I am here with these companions for now. Should my situation change, so will my decision.&quot;</string>
<string name="92376">&quot;Me? The name is Sharwyn, dear &lt;man/woman&gt;, worker of arcane magics and teller of tales, adventurer and traveler both as well as a hero of Neverwinter, if you care to hear the tale!&quot;</string>
<string name="92377">&quot;Oi me, don&apos;t even get her bloody started!&quot;</string>
<string name="92378">&quot;Oh, well, fine. For those with attention spans shorter than their height, I&apos;ll just leave it there. Needless to say, I&apos;m a bard and pleased to be one.&quot;</string>
<string name="92379">&quot;Undermountain has a legend all its own, and I think this is my chance to not only see it first-hand but earn a reward while doing so.&quot;</string>
<string name="92380">&quot;A hundred thousand gold to anyone who can stop the dread creatures from attacking the city, of course. And lesser amounts for good information, I suppose, but who would shoot for less?&quot;</string>
<string name="92381">&quot;Just think: not only would we be renowned as the saviors of fair Waterdeep, but we would have plumbed the very depths of Undermountain and survived!&quot;</string>
<string name="92382">&quot;I know the legend, as would any self-respecting collector of lore. I know that the mad wizard Halaster created the subterranean labyrinth long ago.&quot;</string>
<string name="92383">&quot;I know that he filled it with creatures and traps enough to challenge even the mightiest hero. I know that few, if any, have returned from it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92384">&quot;What I do not know, what no-one knows, is why now after all this time the evil spills to the surface. Has mad Halaster lost control? Are we defenseless?&quot;</string>
<string name="92385">&quot;One can only imagine the terror of being in a city with such a neighbor, but such is the fate of Waterdeep: City of Heroes! So much the better for us, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="92386">The bard grins and laughs merrily. &quot;A-ha! Do you think we will be competing, then? What fun that might be!&quot;</string>
<string name="92387">&quot;Oh?&quot; The bard chuckles. &quot;You needn&apos;t go mutilating yourself on my account. Be a loner, if that&apos;s what you prefer. I should probably stay with my friends here, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="92388">&quot;Ah, a loner type, is it? What a pity. I suppose I should stay with my friends here, anyway.&quot; She shrugs, and doesn&apos;t seem too concerned.</string>
<string name="92389">The assorted group looks at you uncomfortably for a moment. The half-orc stares at you openly before speaking. &quot;It appears that the tales of heroes such as yourself do not always tell the truth. So be it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92390">The half-orc looks away and snorts with obvious derision, but does not push the topic further.</string>
<string name="92391">The half-orc grins suddenly, showing a full set of sharp teeth. &quot;I read a book about you, once. It never said that you were humble.&quot;</string>
<string name="92392">The half-orc nods at you, looking relieved. &quot;The innkeeper is right to wait for you, then. You are not only a hero, you also have a valiant heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="92393">The half-orc looks away, sighing with resignation. &quot;A mercenary, then. Looks like there will be less money for you, Tomi.&quot;</string>
<string name="92394">&quot;Bloody hell.&quot;</string>
<string name="92395">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="92396">&quot;Durnan called for heroes. I&apos;m here to do the right thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="92397">&quot;I&apos;d like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="92398">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92399">&quot;Can I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="92400">&quot;Where do I find Durnan?&quot;</string>
<string name="92401">&quot;Do you know anything about what&apos;s going on in Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="92402">&quot;Tell me about these friends of yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="92403">&quot;Don&apos;t remind me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92404">&quot;Why don&apos;t you come with me, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="92405">&quot;The Shadows of Undrentide?&quot;</string>
<string name="92406">&quot;How about you travel with me, instead?&quot;</string>
<string name="92407">&quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="92408">&quot;What is this reward again?&quot;</string>
<string name="92409">&quot;What do you know about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="92410">&quot;I have my own companions to worry about.&quot;</string>
<string name="92411">&quot;I&apos;d sooner cut off my own ears.&quot;</string>
<string name="92412">&quot;I work better on my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="92413">&quot;If there&apos;s a chance to kill something, I&apos;ll always take it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92414">&quot;If it ever becomes your business, I&apos;ll let you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="92415">&quot;To be honest, I don&apos;t really know why I&apos;m here.&quot;</string>
<string name="92416">&quot;I care what happens to Waterdeep, even if you don&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="92417">&quot;I&apos;m always looking for adventure, if the reward is right.&quot;</string>
<string name="92418">As you knock on the door, you hear someone grumbling and shuffling around, then a small window slides open and a pair of eyes glare out at you.</string>
<string name="92419">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Oh dear, I certainly never meant to offend you. No need to be getting upset. Please, come right in.&quot;</string>
<string name="92420">&quot;My goodness. Please, come right in. I&apos;ll just unlock the door here... there you go. Come right inside.&quot;</string>
<string name="92421">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;The name is &lt;FirstName&gt; and you had better open that door up before I get angry!&quot;</string>
<string name="92422">&quot;I am &lt;FullName&gt;. Perhaps you have heard of me?&quot; </string>
<string name="92423">&quot;Pardon me, but my name is &lt;FullName&gt; and I was told you might help me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92424">A pretty young woman rushes in, a mixture of fear and concern on her face. You vaguely remember her as the daughter of the innkeeper.</string>
<string name="92425">&quot;No, I... I don&apos;t think so, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. I only entered your room because I heard the commotion from the hall.&quot;</string>
<string name="92426">&quot;The drow woman... is she...?&quot;</string>
<string name="92427">&quot;I don&apos;t think she was just a thief, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. She probably took your equipment so you would be defenseless when the drow assassin showed up. That&apos;s been the pattern for the other attacks.&quot;</string>
<string name="92428">&quot;Then you are a lucky &lt;man/woman&gt;, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Many important people have been attacked in their homes here in Waterdeep. But unlike you, they haven&apos;t survived.&quot;</string>
<string name="92429">&quot;That is fortunate. Several important people in Waterdeep have been killed in their homes while they slept... though this is the first time anyone in our inn has been attacked.&quot;</string>
<string name="92430">&quot;Not here at the inn, but some of Waterdeep&apos;s more prominent citizens have been killed in their homes while they sleep. Someone has been sending assassins to kill them off.&quot;</string>
<string name="92431">&quot;But... how could this thief even have known that you were here? You only just arrived to the city. I&apos;ll have to tell father about this. We take pride in the safety of our guests.&quot;</string>
<string name="92432">&quot;The thief must have used magic... that&apos;s the only way she could have gotten in here undetected. She must have used that same magic to send your equipment back to wherever she came from.&quot;</string>
<string name="92433">Tamsil frowns. &quot;Father&apos;s gathered weapons, armor and other equipment here at the inn to help in the defense of Waterdeep. Anyone working to save the city is welcome to any of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92434">&quot;Everything is stored in the armory just across the hall. Just take whatever you need.&quot;</string>
<string name="92435">&quot;I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, but there&apos;s nothing more I can do. If you want your equipment back, you&apos;ll have to find the person who sent the drow thief here in the first place.&quot;</string>
<string name="92436">&quot;I know the equipment in the armory isn&apos;t suitable for a hero like you, &lt;FullName&gt;, but it&apos;s the best we&apos;ve got. Now, please excuse me. I have to go speak with my father.&quot;</string>
<string name="92437">&quot;I&apos;ll tell him what happened here, but it would be best if you didn&apos;t mention it to the other guests. We don&apos;t want to start a panic in the inn. Father will take steps to see this doesn&apos;t happen again.&quot;</string>
<string name="92438">&quot;Goodbye, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Once you have what you need from the armory please go downstairs to the main room. My father is waiting there to speak to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92439">She wrinkles her nose in distaste, then quickly looks away from you. &quot;I am not that sort of girl, my Lord. And this is not that kind of place.&quot;</string>
<string name="92440">Her eyes widen, and for a few moments she forgets to blush. &quot;I... I&apos;m sorry, but that wouldn&apos;t be appropriate.&quot;</string>
<string name="92441">She blushes slightly, looking away. &quot;Oh, but I would sooner allow you to get dressed, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. I&apos;m sure my father could answer any questions you have.&quot;</string>
<string name="92442">&quot;I... of course, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="92443">&quot;As you wish, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. What would you like to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="92444">&quot;He has been ordered by the Lords of Waterdeep to organize an expedition into Undermountain to try and stop the raids.&quot;</string>
<string name="92445">&quot;I really... I really should let him be the one to tell you the details. There are a lot of adventurers downstairs waiting to hear what he has to say. You should join them, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="92446">&quot;Waterdeep has been assaulted for several weeks now by the creatures of Undermountain: dark elves and far worse.&quot;</string>
<string name="92447">&quot;Nobody seems to know what their plan is, if they have one. The city has been in chaos. Thank the gods you arrived before the city was closed.&quot;</string>
<string name="92448">&quot;The Lords of Waterdeep finally sealed the city gates and streets this morning. No one is allowed to travel anywhere except for the militia.&quot;</string>
<string name="92449">&quot;If you hadn&apos;t arrived when you did, they probably wouldn&apos;t have even let you into the city. Well... maybe *you* they would have, I don&apos;t know.&quot;</string>
<string name="92450">&quot;Only that you are a famed adventurer, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, and perhaps the city&apos;s only hope.&quot;</string>
<string name="92451">She pauses for a moment, unsure of whether or not to continue. &quot;I... I must admit, I was expecting someone a little bit more... err...&quot;</string>
<string name="92452">She thinks on your words for a moment and brightens. &quot;You&apos;re probably right, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. I&apos;m sorry for being so rude.&quot;</string>
<string name="92453">She smiles wistfully. &quot;To tell the truth, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, I am a bit envious of your life. My father would never let me face the dangers you do, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="92454">&quot;No, it&apos;s not that! I... I&apos;m sorry, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. Please don&apos;t mind me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92455">&quot;I... suppose so. Maybe. I... I&apos;m sorry if that sounds rude.&quot;</string>
<string name="92456">&quot;Oh, it... it isn&apos;t that. You&apos;re just... not what I expected. Not that it matters.&quot;</string>
<string name="92457">&quot;Oh, no no, you&apos;re not unhandsome at all!&quot; She suddenly realizes what she has said and blushes. &quot;I... that is, you&apos;re just... not what I, ah, expected...&quot;</string>
<string name="92458">&quot;I... maybe.&quot; She blushes and looks a bit apologetic. &quot;I suppose it doesn&apos;t matter what I think.&quot;</string>
<string name="92459">&quot;Only that you are a famed adventurer, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. My father says that your fighting skills are unparalleled.&quot;</string>
<string name="92460">&quot;Only that you are a famed adventurer, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. My father says that you are a powerful servant of nature.&quot;</string>
<string name="92461">&quot;Only that you are a famed adventurer, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. My father says that you are a powerful servant of your god.&quot;</string>
<string name="92462">&quot;Only that you are a famed adventurer, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. My father says that you are a master of the magical arts.&quot;</string>
<string name="92463">&quot;We met ever so briefly last night when you arrived. I am Tamsil, Durnan&apos;s daughter. I help my father run the inn, more or less.&quot;</string>
<string name="92464">&quot;I... I see.&quot; The girl looks down at the corpse again, revulsion evident on her face.</string>
<string name="92465">&quot;Do I...? Oh no, my &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;, I would never... that is, I only came into your room because I heard the commotion from the hall.&quot;</string>
<string name="92466">&quot;Is the inn under attack?&quot;</string>
<string name="92467">&quot;Nobody steals my stuff and lives!&quot;</string>
<string name="92468">&quot;I... think I was warned, actually. Something woke me up.&quot;</string>
<string name="92469">&quot;I&apos;m not that easy to kill. Trust me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92470">&quot;There have been other attacks?&quot;</string>
<string name="92471">&quot;So that&apos;s it? I&apos;m left with nothing?&quot;</string>
<string name="92472">&quot;Any idea where I could get some replacement gear?&quot;</string>
<string name="92473">&quot;I don&apos;t want your second-rate crap! I want my stuff!&quot;</string>
<string name="92474">&quot;That will be all, thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92475">&quot;Seeing as you&apos;re already in my room and I&apos;m undressed...&quot;</string>
<string name="92476">&quot;I could use some help getting dressed...&quot;</string>
<string name="92477">&quot;I have a few questions, if you don&apos;t mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="92478">&quot;Very well, off you go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92479">&quot;Answer my questions, girl.&quot;</string>
<string name="92480">&quot;Indulge me, please.&quot;</string>
<string name="92481">&quot;That&apos;s enough. You can go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92482">&quot;I want to know what your father is planning.&quot;</string>
<string name="92483">&quot;Tell me what&apos;s going on in this city.&quot;</string>
<string name="92484">&quot;What do you mean &apos;the city was closed&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="92485">&quot;What do you know about me?&quot;</string>
<string name="92486">&quot;Heroes are rarely what you expect. Remember that.&quot;</string>
<string name="92487">&quot;Human?&quot;</string>
<string name="92488">&quot;Heroic?&quot;</string>
<string name="92489">&quot;Handsome?&quot;</string>
<string name="92490">&quot;Smarter?&quot;</string>
<string name="92491">&quot;Do you have a name?&quot;</string>
<string name="92492">&quot;Thank you. You can go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92493">&quot;Thank you. I&apos;ll go there right away.&quot;</string>
<string name="92494">&quot;Dead? Yes, I killed the thief.&quot;</string>
<string name="92495">&quot;That is a drow thief! She stole my equipment!&quot;</string>
<string name="92496">&quot;Do you always barge into your guests&apos; rooms?&quot;</string>
<string name="92497">She rolls her eyes. &quot;Uh-huh. If I had a gold piece for every time some adventurer said that to me, I&apos;d be a rich woman.&quot;</string>
<string name="92498">She laughs lightly. &quot;Is that so? I take it a little thing like a war isn&apos;t going to hamper your fun, is that it?&quot;</string>
<string name="92499">She grins. &quot;You&apos;re not the first one to say that. You adventurers are all alike. The Lords of Waterdeep have offered a hundred thousand gold as a reward... is that enough?&quot;</string>
<string name="92500">She looks around. &quot;Well, yes... but not as many as father had hoped for. They&apos;ve been forced to close down the city to prevent the assaults from spreading.&quot;</string>
<string name="92501">&quot;That means it&apos;s up to everyone here to do something, since no-one else can come into Waterdeep. I hope it&apos;s enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="92502">&quot;At any rate, my father will be starting his speech soon. I wouldn&apos;t go too far if I were you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92503">She gives you an odd look, slightly perplexed. &quot;You mean you haven&apos;t heard about all the attacks on Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="92504">&quot;Father says that the creatures have been coming out of Undermountain for weeks now, attacking everywhere in the city. It&apos;s been horrible!&quot;</string>
<string name="92505">&quot;The Lords of Waterdeep have charged him with organizing adventurers to go into Undermountain and find out why this is happening... and maybe stop it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92506">&quot;I assume that&apos;s why you&apos;re here, isn&apos;t it? You look like an adventurer to me... we see a lot of them here at the inn.&quot;</string>
<string name="92507">&quot;My name is Tamsil. My father is Durnan... he runs the Yawning Portal, and he&apos;s the one who made the call for adventurers. You are one, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="92508">Her eyes widen in surprise. &quot;I... yes, of course. Please forgive me, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I didn&apos;t mean anything by it, it&apos;s just... he&apos;s my father...&quot;</string>
<string name="92509">She nods and slowly takes several deep breaths. &quot;Thank the gods! I&apos;ve... I&apos;ve never been through anything like that ever before in my life.&quot;</string>
<string name="92510">&quot;We&apos;ve had the occasional brawl here in the inn, but... but those horrible elves! They would have killed us all if they&apos;d won, wouldn&apos;t they?&quot;</string>
<string name="92511">&quot;Somebody has to do something! This has to stop!!&quot; She clenches her fists in determination, looking around as if to pick up the nearest weapon.</string>
<string name="92512">&quot;Why should we leave it all up to you?! You don&apos;t even live here! Father taught me how to fight! I can go with you... I can go into Undermountain just like he did!&quot;</string>
<string name="92513">&quot;And why not?! Father taught me how to fight! I can go with you... I can go into Undermountain just like Father did!&quot;</string>
<string name="92514">&quot;Don&apos;t be foolish, Tamsil! I will not have you getting yourself killed!&quot;</string>
<string name="92515">&quot;So what should I do, Mother?! Wait here until we get attacked again?! &lt;FirstName&gt;, please... take me with you!&quot;</string>
<string name="92516">Her face lights up. &quot;I can? Oh, thank you! I won&apos;t disappoint you, &lt;FirstName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="92517">&quot;Absolutely not. &lt;FirstName&gt; will not be able to protect you in Undermountain, Tamsil. You will only slow &lt;him/her&gt; down.&quot;</string>
<string name="92518">&quot;Then what am I supposed to do? I want to help!&quot;</string>
<string name="92519">Tamsil slowly sighs, crestfallen. &quot;I... all right. I can do that. It doesn&apos;t sound like very much, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="92520">&quot;This isn&apos;t over. I can feel it in my bones.&quot; Mhaere suddenly looks towards the stairs leading to the well room. &quot;Do... do you hear that?&quot;</string>
<string name="92521">Her eyes blaze with indignation. &quot;I *can* fight! I won&apos;t sit around here! I&apos;m going with you whether you like it or not!&quot;</string>
<string name="92522">&quot;Actually, I&apos;m here see the fair maidens...&quot;</string>
<string name="92523">&quot;We&apos;ll see. It depends on the reward.&quot;</string>
<string name="92524">&quot;Yes, I am. Are there many others here?&quot;</string>
<string name="92525">&quot;What call is that?&quot;</string>
<string name="92526">&quot;Your father? Who might you be?&quot;</string>
<string name="92527">&quot;Your father isn&apos;t the only one in danger here, you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="92528">&quot;He lives.&quot;</string>
<string name="92529">&quot;Calm yourself. We were victorious.&quot;</string>
<string name="92530">&quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;m here for.&quot;</string>
<string name="92531">&quot;Slow down there, girl. Leave this to experienced adventurers.&quot;</string>
<string name="92532">&quot;And you think you can do something about it?&quot;</string>
<string name="92533">&quot;You want to come along? Fine by me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92534">&quot;I can&apos;t spend all my time protecting you. Forget it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92535">&quot;Your mother is right. Your place is here.&quot;</string>
<string name="92536">&quot;You can help by going to the city guard and telling them what&apos;s happened here.&quot;</string>
<string name="92537">&quot;You think you can fight? Don&apos;t make me laugh.&quot;</string>
<string name="92538">&quot;There was another attack in the well room. He&apos;s fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="92539">This ancient-looking man appears ready for battle, though his frail body can barely keep itself upright beneath the weight of his armor.</string>
<string name="92540">&quot;Am I so old that I am of no use to anyone? I&apos;m one of the few who has entered Undermountain and returned to tell the tale! But now they tell me I am too old to help Waterdeep against these foes.&quot; </string>
<string name="92541">&quot;Yes, I suppose you have no need to listen to the ramblings of an old man like me. Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="92542">&quot;Goodbye, and good luck.&quot;</string>
<string name="92543">His body seems to cave into itself. &quot;When they open the streets again. Then I shall go home and die.&quot;</string>
<string name="92544">&quot;Now leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="92545">His eyes brighten a little. &quot;You want to hear about Undermountain? Really? I would really love... I mean, I would be honored to help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92546">&quot;They say Undermountain is never the same, always changing. But there is one thing about that foul labyrinth that never changes: its creator, Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="92547">&quot;Halaster is a wizard of great and terrible power. Centuries ago he built Undermountain, and he has controlled it ever since. They say he is completely mad.&quot;</string>
<string name="92548">&quot;But there is a method to his madness. If you understand how the mage&apos;s mind works it is possible to enter Undermountain and survive, as I have done.&quot;</string>
<string name="92549">&quot;Undermountain is forever changing; its very architecture twisted and distorted on Halaster&apos;s whim. But the nature of the dungeon always remains the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="92550">&quot;Undermountain is designed to confuse and disorient you. Traps and tricks lay in wait around every corner. Never allow yourself to grow complacent, always expect the unexpected.&quot;</string>
<string name="92551">&quot;I think it has something to do with the idea that death is a journey. I could be wrong.&quot;</string>
<string name="92552">&quot;I would never claim to understand Halaster, not really. I just know the patterns now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92553">His face flushes red and his shoulders straighten with pride. &quot;That is not the only suggestion I can make.&quot;</string>
<string name="92554">&quot;Watch out for mirrors. They almost always hide something; sometimes something good, often something very bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="92555">&quot;And greed is a dangerous, often fatal flaw in Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="92556">&quot;Then you are exactly the kind of adventurer Halaster loves to kill. He will start off by teasing you with a small treasure.&quot;</string>
<string name="92557">&quot;Far more so in Undermountain. Halaster counts on adventurers being greedy. He starts by offering a little treasure.&quot;</string>
<string name="92558">&quot;Often little traps will start with a small treasure, to make you think there must be more.&quot;</string>
<string name="92559">&quot;Then there will be a little danger, but nothing you cannot handle. If you continue, eventually the big trap will be set off.&quot;</string>
<string name="92560">&quot;That is where most adventurers die. Of course, surviving the big trap can sometimes mean big rewards. Notice, I said *sometimes*.&quot;</string>
<string name="92561">&quot;Halaster is unpredictable. Sometimes he rewards courage and bravery, other times your trials will give you nothing. It&apos;s as if the wizard is making a mockery of these values.&quot;</string>
<string name="92562">&quot;Farewell, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. May you choose your path wisely.&quot;</string>
<string name="92563">His eyes twinkle in a satisfied way. &quot;Thank you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. It is my duty and my pleasure to assist you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92564">&quot;Tyr protect you on your journey.&quot;</string>
<string name="92565">&quot;Well, that is all I can think of for now. Maybe I will remember more later.&quot;</string>
<string name="92566">He snorts a derisive laugh. &quot;What world are you living in &lt;boy/girl&gt;? Durnan has forbidden me to go down there.&quot;</string>
<string name="92567">&quot;No, I am too old. I am just fooling myself. It hurts just to swing my sword for a short period of time. I will never be of use again.&quot;</string>
<string name="92568">&quot;I suppose so. Leave me to my aged thoughts, young hero.&quot;</string>
<string name="92569">The old paladin looks at you with a bleary, tear-stained face. </string>
<string name="92570">&quot;Leave an old man to his reminiscing. No one needs me anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="92571">The old paladin smiles proudly at you. &quot;I may be too old to journey down into Undermountain myself, but at least my wisdom has served of some use against this foe!&quot; </string>
<string name="92572">&quot;I wish you luck down in Undermountain. Remember what I told you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92573">&quot;I suppose if anyone can tell you about the dangers of Undermountain it would be me. I am one of the few who has entered her dark halls and emerged to tell the tale.&quot;</string>
<string name="92574">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="92575">&quot;You are too old. Why not just go home?&quot;</string>
<string name="92576">&quot;You could help me by telling me about Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="92577">&quot;Halaster?&quot; </string>
<string name="92578">&quot;Who?&quot;</string>
<string name="92579">&quot;I have always been told Undermountain is unpredictable.&quot;</string>
<string name="92580">&quot;That was stupid. I was hoping for something useful.&quot; </string>
<string name="92581">&quot;Why would it be that way?&quot;</string>
<string name="92582">&quot;That is a useful piece of information, thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92583">&quot;Enough yapping, old man. I&apos;ve got real business to attend to.&quot;</string>
<string name="92584">&quot;My greed has served me well so far.&quot;</string>
<string name="92585">&quot;It usually is anywhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="92586">&quot;How so?&quot;</string>
<string name="92587">&quot;Sometimes there is nothing?&quot;</string>
<string name="92588">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="92589">&quot;Goodbye, and thanks for the help.&quot;</string>
<string name="92590">&quot;Anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="92591">&quot;I noticed.&quot; </string>
<string name="92592">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; </string>
<string name="92593">&quot;You&apos;re not too old. Get down there and fight!&quot;</string>
<string name="92594">&quot;Well, I tried. If you think you are too old, then maybe you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="92595">&quot;I&apos;ll remember.&quot;</string>
<string name="92596">&quot;Actually, can you tell me what you know about Undermountain again?&quot;</string>
<string name="92597">The halfling rogue turns and regards you with an upraised brow and a ready smirk. He boldly appraises your purse even though you are standing right there in front of him.</string>
<string name="92598">&quot;The innkeeper has refused to acknowledge the rest of us until &lt;FullName&gt; makes an appearance. I, for one, did not journey so far to render aid only to be ignored.&quot;</string>
<string name="92599">&quot;There is no need to be unkind, Daelan. This &lt;man/woman&gt; deserves our respect. &lt;He/She&gt; is an adventurer of worth, and the fact that &lt;he/she&gt; is here is a boon to our cause.&quot;</string>
<string name="92600">&quot;Huh. There ain&apos;t no cause that I know about that&apos;s gonna pay me a hundred thousand gold like this one will, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="92601">&quot;I agree with Tomi. Gold speaks louder than any cause I&apos;ve ever heard of.&quot;</string>
<string name="92602">&quot;That is an odd thing for a bard to say, Sharwyn. Have you no sense of the epic? I wonder if our friend here would agree with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92603">&quot;Then why do we not ask &lt;him/her&gt;? What of it, &lt;FirstName&gt;? What has brought you to Waterdeep in its hour of need?&quot;</string>
<string name="92604">The half-orc relaxes a bit and nods, pleased. &quot;I am pleased to hear that. The city of Neverwinter was once saved by one who chose to do the right thing, as you say.&quot;</string>
<string name="92605">The halfling steps forward, grinning, and pats you on the back. &quot;Well, now that you&apos;re here I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll want to adventure with good ol&apos; Tomi, aye? One thing, though... if ye wants me to unlock somethin&apos;, don&apos;t stand in me way.&quot;</string>
<string name="92606">The halfling steps forward, grinning, and pats you on the back. &quot;Well, now that you&apos;re here I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll want to adventure with us, aye? Just ignore the prissy cleric lass. I bloody well do.&quot;</string>
<string name="92607">&quot;Of course ya do. I&apos;m Tomi Undergallows, after all. We&apos;ll see how things play out, o&apos; course, but I&apos;m always willin&apos; to take on a hench&lt;man/woman&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="92608">&quot;Oh, sure, aye.&quot;</string>
<string name="92609">&quot;Aye, all right. You&apos;d better get into the other room, anyway... that fella who runs the inn is waiting for ya.&quot;</string>
<string name="92610">&quot;If ya like.&quot;</string>
<string name="92611">&quot;He&apos;s in the other room, I reckon. If ya hears someone really loud, that&apos;s gotta be him.&quot;</string>
<string name="92612">&quot;Nah, not so much. There&apos;s all sorts of beasties attacking the city, I hear, but nobody knows why. Probably just because they&apos;re beasties... don&apos;t know why they needs a reason.&quot;</string>
<string name="92613">&quot;Guess it&apos;s gotten so bad that they&apos;ve gone an&apos; shut down the city. Ya aren&apos;t allowed on the bloody streets no more, lest the militia cut ya down where ya stand.&quot;</string>
<string name="92614">&quot;I wouldn&apos;t go outside, if I were you. I did, an&apos; even Sneaky Pete himself couldn&apos;t have gotten very far out there. Them guards got their eyes peeled but good.&quot;</string>
<string name="92615">&quot;Oh, they&apos;re not so bad. Just some folks I found up in Neverwinter that all wanted to come, they did. For the reward, no doubt.&quot;</string>
<string name="92616">&quot;Can&apos;t says as I knows them all very well. If you wants to know so much, then why doesn&apos;t ya ask them about it?&quot;</string>
<string name="92617">&quot;Ya know... that&apos;s right tempting, that is. Let&apos;s just see what that Durnan fella has ta say first before we make any decisions like that, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="92618">&quot;You haven&apos;t heard o&apos; me? Well, that&apos;s mighty strange. Name&apos;s Tomi Undergallows, rogue of renown and a bit of a bloody rapscallion if I do say so myself. I&apos;m here for the reward, jus&apos; like everyone is, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="92619">&quot;Well, the city&apos;s being attacked time an&apos; again by critters from Undermountain. Unpleasant mess, that is. They&apos;re offering a heap of gold if anyone can find out what&apos;s up.&quot;</string>
<string name="92620">&quot;An&apos; if someone can actually *stop* the attacks, it&apos;s somethin&apos; like a hundred thousand gold they&apos;re offerin&apos;. Who couldn&apos;t use that, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="92621">&quot;You&apos;d figure with that kind o&apos; coin, every self-styled hero from here to Rashamen would&apos;ve come runnin&apos;. Guess they&apos;re all jus&apos; afraid of Undermountain. More for Tomi, I says.&quot;</string>
<string name="92622">&quot;Oh, I dunno. Not much. How bad could it be for a stout hero like me? An&apos; you, of course. Miles of dungeons beneath the city... it&apos;s all old hat, really.&quot;</string>
<string name="92623">He laughs boisterously. &quot;Yeah, they&apos;re a bit of a pain in the arse, ain&apos;t they? But they needs ya, right? So ya hang around. I know where you&apos;re comin&apos; from.&quot;</string>
<string name="92624">&quot;Ya know, that&apos;s always been Tomi&apos;s policy. The coat-tails, I says, are only for pretty lasses and tiny but determined doggies.&quot;</string>
<string name="92625">He chuckles briefly. &quot;Oh, aye? Fair enough, that is. Just thought that ye might want some help, it bein&apos; bloody Undermountain an&apos; all.&quot;</string>
<string name="92626">The assorted group looks at you uncomfortably for a moment. The half-orc stares at you openly before speaking. &quot;It appears that the tales of heroes such as yourself do not always tell the truth. So be it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92627">The half-orc looks away and snorts with obvious derision, but does not push the topic further.</string>
<string name="92628">The half-orc grins suddenly, showing a full set of sharp teeth. &quot;I read a book about you, once. It never said that you were humble.&quot;</string>
<string name="92629">The half-orc nods at you, looking relieved. &quot;The innkeeper is right to wait for you, then. You are not only a hero, you also have a valiant heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="92630">The half-orc looks away, sighing with resignation. &quot;A mercenary, then. Looks like there will be less money for you, Tomi.&quot;</string>
<string name="92631">&quot;Bloody hell.&quot;</string>
<string name="92632">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="92633">&quot;Durnan called for heroes. I&apos;m here to do the right thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="92634">&quot;I&apos;d like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="92635">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92636">&quot;Can I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="92637">&quot;Where do I find Durnan?&quot;</string>
<string name="92638">&quot;Do you know anything about what&apos;s going on in Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="92639">&quot;Tell me about these friends of yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="92640">&quot;Why don&apos;t you travel with me, instead?&quot;</string>
<string name="92641">&quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="92642">&quot;What is this reward again?&quot;</string>
<string name="92643">&quot;What do you know about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="92644">&quot;I have my own companions to worry about.&quot;</string>
<string name="92645">&quot;Get lost. I don&apos;t need any hangers-on.&quot;</string>
<string name="92646">&quot;I work better on my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="92647">&quot;If there&apos;s a chance to kill something, I&apos;ll always take it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92648">&quot;If it ever becomes your business, I&apos;ll let you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="92649">&quot;To be honest, I don&apos;t really know why I&apos;m here.&quot;</string>
<string name="92650">&quot;I care what happens to Waterdeep, even if you don&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="92651">&quot;I&apos;m always looking for adventure, if the reward is right.&quot;</string>
<string name="92652">Although this man looks human, faint traces of elven features reveal a mixed heritage. He appears to be meditating, but as you approach, his eyes open and he smiles in greeting.</string>
<string name="92653">&quot;Good morning to you, friend. I am glad to see you up and about this morning. I believe today you and the other heroes here shall finally hear what good Durnan has planned for you all.&quot;</string>
<string name="92654">&quot;Hopefully he can shed some light on the recent assassinations and the denizens of the dark that are appearing to make war on this fair city.&quot;</string>
<string name="92655">&quot;May your journey expand your mind and fill your life with wonders.&quot;</string>
<string name="92656">&quot;I thank you for the offer, but I am afraid not. My main role here is observation, rather than interaction. I will learn what I can from studying the enemy, not fighting him.&quot;</string>
<string name="92657">&quot;I do not expect you, or any of the others to understand the beliefs of my order, but we do not involve ourselves in wars. We observe and record, that is all.&quot;</string>
<string name="92658">&quot;So long as your questions do not infringe upon the strict laws of my order, I shall do my best to answer them.&quot;</string>
<string name="92659">&quot;Is there anything else you would like?&quot;</string>
<string name="92660">&quot;Durnan is the innkeep and by all accounts a good man. He has shown his loyalty to Waterdeep through the years, and is well respected by her most prominent citizens.&quot;</string>
<string name="92661">&quot;Because the Yawning Portal, this inn, has access to the dungeon called Undermountain, Durnan is organizing some sort of expedition. That is really all I can tell you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92662">&quot;Durnan is waiting downstairs and should be making his announcement any time. I am eager to learn what he has to say so that I may add it to my notes.&quot;</string>
<string name="92663">&quot;I have heard that several key citizens of Waterdeep have been found dead, with evidence that drow were involved.&quot;</string>
<string name="92664">&quot;How they have entered each house is a mystery, as most were locked and well guarded. Hopefully whatever Durnan has to say will clear things up.&quot;</string>
<string name="92665">&quot;My name is Cyphus, a monk of the Guarded Mind Order. I have traveled here in hopes of finding new insights into the creatures of the dark who now ravage this city.&quot;</string>
<string name="92666">&quot;Very little has been written on the Underdark, and little of what has been written is verifiable. My order is interested in learning the truth of such things.&quot;</string>
<string name="92667">&quot;And, if what I have heard from others here is true, you are a famed adventurer. Perhaps I shall have to put some thought into documenting your presence in this war.&quot;</string>
<string name="92668">&quot;You have the bearing of one who shapes events and history. If that proves to be the case, I will have little choice but to chronicle your participation in events here.&quot;</string>
<string name="92669">&quot;That knowledge is not something members of our order share. Strict rules are in place to keep our order safe.&quot;</string>
<string name="92670">&quot;Simply know that I am an observer, nothing more. I wish you luck in whatever lies ahead, but I will not be a part of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92671">&quot;Hello once again. Is there something else you need of me? If not you really should go down. I believe Durnan and the others are waiting for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92672">&quot;I&apos;m surprised to see you here, &lt;FirstName&gt;. With all the excitement going on, I didn&apos;t think you would have time for the likes of a simple chronicler of history like me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92673">&quot;Never fear. Each and every event, including the rather unexpected attack on this inn, is being properly recorded. And I will be sure to make special mention of your actions here.&quot;</string>
<string name="92674">&quot;Now forgive me, but I must return to my notes. So much has happened, I can&apos;t waste any more time. I must write it all down while it is still fresh in my memory.&quot;</string>
<string name="92675">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="92676">&quot;Would you like to work with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="92677">&quot;Let me ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="92678">&quot;That is all my questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="92679">&quot;Who is Durnan?&quot;</string>
<string name="92680">&quot;You mentioned assassinations.&quot;</string>
<string name="92681">&quot;Who are you and why are you here?&quot; </string>
<string name="92682">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="92683">&quot;You want to write about me?&quot;</string>
<string name="92684">&quot;Who are your masters?&quot;</string>
<string name="92685">&quot;Woof, woof!&quot;</string>
<string name="92686">The dog wishes it could be your companion; running by your side as you go off into battle, and tearing out the throats of your foes. It always dreamed of becoming a dog-of-war.</string>
<string name="92687">The dog tells you it was talking to a rat the other day that swore it knew a secret room filled with treasure. The dog warns you to never trust a rat.</string>
<string name="92688">The dogs sniffs the air, then tells you that it isn&apos;t terribly fond of the smell down here. It wonders how long it has been since the floor was given a good scrubbing.</string>
<string name="92689">The dog wonders whatever happened to the bright, sunny place where he used to live. He gloomily concludes that it was probably destroyed when the sky fell, just like the chicken warned him.</string>
<string name="92690">The dog tells you that it is getting rather tired of chasing chickens and wonders why there aren&apos;t any cats around here.</string>
<string name="92691">The dog cannot seem to remember how it got down into this dismal dungeon. It wonders how it will ever manage to make its way home.</string>
<string name="92692">&quot;Hello dog.&quot;</string>
<string name="92693">&quot;They will rue the day they attacked us and forced our brothels to close, those evil fiends!&quot;</string>
<string name="92694">&quot;I am... very... tired...&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Yawn.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="92695">&quot;Why close a perfectly good brothel during a war? It seems to me that a little encouragement is what our soldiers need!&quot;</string>
<string name="92696">&quot;There will be more killings soon; mark my words! This war is far from over.&quot;</string>
<string name="92697">&quot;I should go home, but I am afraid to. What if more of those dark creatures are hiding in there?&quot;</string>
<string name="92698">&quot;I miss Lacey. She left the city after the first attack. She was such a pretty woman.&quot;</string>
<string name="92699">They slew everyone they could reach. I even heard that they killed one of the secret Lords of Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="92700">We will fight for our beloved city until the last of us falls. We will never surrender!</string>
<string name="92701">That&apos;s it; I&apos;m moving to Amn! The drow and duergar can have this blasted city!</string>
<string name="92702">We must keep the armies up here to protect us.</string>
<string name="92703">We must send the armies down to kill them.</string>
<string name="92704">Death came with the night and left with the dawn. I&apos;m afraid it shall return tonight to end us all.</string>
<string name="92705">What are the Lords of Waterdeep doing to help us? Why are they holed up in the castle? Are they going to leave us down here to die?</string>
<string name="92706">My dog tore the throat out of two of them, but they just kept on coming. I barely escaped with my life!</string>
<string name="92707">My son! They took my son! Why would they take such a young innocent?</string>
<string name="92708">They came out of the sewers and destroyed my home. Will they come back tonight and finish us off?</string>
<string name="92709">&quot;Cluck, cluck, cluck!&quot;</string>
<string name="92710">The chicken wishes it could be your companion; riding on your shoulder as you go off into battle, and pecking out the eyes of your foes. It always dreamed of becoming a chicken-of-war.</string>
<string name="92711">The chicken eyes you warily, wondering if your appetite was sated by the fairies. No amount of discussion on your part can convince the chicken that you didn&apos;t eat the fairy corpses.</string>
<string name="92712">The chicken eyes you warily, then decides you are a little large for a meal.</string>
<string name="92713">The chicken wonders who will feed it, now that the fairies are all gone.</string>
<string name="92714">The chicken is rather unimpressed with Undermountain, having expected something a little less... dark.</string>
<string name="92715">The chicken patiently explains to you how it tried to eat one of the fairies, thinking it was a bug. It was quite distraught when the fairy gave it a swift kick in the head.</string>
<string name="92716">&quot;Hello chicken.&quot;</string>
<string name="92717">Don&apos;t you know better than to interrupt an angry mob?</string>
<string name="92718">The Empty Keg Tavern is closed because of the troubles in Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="92719">&quot;We&apos;ll just wait here until those reinforcements arrive.&quot;</string>
<string name="92720">*huff... puff* &quot;My &lt;Lord/Lady&gt;. There is a small band of the enemy just around the corner. They drove us back.&quot;</string>
<string name="92721">&quot;We can&apos;t handle them by ourselves. We need reinforcements.&quot;</string>
<string name="92722">&quot;No, no. Of course not. Uh... we&apos;ll just stay here and wait for reinforcements.&quot;</string>
<string name="92723">&quot;Suit yourself. We&apos;ll... we&apos;ll just wait here for the reinforcements to arrive.&quot;</string>
<string name="92724">&quot;I hope you don&apos;t expect me to help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92725">&quot;I don&apos;t need reinforcements. I&apos;m going on ahead.&quot;</string>
<string name="92726">&quot;We&apos;ll, uh... we&apos;ll stay here and make sure nothing sneaks up on you from behind.&quot;</string>
<string name="92727">&quot;Thanks for your help. I sure hope someone can figure out how to stop these invasions. The city is going to run out of guards... well, someday.&quot;</string>
<string name="92728">The River Gate has been sealed due to the recent attacks.</string>
<string name="92729">This shop is closed due to the fighting. It will probably be open later.</string>
<string name="92730">&quot;Be careful out here... there could be an enemy around every corner.&quot;</string>
<string name="92731">A nervous guard comes running up to you. &quot;How fares everyone inside?&quot;</string>
<string name="92732">&quot;I know, Tamsil warned us. There have been attacks all over this side of the city.  Although we have been resisting them, there are still many of the enemy about.&quot;</string>
<string name="92733">&quot;All roads leading out of this district are sealed and most businesses hereabouts are closed.  You might be better off staying inside until we can clear the streets, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="92734">Okay... but don&apos;t say I didn&apos;t warn you.</string>
<string name="92735">&quot;&lt;FullName&gt;? Oh... I&apos;m sorry. Well, I guess you can handle yourself out here, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="92736">&quot;We were attacked by creatures from the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="92737">&quot;I can take care of myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="92738">&quot;Don&apos;t you recognize me? I&apos;m &lt;FullName&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="92739">&quot;You can&apos;t use that right now.  You must wait for the gears to realign. The light will turn green when it is ready again.&quot;</string>
<string name="92740">&quot;Be careful with that.  It can be a little disorienting.&quot;</string>
<string name="92741">&quot;Sounds dangerous.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Put the telescope down.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="92742">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Look into the telescope.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="92743">&quot;Back again?&quot;</string>
<string name="92744">The dwarf stops her hammering and wipes the sweat from her brow, &quot;I really must get back to work...the Guard needs weapons and armor with which to fight our enemies.&quot;</string>
<string name="92745">&quot;As do I,&quot; the dwarf says as she begins work again.</string>
<string name="92746">&quot;I don&apos;t have time to answer a bunch of questions! Can&apos;t you see how busy I am?&quot;</string>
<string name="92747">She looks at you oddly. &quot;I&apos;m the blacksmith. I don&apos;t pound this anvil all day just to look pretty.&quot;</string>
<string name="92748">&quot;I make the things and Argali sells them. Of course now, most of my sweat is going towards helping our fighting forces keep the city free.&quot;</string>
<string name="92749">&quot;Ha! By the looks of you, there are more important matters on your mind. Still, if you&apos;re serious I could give you a few pointers to help you along.&quot;</string>
<string name="92750">&quot;I&apos;d be willing to sell some of my crafting material too, if you&apos;re interested. So, what do you want to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="92751">&quot;That&apos;s the simple stuff!&quot;</string>
<string name="92752">&quot;I sell a few dye kits that you could try out to color your armor differently. You can also use your craft weapon or craft armor skills to  reconfigure your equipment entirely, though it will cost you some gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="92753">She shakes her head. &quot;That&apos;s for wizards and such. I don&apos;t care for those things. They can make potions and scrolls and wands, even, but I don&apos;t know anything about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92754">&quot;Leather armor is about the easiest of things to make. Just take some hide and craft it into a leather armor torso and then stitch some woolen cloth pads to it.</string>
<string name="92755">&quot;Metal armor takes a wee bit more work, you have to find yourself some steel and form it into a chest piece that can then be worked with other material to make your armor.&quot;</string>
<string name="92756">&quot;To make a sword or some such you just need to forge a steel blade and then attach it to an iron hilt. Smaller weapons can be attached to wooden hilts.&quot;</string>
<string name="92757">&quot;Bows require bow strings, which are easy to make from leather hides. Attach the string to a wooden bow shaft and you will have yourself a fine weapon.&quot;</string>
<string name="92758">&quot;You need a keen eye. You&apos;d be surprised as what you can use to make into something else. Make sure you&apos;ve practiced your crafting skill a bit though -- if you&apos;re no good at making things, you won&apos;t know what to look for.&quot;</string>
<string name="92759">&quot;Take a door. A wooden one can be smashed about and made into arrows or weapon hilts. A metal door can be melted down and reshaped, into shields or blades.&quot;</string>
<string name="92760">&quot;Chests and other furniture make great scrap wood. As well, many creatures can be skinned for their hide. The hide can then be reworked into bow strings or armor.&quot;</string>
<string name="92761">&quot;Take a look, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="92762">&quot;Yes... the brave men and women of Waterdeep who defend us from threats above, beyond, and below.&quot;</string>
<string name="92763">&quot;You&apos;ll find them patrolling the streets outside.&quot;</string>
<string name="92764">&quot;I&apos;d like to buy some crafting material.&quot;</string>
<string name="92765">&quot;I have to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92766">&quot;Can I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="92767">...more questions...</string>
<string name="92768">&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</string>
<string name="92769">&quot;Could you teach me to make weapons and armor?&quot;</string>
<string name="92770">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="92771">&quot;I just want to change the way my equipment looks.&quot;</string>
<string name="92772">&quot;Do you know how to make magical items?&quot;</string>
<string name="92773">&quot;How do I create armor?&quot;</string>
<string name="92774">&quot;How do I make a weapon?&quot;</string>
<string name="92775">&quot;How do I find materials to make into weapons or armor?&quot;</string>
<string name="92776">&quot;I want to buy some crafting material.&quot;</string>
<string name="92777">&quot;The Guard?&quot;</string>
<string name="92778">&quot;Just don&apos;t touch anything yer not supposed to and we&apos;ll get along fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="92779">I could hear the fighting from my bedroom. Mommy hid me in the closet, but it was scary in there.</string>
<string name="92780">The boys won&apos;t let me play war with them. </string>
<string name="92781">I want my mommy! Where did my mommy go?</string>
<string name="92782">Mister Blackstaff will save us. He&apos;s the protector of Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="92783">My doll&apos;s name is Snaffy and she isn&apos;t afraid of any dark monsters.</string>
<string name="92784">My mom says that daddy isn&apos;t coming back. Where did he go?</string>
<string name="92785">This display has a number of magical items for viewing. </string>
<string name="92786">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="92787">&quot;Hey you! Don&apos;t touch that!&quot;</string>
<string name="92788">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; You slip an item out. The guard glances over at you, but doesn&apos;t seem to notice anything.</string>
<string name="92789">You decide to move along, before he gets suspicious.</string>
<string name="92790">The guard eyes you suspiciously. You had better try your luck somewhere else.</string>
<string name="92791">Leave it alone.</string>
<string name="92792">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Pick Pocket]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="92793">I&apos;m scared. Do you think the armies will come again when it gets dark?</string>
<string name="92794">I never got to be in the fighting, but I bet I could have killed a bunch of duergar.</string>
<string name="92795">I&apos;m searching for corpses to loot. My dad says we can get lots of gold for magical weapons.</string>
<string name="92796">I want to be the soldiers and you be the drow. That way I get to win.</string>
<string name="92797">I&apos;m not supposed to be playing out here, but it&apos;s boring inside.</string>
<string name="92798">My dad was wounded in the fighting. Are those monsters coming back?</string>
<string name="92799">A dark, overpowering voice erupts from the mouth of this foul monster.</string>
<string name="92800">&quot;Touch not the items of Sobrey the Sage, lest thy life, nae, thy very soul be imperiled.&quot;</string>
<string name="92801">&quot;I sure am tired of all these bloody interruptions.&quot;</string>
<string name="92802">&quot;How can I concentrate on my cooking with all of that infernal noise outside.&quot;</string>
<string name="92803">&quot;What to make for dessert tonight, hmmmm...&quot;</string>
<string name="92804">&quot;I knew I should have written down that recipe for Huevos Underrancheros.&quot;</string>
<string name="92805">&quot;Was that one pinch of Utrech&apos;s powder or two...&quot;</string>
<string name="92806">&quot;I don&apos;t understand why my souffle won&apos;t rise!&quot;</string>
<string name="92807">&quot;Get out of my kitchen!&quot;</string>
<string name="92808">The half-orc&apos;s eyes snap open wide. His head darts from side to side, seeking an enemy that isn&apos;t there. Only then does his face focus on your own, standing above him.</string>
<string name="92809">He narrows his eyes, trying to decide if you are friend or foe. &quot;Ask your questions,&quot; he answers at last. &quot;I will do my best to answer them.&quot;</string>
<string name="92810">The half-orc looks at you more closely. &quot;Right. You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, the hero that Durnan was waiting for. I&apos;m Daelan Red Tiger, a warrior originally from the northern Uthgardt tribes.&quot;</string>
<string name="92811">The half-orc tilts his head to the side, searching through the shadows of his memory. &quot;Yes. That&apos;s right. &lt;FullName&gt;. The one Durnan was waiting for.&quot;</string>
<string name="92812">&quot;It&apos;s starting to come back to me now... there was a fight in the tavern. A beholder. We chased it down here, and I became separated from the others. I remember... dying.&quot;</string>
<string name="92813">&quot;You raised me, didn&apos;t you? For that, you have my thanks.&quot;</string>
<string name="92814">&quot;I will return to Durnan&apos;s inn, for now. I shouldn&apos;t have any trouble finding my way back. Maybe I can be of more use there than I was down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="92815">&quot;Once again, you have my thanks for returning me to life. I was not ready to leave this world yet. Goodbye, and good luck.&quot;</string>
<string name="92816">&quot;Are you sure that&apos;s a good idea? Most of my equipment is gone, and I haven&apos;t had much luck here in Undermountain so far.&quot;</string>
<string name="92817">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The half-orc grins. &quot;The truth is, I wasn&apos;t ready to end my adventures here in Undermountain quite yet. I would be honored to join up with you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot; </string>
<string name="92818">&quot;I do owe you for saving my life. I suppose joining with you now would be a way to start repaying it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92819">He looks at your companions. &quot;It seems you have more than enough help already, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Perhaps it would be best if I were to return to the inn for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92820">The half-orc&apos;s thick brow furls in concentration as he considers his options. &quot;I&apos;ve learned it&apos;s too dangerous for me to survive down here alone. I will probably go back to the inn, I suppose.&quot;</string>
<string name="92821">&quot;You raised me from the dead only to kill me again? This... this makes no sense. What was the point?&quot;</string>
<string name="92822">He gives you a sideways glance, trying to see if this is some type of trick. &quot;You are a very strange &lt;man/woman&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="92823">&quot;Well, I won&apos;t just roll over and die for you!&quot;</string>
<string name="92824">He shakes his head, perplexed. &quot;I am grateful for what you have done, but if you are expecting a reward what could I possibly give you? I don&apos;t have anything of value on me.&quot;</string>
<string name="92825">&quot;I did notice something strange while I was wandering around. Strange even for this place. The creatures in Undermountain seem to be at war with each other.&quot;</string>
<string name="92826">&quot;I&apos;d always heard that Halaster&apos;s magic forced the creatures in Undermountain to co-exist peacefully. But either the rumors were wrong or something&apos;s changed, because I&apos;ve run across a number of battles already.&quot;</string>
<string name="92827">&quot;Luckily, the creatures involved seem more intent on killing each other than me. I can&apos;t be sure, but it almost seems like there&apos;s two distinct factions in the conflict, each determined to destroy the other.&quot;</string>
<string name="92828">&quot;Other than that, there&apos;s not much I can tell you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92829">&quot;I know they are not what they appear. Foul magic is at work here. My own... my own death was because of them.&quot;</string>
<string name="92830">&quot;No. I was hoping to come across them as I wandered the dungeon, but luck was not with me. I suspect they may have gone deeper into Undermountain. I hope they fared better than I did.&quot;</string>
<string name="92831">&quot;We chased the beholder into this dungeon, but we were being led into an ambush. Just when we thought we had caught our foe, a volley of arrows burst from the darkness.&quot;</string>
<string name="92832">&quot;Everything happened so fast, there wasn&apos;t time to think. Our unseen attackers fled. Enraged, I threw myself into the darkness to chase after them.&quot;</string>
<string name="92833">&quot;I never did catch the cowards who ambushed us, and when I finally gave up the chase I realized that I had become separated from the rest of the group. Since then I have been wandering these passages alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="92834">&quot;I was careless. While searching for a way out, I stumbled onto this room of mirrors. I saw my own reflection, but I also thought I saw the reflection of glittering treasure at my feet.&quot; </string>
<string name="92835">&quot;Intrigued, I approached one of the mirrors. One of the middle two on the east wall, if I remember right. To my horror, my own reflection stepped out from the mirror and attacked me!&quot;</string>
<string name="92836">&quot;I was caught off guard and instantly put on the defensive. My vile twin was able to match and counter my every move. From the condition you found me in, it&apos;s obvious what the ultimate result of the fight was.&quot;</string>
<string name="92837">&quot;I don&apos;t know where that false imposter is now, however. Maybe in killing me, he also destroyed himself. Or maybe the spell simply faded in the time I have been lying here. I really couldn&apos;t say.&quot;</string>
<string name="92838">The half-orc glares at you, his eyes flashing with rage. &quot;Undermountain may have defeated me, but that doesn&apos;t mean I have to sit here and listen to your insults!&quot;</string>
<string name="92839">&quot;I do not take insults lightly, but you have saved my life, so I will forgive you for your harsh words. Now, is there something else?&quot;</string>
<string name="92840">&quot;You saved my life... that is the only reason I don&apos;t meet your insults with my blade. I don&apos;t think there is any reason for us to speak again: I have nothing to say to the likes of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92841">&quot;Time to wake up, big fella. How you feeling? Any memories coming back yet?&quot;</string>
<string name="92842">&quot;Daelan, it&apos;s me - Linu. Do you know where you are?&quot;</string>
<string name="92843">&quot;Daelan, it&apos;s me - Sharwyn. Do you know where you are?&quot;</string>
<string name="92844">&quot;Yes... I know you. It&apos;s all coming back. The battle at Durnan&apos;s inn...I remember.&quot;</string>
<string name="92845">Daelan notices your approach and his stern features slip enough to reveal the hint of a smile. He seems to be fully recovered from the state you found him in back in the dungeon.</string>
<string name="92846">He nods, satisfied at your answer. &quot;Your news will bring some comfort to the people here. I think my presence here comforts them, but we all know the true hope of ending this threat lies with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92847">He seems to consider your offer for a long time before answering. &quot;You saved my life, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I will gladly serve at your side, though I know this small gesture can never fully repay the debt I owe you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92848">He seems to consider your offer for a long time before answering. &quot;I would, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but it seems you have plenty of help already. Besides, my place is here now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92849">&quot;These people here need me more than you do, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I&apos;m honored by your offer, but I&apos;m certain you and your other companions will be fine without my help.&quot;</string>
<string name="92850">The half-orc eyes you warily, tensing at your approach. It is obvious he is not pleased to see you.</string>
<string name="92851">The half-orc snarls at the insult, but says nothing as he turns away from you.</string>
<string name="92852">The once proud barbarian bares his teeth at you as he turns away, shamed by your words and his own failure.</string>
<string name="92853">&quot;You may have saved my life, but that does not mean I will allow you to treat me with disrespect. Just leave me alone, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We have nothing to say to each other.&quot;</string>
<string name="92854">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; He grunts out a harsh laugh. &quot;You have treated me with nothing but dishonor and disrespect. A few words are not enough to atone for what you have done.&quot;</string>
<string name="92855">&quot;I do not accept your apology, &lt;FirstName&gt;. So leave me alone and return to your more important business: saving Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="92856">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; He studies you carefully, trying to judge the sincerity of your words. &quot;Holding a grudge against you would be foolish. You saved my life, and I am forever in your debt. Apology accepted.&quot;</string>
<string name="92857">&quot;May fortune smile on you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The very survival of Waterdeep may depend on it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92858">&quot;Quiet. I&apos;m the one who asks the questions here!&quot;</string>
<string name="92859">&quot;You were dead. I just raised you. Can you remember anything?&quot;</string>
<string name="92860">&quot;I&apos;m &lt;FirstName&gt;. I saw you in the tavern with Durnan.&quot;</string>
<string name="92861">&quot;You don&apos;t remember me? I spoke to your group at the tavern.&quot;</string>
<string name="92862">&quot;You don&apos;t remember me? We spoke at the tavern.&quot;</string>
<string name="92863">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92864">&quot;How about you join me?&quot;</string>
<string name="92865">&quot;That&apos;s a good point. I guess I don&apos;t need you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92866">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I could still use your help, regardless.&quot;</string>
<string name="92867">&quot;I raise you from the dead and now you won&apos;t even join up with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="92868">&quot;What are you going to do now?&quot;</string>
<string name="92869">&quot;That&apos;s probably for the best.&quot;</string>
<string name="92870">&quot;I&apos;m bored with you. I think I&apos;ll just kill you now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92871">&quot;Sorry. Bad joke. Go on - you&apos;re free to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92872">&quot;I just want the satisfaction of killing you myself.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Kill him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="92873">&quot;This is all the thanks I get for bringing you back to life?&quot;</string>
<string name="92874">&quot;I guess you&apos;re right. I don&apos;t need a reward.&quot;</string>
<string name="92875">&quot;Fine. I feel the need to kill you again, I think.&quot;</string>
<string name="92876">&quot;Why don&apos;t you come with me, instead?&quot;</string>
<string name="92877">&quot;Is there anything you can tell me about this area?&quot;</string>
<string name="92878">&quot;At war? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="92879">&quot;Do you know anything about all these mirrors?&quot;</string>
<string name="92880">&quot;That&apos;s not really surprising.&quot;</string>
<string name="92881">&quot;Do you know where your companions are?&quot;</string>
<string name="92882">&quot;Tell me what happened to you, exactly.&quot;</string>
<string name="92883">&quot;How did you get killed?&quot;</string>
<string name="92884">&quot;If I knew how pathetic you were, I wouldn&apos;t have bothered raising you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92885">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t mean that.&quot;</string>
<string name="92886">&quot;I don&apos;t have time for you, half-breed. Scurry back to the inn before you get killed again.&quot;</string>
<string name="92887">&quot;As well as can be expected.&quot;</string>
<string name="92888">&quot;I could use some help. Maybe you could join up with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="92889">&quot;Save it. I can&apos;t waste my time talking to half-breeds.&quot;</string>
<string name="92890">&quot;Something you couldn&apos;t do.&quot;</string>
<string name="92891">&quot;Do you have a problem with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="92892">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I just wanted to apologize for the way I acted before.&quot;</string>
<string name="92893">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92894">The dog sniffs at you and, realizing you are not one of the attackers, pants in a friendly way.</string>
<string name="92895">The dog wishes you well in your fight against the invaders.</string>
<string name="92896">The dog tells you of a magnificent bitch that he met sometime in the past. She died in the invasion, filling the dog with great sorrow.</string>
<string name="92897">The dog wonders if you plan on killing all the invaders yourself, or if you could be kind enough to just wound a few for it to finish off.</string>
<string name="92898">The dog is enjoying the invasion very much, since its master now allows it to bite people.</string>
<string name="92899">The dog tells you that duergar meat tastes like chicken. Really tough, stringy chicken.</string>
<string name="92900">The dog tells you about all the dark invaders it has helped kill.</string>
<string name="92901">&quot;Hello dog.&quot;</string>
<string name="92902">Diddelysquat.</string>
<string name="92903">&quot;I wish I could go with you, but I suppose I&apos;m needed here. Best of luck.&quot;</string>
<string name="92904">&quot;I could do just as well as you, I&apos;ll bet. If only they&apos;d give me a chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="92905">&quot;Perhaps you really are the hero everyone says you are. Good luck, you&apos;ll need it.&quot;</string>
<string name="92906">&quot;You fought very bravely. You obviously have the skills Durnan has been waiting for. Good luck.&quot;</string>
<string name="92907">&quot;Get going. Durnan&apos;s waiting for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="92908">&quot;Durnan asked for your help. You&apos;d better get moving.&quot;</string>
<string name="92909">The guard just shakes his head and motions towards the well room.</string>
<string name="92910">&quot;I don&apos;t know why Durnan called for your assistance instead of mine, but you&apos;d better get down there now.&quot;</string>
<string name="92911">&quot;Durnan has been organizing things and should be ready to explain his plan very soon.&quot;</string>
<string name="92912">The small, fairy-like creature darts toward you and then away again in surprise. It seems to be both fascinated and frightened by you at the same time.</string>
<string name="92913">&quot;Who are you? You don&apos;t work for the ogre, do you? Oh, I so hope not!&quot;</string>
<string name="92914">The small fairy zips back and forth, hesitantly. &quot;Oooo, if only I could believe you! Maybe you here to kill the fairy queen! That would be bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="92915">&quot;Ooohhh,&quot; the fairy cries, flittering about, &quot;the fairy queen told me I was supposed to look out for new people like you, and here you are!&quot;</string>
<string name="92916">&quot;But I forget what I was supposed to do when I see you! How awful! How terrible! I don&apos;t like Undermountain! It is dark and scary and gloomy!&quot;</string>
<string name="92917">&quot;Eeek! You do work for the ogre, you do!!&quot;</string>
<string name="92918">&quot;You want me to leave? But... what if that isn&apos;t what the fairy queen wanted me to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="92919">The fairy wavers for a moment, then apparently comes to a decision. &quot;I&apos;ll go ask the fairy queen what I&apos;m to do, then! That&apos;s it! That&apos;s what I&apos;ll do!&quot; Without another word, she flies off.</string>
<string name="92920">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;No you don&apos;t! I... I would have seen you! That&apos;s right! I would have seen you! Why would you say such a thing?!&quot;</string>
<string name="92921">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You do?&quot; She bobs uncertainly. &quot;But I&apos;ve never seen you before. But if you say you do...&quot;</string>
<string name="92922">The fairy flutters about excitedly. &quot;Okay, I will go! But you must remember to watch for the ogre mage and his minions! They will destroy us all unless we fight them!&quot;</string>
<string name="92923">&quot;Okay!&quot; She starts to dart away, but suddenly stops. &quot;Wait! If... if you work for the fairy queen, how do you not know where she is?&quot;</string>
<string name="92924">Suddenly horror registers on her tiny face. &quot;No, no! This is not good! You *do* work for the ogre mage, you do! You will try to hurt me!!&quot;</string>
<string name="92925">The fairy settles on a nearby stone. &quot;You have questions? What sorts of questions? Are they hard questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="92926">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The fairy settles on a nearby stone. &quot;You have questions? What sorts of questions? Are they hard questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="92927">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I can answer questions, if they are not hard... but wait! No, no! The fairy queen would not want me telling things to someone who works for the ogre mage!&quot;</string>
<string name="92928">She zips about with sudden fear and excitement. &quot;And you *do* work for the ogre mage, don&apos;t you?! Oh, the fairy queen will be so angry with me, so angry! I&apos;ve got to get away before you hurt me!!&quot;</string>
<string name="92929">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The fairy settles on a nearby stone. &quot;You have questions? What sorts of questions? Are they hard questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="92930">&quot;Because he wants to rule this level. He will kill the fairy queen and anyone who tries to stop him. Plus he is very mean and smelly, or so the fairy queen says.&quot;</string>
<string name="92931">&quot;Fighting was never allowed before, but now it is and there is fighting all the time. I wish things went back to how they were.&quot;</string>
<string name="92932">She shrugs. &quot;I don&apos;t know. That is what everyone says. There was a time when fighting was stopped, but not anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="92933">The fairy looks at you quizzically. &quot;How do you not know of her? She has gathered all of us together to fight against the ogre and his smelly minions.&quot;</string>
<string name="92934">&quot;Why we must fight now and never before, I do not know, but the fairy queen says it must be so.&quot;</string>
<string name="92935">&quot;A group of what?&quot; She thinks for a moment and then shakes her head. &quot;I haven&apos;t seen anyone. But I just came here not long before you arrived.&quot;</string>
<string name="92936">The fairy ponders for a long moment. &quot;The fairy queen and the ogre mage started fighting. They never did that before.&quot;</string>
<string name="92937">&quot;I don&apos;t know. The fairy queen says the ogre wants to rule everything, but she won&apos;t let him.&quot;</string>
<string name="92938">&quot;I was brought here by magic. All of us who come to Undermountain were, and we can never leave. Is that not how you come here?&quot;</string>
<string name="92939">&quot;You are very strange. I do not think I have seen a creature like you before.&quot;</string>
<string name="92940">The fairy bobs up and down, pleased. &quot;Good luck to you, then, strange creature! Don&apos;t let the smelly ogre hurt you!&quot;</string>
<string name="92941">&quot;Okay!&quot;</string>
<string name="92942">She shrugs. &quot;I don&apos;t know. The fairy queen says that none of us can leave, and none of the teleporters work for us, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="92943">&quot;There are places all over Undermountain that bring you from one place to the other. They do not work for us. Lately other things have been coming through them, however.&quot;</string>
<string name="92944">&quot;Terrible things! Things with many eyes and evil things with dark skin. They kill you if they see you, so we all avoid them.&quot;</string>
<string name="92945">&quot;I do not know why they come. And they always go. The fairy queen said they come from somewhere else in Undermountain, but I do not know where.&quot;</string>
<string name="92946">&quot;No. But the fairy queen might.&quot;</string>
<string name="92947">The fairy shrugs. &quot;I mean the fairy queen and the ogre mage and all the monsters who come here.&quot;</string>
<string name="92948">&quot;It changes all the time. Or it used to. Now we have fairies like me and harpies and other smaller things that help the fairy queen.&quot;</string>
<string name="92949">&quot;The ogre mage, he has goblins and trolls and big nasty creatures. They are very mean and smelly.&quot;</string>
<string name="92950">&quot;I&apos;ve never met anyone who didn&apos;t come here by magic. Does that mean you can leave, as well? How wonderful that must be!&quot;</string>
<string name="92951">&quot;Then I would fly away!&quot; The fairy zips away briefly and then flies back, nervous. &quot;But... you not look like monster. You not want to kill fairy queen, do you?&quot;</string>
<string name="92952">The fairy flies around you nervously. &quot;I talk about the big, mean ogre mage! He tries to kill the fairy queen! He tries to rule everything! How you not know that?&quot;</string>
<string name="92953">The fairy bobs hesitantly. &quot;This? This only be one very, very small part of Undermountain. Undermountain goes very, very deep down into the ground!&quot;</string>
<string name="92954">&quot;My name is &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I don&apos;t work for anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="92955">&quot;Then let me put you out of your misery.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Kill her.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="92956">&quot;Just leave me alone. I don&apos;t need any annoyances flying about.&quot;</string>
<string name="92957">&quot;You had your chance to leave. Now I swat you!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Kill her.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="92958">&quot;I don&apos;t care what the fairy queen wants. Just go.&quot;</string>
<string name="92959">&quot;How about you take me to the fairy queen, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="92960">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Fine, if you want to stay, how about you answer some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="92961">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff - Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;But I work for the fairy queen, too!&quot;</string>
<string name="92962">&quot;Now run along and leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="92963">&quot;Now Take me to the fairy queen.&quot;</string>
<string name="92964">&quot;Now answer my questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="92965">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Stand still and answer my questions! You&apos;re not making any sense!&quot;</string>
<string name="92966">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Calm down. I just want to ask a few questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="92967">&quot;Never mind. just leave me alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="92968">&quot;Why are you frightened of this ogre?&quot;</string>
<string name="92969">&quot;What do you mean &apos;fighting was not allowed&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="92970">&quot;Tell me what you know about this fairy queen.&quot;</string>
<string name="92971">&quot;Did you see a group of adventurers come running through here?&quot;</string>
<string name="92972">&quot;Has anything changed in Undermountain recently?&quot;</string>
<string name="92973">&quot;Why did they start fighting?&quot;</string>
<string name="92974">&quot;Tell me what you know about Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="92975">&quot;I&apos;m through with questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="92976">&quot;I can&apos;t afford having you tell anyone about me. Sorry.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Kill her.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="92977">&quot;Thank you. You&apos;ve been very helpful.&quot;</string>
<string name="92978">&quot;Just begone and leave me alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="92979">&quot;Let me ask something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="92980">&quot;Why is it you can&apos;t leave?&quot;</string>
<string name="92981">&quot;The teleporters?&quot;</string>
<string name="92982">&quot;Other things, what sorts of things?&quot;</string>
<string name="92983">&quot;Do you know who made the magic that brought you here?&quot;</string>
<string name="92984">&quot;When you say &apos;all of us&apos;, what do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="92985">&quot;And what sorts of monsters are those?&quot;</string>
<string name="92986">&quot;Not by magic, no.&quot;</string>
<string name="92987">&quot;And if I did work for the ogre? What would you do?&quot;</string>
<string name="92988">&quot;What ogre are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="92989">&quot;This is Undermountain? All of this?&quot;</string>
<string name="92990">The guard wrinkles his forehead in concentration as he recognizes you. &quot;You back. What you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="92991">&quot;That be me shield! Oh, you good, good &lt;man/woman&gt;! You be best person in world!&quot;</string>
<string name="92992">&quot;If only me had gold for me get arm fixed. But me doesn&apos;t. Me only has 50 gold, which means maybe in couple of years.&quot;</string>

<string name="93062">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Me hear customer say you lose it &apos;cause you be coward.&quot; </string>
<string name="93063">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I heard some customers say you lost it because you&apos;re a coward.&quot;</string>
<string name="93064">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Me want be you friend. Please tell me.&quot; </string>
<string name="93065">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;d like to be your friend. Please tell me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93066">&quot;Me no need you life story. Hurry up.&quot; </string>
<string name="93067">&quot;I don&apos;t need your life story. Hurry up.&quot;</string>
<string name="93068">&quot;What girl that be?&quot; </string>
<string name="93069">&quot;What girl is that?&quot;</string>
<string name="93070">&quot;That still no tell me where you arm go.&quot; </string>
<string name="93071">&quot;That still doesn&apos;t tell me how you lost your arm.&quot;</string>
<string name="93072">&quot;Go on.&quot;</string>
<string name="93073">&quot;At least you survive.&quot; </string>
<string name="93074">&quot;At least you survived.&quot;</string>
<string name="93075">&quot;So how you end up here?&quot; </string>
<string name="93076">&quot;So how did you end up working here?&quot;</string>
<string name="93077">&quot;Me think me no allowed.&quot; </string>
<string name="93078">&quot;I thought I wasn&apos;t allowed.&quot; </string>
<string name="93079">&quot;Yes, please.&quot;</string>
<string name="93080">&quot;Me allowed to leave.&quot; </string>
<string name="93081">&quot;I&apos;m allowed to leave.&quot;</string>
<string name="93082">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Durnan be me friend; him no mind.&quot; </string>
<string name="93083">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Durnan&apos;s my friend; he won&apos;t mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="93084">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You let me out, or me tell Durnan you forget what him tell you &apos;bout me.&quot; </string>
<string name="93085">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You let me out, or I&apos;ll tell Durnan you forgot his instructions.&quot;</string>
<string name="93086">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You forget. No worry, me no tell nobody you forget.&quot; </string>
<string name="93087">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Bluff]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You must have forgotten. Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t tell anybody you forgot.&quot;</string>
<string name="93088">An emaciated goblin slinks out from the shadows. He approaches you warily, ready to flee at the first hint of danger.</string>
<string name="93089">&quot;No, no, no! Please, I beg, I beg! Spare me, spare this worthless creature! Grovel&apos;s not strong like the ogres, or quick like the fairies. But I&apos;m ever so smart... let me help you. Please.&quot;</string>
<string name="93090">&quot;You&apos;ll have to catch me first!&quot;</string>
<string name="93091">&quot;Yes, that&apos;s good. Good, good, good. Everyone else down here is mad, fighting and killing. But not you. No, no, no.&quot;</string>
<string name="93092">&quot;Maybe you want to talk, yes? Talking is what I&apos;m good at. Not fighting, not magic, but information is what Grovel&apos;s good at. You have questions, Grovel will help you. Better than fighting, yes?&quot; </string>
<string name="93093">&quot;Wait, wait, wait. Grovel wants out of the dungeon. Too much fighting, too much killing. You can help, yes? Maybe? Yes? You can help Grovel escape.&quot;</string>
<string name="93094">&quot;No! No, no, no! They&apos;ll find Grovel! They&apos;ll punish him! Kill him, even! Grovel has to hide. Can&apos;t let them find me!&quot;</string>
<string name="93095">&quot;Yes, yes, yes! Pull Grovel up the well. Send me where it&apos;s safe. Away from here. Please. Thank you. Hurry.&quot;</string>
<string name="93096">You give a tug on the chain and Grovel is hoisted up the well. Hopefully Durnan gives him a chance to explain that you sent him before anyone does something rash.</string>
<string name="93097">&quot;Yes. Good, good, good. Grovel very busy here. Clean and tidy, tidy and clean. That&apos;s good. Very good. Yes, yes, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="93098">&quot;Yes, ogres to the north, fairies to the south. Armies of the Ogre mage and the Fairy Queen, fighting for control. Both think they should be the one in charge now that Halaster&apos;s gone.&quot;</string>
<string name="93099">&quot;Undermountain&apos;s always changing. Halaster doesn&apos;t leave it the same for long. Walls shift, doors move. Brings monsters in, pops monsters out. He&apos;s mad. Mad, mad, mad. Always playing games.&quot;</string>
<string name="93100">&quot;But Grovel knows to be careful. Watch for traps. Play nice with others, stay out of the way, stay small and hidden. Not so bad, before. But now Halaster&apos;s gone, and things are bad. Very bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="93101">&quot;Halaster&apos;s gone. Don&apos;t know where, no, no, no. But he&apos;s gone, yes, yes, yes. That&apos;s why the creatures in Undermountain are fighting. Halaster made us play nice, but now he&apos;s gone.&quot;</string>
<string name="93102">&quot;Now everyone is free to fight and kill - stupid creatures. But with no Halaster to keep us here, we are free to escape, if we survive. Like Grovel, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="93103">&quot;Grovel doesn&apos;t know much else. Only that Halaster is gone, and Undermountain is more dangerous than ever. Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Everyone fighting for power, fighting for control, fighting to escape.&quot;</string>
<string name="93104">&quot;I&apos;m Grovel... nobody important. Not now. Grovel used to be advisor to King Bloodtooth, long ago. Back before Grovel came to Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="93105">&quot;We come like all the others... Halaster brought us. Nobody knows why. No, no, no. One second King Bloodtooth sitting on his throne, then poof... we all here in Undermountain. The whole tribe.&quot;</string>
<string name="93106">&quot;Halaster does things like that. Crazy in the head, yes? Oh yes, yes, yes. But we not know that back then. Grovel only learned that stuff later.&quot;</string>
<string name="93107">&quot;Bloodtooth says we should fight our way out, and tribe agrees. They not smart like Grovel. Grovel knows you don&apos;t fight other creatures in Undermountain. You don&apos;t make Halaster mad.&quot; </string>
<string name="93108">&quot;But Bloodtooth never listens. They try to fight their way out, and now only Grovel is left. Goblins in Undermountain are nothing but food for the others - even Bloodtooth. Yes, yes, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="93109">&quot;But Grovel&apos;s still alive. Not strong, but smart. Hide. Watch. Wait for a chance, yes? Maybe. With Halaster gone, maybe now is a good time to escape, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="93110">He glances up and gives you a lop-sided grin. &quot;Hello, hello, hello. Grovel&apos;s very busy, but never too busy for you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You need something, maybe? Yes, yes, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="93111">&quot;Questions? Questions about Undermountain, yes? Where fairies and ogres tear each others throats? Grovel knows about Undermountain. Yes, yes, yes.&quot;</string>
<string name="93112">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;? Good. Maybe you can shed some light on this. I was standing watch at the well when I got the signal to pull you up. You can imagine my surprise when I saw this... this goblin.&quot;</string>
<string name="93113">&quot;At first I thought it was another invasion, but he started begging and pleading for his life, so I didn&apos;t have the heart to kill him. One unarmed goblin isn&apos;t much of a threat, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="93114">&quot;He claims you sent him to us, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Is this true?&quot;</string>
<string name="93115">&quot;I thought as much. Take this goblin away to the prisons. He probably has information about Undermountain we can use. The interrogators will know how to get it out of him.&quot;</string>
<string name="93116">Grovel lets out a shriek and races for the well. &quot;No, no, no! Not torture! Grovel won&apos;t go to prison!&quot;</string>
<string name="93117">&quot;What did you expect me to do with him, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Turn him loose? He may be harmless to you, but he could still cause a lot of trouble for the average person on the street.&quot;</string>
<string name="93118">&quot;And even if he means no harm, people aren&apos;t going to take to his kind. Not with things the way they are. Wherever he goes, people are going to try and hunt him down.&quot;</string>
<string name="93119">&quot;Looks like we don&apos;t have any other choice but to take him to the city prisons, then. Let them deal with him.&quot;</string>
<string name="93120">The goblin lets out a nervous yelp. &quot;Wait, wait, wait. Grovel has better idea. Why not let him work here, yes? I not cause trouble - not with so many guards and swords around.&quot;</string>
<string name="93121">Durnan scratches his chin. &quot;I don&apos;t know. What do you think, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Can I trust him?&quot;</string>
<string name="93122">&quot;Yes, yes, yes. Grovel works hard, follows instructions. You&apos;ll see. Grovel makes you very happy. Just say the word, and Grovel jumps to action.&quot; </string>
<string name="93123">&quot;Well, with so many people crammed into the inn, it&apos;s hard to keep things clean. I guess I could use someone to tidy up a bit. But no funny business, goblin: I&apos;m keeping an eye on you!&quot;</string>
<string name="93124">&quot;Thank you, thank you. Yes, yes, yes. Grovel gets started right away. Spic and span, clean as clean can be. You see.&quot; </string>
<string name="93125">Durnan shakes his head as the goblin earnestly begins picking up small bits of dust from the floor. &quot;Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn&apos;t get into any mischief.&quot;</string>
<string name="93126">&quot;Time to die, goblin!&quot;</string>
<string name="93127">&quot;Sorry, it&apos;s killin&apos; time!</string>
<string name="93128">&quot;I might let you live... if you can give me useful information.&quot;</string>
<string name="93129">&quot;I serve only myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="93130">&quot;I work for the city of Waterdeep!&quot;</string>
<string name="93131">&quot;Enough yapping. I&apos;m in the mood for a goblin-ka-bob!&quot;</string>
<string name="93132">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="93133">&quot;The only escape from here is death - and I&apos;ll be happy to help!&quot;</string>
<string name="93134">&quot;Forget it. You can stay in here and rot for all I care.&quot;</string>
<string name="93135">&quot;I suppose I could get Durnan to pull you up the well.&quot;</string>
<string name="93136">&quot;Tell Durnan &lt;FullName&gt; sent you up.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;Pull the chain.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="93137">&quot;You mentioned ogres and fairies?&quot;</string>
<string name="93138">&quot;What do you know about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="93139">&quot;Halaster&apos;s gone? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="93140">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93141">&quot;How did you come to Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="93142">&quot;What happened to the rest of your tribe?&quot;</string>
<string name="93143">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="93144">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="93145">&quot;I sent him up here so you could capture and interrogate him.&quot;</string>
<string name="93146">&quot;I&apos;ve never seen this creature before in my life.&quot;</string>
<string name="93147">&quot;Yes. He wanted to escape Undermountain. I think he&apos;s harmless.&quot;</string>
<string name="93148">&quot;Just send him to the prisons. That should solve all our problems.&quot;</string>
<string name="93149">&quot;I guess I never thought of that.&quot;</string>
<string name="93150">&quot;Open your eyes, Durnan! He&apos;s obviously a spy!&quot;</string>
<string name="93151">&quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s any threat. Might as well put him to work.&quot;</string>
<string name="93152">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Insight]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Put him to work at your inn so you can keep an eye on him.&quot;</string>
<string name="93153">Do you wish to descend into the black depths of the well?</string>
<string name="93154">No.</string>
<string name="93155">Yes.</string>
<string name="93156">The elven cleric brushes herself off slowly, rubbing her head. She seems a little confused as she casts about, looking for something to help her get her bearings.</string>
<string name="93157">Her eyes grow wide in surprise at your sharp words. After a second she composes herself and says coldly, &quot;I see. Very well, ask your questions and I will do my best to answer them.&quot;</string>
<string name="93158">Linu studies you for a few seconds before her face lights up in recognition.&quot;You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, aren&apos;t you dear? The one Durnan was waiting for. I&apos;m Linu La&apos;neral, priestess of Sehanine Moonbow.&quot;</string>
<string name="93159">Linu&apos;s face furls in concentration as she struggles to recover her faded memories. &quot;Yes, of course. You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, aren&apos;t you dear? The one Durnan was waiting for.&quot;</string>
<string name="93160">&quot;Now I remember ... there was a beholder. We chased it from the tavern and then... then we were ambushed by drow! Sharwyn went down, Daelan charged off in one direction and Tomi and I ran in the other!&quot;</string>
<string name="93161">&quot;Tomi and I managed to escape the ambush, but in our escape we lost our bearings. We were trying to find our way back out when we stumbled across these slaves. At least, we thought they were slaves.&quot;</string>
<string name="93162">&quot;They asked us for help, so Tomi went off to spy on a nearby drow encampment and I stayed here to protect them. Of course, as soon as my back was turned they revealed what they really were.&quot;</string>
<string name="93163">&quot;I tried to call on the power of Sehanine to protect me from those shape-shifting Rakshasa but there were too many of them and they were too fast. I remember... I remember dying.&quot;</string>
<string name="93164">&quot;You raised me, didn&apos;t you, dear? Thank you. I know those words don&apos;t count for much, but I sincerely mean it: thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93165">&quot;I imagine there are more than a few people who will have need of my healing powers back at the inn. Don&apos;t worry, dear, I&apos;m confident I can make it back there on my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="93166">&quot;Goodbye, and good luck. Everyone is counting on you now, dear.&quot;</string>
<string name="93167">&quot;Are you certain that&apos;s what you want, dear? I have something of a reputation for being accident prone. Sometimes unfortunate things happen to those around me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93168">Linu&apos;s face lights up with a beaming smile. &quot;Yes, I imagine my skills could come in handy in a place like this. Lead on, dear, and I&apos;ll be happy to follow.&quot;</string>
<string name="93169">She looks at your companions. &quot;It would appear you have more than enough help as it is, dear. And I imagine people back at Durnan&apos;s inn have need of my healing abilities.&quot;</string>
<string name="93170">&quot;Well, it&apos;s obvious I&apos;m not going to make it on my own if I stay down here. I suppose I should go back to Durnan&apos;s inn, at least for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="93171">&quot;What?? Why would you bring me back to life only to kill me again? What was the point?&quot;</string>
<string name="93172">She gives you long stare, then simply shakes her head. &quot;You have a very unusual sense of humor, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="93173">&quot;May Sehanine Moonbow protect me!&quot;</string>
<string name="93174">&quot;I&apos;ve given you my thanks already, and I don&apos;t have anything else. But really, that should be more than enough. A good deed is its own reward, after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="93175">&quot;There&apos;s not much I can tell you that you probably don&apos;t already know, dear. Obviously, the slaves weren&apos;t really slaves at all. If I had known that I wouldn&apos;t have been in the state you found me in.&quot;</string>
<string name="93176">&quot;There is one thing that might be useful. They mentioned an encampment of drow to the south. Tomi went off to scout it out. As soon as he was gone, the Rakshasa attacked me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93177">&quot;I don&apos;t know much else, unfortunately. When you&apos;re dead you tend to miss out on a lot.&quot;</string>
<string name="93178">&quot;It wouldn&apos;t have helped a bit. I tried to warn you about them slaves, but you wouldn&apos;t listen to me. Instead, you sent me off to meet an untimely end at the hands of them drow!&quot;</string>
<string name="93179">&quot;Yes, and now we&apos;re both alive and well, aren&apos;t we? So really, dear, I don&apos;t understand what you&apos;re complaining about.&quot;</string>
<string name="93180">&quot;I don&apos;t know what happened to Daelan or Sharwyn after the ambush. Tomi, however, was going off to investigate the drow encampment. I do hope nothing terrible has happened to him.&quot;</string>
<string name="93181">&quot;He was going to look for a magical stone to help the slaves escape this place. I mean the Rakshasa. I mean, the slaves who were really Rakshasa. Oh, you know what I mean, don&apos;t you, dear?&quot;</string>
<string name="93182">&quot;We were led to believe that the drow had a djinni bottle, and that inside the bottle was a stone that would allow the owner to use the portal in the other room to return to Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="93183">&quot;Of course, as soon as Tomi was gone the Rakshasa unleashed their little surprise on me and... well, you know the rest.&quot;</string>
<string name="93184">&quot;Why are you asking her? She&apos;s been stuck inside a sarcophagus. She wouldn&apos;t know about anything that happened to them since the ambush!&quot;</string>
<string name="93185">&quot;Hopefully they&apos;ve made it back to Durnan&apos;s inn. That&apos;s where they&apos;ll go, if they&apos;re able.&quot;</string>
<string name="93186">&quot;The Rakshasa must have tried to hide me in there so they could continue their ruse. I can&apos;t believe I actually thought they were slaves and wanted to help them!&quot;</string>
<string name="93187">&quot;I told you there was something off about them, didn&apos;t I? But you wouldn&apos;t listen to old Tomi, oh no! You just kept going on and on about helping people and protecting the weak.&quot;</string>
<string name="93188">&quot;Guess it just goes to prove what I always say: no good deed goes unpunished.&quot;</string>
<string name="93189">&quot;What a horrible thing to say! I&apos;m not about to let one mistake change what I believe in, Tomi. I will still do everything I can to help those in need. I&apos;ll just have to be more careful in the future.&quot;</string>
<string name="93190">&quot;I see the Rakshasa are all dead now. Good. They were creatures of pure evil, and their very existence was an affront to everything I stand for. I suppose I should thank you for that, too, dear.&quot;</string>
<string name="93191">Linu recoils as if she&apos;s been slapped. &quot;I understand that this is a difficult situation, and we&apos;re all feeling more than a little stress. But there&apos;s no need to speak to me like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="93192">&quot;I accept your apology, dear. But I think the last thing we need right now is to be throwing harsh words at each other.&quot;</string>
<string name="93193">&quot;I don&apos;t know why you&apos;re speaking to me like this, but I won&apos;t stand for it!&quot;</string>
<string name="93194">Linu begins to walk off, but snags her heel on a stone causing her to take a tumble. With all the dignity she can muster, she rises to her feet again and marches off without a backward glance.</string>
<string name="93195">&quot;Just give her a sec. Comin&apos; back from the dead&apos;s a bit like waking up after a long night at yer favorite tavern. The heads a bit groggy, and you aren&apos;t sure where you are or who yer with.&quot;</string>
<string name="93196">&quot;I remember this one time I had a bit too much of the liquid pleasure, and I woke up to find this ogre-looking gal lyin&apos; beside me, snoring fierce enough like to scare a dragon.&quot;</string>
<string name="93197">&quot;I woulda&apos; made my escape right quick, but me hands were lashed to the bedpost. Not rightly sure how that happened. Anyway, I figure I may as well make the best of a bad situation, so I...&quot;</string>
<string name="93198">&quot;That&apos;s quite enough, Tomi dear. My memory is coming back to me now, and I don&apos;t think I need to hear this particular story of your exploits.&quot;</string>
<string name="93199">&quot;Linu it&apos;s me - Sharwyn. Do you know where you are?&quot;</string>
<string name="93200">&quot;Sharwyn? Yes... Sharwyn. I remember you, dear. It&apos;s... it&apos;s starting to come back to me now. The battle at Durnan&apos;s inn... I remember.&quot;</string>
<string name="93201">&quot;You seem to be doing much better than when I last saw you, dear. It&apos;s good to know you&apos;re safe and sound.&quot;</string>
<string name="93202">&quot;It&apos;s only thanks to &lt;FirstName&gt; here. &lt;He/She&gt; found me and raised me from the dead, just like we did with you. What happened to you, Linu?&quot;</string>
<string name="93203">&quot;Everything&apos;s still a bit hazy. Let me see... I remember you getting hit by an arrow and going down. And I remember Daelan let out a war cry and raced off down the corridor without a second thought.&quot;</string>
<string name="93204">&quot;Linu, are you okay? It&apos;s me, Daelan.&quot;</string>
<string name="93205">&quot;Daelan? Yes... Daelan. I remember now. We were... we were all chasing after that beholder when we were ambushed! It&apos;s good to see you safe and sound, dear.&quot;</string>
<string name="93206">&quot;Only because of &lt;FirstName&gt;. &lt;He/She&gt; found my body and raised me, just like you. What happened to you, Linu?&quot;</string>
<string name="93207">&quot;Everything&apos;s still a bit hazy. Let me see... I remember Sharwyn was hit by an arrow and went down, and you let out a war cry and raced off down the corridor without a second thought.&quot;</string>
<string name="93208">&quot;And then Tomi scampered off in the opposite direction. An army of Drow appeared out of nowhere, and I knew I had no chance against them alone. So I ran after Tomi.&quot;</string>
<string name="93209">&quot;Why did you go after Tomi? Why not follow me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93210">&quot;You&apos;re a mighty Uthgardt warrior, dear. Tomi&apos;s just a little guy. I figured he&apos;d need my help more than you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93211">&quot;I also thought it might be a good idea to keep a watchful eye on our resident rogue. It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t trust him, but sometimes he needs a little convincing to do the right thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="93212">&quot;Hey, the only person I need looking out for me is a resourceful fellow known as Tomi Undergallows, get it? Tomi looks after himself, and if you ask me he does a pretty decent job of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="93213">&quot;I also thought it might be a good idea to keep a watchful eye on our resident rogue. It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t trust you, Tomi dear, but sometimes you need a little convincing to do the right thing.&quot;</string>
<string name="93214">&quot;You mean you just left me there? How very heroic of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93215">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, dear, but I wouldn&apos;t have been much good to you if I was dead myself. Besides, I always intended to come back and raise you later.&quot;</string>
<string name="93216">&quot;That&apos;s okay, I guess. Still, I figured you would have followed Daelan rather than pair up with a rogue.&quot;</string>
<string name="93217">&quot;Daelan&apos;s a mighty Uthgardt warrior, dear. Tomi&apos;s just a little guy. I figured he&apos;d need my help more than the half-orc.&quot;</string>
<string name="93218">Linu notices your approach, and her face lights up. As she gives you a warm wave, it&apos;s obvious she is suffering no ill effects from her trauma in the dungeon.</string>
<string name="93219">&quot;I&apos;m glad to hear it. I hope you don&apos;t mind if I tell people here how well you&apos;re doing, dear. They could use some good news to lift their spirits.&quot;</string>
<string name="93220">&quot;I thought you&apos;d never ask, dear! It will be a pleasure to serve at your side. And by the grace of Sehanine Moonbow, we will not fail!&quot;</string>
<string name="93221">&quot;I don&apos;t know, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You seem to have plenty of help already, and I don&apos;t want to get in the way. Besides, these people here need me, too.&quot; </string>
<string name="93222">&quot;They&apos;re scared and hurt, and I can offer them comfort. Anyway, I know I don&apos;t have to worry about you, dear. You and your companions can look after yourselves just fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="93223">The elven cleric watches you with guarded suspicion. It&apos;s obvious she isn&apos;t looking forward to another conversation with you.</string>
<string name="93224">For a brief second Linu appears to be about to respond to your insult, but instead she holds her tongue and curtly turns away from you, ending the conversation.</string>
<string name="93225">&quot;Hmph! There was a moment after you rescued me when I thought you were both noble and heroic. I see now how wrong those assumptions were. Good&lt;day/night&gt; to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="93226">&quot;No, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I do not. You have an evil streak in you. You aren&apos;t the first &lt;race&gt; adventurer I&apos;ve ever met, but you are certainly the cruelest.&quot;</string>
<string name="93227">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Linu&apos;s face scrunches up into a sour grimace. &quot;Normally I&apos;m not one to hold grudges, but I cannot simply forget everything you said to me, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="93228">&quot;You did save my life, and I&apos;m grateful. But I was deeply hurt by your words. I&apos;m sorry, but I cannot forgive you. Not yet, at least. Maybe... maybe in time.&quot;</string>
<string name="93229">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; Linu&apos;s face breaks into a relieved smile. &quot;You have no idea how glad I am to hear that!&quot;</string>
<string name="93230">&quot;I was hoping your words were just a reaction to the difficult situation we were in. I was shocked by those things you said to me. It&apos;s such a relief to find out you didn&apos;t mean them after all.&quot;</string>
<string name="93231">&quot;Yes, of course. Goodbye, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And good luck. We&apos;re all counting on you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93232">&quot;Quiet. I&apos;m the one who asks the questions here!&quot;</string>
<string name="93233">&quot;You were dead. I just raised you. Can you remember anything?&quot;</string>
<string name="93234">&quot;I&apos;m &lt;FirstName&gt;. I saw you in the tavern with Durnan.&quot;</string>
<string name="93235">&quot;You don&apos;t remember me? I spoke to your group at the tavern.&quot;</string>
<string name="93236">&quot;You don&apos;t remember me? We spoke at the tavern.&quot;</string>
<string name="93237">&quot;Then what happened?&quot;</string>
<string name="93238">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="93239">&quot;How about you join me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93240">&quot;That&apos;s a good point. I&apos;m probably safer without you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93241">&quot;I&apos;m willing to risk it. I could use a good healer.&quot;</string>
<string name="93242">&quot;What are you going to do now?&quot;</string>
<string name="93243">&quot;That&apos;s probably for the best.&quot;</string>
<string name="93244">&quot;Enough chit-chat. I think I&apos;ll just kill you now.&quot;</string>
<string name="93245">&quot;Just kidding. Head on back to the inn.&quot;</string>
<string name="93246">&quot;I just want the satisfaction of killing you myself.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Kill him.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="93247">&quot;This is all the thanks I get for bringing you back to life?&quot;</string>
<string name="93248">&quot;I guess you&apos;re right. I don&apos;t need a reward.&quot;</string>
<string name="93249">&quot;Not good enough. Guess I have to kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93250">&quot;Why don&apos;t you come with me, instead?&quot;</string>
<string name="93251">&quot;Is there anything you can tell me about this area?&quot;</string>
<string name="93252">&quot;Do you know where your other companions are?&quot;</string>
<string name="93253">&quot;How did you end up stuffed inside that sarcophagus?&quot;</string>
<string name="93254">&quot;You&apos;re pathetic. I should have just left you for dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="93255">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I guess this whole situation is just getting to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93256">&quot;Go back to the inn and find a corner to pray in. That&apos;s the only place someone as hopeless as you can be of any use.&quot;</string>
<string name="93257">&quot;As well as can be expected.&quot;</string>
<string name="93258">&quot;I could use some help. Maybe you could join up with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93259">&quot;Get back to your prayers. You&apos;ve already proved you aren&apos;t good for much else.&quot;</string>
<string name="93260">&quot;Yeah, nobody had to come drag my sorry carcass out of there.&quot;</string>
<string name="93261">&quot;You don&apos;t like me much, do you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93262">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I&apos;m sorry about what I said to you before. I didn&apos;t mean it.&quot;</string>
<string name="93263">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="93264">The beauty of this woman at her peak must have been something to behold, because age certainly doesn&apos;t seem to have had much effect on her.</string>
<string name="93265">&quot;Ah, you must be &lt;FirstName&gt;. Durnan told me you would be coming to help out our poor city. I would welcome you to my House of Pleasures, but I am sorry to tell you, we are closed for business&quot;</string>
<string name="93266">&quot;That the City of Splendors should come to such a state as this is almost unthinkable. But my manners are lacking, how can this poor house of refuge assist you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93267">&quot;Come back when this war is over and my people will explore the mysteries of the night with you at no cost, should you prove to be the hero I hope you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="93268">&quot;I will help you in any way I can. I have nothing pressing right now; other than comforting this group of refugees.&quot;</string>
<string name="93269">&quot;All right. I had better get back to work. I need to see if I can make room for a few more families.&quot;</string>
<string name="93270">&quot;I don&apos;t know who has remained open. Most stores are closed, but you might want to try Argali&apos;s Arms. She&apos;s a brave, if obnoxious woman, and she might just have dared to remain open.&quot;</string>
<string name="93271">&quot;I haven&apos;t seen any merchants in this part of the city, which is why it costs so much for me to get enough supplies for these people here.&quot;</string>
<string name="93272">&quot;No, we have our own guards and have been lucky so far. Most of the people in here have seen some of the fighting though.&quot;</string>
<string name="93273">&quot;These poor folk residing here have lost everything and needed somewhere to stay. I have some experience with being an orphan so I felt I had a duty.&quot;</string>
<string name="93274">&quot;Of course I never realized just how expensive feeding and clothing this many people could be. I do not know how they made ends meet at the Kettlesmith Orphanage.&quot;</string>
<string name="93275">&quot;The only thing that could help me right now is gold to buy food and clothes for these poor souls.&quot;</string>
<string name="93276">&quot;You cold-hearted, villainous &lt;bitch/bastard&gt;! Here I talk about how I can&apos;t afford to feed these helpless souls and you want to steal my gold?&quot;</string>
<string name="93277">&quot;Don&apos;t be a fool. What kind of reputation in Waterdeep are you looking for? If people know you as a hero, doors of opportunity will open. Rob from the poor and you will be despised.&quot;</string>
<string name="93278">&quot;I am not amused. It was not a funny joke. Is there anything else you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="93279">&quot;All I have is the 30 gold I was going to use to buy food for the innocents. Take it and be gone with you. Darken my door no more.&quot;</string>
<string name="93280">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Sigh]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;That&apos;s all right. I really didn&apos;t expect anything. Is there anything else I can do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93281">&quot;Dear me, but you are a sweet &lt;man/woman&gt;. With that kind of assistance I can probably accept a few more innocents into my refuge.&quot;</string>
<string name="93282">&quot;We shall remember your name in Waterdeep, so long as I have breath to tell people of your generosity. Oh, and if you get in to see Argali ask about her special equipment.&quot;</string>
<string name="93283">&quot;And if she shows you an emerald, remember that it is seriously flawed. Is there anything else I can do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93284">&quot;That is awfully kind of you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope someday you will return and I can pay you back in kind. Perhaps a night of pleasures on the house.&quot;</string>
<string name="93285">&quot;Or just some gentle conversation and good food, if that is more to your liking. Oh, I should tell you, if Argali&apos;s Arms is open, you should ask Argali if she has any special equipment.&quot;</string>
<string name="93286">&quot;I know she sometimes has something extra hidden from her regular inventory. Is there anything else I can do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93287">&quot;I guess anything helps. Thanks. I&apos;ll have to see if other adventurers have something to give.&quot;</string>
<string name="93288">&quot;That was one of the better places I lived, yes. My first adopted family worked me hard and nearly starved me to death.&quot;</string>
<string name="93289">&quot;Then a guard caught my &apos;father&apos; in a slave trade and I returned to the orphanage. I was so skinny and sickly looking that no one else wanted to adopt me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93290">&quot;Life wasn&apos;t so bad at the orphanage, once I was old enough to trade favors with the staff. A little sexual offer can take you far, if you learn how to use it properly.&quot;</string>
<string name="93291">&quot;That is a brusque way to put it, but suppose it&apos;s an apt description.&quot;</string>
<string name="93292">&quot;With the extra food and clothes I earned, I was able to fix myself up and find a career that has been as fulfilling as I ever dreamed.&quot;</string>
<string name="93293">&quot;There was nowhere for a young girl to go that was not worse than what I was experiencing. The streets are not safe for a lonely girl.&quot;</string>
<string name="93294">&quot;I did indeed. With the extra food and clothes I earned, I was able to fix myself up and find a career that has been as fulfilling as anything else I have experienced.&quot;</string>
<string name="93295">&quot;I was as old as many girls are when they get married. What would you have done? Asked the temples for help? Prayed for deliverance?&quot;</string>
<string name="93296">&quot;Do you not think I tried that? The temples sent me right back to the orphanage and told the headmaster to keep a better leash on his pets. And the gods? They must not have been listening.&quot;</string>
<string name="93297">&quot;I used what I had to survive. These refugees: they will get better treatment from me. If I can afford it, they shall stay here in safety until the war is over.&quot;</string>
<string name="93298">&quot;Come back when this war is over and my people will explore the mysteries of the night with you at no cost, should you prove to be the hero I hope you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="93299">&quot;I will do my best to help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93300">&quot;I am Mother Salinka, usually the madam of this house, now patroness of the displaced. I fear that if you came to explore the mysteries of the night, you are sadly out of luck.&quot;</string>
<string name="93301">&quot;My most skilled people have either fled the city or are helping me here. When the war is over, we shall return to business as usual. Is there anything else I can assist you with?&quot;</string>
<string name="93302">&quot;You even have the look of one I might have explored the mysteries with in person, but that will have to wait. Is there anything else I can assist you with?&quot;</string>
<string name="93303">You see Mother Salinka eyeing one of the orphaned children with a sad, caring look. </string>
<string name="93304">&quot;I see you have returned. How may I help you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93305">Mother Salinka&apos;s eyes flash with anger. &quot;I said I never wanted to speak to you again and I meant it.&quot;</string>
<string name="93306">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="93307">&quot;Me asks you questions?&quot; </string>
<string name="93308">&quot;May I ask you some questions?&quot;</string>
<string name="93309">&quot;Me not have more questions.&quot; </string>
<string name="93310">&quot;I don&apos;t have any more questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="93311">&quot;You know where me get equipment?&quot; </string>
<string name="93312">&quot;Do you know where I could get some equipment?&quot;</string>
<string name="93313">&quot;You get attack in here?&apos; </string>
<string name="93314">&quot;Have you been attacked in here?&quot;</string>
<string name="93315">&quot;Why all these people be here?&quot; </string>
<string name="93316">&quot;Why are all these people in here?&quot;</string>
<string name="93317">&quot;Could me help you, maybe?&quot; </string>
<string name="93318">&quot;Could I help you somehow?&quot;</string>
<string name="93319">&quot;Gold help me too. You give me gold or goodbye widows and orphans.&quot; </string>
<string name="93320">&quot;Gold would help me as well. You don&apos;t want anything to happen to these poor widows and orphans?&quot;</string>
<string name="93321">&quot;It only a joke. Calm yourself.&quot; </string>
<string name="93322">&quot;It was only a joke. Relax.&quot;</string>
<string name="93323">&quot;Me no care. Give me you gold.&quot; </string>
<string name="93324">&quot;I don&apos;t care. Give me your gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="93325">&quot;Me guess me no help you then.&quot; </string>
<string name="93326">&quot;I guess I can&apos;t help you then.&quot;</string>
<string name="93327">&quot;Me could spare 200 gold.&quot; </string>
<string name="93328">&quot;I could spare 200 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="93329">&quot;100 gold help you?&quot; </string>
<string name="93330">&quot;How about 100 gold?&quot;</string>
<string name="93331">&quot;10 gold help?&quot; </string>
<string name="93332">&quot;Would 10 gold help.&quot;</string>
<string name="93333">&quot;That where you grow up?&quot; </string>
<string name="93334">&quot;That was were you grew up?&quot;</string>
<string name="93335">&quot;Ha! Me guess you find calling in life at young age.&quot; </string>
<string name="93336">&quot;Ha! I guess you found your calling in life early.&quot;</string>
<string name="93337">&quot;Why you no run away?&quot; </string>
<string name="93338">&quot;Why didn&apos;t you just run away?&quot;</string>
<string name="93339">&quot;Me guess you do what you must to live.&quot; </string>
<string name="93340">&quot;I guess you do what you have to, to survive.&quot;</string>
<string name="93341">&quot;That be awful. How you do bad thing like that?&quot;</string>
<string name="93342">&quot;That is horrible! How could you do such things?&quot;</string>
<string name="93343">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="93344">&quot;Me gots more questions.&quot; </string>
<string name="93345">&quot;I have some more questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="93346">&quot;Who you be?&quot; </string>
<string name="93347">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93348">&quot;Me want help you with widows and orphans.&quot; </string>
<string name="93349">&quot;I would like to help you with the widows and orphans.&quot; </string>
<string name="93350">A quiet voice whispers, &quot;Pssst. Hey you. Give me a gold piece.&quot; It seems to be coming from the pedestal itself.</string>
<string name="93351">&quot;I wouldn&apos;t listen to him, if I were you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93352">&quot;Blast! That&apos;s so unfair!&quot;</string>
<string name="93353">&quot;I&apos;m just experimenting with something. You just should ignore the pedestal.&quot;</string>
<string name="93354">&quot;Ignore him. I&apos;ve got something special to show you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93355">The gold piece flies up from the pedestal and catches you in the side of the head, leaving a nasty welt.</string>
<string name="93356">&quot;I told you so. I&apos;m studying a bit of the dirt from one of the streets here in Waterdeep that is cursed. And the pedestal has a wicked sense of humor.&quot;</string>
<string name="93357">&quot;Hee hee hee.&quot;</string>
<string name="93358">&quot;Many years ago, one of the Lords of Waterdeep turned evil and betrayed his fellow lords. He killed three of them before his true colors were revealed.&quot;</string>
<string name="93359">&quot;At that time, there was a head lord, a very powerful mage. The two of them had a spectacular mage duel that raged right across the breadth of old Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="93360">&quot;In the end, the good lord won, and he cursed the ground where the evil lord fell, saying that none should put a stone to commemorate the evil mage.&quot;</string>
<string name="93361">&quot;Yes, indeed. Anyone who places non-living materials larger than a tiny pebble upon the dirt, finds the object flung back up at his head.&quot;</string>
<string name="93362">&quot;Anyone who places non-living materials larger than a tiny pebble upon the dirt, finds the object flung back up at his head.&quot;</string>
<string name="93363">&quot;I am experimenting with this dirt to see if it could somehow be mixed in with metal to create magical armor.&quot;</string>
<string name="93364">&quot;Unfortunately, the dirt seems to keep the metal from becoming attached and the whole process simply doesn&apos;t work.&quot;</string>
<string name="93365">&quot;That&apos;s &apos;cause you&apos;re a lousy mage!&quot;</string>
<string name="93366">&quot;One of these days I&apos;m going to get rid of that pedestal. Ah well, I&apos;d better get back to work.&quot;</string>
<string name="93367">&quot;Goodbye, &lt;FullName&gt;. And watch out for that pedestal.&quot;</string>
<string name="93368">&quot;Too many magical experiments using the same pedestal caused it to somehow gain a mind of its own.&quot;</string>
<string name="93369">&quot;It&apos;s a very crude and annoying mind, but what can you do? It&apos;s all part of the curse.&quot;</string>
<string name="93370">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Leave the pedestal alone.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="93371">&quot;Why not?&quot;</string>
<string name="93372">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Ignore Sobrey and put a gold piece on the pedestal.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="93373">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Leave the pedestal alone.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="93374">&quot;Tell me about this curse.&quot;</string>
<string name="93375">&quot;And this dirt is from there?&quot;</string>
<string name="93376">&quot;Go on.&quot;</string>
<string name="93377">&quot;The pedestal has a sense of humor?&quot;</string>
<string name="93378">&quot;No time to chat now. We have to save Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="93379">A shadow in the corner shifts, revealing itself to be Nathyrra, the drow you met you earlier. She looks about cautiously before fully emerging from her hiding place.</string>
<string name="93380">&quot;And so we meet again. You&apos;ll be pleased to know that your quest to rid Undermountain of the Valsharess&apos;s drow is nearly at its end.&quot;</string>
<string name="93381">&quot;The mad mage is being held just ahead, guarded by some of the Valsharess&apos;s most loyal and powerful servants. No doubt they&apos;ll attack us on sight.&quot;</string>
<string name="93382">She sighs in exasperation. &quot;I was hoping you would trust me by now. I&apos;m not your enemy: the Valsharess is.&quot;</string>
<string name="93383">She throws her head back and laughs. &quot;Ha-ha-ha! Me? The Valsharess? You are as mad as Halaster himself! If I was going to disguise myself, why would I disguise myself as a drow?&quot;</string>
<string name="93384">&quot;You want to end the threat to Undermountain, &lt;FirstName&gt;. So do I. The way to do that is to kill the drow in the next room so you can free Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="93385">&quot;Halaster is imprisoned in a magical globe powered by three energy stones. If the stones are destroyed, the mad mage will be free - and he&apos;ll likely help us dispose of any remaining drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="93386">&quot;You might be able to do this alone, but you&apos;ll have a better chance if I&apos;m fighting by your side. Now let&apos;s stop talking about it, and let&apos;s go save Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="93387">Nathyrra, the drow who approached you earlier, materializes from the darkness. &quot;We meet again. Somehow I knew we would.&quot;</string>
<string name="93388">The dark elf doesn&apos;t seem at all offended by your suspicion. In fact, she seems somewhat amused. &quot;Still not inclined to trust me? Maybe that will change with what I have to tell you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93389">She seems momentarily taken aback by your kind words. &quot;Uh... thank you. It&apos;s good to see you again, too. I... I have to warn you about something.&quot;</string>
<string name="93390">&quot;I&apos;ve been waiting for you here. I knew you&apos;d have to come this way eventually if you wanted to free Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="93391">&quot;I&apos;ve been scouting the area, and I came across a large encampment of the Valsharess&apos;s forces near here. If you take this bridge you&apos;ll be walking right into them.&quot;</string>
<string name="93392">&quot;As I told you earlier, I&apos;m not your enemy. I want to help you defeat the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="93393">She smiles. &quot;There&apos;s more. The drow have set up a pair of ballista on top of a ridge behind their camp. If you attack them head on they&apos;ll use the ballista to smash you to bits.&quot;</string>
<string name="93394">&quot;But there&apos;s a way you can sneak past the camp and get to the ballista unseen. Then you can use their own weapons against the rest of the camp, and rain death down on them from above!&quot; </string>
<string name="93395">&quot;Just follow the narrow corridor to the north. It seems to lead to a dead end, but there is actually a secret passage that will take you right to the ballista.&quot;</string>
<string name="93396">She shrugs. &quot;Do as you will. Attack them head on and be smashed by the ballista, or use the passage to the north and beat them at their own game. The choice is yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="93397">&quot;I have to go now, &lt;FirstName&gt;... unless there is something else?&quot;</string>
<string name="93398">A single drow female steps out from the shadows, her hands held up to show they are empty. She approaches you cautiously. &quot;Hold your weapons. I mean you no harm.&quot;</string>
<string name="93399">&quot;I understand your suspicion, but not all the drow are after your blood. Just listen to what I have to say, and it will all become clear.&quot;</string>
<string name="93400">She relaxes slightly; obviously she was as wary about this encounter as you were. &quot;My name is Nathyrra. You&apos;re the one they call &lt;FullName&gt;, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93401">She smiles slightly. &quot;I&apos;m afraid your reputation precedes you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know who you are. You&apos;ve become something of a legend among my people.&quot;</string>
<string name="93402">She smiles slightly. &quot;Your reputation precedes you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I know who you are. You&apos;re something of a legend among my people.&quot;</string>
<string name="93403">She furrows her brow, carefully considering her next words. &quot;Although I am a drow, I am not allied with those who are attacking Waterdeep. Me and my people are different. We are... rebels.&quot;</string>
<string name="93404">She frowns. &quot;My people are drow, but they are not like the ones who have invaded Undermountain and attack the surface. We are different. We are... rebels.&quot;</string>
<string name="93405">&quot;We want to help you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. We want to help you free Halaster so you can stop the forces of the Valsharess from attacking Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="93406">&quot;The Valsharess is the ruler of House Kilath, a faction from the drow that has recently risen to prominence. The drow invading Waterdeep serve the Valsharess and her house.&quot;</string>
<string name="93407">&quot;Her forces captured Halaster, giving them free access through Undermountain and allowing them to strike at the very heart of Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="93408">&quot;But not all the drow follow the Valsharess. There are some of us who oppose her, and will do whatever we can to break her power.&quot; </string>
<string name="93409">She nods. &quot;I can&apos;t blame you. The drow have a reputation for treachery, you would be foolish to blindly trust me. If it helps, you should know that I don&apos;t fully trust you yet, either.&quot;</string>
<string name="93410">&quot;We weren&apos;t certain we should even approach you, but in the end we thought you should know that there are others who want to see the attacks on Waterdeep ended.&quot;</string>
<string name="93411">&quot;At this point, I&apos;m only here to provide you information, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="93412">&quot;Goodbye, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And good luck. Maybe we&apos;ll meet again, sometime.&quot; With those words, Nathyrra disappears back into the shadows.</string>
<string name="93413">&quot;Before you go, there is some information you might find useful. To the southwest several drow overseers have captured a formian queen and enslaved her colony.&quot; </string>
<string name="93414">&quot;They are forcing the formians to dig through Undermountain itself, making it easier for the drow to move about the dungeon. If you free the queen, the colony will be in your debt.&quot; </string>
<string name="93415">&quot;The formians could help you against the drow here in Undermountain, and you would be wise to seek out whatever allies you can.&quot;</string>
<string name="93416">The drow shrugs. &quot;Seeking the aid of the formians is your choice. I am only telling you this as a show of good faith. Whether you use the information is up to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93417">&quot;The formians were working to the southwest of here. The drow have several guards watching over them, so be careful if you go back there.&quot;</string>
<string name="93418">&quot;The formians are a strange race of beings... not unexpected here in Undermountain. They resemble giant ants, but they are highly intelligent. At least, the queen is.&quot;</string>
<string name="93419">&quot;The drow have enslaved the entire colony by capturing the queen. If you save her, the entire colony will be in your debt.&quot;</string>
<string name="93420">&quot;Maybe not. But now at least you know the name of the enemy you face. Without our help you you might never have learned that the Valsharess was behind this.&quot;</string>
<string name="93421">&quot;Ask your questions and I&apos;ll do my best to answer them.&quot;</string>
<string name="93422">&quot;We&apos;re a group of rebels and outcasts. Some of us chose to leave the evil of drow society willingly, others were driven away or banished by misfortune and circumstance.&quot;</string>
<string name="93423">&quot;I... I don&apos;t think I should say anymore. Not yet. In any case, you should focus on rescuing Halaster. Once free, he&apos;ll drive the Valsharess&apos;s army out of Undermountain and back into the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="93424">&quot;We don&apos;t know much about her. She is the matron mother of House Kilath. They were once a weak house, beneath the notice of the more powerful factions.&quot;</string>
<string name="93425">&quot;No one paid any attention to plots of house Kilath. Maybe that&apos;s why they were able to rise to power so quickly. They went from nothing to the most powerful family in the city within weeks.&quot;</string>
<string name="93426">&quot;The Valsharess recruited the most powerful agents from the other houses to form the Red Sisters, a squad of assassins she uses to maintain her control over those who have now sworn allegiance to her.&quot; </string>
<string name="93427">&quot;To conquer it, of course. The drow houses hate those who dwell on the surface, the matron mothers would like nothing better than to see the cities above razed and their citizens enslaved.&quot;</string>
<string name="93428">&quot;In the past Halaster&apos;s presence in Undermountain kept Waterdeep safe from constant raids from the Underdark. Once the Valsharess imprisoned the arch-mage, however, that protection was gone.&quot;</string>
<string name="93429">Nathyrra nods. &quot;The work of the Red Sisters. The Valsharess is using them to sow fear and panic, and to weaken the city by removing its most powerful defenders.&quot; </string>
<string name="93430">&quot;The Red Sisters are very good at what they do. Had you not caught that thief in your room, you would have woken to find a Red Sister with a blade standing over you... assuming you woke up at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="93431">&quot;The Valsharess must have targeted you because of your reputation. You are one of the few powerful enough to threaten her plans. That&apos;s also the reason we finally chose to approach you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93432">&quot;Halaster isn&apos;t far, once you get past the drow encampment. Just follow the passage to the southwest.&quot;</string>
<string name="93433">&quot;I&apos;ve done some scouting on this level; the wizard is being held far from here. Go through the north caverns, then head to the west once you are past them.&quot;</string>
<string name="93434">&quot;There is a powerful drow war party guarding the wizard. If you want to free Halaster, you&apos;ll have to find some way to deal with them.&quot;</string>
<string name="93435">She shrugs. &quot;We don&apos;t know. It must have been some type of trap that preyed on his insanity. Or maybe she used his own arrogance to trick and ensnare him.&quot; </string>
<string name="93436">&quot;She&apos;s keeping him alive, that much we know. She&apos;s probably afraid of what will happen to Undermountain if Halaster dies. But she&apos;s been very careful to make sure he can&apos;t get out.&quot;</string>
<string name="93437">&quot;If the wizard ever breaks free, there&apos;s no way the Valsharess will be able to maintain control of Undermountain. In his own realm Halaster is a match for anyone, and he won&apos;t let himself be tricked again.&quot;</string>
<string name="93438">She shakes her head slightly. &quot;We want to offer you aid, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but there is only so much we are willing to do. We don&apos;t fully trust you yet, as I&apos;m sure you don&apos;t fully trust me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93439">&quot;There is only so much we are willing to do, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I admit, we don&apos;t fully trust you yet - just as I&apos;m sure you don&apos;t fully trust me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93440">&quot;Allies are hard to find in Undermountain, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You should take whatever help is offered. Any enemy of the Valsharess is a friend of yours... at least for now.&quot;</string>
<string name="93441">You&apos;re back. We have to hurry and save Halaster.</string>
<string name="93442">&quot;Still following me? Maybe I should just kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93443">&quot;Not one step closer, foul drow!&quot;</string>
<string name="93444">&quot;I think you&apos;re the Valsharess in disguise!&quot;</string>
<string name="93445">&quot;It takes more than that to win my trust.&quot;</string>
<string name="93446">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I guess you&apos;ve proven yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="93447">&quot;You said &apos;us&apos;? Are you helping in this fight?&quot;</string>
<string name="93448">&quot;Back off - I&apos;m not falling for any drow treachery!&quot;</string>
<string name="93449">&quot;It&apos;s good to see you again.&quot;</string>
<string name="93450">&quot;How did you know where to find me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93451">&quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot;</string>
<string name="93452">&quot;Good. They&apos;re easier to kill when they&apos;re all together.&quot;</string>
<string name="93453">&quot;Thanks for the warning. I&apos;ll be careful.&quot;</string>
<string name="93454">&quot;Sounds like you&apos;re leading me into a trap!&quot;</string>
<string name="93455">&quot;I prefer to tackle my battles head on.&quot;</string>
<string name="93456">&quot;Thanks for the information.&quot;</string>
<string name="93457">&quot;That&apos;s all. Thanks for the warning.&quot;</string>
<string name="93458">&quot;Is this some type of trick?&quot;</string>
<string name="93459">&quot;A drow who means no harm? I doubt that!&quot;</string>
<string name="93460">&quot;I&apos;ll listen. But don&apos;t try anything!&quot;</string>
<string name="93461">&quot;Who are you? What do you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="93462">&quot;No, I think you have me confused with someone else.&quot;</string>
<string name="93463">&quot;How do you know my name?&quot;</string>
<string name="93464">&quot;What do you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="93465">&quot;Your people? You mean the drow?&quot;</string>
<string name="93466">&quot;The Valsharess? Who&apos;s that?&quot;</string>
<string name="93467">&quot;I don&apos;t trust you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93468">&quot;I still don&apos;t trust you. Just leave me alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="93469">&quot;I have to go now.&quot;</string>
<string name="93470">&quot;This sounds like a trap.&quot;</string>
<string name="93471">&quot;Thanks for the information.&quot;</string>
<string name="93472">&quot;I don&apos;t even know what a formian is!&quot;</string>
<string name="93473">&quot;That&apos;s not much help.&quot;</string>
<string name="93474">&quot;I guess your information could be useful.&quot;</string>
<string name="93475">&quot;So you&apos;ll answer some questions for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93476">&quot;Tell me more about you and your &apos;rebel&apos; friends.&quot;</string>
<string name="93477">&quot;Tell me more about the Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="93478">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="93479">&quot;Why is she attacking Waterdeep?&quot;</string>
<string name="93480">&quot;There have been several recent assassinations in Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="93481">&quot;Do you know where Halaster is being held?&quot;</string>
<string name="93482">&quot;How did the Valsharess imprison Halaster?&quot;</string>
<string name="93483">&quot;Would you like to join up with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93484">&quot;So how do you plan to help me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93485">&quot;Why would you want to help me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93486">&quot;I don&apos;t like the modern music they play in these taverns. Why can&apos;t they stick to the classics?&quot;</string>
<string name="93487">&quot;I was surviving by gathering wood for the university. I hope they get it rebuilt soon.&quot;</string>
<string name="93488">&quot;I heard they burned the granaries. It&apos;s going to be a long, hard winter.&quot;</string>
<string name="93489">&quot;My poor old wife had her head split open by one of those dark dwarves.&quot;</string>
<string name="93490">&quot;I lost my home in the invasion. It was only a small home, but it was mine. What shall I do?&quot;</string>
<string name="93491">&quot;Oh, my back hurts and I can barely see. I think I need another drink.&quot;</string>
<string name="93492">A pretty, but quiet elf sips wine carefully from her glass before speaking, &quot;With all that is out of balance in this age, let my hospitality welcome and comfort you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93493">&quot;Times of stress and war do not exempt one from good manners; you might want to keep that in mind in the future.&quot;</string>
<string name="93494">&quot;Times of stress and war do not exempt one from good manners; hold tight to this lesson and you shall find peace in the midst of conflict.&quot;</string>
<string name="93495">&quot;Times of stress and war do not exempt one from good manners; a lesson I am glad to see you understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="93496">&quot;My name is Parley. I am a druid out of Vaasa. And you would be &lt;FullName&gt;, correct?&quot;</string>
<string name="93497">&quot;Then so is everyone else in this tavern. Would you try to make me feel like a fool?&quot;</string>
<string name="93498">&quot;Good day to you, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="93499">&quot;I have heard a few tales about you since I came to this part of the world. I used to dream of having tales told about me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93500">&quot;It was another &lt;class&gt; such as yourself that convinced me to leave my homeland and enter this &apos;civilized&apos; world.&quot;</string>
<string name="93501">&quot;But I&apos;m sure you don&apos;t want to hear about my struggles. You must have enough of your own.&quot;</string>
<string name="93502">&quot;Goodbye, &lt;sir/madam&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="93503">&quot;Then I shall shoulder my burden alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="93504">&quot;That is very kind. It is just such a response that is the source of my problems though.&quot;</string>
<string name="93505">&quot;I was content to live in my forest and tend to nature, solitary, yet not lonely; until I met Aragati.&quot;</string>
<string name="93506">&quot;He was a half-elf &lt;class&gt; who caught me meditating by a small brook. I thought he might be there to harm me, but he simply sat and stared at me for over an hour.&quot;</string>
<string name="93507">&quot;I see that patience is not your greatest strength. I will waste no more of your time then.&quot;</string>
<string name="93508">&quot;You must have thought I had some quest or job for you, but I have only a philosophical quandary, which I am sure would not interest you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93509">&quot;When I finally spoke, he told me that he once was a prince, but had decided to try living as one of his subjects.&quot;</string>
<string name="93510">&quot;Once he sampled from the variety of life, he couldn&apos;t get enough. He dedicated the rest of his life to trying something new as often as he could.&quot;</string>
<string name="93511">&quot;I thought about it for a long time and then decided that I needed to emerge from my retreat and sample the world. And you know what I have found?&quot;</string>
<string name="93512">&quot;Then why did you ask me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93513">&quot;As much as I love nature, I love the bustle of the city as well. Everyone leads a life that is as important to him or her as storing nuts is to a squirrel.&quot;</string>
<string name="93514">&quot;And so I find myself in a quandary. How can I reconcile my life as a druid, to a life in the city?&quot;</string>
<string name="93515">&quot;I&apos;m not looking for an answer from you. The answer must come from within me. But thank you for your time.&quot;</string>
<string name="93516">&quot;You must have thought I had some quest or job for you, but I have only a philosophical quandary, which obviously does not interest you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93517">&quot;Not everything needs an outer reward. sometimes the reward is entirely internal. I am sorry to have wasted your time.&quot;</string>
<string name="93518">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;, it has been a great pleasure talking to you. Please allow me to give you a small gift.&quot;</string>
<string name="93519">&quot;May your travels make you wiser and your life be rich and full. For the stretch of a day, I gift you the strength of the bull.&quot;</string>
<string name="93520">&quot;The balance favor you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="93521">&quot;Durnan asked for your help. Some of us will stay up here in case they come from outside as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="93522">&quot;Good friend, may all your tender roots find purchase, that you may grow in greatness.&quot;</string>
<string name="93523">&quot;Look inside yourself and try to find improvements. Only then will you find contentment.&quot;</string>
<string name="93524">&quot;I speak to those who show they have manners, not to children who have learned none.&quot;</string>
<string name="93525">&quot;I heard that Durnan is going to be making an announcement soon. I hope this means I&apos;ll be able to head down into Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="93526">&quot;No thanks. Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="93527">&quot;What you mean?&quot; </string>
<string name="93528">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="93529">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93530">&quot;No, you be wrong.&quot;</string>
<string name="93531">&quot;No. You are mistaken.&quot;</string>
<string name="93532">&quot;Yes, how you know?&quot; </string>
<string name="93533">&quot;Yes, how&apos;d you know?&quot; </string>
<string name="93534">&quot;Yes, me be &lt;him/her&gt;.&quot; </string>
<string name="93535">&quot;Yes, that is I.&quot;</string>
<string name="93536">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="93537">&quot;True. Me no want more stuff to worry &apos;bout.&quot; </string>
<string name="93538">&quot;True. I really don&apos;t want to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="93539">&quot;True. Me gots troubles. But me likes to hear yours anyways.&quot; </string>
<string name="93540">&quot;True, I have troubles; but sometimes it helps to share them.&quot;</string>
<string name="93541">&quot;Hurry tale and tell problem.&quot;</string>
<string name="93542">&quot;Hurry up and explain your problem.&quot;</string>
<string name="93543">&quot;Him sound strange.&quot; </string>
<string name="93544">&quot;That would be strange.&quot;</string>
<string name="93545">&quot;Me no care.&quot; </string>
<string name="93546">&quot;I don&apos;t care.&quot;</string>
<string name="93547">&quot;You hate it.&quot; </string>
<string name="93548">&quot;You like it?&quot; </string>
<string name="93549">&quot;Me not know.&quot; </string>
<string name="93550">&quot;I have no idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="93551">&quot;That be it? Me listen to you for no reason?&quot; </string>
<string name="93552">&quot;That&apos;s it? I listened to all that for no reason?&quot;</string>
<string name="93553">&quot;You welcome, me thinks.&quot; </string>
<string name="93554">&quot;You&apos;re welcome, I guess.&quot; </string>
<string name="93555">The woman&apos;s eyes flutter open and she looks around with a great deal of surprise and slowly dawning horror. Her face goes pale as she realizes where she is.</string>
<string name="93556">She looks at you a bit archly and visibly bites back a response. &quot;Ask away, then,&quot; she says curtly.</string>
<string name="93557">The woman peers at you closely. &quot;Of course. You were there with us during the fight. You&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;, the hero that Durnan was waiting for.&quot;</string>
<string name="93558">The bard peers at you closely. &quot;Of course. You... you&apos;re &lt;FullName&gt;. The hero that Durnan was waiting for.&quot;</string>
<string name="93559">&quot;There was a fight when we chased that beholder down here... and I was hit by a poisoned arrow and killed.&quot; She nods slowly. &quot;I remember now. Thank you for bringing me back.&quot;</string>
<string name="93560">The bard seems slightly surprised and arches an eyebrow, studying you. &quot;Are you serious? Most of my equipment appears to have been taken. I&apos;m hardly in a state to be of much help to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="93561">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Well, I must admit I didn&apos;t want to stop the adventure this early in Undermountain.&quot; She shrugs, grinning. &quot;Lead on, then!&quot;</string>
<string name="93562">&quot;Hmm. You needn&apos;t resort to blackmail, you know... it&apos;s not as if you need to twist my arm to get me to want to see more of Undermountain.&quot; She thinks for a moment and then shrugs. &quot;So be it. Lead on!&quot;</string>
<string name="93563">She looks at your companions, grinning. &quot;Oh, I think you&apos;ve got more than enough help right now. You don&apos;t need me tagging along, I&apos;m sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="93564">She frowns and thinks about it for a moment. &quot;Well... I suppose I could go back to the inn. I&apos;ve no illusions about being able to make it through Undermountain on my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="93565">She studies you carefully with a steely gaze. &quot;That&apos;d be an awful waste of good magic, wouldn&apos;t it? I&apos;m no match for you... just let me go.&quot;</string>
<string name="93566">She edges away from you slowly, trying to judge if you&apos;re serious, and then slowly relaxes. &quot;Very well.&quot;</string>
<string name="93567">&quot;That won&apos;t be as easy as you seem to think!&quot;</string>
<string name="93568">She arches a brow at you and crosses her arms. &quot;What would you like, exactly? It seems most of my equipment is gone, and I haven&apos;t a spell left until I rest again. Shall I sing you a song?&quot;</string>
<string name="93569">She frowns for a moment, and then her face softens and she grins. &quot;Of course I&apos;m grateful. Do you really think I would rather be lying there on the floor forever?&quot;</string>
<string name="93570">She frowns for a moment, and then her face softens. &quot;Of course I&apos;m grateful.&quot; Smiling, she kisses you on the forehead. &quot;Do you really think I would rather be lying there on the floor forever?&quot;</string>
<string name="93571">&quot;So should I go back to the inn, now? Unless you&apos;ve other plans for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93572">Both of her eyebrows come up as she stares at you incredulously, now. &quot;You can&apos;t possibly mean what I think you mean. Here? In the middle of Undermountain? With you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93573">&quot;I see.&quot; She studies you sternly for a long moment. &quot;Please forgive me if I don&apos;t roll in the corridors with laughter. I was just dead, if you&apos;ll recall.&quot;</string>
<string name="93574">She stops to gather a few of her belongings which were scattered around her body. &quot;I&apos;ll head back to Durnan&apos;s inn. I think I can find the way from here... it&apos;s not as if I got very far.&quot;</string>
<string name="93575">She stops to look at you seriously. &quot;For what it&apos;s worth, you have my gratitude. I hope things go well for you down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="93576">&quot;Indeed?&quot; She appears quite flustered, not sure if she should believe you. &quot;Just like that? To reward you for saving me? That&apos;s what you want? How romantic.&quot;</string>
<string name="93577">&quot;Well, you&apos;ll just have to forgive me if I&apos;m not ready to lie down and be ravished in exchange for your rescue. If that&apos;s all you wanted, you should have left me there.&quot;</string>
<string name="93578">&quot;I wish I could help you. We chased the beholder into this area. There wasn&apos;t really time for me to look around much, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="93579">&quot;I&apos;ve no idea. If my companions had been victorious, surely Linu would have raised me. They wouldn&apos;t have abandoned me here.&quot; She thinks again. &quot;Well, Tomi maybe... but never Linu or Daelan.&quot;</string>
<string name="93580">&quot;I can only assume they fled further into the dungeon... or died, perhaps.&quot; She shudders visibly at that thought. &quot;Just some more adventurer bones to add to the pile down here. I hope not.&quot;</string>
<string name="93581">&quot;I&apos;m not certain, exactly. We were chasing after the beholder and had almost caught up to it, when suddenly it veered about and arrows started firing upon us from the shadows.&quot;</string>
<string name="93582">She nods. &quot;It happened very quickly, so I did not even see who attacked us, but I think you&apos;re right. We should not have acted so recklessly, it seems.&quot;</string>
<string name="93583">&quot;My name is Sharwyn, a bard most recently from Neverwinter. There were four of us... companions all... who chased after the beholder in Durnan&apos;s cellar.&quot;</string>
<string name="93584">She nods quickly, looking about to study the paths nearby. &quot;I should be able to find my way back to the entrance without too much trouble.&quot; She snorts with derision. &quot;It&apos;s not as if I got very far in, did I?&quot;</string>
<string name="93585">&quot;Well, you have my sincere thanks for saving me. This may not be the most epic moment of my life, but at least it&apos;s not the last. Good luck. If you need me, you&apos;ll find me at the inn... I hope!&quot;</string>
<string name="93586">Sharwyn notices your approach and smiles warmly. She seems to have cleaned herself up considerably from the state you found her in back in the dungeon.</string>
<string name="93587">&quot;It is really good to see you again, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I hope everything is going well?&quot;</string>
<string name="93588">She nods. &quot;Good, I&apos;m glad. I&apos;ve been keeping the folks here entertained in the mean-time... they&apos;re all a bit frightened. I hope you succeed down there.&quot;</string>
<string name="93589">&quot;I can try. Let me have a look through what you have... I&apos;ll let you know if there&apos;s anything that I can tell you much about.&quot;</string>
<string name="93590">She grins broadly. &quot;I thought you&apos;d never ask!&quot;</string>
<string name="93591">She grins. &quot;I&apos;d like to, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but you&apos;ve got more than enough help, it seems... and these people here need me, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="93592">&quot;I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll do well enough without me, won&apos;t you? I must admit I&apos;m flattered, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="93593">Sharwyn notices you approach and stiffens, frowning. She does not appear pleased to see you in the slightest.</string>
<string name="93594">She rolls her eyes and turns away from you, but says nothing.</string>
<string name="93595">A flush rolls up her neck and she turns away from you, silent but obviously furious.</string>
<string name="93596">She rolls her eyes at you. &quot;Am I that transparent? Why don&apos;t you go back to being a hero and leave me alone?&quot;</string>
<string name="93597">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; She snorts with derision. &quot;Not likely. Just go and do whatever you have to... we&apos;ve no reason to talk, anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="93598">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; She seems reluctant, but finally grins. &quot;You did save my life. I guess I shouldn&apos;t hold it against you, still. Fine. You&apos;re forgiven.&quot;</string>
<string name="93599">&quot;Good luck. Waterdeep is counting on you, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="93600">&quot;Quiet. I&apos;ll ask the questions, here.&quot;</string>
<string name="93601">&quot;That&apos;s not important. You died and I just raised you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93602">&quot;The name is &lt;FirstName&gt;. You were in the tavern, weren&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93603">&quot;You don&apos;t remember me? I spoke to your group at the tavern.&quot;</string>
<string name="93604">&quot;You don&apos;t remember me? We spoke at the tavern.&quot;</string>
<string name="93605">&quot;How about you join me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93606">&quot;True enough. Go back to the inn, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="93607">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I could still use your help, regardless.&quot;</string>
<string name="93608">&quot;I think your assistance would be fair exchange for saving you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93609">&quot;What are you going to do now?&quot;</string>
<string name="93610">&quot;Go on back to the inn, and fare you well.&quot;</string>
<string name="93611">&quot;You won&apos;t be going anywhere, I&apos;m afraid. Time to die... again.&quot;</string>
<string name="93612">&quot;Go on, get out of here, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="93613">&quot;I raised you, I can put you back.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Kill her.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="93614">&quot;This is all the thanks I get for bringing you back to life?&quot;</string>
<string name="93615">&quot;Fine. I feel the need to kill you again, I think.&quot;</string>
<string name="93616">&quot;Just some simple gratitude would be nice.&quot;</string>
<string name="93617">&quot;Other plans? You mean such as killing you again?&quot;</string>
<string name="93618">&quot;No, that&apos;s fine. Go back to the inn.&quot;</string>
<string name="93619">&quot;Well... you *are* rather cute...&quot;</string>
<string name="93620">&quot;Turning me down, eh? Maybe you need to die again.&quot;</string>
<string name="93621">&quot;Of course I&apos;m not serious! Ha ha ha!&quot;</string>
<string name="93622">&quot;No, I don&apos;t mean *here*. Maybe back at the inn?&quot;</string>
<string name="93623">&quot;Why not? You should do so well.&quot;</string>
<string name="93624">&quot;Well how about I settle for just a &apos;thank you&apos; for now?&quot;</string>
<string name="93625">&quot;Fine, have it your way. Run along, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="93626">&quot;Ha ha! I&apos;m just kidding! You look so serious!&quot;</string>
<string name="93627">&quot;That&apos;s what I want. I don&apos;t have time for real romance.&quot;</string>
<string name="93628">&quot;I can always return you to that state and leave you for the next adventurer to wander by.&quot;</string>
<string name="93629">&quot;Why don&apos;t you come with me, instead?&quot;</string>
<string name="93630">&quot;Is there anything you can tell me about this area?&quot;</string>
<string name="93631">&quot;Do you know where the rest of your group is?&quot;</string>
<string name="93632">&quot;What happened to you, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="93633">&quot;An ambush?&quot;</string>
<string name="93634">&quot;Tell me who you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="93635">&quot;I&apos;ll be moving on, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="93636">&quot;Where are your companions now? Do you know?&quot;</string>
<string name="93637">&quot;Things are going well enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="93638">&quot;I have some items I don&apos;t recognize... could you identify them?&quot;</string>
<string name="93639">&quot;I was hoping you&apos;d consider joining me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93640">&quot;Take a flying leap off the roof, bard.&quot;</string>
<string name="93641">&quot;Seeing how quickly you drop dead, I&apos;m surprised to see you alive, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="93642">&quot;Not happy to see me, I take it?&quot;</string>
<string name="93643">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I hope you&apos;ll accept my apology for the way I acted down there.&quot;</string>
<string name="93644">&quot;I should go.&quot;</string>
<string name="93645">An elegantly dressed mage is busily reading from an ancient, crumbling text, but he smiles at you as you approach.</string>
<string name="93646">&quot;Of course my shop is actually closed right now, but a visit from such a famous adventurer is too good an opportunity to miss. Maybe I will write you into one of my plays!&quot;</string>
<string name="93647">&quot;A connoisseur of the arts! Oh, a true hero after my own heart. Well, let me tell you, I have not yet published anything of the creative bent, though I have started many a wonderful project.&quot;</string>
<string name="93648">&quot;(Sigh). It seems that I just never have enough time, what with all the work I do at the University of Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="93649">&quot;Oh, well I am famous around magical theory circles. Or, at least I was famous until those cretins burned the building down.&quot;</string>
<string name="93650">&quot;Oh, how rude of me. I am the mage, Sobrey, an instructor of the magical arts at the University of Waterdeep, Sage of Soothsayers Way, and proprietor of this fine establishment.&quot;</string>
<string name="93651">&quot;Or, at least I was an instructor, before those cretins burned down my part of the school.&quot;</string>
<string name="93652">&quot;We were one of the first places to be attacked by the drow and duergar. They were savage, brutish monsters. They put the entire School of Magic at the university to the torch.&quot;</string>
<string name="93653">&quot;It was simply awful. They almost killed me, you know?&quot;</string>
<string name="93654">&quot;Um... well... no. I was supposed to be there, but I had some last minute business to attend to here at my shop.&quot;</string>
<string name="93655">&quot;I got rather involved and by the time I returned, the fight had moved on and the building was in ruins.&quot;</string>
<string name="93656">&quot;Well, I was not actually there at the time, but they did kill a number of my friends. You can imagine how terrible it was for me to go back and see all the devastation.&quot;</string>
<string name="93657">&quot;Several of my students died in the laboratory where I taught. We found their bodies, dead and mangled around the corpse of a young cockatrice they had helped hatch only weeks before.&quot;</string>
<string name="93658">&quot;I know it probably sounds strange to you, but the way they protected that creature... well... no mother could have possibly done more. And now they&apos;re dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="93659">&quot;I have barely been able to sleep since. That was why I created the magical telescope, in the hopes it would help me come to grips with the attack on the university.&quot;</string>
<string name="93660">&quot;Feel free to use the telescope whenever you wish to observe the details of the brutal attack. It might help to strengthen your resolve against our enemy.&quot;</string>
<string name="93661">&quot;But I&apos;m sure you have more important things ahead of you, too. Perhaps I might have something you would find useful.&quot;</string>
<string name="93662">&quot;I have all sorts of magical items at my disposal, and a share of all profits go to assist the rebuilding of the university. Would you like to see my wares?&quot;</string>
<string name="93663">&quot;Ah, well, if you should change your mind, I will remain here. Farewell and may the gods watch over you on your perilous journey.&quot;</string>
<string name="93664">&quot;(Oh, that is good stuff. I shall really have to write this all down someday.)&quot;</string>
<string name="93665">&quot;Good! I will take that as a promise! We shall both be famous; yes, indeed.&quot;</string>
<string name="93666">&quot;Oh... well... perhaps you shall change your mind later. (Sigh) I suppose this must happen to bards too, sometimes.&quot;</string>
<string name="93667">&quot;Okay, here you go.&quot;</string>
<string name="93668">&quot;Wonderful! I am so glad you agree.&quot;</string>
<string name="93669">&quot;You shall be famous for deeds and I shall be famous for words! And they told me I would never make it as a bard!&quot;</string>
<string name="93670">&quot;Well, I guess you are here to buy something, so I shall show you my wares.&quot;</string>
<string name="93671">&quot;Okay. Good luck, hero!&quot;</string>
<string name="93672">&quot;Have a look then.&quot;</string>
<string name="93673">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="93674">Sobrey watches your expression as you look up from viewing the battle. &quot;It was horrific, and the powerful items they stole... I shudder at the thought of our enemies wielding such power.&quot;</string>
<string name="93675">&quot;I fear that with such deadly attacks on the city, we shall find ourselves undermined and easy prey for the creatures of the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="93676">&quot;Of course. Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="93677">&quot;All I know are rumors and legends. I do know that there is supposed to be a way down into the Underdark, through Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="93678">&quot;That is not my area of expertise, I fear. It is a dark dungeon, created by a wizard of undeniable power and destructive insanity. If Halaster is not in league with our opponents, then he is overcome by them.&quot;</string>
<string name="93679">&quot;It is the stuff of nightmares to think that one so strong as he might have fallen. If his power could be bested, then I fear for all our lives.&quot;</string>
<string name="93680">&quot;The strikes against our fair city have been fast and deadly. They are obviously well planned and executed with discipline.&quot; </string>
<string name="93681">&quot;I assure you, should they continue, and the war not be taken to them, Waterdeep will fall.&quot;</string>
<string name="93682">&quot;Everything magical that the mages of the university had made or were studying. Most likely there were even a few powerful artifacts, though I am not sure what they would be.&quot;</string>
<string name="93683">&quot;If you recover any, I am sure the school would love to have them back.&quot;</string>
<string name="93684">&quot;You write plays? How wonderful. What is your name? Maybe I have heard of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93685">&quot;Oh, well, keep trying, perhaps someday you will be famous.&quot;</string>
<string name="93686">&quot;Oh, well I am not really interested then. I thought maybe you were famous.&quot;</string>
<string name="93687">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93688">&quot;You have the advantage of me. What is your name?&quot;</string>
<string name="93689">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="93690">&quot;I heard something about that. What happened exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="93691">&quot;I guess you were lucky then.&quot;</string>
<string name="93692">&quot;Were you in the battle there?&quot;</string>
<string name="93693">&quot;How did you escape?&quot;</string>
<string name="93694">&quot;Enough with the stories. Do you have any goods to sell?&quot;</string>
<string name="93695">&quot;It was a monster; get over it.&quot; </string>
<string name="93696">&quot;Everyone has experienced loss from this war.&quot;</string>
<string name="93697">&quot;I am sorry for your loss.&quot;</string>
<string name="93698">&quot;Not right now. I am not really interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="93699">&quot;Yes, please, show me what you have.&quot;</string>
<string name="93700">&quot;This happened during the attack?&quot; </string>
<string name="93701">&quot;Whatever. Just show me your wares.&quot;</string>
<string name="93702">&quot;I do not think so. I am just here to look at your wares.&quot;</string>
<string name="93703">&quot;When this is all done. I would love for you to record my deeds.&quot;</string>
<string name="93704">&quot;No thanks.&quot;</string>
<string name="93705">&quot;Good idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="93706">&quot;No. Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="93707">&quot;Yes.&quot; </string>
<string name="93708">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="93709">&quot;Can you tell me more about this attack.&quot;</string>
<string name="93710">&quot;What can you tell me about the Underdark?&quot;</string>
<string name="93711">&quot;What can you tell me about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="93712">&quot;Waterdeep is stronger than that.&quot;</string>
<string name="93713">&quot;What kind of items did they steal?&quot;</string>
<string name="93714">An ancient-looking man looks up at you from his chair and you wonder how he stays mobile in his full plate armor.</string>
<string name="93715">&quot;Am I so old that I am of no use to anyone? I&apos;ve been exploring Undermountain longer than anyone else in this city.&quot; </string>
<string name="93716">&quot;I sacrificed everything to stand for justice and hunt the wickedness that lay beneath Waterdeep, and now they tell me I&apos;m too old to fight for her!&quot;</string>
<string name="93717">&quot;What ever.&quot;</string>
<string name="93718">His body seems to cave into itself. &quot;When they open the streets again. Then I shall go home and die.&quot;</string>
<string name="93719">&quot;Now leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="93720">His eyes brighten a little. &quot;You want to hear about Undermountain? Really? I would really love... I mean, I would be honored to help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93721">&quot;Everyone always tells of how Undermountain is constantly changing, but there is one secret that could help you out.&quot;</string>
<string name="93722">&quot;There is one thing that never changes about Undermountain; its creator.&quot;</string>
<string name="93723">&quot;Halaster is even older than I am, and he&apos;s been controlling Undermountain for centuries.&quot;</string>
<string name="93724">&quot;It took me decades to figure it out, but now I can predict some of Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="93725">&quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong, you can&apos;t just walk into Undermountain and predict what will be in the next room; it doesn&apos;t work that way.&quot;</string>
<string name="93726">&quot;But if you walk into a room and you see a giant throne and a sarcophagus, you can bet your life that there is more than undead involved in this puzzle.&quot;</string>
<string name="93727">&quot;Chances are, one of those objects is a transporter of some sort, either to bring monsters in, or for you to get to another area.&quot;</string>
<string name="93728">&quot;I think it has something to do with the idea that death is a journey. I could be wrong.&quot;</string>
<string name="93729">&quot;I don&apos;t understand Halaster, not really. I just know the patterns now.&quot;</string>
<string name="93730">His face flushes red and his shoulders straighten with pride. &quot;That&apos;s not the only suggestion I can make.&quot;</string>
<string name="93731">&quot;There are some little things, like watch out for mirrors. They almost always hide something; some times something good, often something very bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="93732">&quot;And greed is a dangerous, often fatal flaw in Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="93733">&quot;Then you are exactly the kind of adventurer Halaster loves to kill. He&apos;ll start off by teasing you with a small treasure.&quot;</string>
<string name="93734">&quot;Far more so in Undermountain. Halaster counts on adventurers being greedy. He starts by offering a little treasure.&quot;</string>
<string name="93735">&quot;Often little traps will start with a small treasure, to make you think there must be more.&quot;</string>
<string name="93736">&quot;Then there will be a little danger, but nothing you can&apos;t handle. If you continue, eventually the big trap will be set off.&quot;</string>
<string name="93737">&quot;That&apos;s where most adventurers die. Of course, surviving the big trap can sometimes mean big rewards; notice I said sometimes.&quot;</string>
<string name="93738">&quot;Halaster tends to enjoy rewarding those who entertain him.&quot;</string>
<string name="93739">&quot;But, I think he also finds entertainment in watching an adventurer go through a really tough fight and open a treasure chest to find useless garbage.&quot;</string>
<string name="93740">&quot;Still, if you persevere, Undermountain is a great place to make a living.&quot;</string>
<string name="93741">&quot;Farewell, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. May you choose your path wisely.&quot;</string>
<string name="93742">His eyes twinkle in a satisfied way. &quot;Thank you, &lt;lad/lass&gt;. It is my duty and my pleasure to assist you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93743">&quot;Tyr protect you on your journey.&quot;</string>
<string name="93744">&quot;Well, that&apos;s all I can think of for now. Maybe I&apos;ll remember more later.&quot;</string>
<string name="93745">He snorts a derisive laugh. &quot;What world are you living in &lt;boy/girl&gt;? Durnan has forbidden me to go down there.&quot;</string>
<string name="93746">&quot;No, I am too old. I am just fooling myself. It hurts just to swing my sword for a short period of time. I&apos;ll never be of use again.&quot;</string>
<string name="93747">&quot;I suppose so. Leave me to my aged thoughts, young hero.&quot;</string>
<string name="93748">An ancient-looking man looks up at you from his chair. &quot;I don&apos;t understand why Durnan didn&apos;t call for my aid. Who else can he trust to fight for justice?&quot;</string>
<string name="93749">The old paladin looks up at you with a bleary, tear-stained face. </string>
<string name="93750">&quot;Leave an old man to his reminiscing. No one needs me anymore.&quot;</string>
<string name="93751">The old paladin smiles proudly at you. &quot;None of those vermin will harm the occupants of this house while I&apos;m on duty!&quot;</string>
<string name="93752">An ancient-looking man looks up at you from his chair. &quot;Eh, you aren&apos;t Durnan! I&apos;m waiting for Durnan to call me to arms.&quot;</string>
<string name="93753">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="93754">&quot;You be too old. You go home!&quot; </string>
<string name="93755">&quot;You are too old. Why not just go home?&quot;</string>
<string name="93756">&quot;You help me by tell me &apos;bout Undermountain.&quot; </string>
<string name="93757">&quot;You could help me by telling me about Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="93758">&quot;Halaster?&quot; </string>
<string name="93759">&quot;Who?&quot;</string>
<string name="93760">&quot;Me always hear Undermountain no predictable.&quot; </string>
<string name="93761">&quot;I&apos;ve always been told Undermountain is unpredictable.&quot;</string>
<string name="93762">&quot;That stupid. Me was hoping for something me could use.&quot; </string>
<string name="93763">&quot;That&apos;s stupid. I was hoping for something useful.&quot; </string>
<string name="93764">&quot;Why it be like that?&quot; </string>
<string name="93765">&quot;Why would it be that way?&quot;</string>
<string name="93766">&quot;That smart idea, thanks.&quot; </string>
<string name="93767">&quot;Useful tip, thanks.&quot;</string>
<string name="93768">&quot;Me like greedy. It make me wealthy.&quot; </string>
<string name="93769">&quot;My greed has served me well so far.&quot;</string>
<string name="93770">&quot;It usually be flaw anywhere.&quot; </string>
<string name="93771">&quot;It usually is anywhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="93772">&quot;How so?&quot;</string>
<string name="93773">&quot;Me notice.&quot; </string>
<string name="93774">&quot;I noticed.&quot; </string>
<string name="93775">&quot;Sometime no reward?&quot; </string>
<string name="93776">&quot;Sometimes there is nothing?&quot;</string>
<string name="93777">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="93778">&quot;Thanks for help me.&quot; </string>
<string name="93779">&quot;Thanks for the help.&quot;</string>
<string name="93780">&quot;You know more stuff?&quot; </string>
<string name="93781">&quot;Anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="93782">&quot;Like what?&quot;</string>
<string name="93783">&quot;You no too old. Go fight!&quot; </string>
<string name="93784">&quot;You aren&apos;t too old. Get down there and fight!&quot;</string>
<string name="93785">&quot;Well, me tried. If you think you be too old, then you be so.&quot; </string>
<string name="93786">&quot;Well, I tried. If you think you&apos;re too old, then maybe you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="93787">The halfling blinks several times, stares at you with wide and incredulous eyes and then looks around for several confused seconds before finally speaking.</string>
<string name="93788">&quot;One of these days I&apos;m going to bloody well piss off them death gods for teasin&apos; them all th&apos; time.&quot; He looks at you and blinks again. &quot;Say, you look familiar.&quot;</string>
<string name="93789">&quot;Oh, sure, sure. Everybody gots questions. Last time some old hag raised me, she sticks her ugly face right in mine and asks &apos;where does it hurt?&apos;. &apos;My eyes!&apos;, I screams, &apos;my eyes!&quot;.</string>
<string name="93790">&quot;Of course, then she goes and casts some spell on me to cure me of bloody blindness. That&apos;s the clergy for ya... they never quite gets it, do they?&quot;</string>
<string name="93791">&quot;Well, do ya want me to answer your bloody questions or do ya want me to shut me trap? Make up your mind, sheesh.&quot;</string>
<string name="93792">&quot;Yes, that would be nice, wouldn&apos;t it? Linu keeps hintin&apos; at that, all polite-like. Strange gal, that. Clumsier than a drunk minotaur.&quot;</string>
<string name="93793">&quot;You think that&apos;s disrespectful? Gosh, I wouldn&apos;t want to tell ya about the time I hit the High Priest of Mask in the head with a giant custard. Boy, that was sweet!&quot;</string>
<string name="93794">&quot;Well, there ya have it. I rest my case.&quot;</string>
<string name="93795">&quot;You says that like it doesn&apos;t happen very often. Shoot, I&apos;ve found myself dead in stranger places than this. That time I died in Hellgate Keep when I was in that dress... now that required some fast talkin&apos;.&quot;</string>
<string name="93796">&quot;But anyway... you looks familiar to me, somehow. You&apos;s the daughter of the fella that runs the inn, ain&apos;tcha? Tamsin or somethin&apos;, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="93797">&quot;But anyway... you looks familiar to me, somehow. You&apos;s that fella who runs the inn, right? Starts with a &apos;D&apos; or somethin&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="93798">&quot;Right, right. And you, ummm... you&apos;re the daughter of that fella who runs the inn, ain&apos;tcha? Tamsin or somethin&apos;, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="93799">&quot;Right, right. And you, ummm... you&apos;re that fella who runs the inn, right? Starts with a &apos;D&apos; or somethin&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="93800">&quot;Wait a minute... you&apos;re the &lt;man/woman&gt; who&apos;s so famous &lt;he/she&gt;&apos;s got everyone&apos;s knickers in a twist. I remember, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="93801">&quot;Mmm. That would be a no, I take it? You should see me tryin&apos; ta guess some lass&apos;s name the mornin&apos; after.&quot;</string>
<string name="93802">&quot;Oh, right, the famous one. Well, I guess there&apos;s a reason after all why everybody was whisperin&apos; all excited-like that you were showin&apos; up.&quot;</string>
<string name="93803">&quot;I guess it don&apos;t get much better than bein&apos; saved by a professional, aye? Thanks a bunch. That was real swell of ya.&quot;</string>
<string name="93804">&quot;Hey, hey! Bloody well slow down for a minute, will ya? Ya can&apos;t just raise a fella and then trot off while he&apos;s still figurin&apos; out he&apos;s got a heartbeat, ya know.&quot;</string>
<string name="93805">&quot;Eh? I don&apos;t bloody know. Let&apos;s not give a fella a few moments ta reflect on the fact that he&apos;s just cheated death one more time, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="93806">&quot;Let&apos;s not give a fella a few moments ta reflect on the fact that he&apos;s just cheated death one more time, aye? Hmph. At any rate, I know what happened to &apos;em... for the most part.&quot;</string>
<string name="93807">&quot;How do ya think I ended up here? First there was the running, then there was the stabbing.&quot; He rubs his chest absently. &quot;You sure there&apos;s no holes left, still?&quot;</string>
<string name="93808">&quot;You mean ya don&apos;t already know? I would have thought that&apos;s why ya brought me back ta life... ta meet the world-famous Tomi Undergallows!&quot;</string>
<string name="93809">&quot;I see ya don&apos;t have any of my friends trottin&apos; around with ya at the moment. Didja happen to find Linu, at least?&quot;</string>
<string name="93810">&quot;You got yourself a point there, aye. Can&apos;t say I&apos;m not just a bit glad that ya decided to rescue *me* while you were trottin&apos; around down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="93811">&quot;Huh. Well, we got away from the drow who were chasin&apos; us, right? An&apos; we found some human slaves down here who naturally begged for our help an&apos; such.&quot;</string>
<string name="93812">&quot;I didn&apos;t really like the look of &apos;em, but Linu&apos;s little heart started bloody bleedin&apos; all over the place an&apos; she just had to help &apos;em get out somehow.&quot;</string>
<string name="93813">&quot;That&apos;s why I came here. According to the slaves, the drow here had some djinni that can activate a portal the slaves were at an&apos; let them out. Don&apos;t matter to me none if ya just leaves &apos;em be, though.&quot;</string>
<string name="93814">&quot;Oh, well that&apos;s good. Hopefully she took &apos;em slaves with her, too. She was so bloody determined ta help &apos;em it was drivin&apos; me nuts.&quot;</string>
<string name="93815">&quot;That&apos;s why I came here lookin&apos; for the djinni the drow had, right? An&apos; you can see how that turned out.&quot;</string>
<string name="93816">&quot;Hah! So them slaves did pick her off, just like I thought they would. I warned her, ya know. Ummm... say, why didn&apos;t ya bring her back ta life if ya found her?&quot;</string>
<string name="93817">&quot;Is that so? Huh. I&apos;d be welling to bet 50 gold that she wasn&apos;t a rak-whatever earlier. Are ya sure the real Linu wasn&apos;t somewhere near?&quot;</string>
<string name="93818">&quot;Not that it&apos;s a big deal ta me or nothin&apos;. Linu was so bloody sure they was poor slaves she made me come here ta look for the djinni ta help them... an&apos; you can see what came of that.&quot;</string>
<string name="93819">&quot;Hmmm. I was thinkin&apos; I might just head back to the inn. Unless ya think ya got room for a smart-mouthed halfling in your entourage, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="93820">&quot;Right, then. Suit yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="93821">&quot;Right, then. All I need is a weapon an&apos; some armor an&apos; whatever else ya can spare an&apos; I can visit some halfling death on everyone who so much as bugs ya! Ha ha!!&quot;</string>
<string name="93822">&quot;Hmmm. I was thinkin&apos; I might just head back to the inn. Skulkin&apos; round down here&apos;s fun an&apos; all, but dyin&apos; tends to take the wind outta me sails, ya know what I mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="93823">&quot;At any rate, don&apos;t let me keep ya or nothin&apos;. I can find my way back to the inn easy. See ya there if ya needs anything from me, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="93824">&quot;Hmph. Them elves got ears like ya wouldn&apos;t believe. Hear a feather hittin&apos; the ground, they would. I suppose it didn&apos;t help none that I was tryin&apos; to steal their jewelry while they was still wearin&apos; it.&quot;</string>
<string name="93825">&quot;They&apos;re in some big chamber off in the eastern part of the dungeon. There&apos;s a portal there, ya see, which they thought would take &apos;em outta here... if they got the djinni, first.&quot;</string>
<string name="93826">&quot;Them slaves said the drow had some bottle that summoned a djinni. Said it could open their portal for &apos;em. Why? Didn&apos;t ya find anything?&quot;</string>
<string name="93827">&quot;Oh, so ya did find her, then. Yeah, she&apos;s determined to help &apos;em folks out... never mind that it&apos;s just the two of us stuck in this deadly dungeon, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="93828">&quot;I see ya found Linu. Sorry I couldn&apos;t get the bottle back to ya, luv. Does your poor human folks still need it?&quot;</string>
<string name="93829">&quot;Umm... not exactly, dear. It&apos;s a bit of a long story, however...&quot;</string>
<string name="93830">&quot;Ahhh, don&apos;t tell me. I didn&apos;t want ta hear it the first time, &apos;cept you were so bloody broken-hearted about them bein&apos; stuck here an&apos; all.&quot;</string>
<string name="93831">&quot;I see ya managed to find some of the folks we, ah, kind of left behind. No hard feelings, aye? Linu and I were a bit pre-occupied at the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="93832">&quot;If Linu was forced to leave us behind, I trust that there was sufficient urgency that made it necessary.&quot;</string>
<string name="93833">&quot;Aye, we were a bit over-powered, ta say the least. Which all just goes to prove that ya don&apos;t need to run very fast... ya just needs mates who are slower than you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="93834">&quot;I&apos;ll have to remember that. Hold still while I hobble you, runt.&quot;</string>
<string name="93835">&quot;Heh heh... funny, that. Mmmm.&quot;</string>
<string name="93836">&quot;Hmmm... come ta think of it, didja happen to find Linu while you were bouncin&apos; around down here, maybe?&quot;</string>
<string name="93837">&quot;Are you saying it would be more prudent of me to remove your kneecaps, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="93838">&quot;Yes, I remember. The running, and the screaming...&quot;</string>
<string name="93839">Tomi grins widely as he sees you coming. Currently he appears to be stuffing his face with a wedge of cheese and a chunk of bread as large as his head.</string>
<string name="93840">He shrugs. &quot;Have it your way, I guess. Good luck down there, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="93841">&quot;Yeah? Could&apos;a fooled me. Hmmm... wonder if the kitchen&apos;s got more gruel, yet?&quot;</string>
<string name="93842">&quot;Ahhhh, that&apos;s too bad. You needs Tomi helpin&apos; ya, that&apos;s what. I&apos;m the original lucky charm, ya know... just, ummm, less horseshoe-shaped.&quot;</string>
<string name="93843">&quot;Well, good! Then maybe we can all get outta this joint soon enough an&apos; move onto better things. Keep it up, aye?&quot;</string>
<string name="93844">&quot;Quiet. I have some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="93845">&quot;Silence! I did not raise you to hear you prattle on!&quot;</string>
<string name="93846">&quot;I would expect more thanks for bringing you back from the dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="93847">&quot;You should not be so disrespectful of the devout.&quot;</string>
<string name="93848">&quot;What?&quot;</string>
<string name="93849">&quot;What&apos;s important is that I just brought you back from the dead.&quot;</string>
<string name="93850">&quot;Do I? You were part of that group back at the inn, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="93851">&quot;I should. You were with that group I talked to in the inn.&quot;</string>
<string name="93852">&quot;Don&apos;t you remember who I am? We spoke at the inn.&quot;</string>
<string name="93853">&quot;Perhaps dying again would jog your memory.&quot;</string>
<string name="93854">&quot;Are you kidding me?&quot;</string>
<string name="93855">&quot;No, my name is &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="93856">&quot;I should move on.&quot;</string>
<string name="93857">&quot;What are you going to do, now?&quot;</string>
<string name="93858">&quot;Don&apos;t you wonder what happened to the rest of your group?&quot;</string>
<string name="93859">&quot;How did you end up here?&quot;</string>
<string name="93860">&quot;Just who are you, anyway?&quot;</string>
<string name="93861">&quot;Does it really matter? I&apos;m not here to rescue any of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="93862">&quot;No, I haven&apos;t found her. Why?&quot;</string>
<string name="93863">&quot;I found her, yes, and sent her back to the inn.&quot;</string>
<string name="93864">&quot;I found her, yes, but she&apos;s dead. Just as you were.&quot;</string>
<string name="93865">&quot;I found a rakshasa pretending to be her.&quot;</string>
<string name="93866">&quot;What are you going to do, now?&quot;</string>
<string name="93867">&quot;Not a chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="93868">&quot;I don&apos;t think so, no.&quot;</string>
<string name="93869">&quot;I could use your help, sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="93870">&quot;So how did the drow catch you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93871">&quot;So where are these slaves you mention?&quot;</string>
<string name="93872">&quot;What&apos;s this about a djinni?&quot;</string>
<string name="93873">&quot;I found her with some slaves. She&apos;s determined to help them.&quot;</string>
<string name="93874">&quot;No thanks.&quot;</string>
<string name="93875">&quot;Sure, come along.&quot;</string>
<string name="93876">&quot;I am not your personal savior.&quot;</string>
<string name="93877">&quot;Not so well, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="93878">&quot;It&apos;s going well, so far.&quot;</string>
<string name="93879">&quot;I could use your help, actually.&quot;</string>
<string name="93880">This elegantly dressed, well manicured, beautiful woman smiles at you. </string>
<string name="93881">&quot;A list of men I need to conquer and... well,&quot; she licks her lips, &quot;I&apos;m sure you get the idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="93882">&quot;Yes, of course. Let&apos;s get right to business: I have a gift here for you. Something to help you on your quest.&quot;</string>
<string name="93883">&quot;But pleasures must be denied in such trying times.&quot;</string>
<string name="93884">&quot;Sure I can, darling. I&apos;m a priestess of Sune, Goddess of Beauty. Besides, I wouldn&apos;t do anything more than look and... heal, without your permission.&quot;</string>
<string name="93885">&quot;I&apos;m a priestess of Sune, Goddess of Beauty. Our goddess&apos;s first desire is to find beauty and make it hers. I, as her follower, must do the same. &quot;</string>
<string name="93886">&quot;But, I suppose that&apos;s not why I&apos;m here. Durnan called upon my temple for help, so I came. He seems to think I might have items that could aid you on your quest.&quot;</string>
<string name="93887">&quot;Goodbye, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I do hope we get the chance to meet again later.&quot;</string>
<string name="93888">&quot;I&apos;ve all manner of wares devoted to the healing arts. Normally I&apos;d expect a large donation for each of them, but given the circumstances I&apos;ll just need enough gold to cover their basic cost.&quot;</string>
<string name="93889">&quot;First I have something for you. A gift from my temple to aid those defending Waterdeep. I was saving it until Durnan had organized his expedition into Undermountain, but it looks like you&apos;re the only one left.&quot;</string>
<string name="93890">&quot;It&apos;s a Rod of Resurrection - an item of such power it can actually raise the dead. Based on all the rumors about Undermountain you&apos;re going to need it.&quot;</string>
<string name="93891">&quot;Those four eager souls who charged on ahead likely have need of its power, so don&apos;t be afraid to use it on them if you stumble across their bodies. The Rod has several charges.&quot;</string>
<string name="93892">&quot;Really? You might want to reconsider that attitude. Undermountain is a dangerous place, and few are brave enough to venture into its depths.&quot;</string>
<string name="93893">&quot;If you find the remains of one of those brave adventurers and restore them to life, they might be wiling to help you in your quest. I doubt you&apos;ll find many others who will accompany you into Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="93894">&quot;Now let me show you the rest of my items. Normally I&apos;d ask a large donation for each of them, but since you&apos;re trying to save the city I&apos;ll only need enough to cover their base cost.&quot;</string>
<string name="93895">She laughs a high, girlish laugh, &quot;Ah, so young, so eager; I do think I like you. But I suppose we really must keep our mind on saving the city rather than on more... interesting... topics.&quot;</string>
<string name="93896">&quot;Of course. It would be a pleasure to answer any questions you might have.&quot;</string>
<string name="93897">&quot;No more than you, I suspect. I&apos;ve heard you were attacked in your own bed.&quot; She arches her eyebrows. &quot;That&apos;s why I&apos;m careful to make sure I never sleep alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="93898">&quot;Very little. A dark and dangerous place. Normally I find both danger and the dark to be very... stimulating. But Undermountain is a little too dark and dangerous for my taste.&quot;</string>
<string name="93899">&quot;You should speak to Durnan about this. Or maybe Tanarell, the old paladin upstairs. He used to adventure into Undermountain, though he&apos;s not nearly as adventurous as I was hoping.&quot;</string>
<string name="93900">She gives you a mischievous grin. &quot;I spoke with him earlier and he wasn&apos;t the least bit interested in exploring with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93901">She gives you a coy smile. &quot;What an absolutely delicious thing to say.&quot;</string>
<string name="93902">&quot;But I am sure there are more important, albeit less entertaining, things to talk about.&quot;</string>
<string name="93903">&quot;Sune knows that beauty comes in many forms, and there&apos;s a lot to be said for experience. Unfortunately, he told me it wouldn&apos;t be proper...&quot;</string>
<string name="93904">&quot;The followers of Sune worship beauty in all its forms. We desire to possess those things we recognize as beautiful, and we aren&apos;t afraid to express this desire.&quot;</string>
<string name="93905">&quot;Of course, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Just stand still, this won&apos;t hurt a bit. In fact, it should feel quite... pleasant.&quot;</string>
<string name="93906">&quot;You know who I am?&quot;</string>
<string name="93907">&quot;Your list?&quot;</string>
<string name="93908">&quot;I don&apos;t have time for this. Durnan said you had something for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93909">&quot;Hey! You&apos;re a priestess, you can&apos;t act like that!&quot;</string>
<string name="93910">&quot;What kind of god do you follow?&quot;</string>
<string name="93911">I&apos;ll be going now.</string>
<string name="93912">&quot;Let me see what items you have.&quot;</string>
<string name="93913">&quot;What is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="93914">&quot;If they&apos;re stupid enough to rush off, then they got what they deserved.&quot;</string>
<string name="93915">&quot;Do you have anything else I could use?&quot;</string>
<string name="93916">&quot;If I come across their bodies, I&apos;ll be sure to try and help them.&quot;</string>
<string name="93917">&quot;That&apos;s too bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="93918">&quot;Sounds interesting. We&apos;ll have to try that sometime.&quot; </string>
<string name="93919">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="93920">&quot;Do you know anything about these attacks?&quot;</string>
<string name="93921">&quot;What do you know about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="93922">&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;</string>
<string name="93923">&quot;He&apos;s a foolish man to pass up an opportunity like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="93924">&quot;Isn&apos;t he a little old for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="93925">&quot;Tell me about your faith.&quot;</string>
<string name="93926">&quot;Maybe we could *honor* your god together.&quot;</string>
<string name="93927">&quot;I need healing.&quot;</string>
<string name="93928">&quot;Durnan said you have something for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="93929">This display has a number of interesting weapons for viewing.</string>
<string name="93930">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="93931">&quot;Hey you! Don&apos;t touch that!&quot;</string>
<string name="93932">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Successful]&lt;/Start&gt; You slip an item out. The guard glances over at you, but doesn&apos;t seem to notice anything.</string>
<string name="93933">You decide to move along, before he gets suspicious.</string>
<string name="93934">The guard eyes you suspiciously. You had better try your luck somewhere else.</string>
<string name="93935">Leave the display.</string>
<string name="93936">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Pick Pocket]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="93937">This door has been locked and barred because of the curfew in Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="93938">Me be Grayban. Me usually guard well. But no one can enter now so door be locked.</string>
<string name="93939">Yes. Bye.</string>
<string name="93940">Me not like talk &apos;bout it.</string>
<string name="93941">Boss said no one enters. Him told so by wizard guy.</string>
<string name="93942">Well go to Undermountain. But that closed &apos;cause of fights.</string>
<string name="93943">Now, no more question. You go. You want in, must talk to boss.</string>
<string name="93944">You no can enter well. You gets Durnan say so first.</string>
<string name="93945">Durnan say you be hero. You can go in well. You be careful. Great danger in Undermountain.</string>
<string name="93946">Glad you still be alive. Me thinked maybe you not make it. Sorry.</string>
<string name="93947">Me no like talk &apos;bout it.</string>
<string name="93948">Oh! That be me shield. If only me had &apos;nuff gold to pay healer for arm to grow back.</string>
<string name="93949">But me doesn&apos;t. Me only has 50 gold, which means maybe in couple of years.</string>
<string name="93950">Unless you takes me 50 gold for find shield. That be all me gots left, but you deserving it.</string>
<string name="93951">Oh, you be the kindest &lt;man/woman&gt; me ever meet.</string>
<string name="93952">Maybe someday me can pay you back. Can me warn you &apos;bout something?</string>
<string name="93953">Okay. Guess you knows what you doing.</string>
<string name="93954">Me hear things and one time me hear &apos;bout Skullport. Maybe if you goes there, you find Frauzetaulen. </string>
<string name="93955">If him alive, maybe him help you. Him be tough wizard, help me party once. Told us him lives in Skullport.</string>
<string name="93956">You go see him if you goes down there. Now me gots to guard door. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="93957">Thank you. That be good.</string>
<string name="93958">Now just one more year. One more year.</string>
<string name="93959">Okay. Me understand. Maybe me get arm back someday.</string>
<string name="93960">What you want. You gots me money, now leave me alone.</string>
<string name="93961">Okay. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="93962">Where you arm be? </string>
<string name="93963">What happened to your arm?</string>
<string name="93964">Why no one can enter? </string>
<string name="93965">Why can&apos;t anyone enter it?</string>
<string name="93966">What be in well? </string>
<string name="93967">What&apos;s in the well?</string>
<string name="93968">Okay. Goodbye.</string>
<string name="93969">Where you arm be? </string>
<string name="93970">What happened to your arm?</string>
<string name="93971">Me find shield. You name be on it.</string>
<string name="93972">I found this shield with your name on it.</string>
<string name="93973">You takes me 50 gold and gets you arm back. </string>
<string name="93974">Here, take this 50 gold and get your arm back.</string>
<string name="93975">No thanks.</string>
<string name="93976">Sure.</string>
<string name="93977">No, you keeps you gold. You needs it. </string>
<string name="93978">No, you keep your gold. You need it.</string>
<string name="93979">Me take you gold. </string>
<string name="93980">I&apos;ll be taking the gold. </string>
<string name="93981">Pulling the rope signals Durnan to haul you back up. Do you wish to pull the rope and return to the Yawning Portal?</string>
<string name="93982">No.</string>
<string name="93983">Yes.</string>
<string name="93984">The rat&apos;s nose twitches and his eyes blink as he looks at you, then he moves on, casually sniffing the floor.</string>
<string name="93985">The rat stares up at you with eyes that seem as old as Undermountain itself. Images flash through your mind in rapid succession.</string>
<string name="93986">You see bones and rotting flesh, glittering objects that fascinate the rat, and more than any other image or emotion, you sense the constant struggle to survive.</string>
<string name="93987">The rat scurries off.</string>
<string name="93988">A warm feeling of gratitude emanates from the rat.</string>
<string name="93989">You get the distinct impression that the rats wants you to follow close behind him, so he can show you something.</string>
<string name="93990">It squeaks in fear and starts to run away.</string>
<string name="93991">The rat nods and moves away.</string>
<string name="93992">You get the impression that the rat has what it considers to be its own treasure, but where that might be, it isn&apos;t telling right now.</string>
<string name="93993">You see images of a large group of creatures moving through the dungeon and killing many of its inhabitants.</string>
<string name="93994">The rat is obviously terrified of the army that attacked Waterdeep. It seems to think of the army as coming from east of here.</string>
<string name="93995">Leave the rat.</string>
<string name="93996">Feed the rat some seeds.</string>
<string name="93997">Attack the rat.</string>
<string name="93998">&quot;Me will follow you.&quot; </string>
<string name="93999">&quot;I will follow you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94000">Focus on the images of the glittering objects.</string>
<string name="94001">Focus on the images of death and decay.</string>
<string name="94002">The ogre wrinkles his brow and bares his teeth in what could only vaguely be called a smile. It is a frightening smile to say the least. </string>
<string name="94003">The ogre chuckles deep in his throat. &quot;Yes, yes, I know; I am supposed to sound vacant-minded, like &apos;Me crush you good!&apos;. But I only play on the stereotype to keep my enemies off guard.&quot;</string>
<string name="94004">&quot;Being a powerful wizard, you&apos;d think people would realize I&apos;m also highly intelligent. But they see this body and assume the worst. My enemies tend to underestimate me. Except for you, of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="94005">&quot;I suppose it is safe to assume that my forces have been devastated beyond repair, so it seems that oversized fairy will rule this level after all. What are your terms of surrender?&quot;</string>
<string name="94006">&quot;I&apos;ve no desire to serve as your slave, my good &lt;sir/madam&gt;. Understandable, I&apos;m sure. But you did defeat me, so you do have certain entitlements.&quot;</string>
<string name="94007">&quot;Well, you defeated me quite handily. To the victor goes the spoils. You&apos;ve spared my life, so you are entitled to certain compensations.&quot;</string>
<string name="94008">&quot;So what I am proposing is that I answer any questions you have, and then you allow me to live. I assure you, I&apos;ll scurry off somewhere so that you never have to deal with me again.&quot;</string>
<string name="94009">The ogre sighs. &quot;I suspected this would end in bloodshed. My luck just seems to be working out that way right now. Very well, let us duel this out to the bitter end.&quot;</string>
<string name="94010">Yes &lt;sir/madam&gt;! I lay my vast repertoire of facts and speculation at your feet in a most humble and undeserving way.</string>
<string name="94011">&quot;My resources are at your disposal. What question can I answer for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94012">&quot;I knew you were an honorable &lt;man/woman&gt;. I thank you for my life, and I wish you luck while you are in this twisted labyrinth of death.&quot;</string>
<string name="94013">&quot;There was a passage leading down, though I couldn&apos;t tell you where it is, exactly. Undermountain has a habit of changing, you see. Things move every so often. Halaster likes to keep us off-balance.</string>
<string name="94014">&quot;But the tunnel is collapsed, in any case. During one of my battles with the Fairy Queen&apos;s forces a spell I unleashed caved it in, sealing it with tons of rock.&quot;</string>
<string name="94015">The ogre rubs his chin in deep thought for a few seconds. &quot;I suppose you could blast your way through the debris. Yes, that might be possible given the resources of this level...&quot;</string>
<string name="94016">&quot;You might be able to find a keg of alchemist&apos;s fire....those have quite a nice explosion. Halaster kept a few of them stashed around down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94017">&quot;Now, is there anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="94018">&quot;Well, if you are careful to put the ingredients together in the right mixtures, there&apos;s an excellent chance the explosion could be controlled. I&apos;m fairly confident it won&apos;t kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94019">&quot;Undermountain is the plaything of Halaster the Mad, an archmage of immense power. As you can guess from his name, he&apos;s also a bit unbalanced. That&apos;s probably why this place is so strange.&quot;</string>
<string name="94020">&quot;Halaster probably knew adventurers would flock to this place, so he stocked its halls with a bizarre assortment of creatures, traps and treasure. I imagine he enjoys watching people in his maze.&quot;</string>
<string name="94021">&quot;Or, to be more precise, I should say I imagine he used to enjoy watching people. Now that he&apos;s gone I doubt he&apos;s paying much attention to events here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94022">&quot;My name is Olgin Hasterean, a powerful ogre mage from a tribe in the Turmish mountains. Among my own people I was regarded as something of an aberration for my intelligence.&quot;</string>
<string name="94023">&quot;The others of my own tribe were simple brutes. They feared me and my magic, and I ruled them like a king. Until Halaster brought me here against my will, though I&apos;m not sure why I was chosen.&quot;</string>
<string name="94024">&quot;Maybe Halaster felt an intelligent ogre would be a fitting addition to his menagerie of creatures. Or maybe he wanted a leader for the other ogres he had running around in his maze.&quot;</string>
<string name="94025">&quot;Whatever the reason, I was transported without warning from my home in the Turmish mountains to this level of Undermountain. I&apos;ve been here ever since.&quot;</string>
<string name="94026">&quot;There&apos;s no escape from Undermountain. You can go deeper into its depths if you wish, but you can&apos;t actually leave. Halaster doesn&apos;t permit it.&quot;</string>
<string name="94027">&quot;At least, he didn&apos;t permit it while he was around. Now that he&apos;s gone, the rules have changed somewhat. That&apos;s why I thought I could take over this level. The Fairy Queen must have thought so, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="94028">&quot;Well, shatter my skull! I just assumed that you were an agent of the Fairy Queen, sent to best my army. This is a far superior situation.&quot;</string>
<string name="94029">&quot;Recently Undermountain has undergone a fundamental shift in the paradigms of power. Needless to say, I sought to capitalize on this change.&quot;</string>
<string name="94030">&quot;I began to recruit followers and spread my influence through this level. Apparently this Fairy Queen had a similar plan. It was inevitable our respective minions would clash.&quot; </string>
<string name="94031">&quot;I had thought this war would end quickly, but her fey powers to charm and dominate have prolonged the hostilities.&quot;</string>
<string name="94032">&quot;Not so much a shift, really. More like a vacuum. Halaster used to keep us all in line, but now that he&apos;s gone it&apos;s anarchy.&quot;</string>
<string name="94033">&quot;Yes, he just seems to have vanished. I couldn&apos;t begin to guess where or why, but I do know that the spells he had in place to control the creatures here in Undermountain have vanished with him.&quot;</string>
<string name="94034">&quot;Once I realized Halaster was in absentia, I decided to try and increase my own power by seizing control of this level of Undermountain. Apparently the Fairy Queen had similar ideas.&quot;</string>
<string name="94035">The ogre raises a large, shaggy eyebrow. &quot;The fey is beaten? Truly?&quot;</string>
<string name="94036">&quot;That is good to know, though I&apos;d rather she was dead entirely. Still, if her power has been broken I can at least take satisfaction in the knowledge she did not succeed where I failed.&quot;</string>
<string name="94037">&quot;Had I only known that you defeated her, my followers would have let you past and I would have congratulated you. Instead, you&apos;ve slaughtered my followers - and hers, I imagine.&quot;</string>
<string name="94038">&quot;I suppose our folly has left the level quite barren now. I&apos;ve no desire to rule a kingdom of corpses. Perhaps I should leave Undermountain and return to my home in the Turmish mountains.&quot;</string>
<string name="94039">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot; </string>
<string name="94040">&quot;You&apos;re pretty well spoken, for an ogre.&quot; </string>
<string name="94041">&quot;Are you sure you&apos;re an ogre? You don&apos;t sound like one.&quot;</string>
<string name="94042">&quot;I think it&apos;s time for you to die now.&quot; </string>
<string name="94043">&quot;I defeated you. Now you are my slave.&quot;</string>
<string name="94044">&quot;What do you mean, &apos;terms&apos;?&quot;</string>
<string name="94045">&quot;I&apos;d rather just kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94046">&quot;Answer my questions now and I&apos;ll decide what to do with you after.&quot;</string>
<string name="94047">&quot;Um... sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="94048">&quot;You&apos;re free to go.&quot; </string>
<string name="94049">&quot;Tell me about this Fairy Queen you mentioned.&quot;</string>
<string name="94050">&quot;Do you know how to get down below this level?&quot;</string>
<string name="94051">&quot;How do I do that?&quot;</string>
<string name="94052">&quot;And bring Waterdeep down on my head?&quot;</string>
<string name="94053">&quot;What do you know about Undermountain?&quot; </string>
<string name="94054">&quot;Who are you? How did you end up here?&quot;</string>
<string name="94055">&quot;Didn&apos;t you ever try to escape?&quot;</string>
<string name="94056">&quot;What fairy?&quot;</string>
<string name="94057">&quot;Don&apos;t get too excited. You are still in my power.&quot;</string>
<string name="94058">&quot;Tell me about this Fairy Queen.&quot;</string>
<string name="94059">&quot;You mentioned a power shift in Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="94060">&quot;Halaster is gone?&quot;</string>
<string name="94061">&quot;The Fairy Queen is defeated.&quot;</string>
<string name="94062">&quot;Enough. It&apos;s time to answer some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94063">&quot;Her forces are destroyed, though I allowed her to live.&quot;</string>
<string name="94064">&quot;I killed her myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="94065">&quot;That will be tough, considering I plan to kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94066">&quot;I have some questions for you first.&quot;</string>
<string name="94067">There is a loud clang and the door opens.</string>
<string name="94068">This door is presently barred from the other side but shows signs of recent use. Perhaps it can be opened somehow.</string>
<string name="94069">&quot;Fight them all!&quot;</string>
<string name="94070">&quot;You will never win!&quot;</string>
<string name="94071">&quot;Back! This realm belongs to us!&quot;</string>
<string name="94072">&quot;Attack! Attack!&quot;</string>
<string name="94073">&quot;The fairy queen rules!&quot;</string>
<string name="94074">&quot;The level is ours!&quot;</string>
<string name="94075">&quot;Fight! Kill them all!&quot;</string>
<string name="94076">&quot;For the sorceress!&quot;</string>
<string name="94077">&quot;Might makes right! Fight fight fight!!&quot;</string>
<string name="94078">&quot;We will have victory!&quot;</string>
<string name="94079">&quot;This level is ours!&quot;</string>
<string name="94080">&quot;Kill! Destroy!&quot;</string>
<string name="94081">&quot;The high mage rules us all!&quot;</string>
<string name="94082">&quot;Rahhr! We rule this place!&quot;</string>
<string name="94083">&quot;Crush their bones!&quot;</string>
<string name="94084">&quot;For the ogre!&quot;</string>
<string name="94085">You almost believe that you saw the skeletal hand of this dead king move... but now that you look closely, it is surely still.</string>
<string name="94086">Approaching the skeleton in its seat, you almost get the sense that it is aware of you... but it does not move or respond, if that is the case.</string>
<string name="94087">Though you get quite close to the dust-covered skeleton, it does not move at all in response.</string>
<string name="94088">A faint flicker of cold light can be seen deep within the dead eye socket of the skeleton... but it does not move.</string>
<string name="94089">There is a hushed aura to this room that whispers of kings long dead. Long enough, perhaps, that even the names of the lands they once ruled have been forgotten.</string>
<string name="94090">As you approach the skeleton, you get an eerie feeling that this dead monarch only slumbers... that he would quickly arise to strike down any who disturbs him.</string>
<string name="94091">The dust in the room has been heavily disturbed. Obviously despite the quiet and the almost tomb-like feel of this chamber, these kings have risen before. Why they are still now, you do not know...</string>
<string name="94092">You hear drow talking to each other in the next room. They have found one of the chains and are preparing to search for the others...</string>
<string name="94093">The statue appears to have locked in place.</string>
<string name="94094">This large, heavy statue looks like it has been built on rollers.  Perhaps it could be rotated.</string>
<string name="94095">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94096">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>

<string name="94102">A large lever sits on the floor before you.  It does not currently function because it seems to be missing a control rod of some kind.  What do you wish to do?</string>
<string name="94103">A large lever sits on the floor before you.  It currently holds a Yellow control rod of some kind.  What do you wish to do?</string>

<string name="94117">You see your reflection in the mirror, but on the ground near your reflection&apos;s feet are many tantalizing objects, almost real enough to touch.</string>
<string name="94118">Your reflection in the mirror seems to have a forlorn look in its eyes, but when you look again, it is gone.</string>
<string name="94119">You see your reflection in the mirror, but on the ground near your reflection&apos;s feet are many tantalizing objects, almost real enough to touch.  For an instant, you thought you saw a strange gleam in your reflection&apos;s eyes.</string>
<string name="94120">This is an entrance portal that Halaster uses to trap creatures in Undermountain.</string>
<string name="94121">Before you is seated the remains of a great king of man.</string>
<string name="94122">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94123">Tracks of four humanoids pass through this corridor.  From the markings you would guess that they passed fairly recently and at great pace.</string>
<string name="94124">You recognize these tracks as belonging to the four adventurers from the Yawning Portal - Linu, Sharwyn, Tomi and Daelan.  They seemed to be moving at a run as the passed through this corridor very recently.</string>
<string name="94125">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94126">A large humanoid seems to have run off in this direction in pursuit of a larger group of creatures.</string>
<string name="94127">You recognize these tracks as belonging to Daelan Red Tiger.  He seems to have been pursuing a group of humanoids in this direction, and from the spacing between his footprints, he seemed to be showing no regard for his own personal safety.</string>
<string name="94128">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94129">A large humanoid seems to have passed in this direction recently.  These tracks seem familiar to you somehow.</string>

<string name="94131">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94132">A large humanoid seems to have passed in this direction recently.  It was pursued by two other humanoids, but they were driven off by a larger group of creatures - you are 90% sure they were Drow.</string>
<string name="94133">You recognize these tracks as belonging to Linu and Tomi.  They seemed to have started in pursuit of a large humanoid, probably Daelan, and then doubled back, pursued by what look like several Drow.</string>
<string name="94134">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94135">A pair of humanoids moved through this area recently.  They seemed to be moving cautiously, checking the area as they go.</string>

<string name="94139">You recognize these tracks as belonging to Linu and Tomi.  The tracks move cautiously around the portal that is in front of you, but do not lead away.  They must have entered it and gone who knows where.</string>
<string name="94140">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94141">A pair of humanoids moved through this area recently.  Their tracks lead down the stairs that beckon just in front of you.</string>
<string name="94142">You recognize these tracks as belonging to Linu and Tomi.  They must have got past the colored pillars as well, as their tracks lead to the stairs in front of you that lead down.</string>
<string name="94143">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94144">A pair of humanoids moved through this area recently.  They seemed to have slowed almost to a stop at this point and spent some time cautiously looking around.</string>
<string name="94145">You recognize these tracks as belonging to Linu and Tomi.  They seemed to have stopped short at this point and taken great care with something directly in front of them.  The smaller one seems to have spent a bit of time checking something at floor level.</string>
<string name="94146">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>

<string name="94149">The chests in front of you radiate with illusionary magic.</string>
<string name="94150">A winch and pulley system above this pedestal looks as if a chain of some sort could be attached to it.</string>
<string name="94151">This particular chain does not appear to fit here.</string>
<string name="94152">The chain winches easily into place.</string>
<string name="94153">Do nothing.</string>
<string name="94154">Attach the yellow chain.</string>
<string name="94155">Attach the red chain.</string>
<string name="94156">Attach the purple chain.</string>
<string name="94157">Attach the green chain.</string>
<string name="94158">Colors within the pool swirl, but nothing happens.</string>
<string name="94159">This door has been magically locked.</string>
<string name="94160">Come back here with that chain you little toad!</string>
<string name="94161">Aiiieeeeeee!  Get away.  It&apos;s mine... mine!  My brudder Ugtump said I could keep da yellow chainsie. </string>
<string name="94162">Now that they&apos;ve been marked, we&apos;ll see what Halaster&apos;s magic will do to them.</string>
<string name="94163">You sense a discharge of magical energies.</string>
<string name="94164">You sense a discharge of magical energies.</string>
<string name="94165">&quot;Uh... wait. Just wait. You don&apos;t want to kill me. I can help you. I know stuff.&quot;</string>
<string name="94166">&quot;You&apos;re just like all the rest - everyone&apos;s trying to kill me! I&apos;ll show you!&quot;</string>
<string name="94167">&quot;I ain&apos;t all that smart, you know. But I&apos;ll try to answer what I can.&quot;</string>
<string name="94168">&quot;Oh, okay. Well... goodbye, I guess. I&apos;ll just stay here where it&apos;s safe until my dad gets free and puts things back to the way they were.&quot;</string>
<string name="94169">&quot;I used to know everything about this place. Even when Halaster changed it around, he&apos;d pull me aside and explain what he was up to. But now... now I don&apos;t know nothing!&quot;</string>
<string name="94170">&quot;Monsters fighting and killing, armies of drow running loose everywhere. That just ain&apos;t right.&quot;</string>
<string name="94171">&quot;Everyone here used to treat me real nice, but nothing&apos;s the same since dad got snatched up. Now everyone here is trying to kill me!&quot;</string>
<string name="94172">&quot;I know he made me. At least, he told me that before the drow captured him. And I got no reason to think he&apos;s lying, seeing as how he&apos;s my dad and all.&quot;</string>
<string name="94173">The creature seems momentarily confused. &quot;Oh... sorry. Halaster&apos;s always telling me to watch my manners. My name&apos;s Berger. Halaster is my dad.&quot;</string>
<string name="94174">&quot;What do you mean by that? Do you think I&apos;m lying? I don&apos;t lie! Halaster is so my father. He even told me so.&quot;</string>
<string name="94175">&quot;Halaster made me. Told me he sewed me together himself. I helped him run this place. Everyone used to be real nice to me. They used to smile and nod and say: Hello, Berger.&quot;</string>
<string name="94176">&quot;But now things ain&apos;t so nice. Ever since dad got snatched up, the others don&apos;t take such a shine to me. Them dark elves is especially bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="94177">&quot;Hey, now that&apos;s just rude! You don&apos;t gotta be all mean and such. But don&apos;t worry... I ain&apos;t gonna hold it against you. At least you aren&apos;t trying to kill me like all the others.&quot;</string>
<string name="94178">&quot;That&apos;s right. My dad&apos;s in the clutches of them... them dark skinned... pointy-eared... silver-haired... no good drow! Now they&apos;re after me, too!&quot;</string>
<string name="94179">&quot;Ever since they grabbed up my dad, them drow have been trompin&apos; around Undermountain wherever they please. That&apos;s not right. Halaster doesn&apos;t like people just marching around here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94180">&quot;But they can&apos;t kill dad, or Undermountain will come crashin&apos; down around their ears. So they keep him alive. And when he gets out, he&apos;s going to be *mad*! Then them drow&apos;ll be sorry!&quot;</string>
<string name="94181">&quot;Aww, don&apos;t say that! Halaster&apos;s all I got in this world. I&apos;d go after him myself, but I know I don&apos;t got any chance against them drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="94182">&quot;Me? Uh... no. Wait! I could... no. Oh, I know! I&apos;ll just... no. I don&apos;t got no plan. I&apos;m not real good at planning.&quot;</string>
<string name="94183">&quot;But maybe you could help! You look real smart. And tough. I bet you could just smash them drow and rescue my dad easy!&quot;</string>
<string name="94184">&quot;Huh? Oh... you mean like a reward, don&apos;t you? Uh... well, I don&apos;t got nothing I can give you. But you have to help Halaster, you just have to! He&apos;ll fix everything then.&quot;</string>
<string name="94185">&quot;You will? Yipee! I know you&apos;ll do it, too. I can tell just by looking at you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94186">&quot;As soon as he&apos;s free again, he&apos;ll take care of those dark elves! He&apos;ll make them sorry they were mean to me. Them and all the others. They&apos;ll all be sorry. Real sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="94187">&quot;He&apos;ll put things right, like before. Monsters in Undermountain will stay in Undermountain, and them drow will be booted back down to the Underdark where they belong!&quot;</string>
<string name="94188">&quot;Aw, don&apos;t be that way. Once dad&apos;s free he&apos;ll put things right. Undermountain will be like it was before. Monsters will stay where they belong, and the drow won&apos;t be welcome here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94189">&quot;Dad&apos;s down on the lower levels. Somewhere. I really don&apos;t know where. I been spending all my time running from the drow and the rest of the creatures here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94190">&quot;He ain&apos;t insane! You just don&apos;t understand him &apos;cause he&apos;s so smart and all. Nobody does. But if you help him, he&apos;ll help you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94191">&quot;Found the chains and thumped them drow, I bet. That&apos;ll learn them. Halaster&apos;s gonna be real proud of you for that.&quot;</string>
<string name="94192">&quot;You&apos;re an abomination... time to die!&quot;</string>
<string name="94193">&quot;I&apos;m done with you. Time to die.&quot;</string>
<string name="94194">&quot;Okay, I&apos;ll let you live if you answer my questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94195">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="94196">&quot;What can you tell me about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="94197">&quot;Dad? You mean Halaster?&quot;</string>
<string name="94198">&quot;What do you know about Halaster?&quot;</string>
<string name="94199">&quot;What are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94200">&quot;Funny. You look like a flesh golem to me.&quot;</string>
<string name="94201">&quot;Halaster&apos;s your father?&quot;</string>
<string name="94202">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="94203">&quot;Creating something as annoying as you proves Halaster was insane.&quot;</string>
<string name="94204">&quot;You said Halaster was a prisoner?&quot;</string>
<string name="94205">&quot;Halaster&apos;s a prisoner?&quot;</string>
<string name="94206">&quot;What if he never gets free?&quot;</string>
<string name="94207">&quot;Do you have a plan to free him?&quot;</string>
<string name="94208">&quot;What&apos;s in this for me if I help you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94209">&quot;Don&apos;t worry - I&apos;ll find a way to free Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="94210">&quot;Forget it!&quot;</string>
<string name="94211">&quot;So where is Halaster being held?&quot;</string>
<string name="94212">&quot;Why would I save someone as insane as Halaster?&quot;</string>
<string name="94213">&quot;I found the four chains.&quot;</string>
<string name="94214">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94215">You here the sound of a door being unlocked somewhere...</string>
<string name="94216">You...you are the one from the prophecy...my mistress must be informed.</string>
<string name="94217">How did you get in here? No matter, I shall make short work of you!</string>
<string name="94218">You should speak to Shareesh. He is our leader here.</string>
<string name="94219">Shareesh says the portal can lead us to freedom. But without the activation stone we have no way to use it!</string>
<string name="94220">The Rakshasa you killed were our captors... and our protectors. Now we are defenseless. We must escape this place before the Drow discover us.</string>
<string name="94221">Shareesh says the Drow have invaded Undermountain. He thinks they may have captured Halaster himself!</string>
<string name="94222">Halaster&apos;s magic kept the peace in Undermountain, but since he disappeared, the creatures here have turned against each other.</string>
<string name="94223">I don&apos;t agree with a lot of things Shareesh says, but he&apos;s the one in charge. Nobody listens to what I have to say.</string>
<string name="94224">Everyone says the portal will lead us to freedom... but how do we know it isn&apos;t a trap?</string>
<string name="94225">When Halaster was running things down here, we knew there was no escape for us. But at least we didn&apos;t have to fear for our lives!</string>
<string name="94226">Most of the others are glad Halaster is gone, but I don&apos;t know. Is it better to be a slave to a wizard, or captured by the Drow?</string>
<string name="94227">The creatures in Undermountain used to get along fine, but now that Halaster isn&apos;t here to keep them in line...</string>
<string name="94228">You should speak to Shareesh in the other room. He&apos;s our leader.</string>
<string name="94229">Shareesh says the portal in the other room can get us out of here. I hope he&apos;s right.</string>
<string name="94230">Stay away from that sarcophagus over there. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s inside, but I don&apos;t want to find out.</string>
<string name="94231">The Drow never used to come through Undermountain. But now that Halaster&apos;s gone, I guess there&apos;s nothing left to stop them.</string>
<string name="94232">That cleric of Lathander says she&apos;ll stay here and protect us until we escape this place. If we ever escape this place.</string>
<string name="94233">You should speak to our leader, Shareesh. He&apos;s in the other room.</string>
<string name="94234">Shareesh thinks that portal in the other room can take us right to Waterdeep... if we get the activation stone.</string>
<string name="94235">It&apos;s a good thing that cleric, Brit, promised to watch over us. We need all the help we can get.</string>
<string name="94236">Shareesh always said we&apos;d be free one day. Now that Halaster is gone, I&apos;m starting to believe him.</string>
<string name="94237">Stay away from that sarcophagus, if you know what&apos;s good for you. I get a bad feeling just looking at it.</string>
<string name="94238">&quot;Hello again, &lt;FullName&gt;. What can I do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94239">&quot;I guess I could answer some questions for you, though if you want information you should probably talk to Shareesh in the next room. He&apos;s the leader of these poor slaves.&quot; </string>
<string name="94240">&quot;Undermountain was created by an insane archmage... I&apos;d be surprised if it didn&apos;t feel strange down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94241">&quot;It&apos;s not that strange. I am a priestess of Sehanine Moonbow, after all. Helping others is a duty I gladly accept. I&apos;m just here to protect these poor slaves. Someone has to watch over them, right?&quot;</string>
<string name="94242">&quot;I know it&apos;s an instrument of great evil... and that&apos;s enough to make me leave it alone. Touching it might release some kind of demon or terrible undead creature.&quot;</string>
<string name="94243">&quot;Yes, of course. But I don&apos;t want to risk innocent lives to do it. As long as these slaves are still here, we should leave the sarcophagus closed.&quot;</string>
<string name="94244">&quot;Very little. If you have questions you should go speak with Shareesh in the other room... he would probably know far more than I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="94245">&quot;I wish I could be more helpful, but I&apos;ve spent most of my time here. There are many dangerous creatures in Undermountain: drow, rakshasa... someone has to keep watch over these poor slaves.&quot;</string>
<string name="94246">&quot;Was there anything else, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="94247">&quot;These people need my help, I can&apos;t turn my back on them. So until these slaves escape Undermountain, I&apos;m going to stay here to protect them.&quot;</string>
<string name="94248">&quot;Ah yes, the halfling. No doubt he&apos;s given you some wild story, but you can&apos;t trust him. He&apos;s nothing but a thief and a liar!&quot; </string>
<string name="94249">&quot;The truth is this: I&apos;m staying here to watch over these slaves. Undermountain is a dangerous place. If I don&apos;t stay here to protect them, who will? Halaster&apos;s Rakshasa guards?&quot;</string>
<string name="94250">&quot;How did I get past them? Uh... well, they weren&apos;t there when I... no, I mean... uh... damn you and your questions!&quot;</string>
<string name="94251">Linu steps back from you, her face twisted into a mask of inhuman rage.</string>
<string name="94252">&quot;Enough of these games! We will feast on your flesh and gnaw on your bones!&quot;</string>
<string name="94253">&quot;You do? This is excellent news, &lt;FirstName&gt;! Quickly, you should give it to Shareesh in the other room. He will know what to do with it.&quot;</string>
<string name="94254">You recognize Linu, the priestess of Sehanine Moonbow, from the Yawning Portal. She seems lost deep in thought, although she does look up as you approach.</string>
<string name="94255">&quot;Yes? Can I help you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94256">&quot;Goodbye, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="94257">Linu steps back from you, a look of wry amusement on her face.</string>
<string name="94258">&quot;If you really wanted to kill poor Linu, I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re too late. But maybe I can arrange for you to join her!&quot;</string>
<string name="94259">&quot;Oh... yes, &lt;FullName&gt;. Of course I recognize you. I&apos;m just... I just have a lot on my mind. These poor slaves, trapped here; I wish there was something I could do to help them.&quot; </string>
<string name="94260">&quot;Maybe... maybe you could help them, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I would do it myself, but I don&apos;t want to leave these poor souls all alone. I have to stay here and guard them.&quot;</string>
<string name="94261">&quot;What a terrible thing to say! Look at these people... they&apos;re helpless, trapped... how can you turn your back on them?&quot;</string>
<string name="94262">&quot;These slaves could escape Undermountain through the portal in the next room, but the portal can only be opened by someone who possesses the activation stone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94263">&quot;You could find that stone for them, &lt;FullName&gt;! I don&apos;t know where it is, but I bet Shareesh does. He&apos;s the leader of these slaves. You should go talk to him in the other room.&quot;</string>
<string name="94264">&quot;I&apos;m sorry you feel that way. But I won&apos;t abandon these poor souls.&quot;</string>
<string name="94265">&quot;Then I wish you luck, &lt;FirstName&gt;. If you do find the stone, please give it to Shareesh in the other room. He will know what to do with it.&quot;</string>
<string name="94266">&quot;Undermountain is a dangerous place. Someone has to stay here and protect these poor souls from the Drow and the Rakshasa and whatever else is out there. If I don&apos;t do it, who will?&quot;</string>
<string name="94267">&quot;I&apos;m here trying to help these people find their freedom.&quot;</string>
<string name="94268">&quot;If only we had the activation stone for this portal, these poor souls could finally be free.  Maybe you could help get if for them, &lt;FullName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="94269">&quot;I&apos;m sick of you, Linu. Time to die!&quot;</string>
<string name="94270">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94271">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intelligence]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Something doesn&apos;t feel right here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94272">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intelligence]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;No... that&apos;s not it. There&apos;s something strange about you being here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94273">&quot;But how did you get past the Rakshasa guards without killing them?&quot;</string>
<string name="94274">&quot;I guess you&apos;re right.&quot;</string>
<string name="94275">&quot;Do you know anything about the sarcophagus in this room?&quot;</string>
<string name="94276">&quot;Shouldn&apos;t we try to destroy this evil?&quot;</string>
<string name="94277">&quot;Have you learned anything while you were down here?&quot;</string>
<string name="94278">&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</string>
<string name="94279">&quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;</string>
<string name="94280">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intelligence]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Something&apos;s not right. How did you get past the Rakshasa guards without killing them?&quot;</string>
<string name="94281">&quot;I ran into Tomi Undergallows. He wanted me to check up on you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94282">&quot;A liar? So why don&apos;t you tell me the truth, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="94283">&quot;Wait a minute... how *did* you get past those Rakshasa guards out front?&quot;</string>
<string name="94284">&quot;I have the activation stone for the portal.&quot;</string>
<string name="94285">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="94286">&quot;I&apos;ve been waiting for a chance to kill you, Linu!&quot;</string>
<string name="94287">&quot;Don&apos;t you recognize me, Linu? It&apos;s &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="94288">&quot;Why should I help them?&quot;</string>
<string name="94289">&quot;You&apos;re right. What can I do to help them?&quot;</string>
<string name="94290">&quot;What can I do to help them?&quot;</string>
<string name="94291">&quot;Forget it. I don&apos;t have time to help a bunch of worthless slaves!&quot;</string>
<string name="94292">&quot;Don&apos;t worry - I&apos;ll find that activation stone!&quot;</string>
<string name="94293">Why can&apos;t you find the activation stone for them?</string>
<string name="94294">&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</string>
<string name="94295">&quot;Are you okay, Linu? I was worried about you leaving you here. I thought... wait a minute! You&apos;re not Linu!&quot;</string>
<string name="94296">&quot;What... what are you talking about? Did you hit your head on something?&quot;</string>
<string name="94297">&quot;Oh, no... you&apos;re not fooling me! You can&apos;t con a con artist: I&apos;ve got a nose for things that stink, and this smells worse than any outhouse I&apos;ve ever been in. You&apos;re not Linu!&quot;</string>
<string name="94298">&quot;Very clever, halfling. But it&apos;s too late to save your friend now... and too late to save yourself!&quot;</string>
<string name="94299">This strange looking rock seems to have a slot cut into its smooth surface.  </string>
<string name="94300">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Do nothing.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94301">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Insert the Activation Stone into the slot.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94302">The sarcophagus before you is empty, but still reeks of decay.</string>
<string name="94303">The sarcophagus before you has been hastily stuffed with the mangled body of Linu, the priestess of Sehanine Moonbow.</string>
<string name="94304">Before you can do anything with this sarcophagus, Linu calls out a stern warning:</string>
<string name="94305">&quot;Don&apos;t touch that! I don&apos;t know what evil lurks inside, but I can feel its foul presence. If you open the sarcophagus, you&apos;ll release whatever is trapped inside!&quot;</string>
<string name="94306">Inside you see the mangled body of Linu, the priestess of Sehanine Moonbow. You realize something is very wrong here. </string>
<string name="94307">&quot;You just had to go and look inside, didn&apos;t you? *sigh* I guess there&apos;s no reason to continue this charade any longer.&quot; </string>
<string name="94308">&quot;Thank you. There are too many innocent people here, too many lives that could be lost. The best thing we can do right now is to just leave whatever&apos;s inside that sarcophagus alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94309">&quot;Of course, but these slaves are helpless! If you open that sarcophagus, you&apos;ll put every one of them at risk! We have to consider their safety first.&quot;</string>
<string name="94310">&quot;I&apos;m sure you can. But what about these slaves? You can&apos;t protect them all against whatever evil you might unleash.&quot;</string>
<string name="94311">Bring her back to life.</string>
<string name="94312">Close the lid and let her rest in peace.</string>
<string name="94313">Ignore Linu and open the sarcophagus.</string>
<string name="94314">&quot;Sorry... I&apos;ll leave it alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94315">&quot;Don&apos;t you want to destroy this evil?&quot;</string>
<string name="94316">&quot;Don&apos;t worry - I can handle whatever&apos;s inside here!&quot;</string>
<string name="94317">&quot;Yes, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? Is there something you need?&quot;</string>
<string name="94318">&quot;Please hurry, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. We are only safe in this chamber until the other denizens of Undermountain realize you have slain the Rakshasa that were keeping us prisoner.&quot;</string>
<string name="94319">&quot;Of course, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. What do you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="94320">&quot;In our time here as Halaster&apos;s slaves, we have learned something of his secrets. Undermountain is filled with traps and devices to help the mad wizard maintain control. The chains you speak of were one such method.&quot;</string>
<string name="94321">&quot;The central chamber leads down to the lowest level of Undermountain. The doors to the chamber were held open by four powerful chains - without them, the doors would slam shut and remain forever sealed.&quot;</string>
<string name="94322">&quot;This would restrict movement between this level and the one beneath it - a way for Halaster to seal the level in an emergency. Just one more way he could maintain control over everyone and everything in Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="94323">&quot;So the chains are gone, which means the doors are now sealed. I suspected as much. Halaster - or maybe one of his apprentices - must have triggered the doors to the central chamber in an effort to try and stop the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="94324">&quot;I suspected as much. Halaster - or maybe one of his apprentices - must have triggered the doors to the central chamber in an effort to try and stop the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="94325">&quot;The doors were designed so that once closed, the chains would be scattered throughout this level of Undermountain. That way, Halaster could collect the chains at his leisure and re-open the central chamber once the trouble had passed.&quot; </string>
<string name="94326">&quot;Each of the four chains would teleport itself to a random section of the dungeon; I doubt even Halaster himself knew for certain where they would appear.&quot;</string>
<string name="94327">&quot;But I know where one of these chains has reappeared. Of course, I will only tell you its location after you bring me the activation stone for the portal that will lead us safely to the surface.&quot; </string>
<string name="94328">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The old man shakes his head defiantly, seeming to find a long forgotten inner strength.</string>
<string name="94329">&quot;Forgive me, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;, but I will not help you until after you have given us the activation stone for the portal. This is our once chance for freedom - our one hope to escape this place.&quot;</string>
<string name="94330">&quot;The location of the chain is all we have to bargain with. I will not give up my secret until after we have the activation stone.&quot; </string>
<string name="94331">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Forgive me, my lady. Maybe I&apos;ve been trapped in this dark place too long, but I fear I have lost my ability to trust anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94332">&quot;Perhaps they hope to use it as a base for an attack on the surface. Aren&apos;t the drow always trying to conquer or destroy the surface world?&quot; </string>
<string name="94333">&quot;The real question is: how come the drow are still here? In the past, Halaster had absolute control over Undermountain and all the beings who dwell here - he would never have allowed the drow to set up their camps in his domain.&quot;</string>
<string name="94334">&quot;But the drow are here now, and Halaster is missing. I suspect the two are related, but in what way I couldn&apos;t say.&quot;</string>
<string name="94335">&quot;I can only tell you what we have learned in our years serving him. First, he is quite mad. But despite his insanity, you cannot underestimate his power: all of Undermountain stands as a testament to his abilities.&quot;</string>
<string name="94336">&quot;And I know that he has recently vanished; I heard the Rakshasa speaking of his disappearance. I don&apos;t know what happened to him, but I suspect the drow who have recently come to Undermountain are involved.&quot; </string>
<string name="94337">&quot;Halaster hid the activation stone inside a djinni bottle that he kept with him at all times. But now Halaster has disappeared... and so has the bottle.&quot;</string>
<string name="94338">&quot;I don&apos;t know what happened to the mad mage, but I heard the Rakshasa say that drow had overrun the southern chambers. It wouldn&apos;t surprise me to learn that they had something to do with Halaster&apos;s disappearance.&quot;</string>
<string name="94339">&quot;If you want to find the djinni bottle, you should probably investigate their camp. Just be careful... the drow prefer killing strangers to answering their questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94340">Is there anything else I can help you with, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;?</string>
<string name="94341">&quot;Then I have no further use for you!&quot;</string>
<string name="94342">&quot;You have the stone? Quickly - give it to me so we can escape this place once and for all!&quot;</string>
<string name="94343">The djinni bottle at your side begins to shake and rumble. Suddenly, the stopper pops free and a billow of dark smoke rushes forth, materializing into the djinni himself. </string>
<string name="94344">&quot;Forgive the intrusion, but I don&apos;t think you want to give the activation stone to these... hmm, what are you pretending to be this time, Shareesh?&quot;</string>
<string name="94345">&quot;This is none of your concern, you semi-sentient puff of wind! Get back in your bottle where you belong!&quot;</string>
<string name="94346">&quot;I never liked you very much, Shareesh. I&apos;ll go, but first I think this mortal needs to see you in your true form!&quot;</string>
<string name="94347">&quot;You will pay for this, Volkarion! After I feast on this &lt;race&gt; fool&apos;s flesh, I will bind you to my service for a thousand years!&quot;</string>
<string name="94348">&quot;I&apos;d be more worried about what this mortal is going to do to you, Shareesh. I&apos;ll be back inside my bottle if anyone needs me.&quot;</string>
<string name="94349">&quot;Wh... what do you mean, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;? I have been nothing but honest with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94350">&quot;Tomi? You mean Tomi Undergallows? The halfling adventurer? He is nothing but a thief and a liar! Even his own friends don&apos;t trust him!&quot;</string>
<string name="94351">&quot;If you don&apos;t believe me, go speak to Tomi&apos;s own companion - the cleric, Linu. She stayed here to watch over us while Tomi went to try and steal the djinni bottle from the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="94352">&quot;You would be foolish to put your faith in the halfling. Linu told us he is nothing but a liar, full of spite and hate.&quot;</string>
<string name="94353">&quot;Uh... you have to realize that... I mean... you see... uh... Damn your endless interrogations!&quot;</string>
<string name="94354">The old man steps back and rises up to his full height, all trace of his former subservience gone.</string>
<string name="94355">&quot;I tire of your questions, &lt;Race&gt;! The time has come to end this charade!&quot;</string>
<string name="94356">&quot;Yes, of course. Go speak with the cleric. She is in the room at the back.&quot;</string>
<string name="94357">&quot;So, halfling... it seems you still haven&apos;t gotten over your distrust of us. But I assure you, we have no secrets. Go and speak to Linu if you do not believe me. She is in the room at the back.&quot;</string>
<string name="94358">&quot;That&apos;s a good idea. Come on - let&apos;s go talk to Linu and straighten this out.&quot;</string>
<string name="94359">&quot;Yes, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="94360">&quot;I will gladly help you... if you help us escape this place. For even though the Rakshasa are dead, there are still many terrible creatures roaming the halls of Undermountain.&quot;</string>
<string name="94361">This old man approaches you timidly, with his head bowed and his eyes cast down in a subservient manner.</string>
<string name="94362">&quot;The... the Rakshasa in the other room are dead. Did... did you kill them? Are you... are you here to save us?&quot;</string>
<string name="94363">The old man recoils from you in abject terror; a pathetic, fawning creature.</string>
<string name="94364">&quot;Please, we wish you no harm! We are only humble slaves - we are powerless to stand against one such as you!&quot;</string>
<string name="94365">&quot;But if you spare us, we can help you. We know things about Undermountain... valuable information. I will tell you all I know, if you help us.&quot;</string>
<string name="94366">The old man steps back suddenly and rises up to his full height, all trace of his former subservience gone.</string>
<string name="94367">&quot;You seem determined to see blood spilt here. Never fear... we can accommodate your wish!&quot;</string>
<string name="94368">&quot;My name is Shareesh, leader of these people. Or at least, as much a leader as any. You see, everyone here is a slave, a poor soul bound and forced to serve the mad wizard Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="94369">&quot;The Rakshasa outside were supposed to protect us from the other creatures here in Undermountain - and to make sure we never tried to escape.&quot;</string>
<string name="94370">&quot;Not that we could have tried, in any case. Halaster&apos;s magic bound us to this place. But now Halaster has disappeared, and the spells binding us here have faded.&quot; </string>
<string name="94371">&quot;Y... yes. My &lt;lord/lady&gt;. I will get right to the heart of the matter: the halls of Undermountain are overrun with deadly monsters and drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="94372">&quot;I wish it were that easy, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. But there are many terrible creatures roaming the halls of Undermountain, to say nothing of all the drow who have recently appeared.&quot;</string>
<string name="94373">&quot;It would be suicide for us to venture out from these chambers. A few of us might escape these halls, but most would never make it to the surface alive.&quot; </string>
<string name="94374">&quot;But there might be another way for us to escape this place. There is a magic portal in this section of the dungeon, a back door if you will. Halaster built it as an emergency escape route.&quot;</string>
<string name="94375">&quot;The portal can only be used by someone who possesses the proper activation stone. Without it, the portal is useless - a false hope to tempt and torture us. But if we could get that stone...&quot; </string>
<string name="94376">&quot;If you bring the stone to me, I will tell you the location of a powerful magic item... one of the four chains Halaster used to bind open the doors of this level.&quot;</string>
<string name="94377">&quot;As you wish, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="94378">&quot;Thank you, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;. You alone can deliver us to freedom! But if you are to help us, I must first tell you where to find the activation stone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94379">&quot;In our years of slavery, we have learned much about Halaster&apos;s creations. If you agree to help us, I will tell you everything we know about the chains.&quot;</string>
<string name="94380">&quot;I&apos;ll be back once I have the activation stone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94381">&quot;I&apos;ve decided to butcher you like hogs. It&apos;s how I get my kicks.&quot;</string>
<string name="94382">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94383">&quot;What do you know about the magic chains and the central chamber?&quot;</string>
<string name="94384">Do you know where these chains are now?</string>
<string name="94385">But now the doors are sealed.</string>
<string name="94386">&quot;I want to ask about something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="94387">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intimidate]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You better tell me where that chain is... I don&apos;t want this to get nasty.&quot;</string>
<string name="94388">&quot;Then I guess I&apos;ll have to beat it out of you!&quot;</string>
<string name="94389">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade - Flirt]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Do I look like someone who&apos;d betray you? Come on... you can trust me.&quot;</string>
<string name="94390">&quot;Why have the drow come to Undermountain?&quot; </string>
<string name="94391">&quot;What can you tell me about Halaster?&quot;</string>
<string name="94392">&quot;Where can I find the activation stone again?&quot;</string>
<string name="94393">&quot;I have the activation stone right here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94394">&quot;Is there something you&apos;re not telling me?&quot;</string>
<string name="94395">&quot;Never mind. I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="94396">&quot;Tomi said there was something strange about you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94397">&quot;You seem awfully defensive about this.&quot;</string>
<string name="94398">&quot;I think I&apos;ll go speak to Linu about this right now.&quot;</string>
<string name="94399">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intelligence]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Hold on... how did Tomi and Linu get in here without killing the Rakshasa guards?&quot;</string>
<string name="94400">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94401">&quot;Your Rakshasa captors are dead. You&apos;re free.&quot;</string>
<string name="94402">&quot;I killed the Rakshasa - just like I&apos;m going to kill you!&quot;</string>
<string name="94403">&quot;Forget it... I just want to kill you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94404">&quot;Help you? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="94405">&quot;I&apos;ll spare you... for now. Tell me what you know.&quot;</string>
<string name="94406">&quot;Why would I want to save someone like you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94407">&quot;Save you? Save you from what?&quot;</string>
<string name="94408">&quot;The Rakshasa are dead. But who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94409">&quot;I hope there&apos;s a point to all this.&quot;</string>
<string name="94410">&quot;Great. You&apos;re free. So get out of here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94411">&quot;So now that I&apos;ve killed the Rakshasa, you&apos;re free to leave?&quot;</string>
<string name="94412">&quot;I&apos;m too busy to waste my time with this!&quot;</string>
<string name="94413">&quot;I could help you find that stone... for the right reward.&quot;</string>
<string name="94414">&quot;And you want me to find the activation stone?&quot;</string>
<string name="94415">&quot;Maybe I could help you find the activation stone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94416">&quot;I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="94417">&quot;I think I&apos;d rather just slaughter everyone here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94418">&quot;Okay, I&apos;ll try and find the activation stone for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94419">&quot;That&apos;s okay - I can find it without your help.&quot;</string>
<string name="94420">&quot;Actually, I&apos;d rather ask you some questions first.&quot;</string>
<string name="94421">&quot;Okay, where can I find the activation stone?&quot;</string>
<string name="94422">&quot;What do you know about those chains?&quot;</string>
<string name="94423">squeak... squeak...</string>
<string name="94424">Instead of scampering away at your approach, this rat stands its ground and regards you with a brazen courage. It is obviously well fed.</string>

<string name="94426">The rat returns to scavenging for food.</string>

<string name="94439">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94440">A large group of small humanoids has recently passed through.</string>
<string name="94441">A large group of goblin tracks are scattered throughout the area.  </string>
<string name="94442">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94443">A large group of goblinoid creatures were driven away by an even larger group of humanoids.  Blood and the remains of battle can be seen littering the floor surrounding these tracks.</string>
<string name="94444">A large group of hobgoblin tracks are scattered throughout the area.  Some of them seem to have been wounded and trying to flee from some other creatures - It looks as if they were attacked by a large group of Drow and Duergar.  </string>
<string name="94445">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94446">A humanoid and a large group of creatures recently fought in this area.</string>
<string name="94447">These human prints look like they came from Linu.  She seems to have been involved in a violent struggle with numerous large humanoids - with paws?</string>
<string name="94448">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94449">A large humanoid has passed by here recently</string>
<string name="94450">These paw prints look like Rakshasa tracks.  But what would they be doing here?</string>
<string name="94451">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94452">A group of barefooted humans has passed over this area recently.</string>
<string name="94453">These human prints look like they were left by barefooted individuals.  But something seems slightly off about them.  You can&apos;t quite put your finger on it.</string>
<string name="94454">The strange mage brushes the dust from his sleeves before turning his wild-eyed gaze to you. He surveys you thoroughly up and down, twice, then sniffs dismissively.</string>
<string name="94455">Nathyrra seizes your arm and hisses into your ear: &quot;He&apos;s an archmage of tremendous power and unstable temperament. Don&apos;t make him angry!&quot;</string>
<string name="94456">Halaster cocks his head to the side. &quot;You really should listen to your friend. Talking back can lead to a gruesome end.&quot;</string>
<string name="94457">&quot;The last one to sass me was a bold orc named Grug. Ask him what happened, if you know how to speak slug.&quot;</string>
<string name="94458">There is a sudden flash of light and the room fills with colored smoke. When the air clears, you see not one but two versions of the mad wizard standing before you.</string>
<string name="94459">The first Halaster interrupts before the second can answer your question. &quot;Wait just a moment, my identical friend. You seem somewhat confused, and I want it to end.&quot; </string>
<string name="94460">&quot;You were nothing but a safety device. I created a clone, and put it on ice. I knew that one day I might get into trouble. I&apos;m the real Halaster, you&apos;re just my double.&quot;</string>
<string name="94461">The second Halaster shakes his head. &quot;I think you&apos;re mistaken, you were only a ploy. I let the drow catch you, you&apos;re naught but a toy!&quot;</string>
<string name="94462"> &quot;I know how you feel, but you&apos;re not even real. You&apos;re just a double to save me from trouble! It&apos;s hard to accept, but I&apos;m afraid that it&apos;s true. The original Halaster is me and not you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94463">The first Halaster throws his hands up in exasperation. &quot;Which is the clone, which is the master? How will we know the real Halaster? I can&apos;t believe this has happened. What a disaster!&quot;</string>
<string name="94464">Both versions of Halaster turn to look at you, their eyes dark with anger at the interruption. Then, they both smile as an idea pops simultaneously into their heads.</string>
<string name="94465">&quot;We&apos;ll settle this later, when we&apos;re just one on one. But first the Valsharess must suffer for what she has done.&quot;</string>
<string name="94466">&quot;Someone must get her, make her pay for her crime. I&apos;d do it myself, but I can&apos;t spare the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="94467">The first Halaster waves his hand, and you feel the power of his spell coursing through you. It feels as if a hundred tiny hooks have been latched onto your very soul.</string>
<string name="94468">&quot;Nothing much, just a spell to make sure you obey. I put a geas upon you, it&apos;s better this way.&quot;</string>
<string name="94469">&quot;Down to the Underdark is where you will go. You&apos;re working for me now, you can&apos;t really say no.&quot;</string>
<string name="94470">Nathyrra gasps. &quot;The geas will bind you to Halaster&apos;s service. He&apos;s compelled you to enter the Underdark and kill the Valsharess. If you don&apos;t obey him, you&apos;ll wither away and die.&quot;</string>
<string name="94471">&quot;Your dark elven friend speaks words that are true. I think she could help, so I&apos;ll send her down, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="94472">&quot;You have no choice but to do as I say. But once the Valsharess is dead, my spell goes away. After that I promise you&apos;ll truly be free... but don&apos;t do something foolish, like come after me.&quot; </string>
<string name="94473">&quot;You&apos;re sending &lt;FirstName&gt; down into the Underdark? &lt;He/She&gt;&apos;ll have need of my skill in battle. You better send me, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="94474">&quot;You&apos;re sending &lt;FirstName&gt; down into the Underdark? &lt;He/She&gt;&apos;ll have need of my healing. You better send me, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="94475">&quot;You&apos;re sending &lt;FirstName&gt; down into the Underdark? &lt;He/She&gt;&apos;ll have need of my skills. You better send me, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="94476">&quot;Yer sending &lt;FullName&gt; down into the Underdark? It&apos;s full of shadows and traps and treasure! It&apos;s like I was born for that place! You better send me down, too!&quot;</string>
<string name="94477">&quot;No, no, no - it won&apos;t work that way! It&apos;s up to me if you go or you stay. You don&apos;t give me orders here in my home! I&apos;m sending your friend down all alone!&quot;</string>
<string name="94478">&quot;Hey! Deekin not like it when people talk to Boss like that!&quot;</string>
<string name="94479">&quot;Your kobold is brave, though not too bright. Just the kind of ally you might need in this fight.&quot;</string>
<string name="94480">&quot;I&apos;ll send him with you when you go down below. He just might prove useful - you never know.&quot;</string>
<string name="94481">&quot;Don&apos;t say that, Boss! Deekin not let you down! You&apos;ll see!&quot;</string>
<string name="94482">&quot;Thanks, Boss! Deekin not let you down! You&apos;ll see.&quot;</string>
<string name="94483">&quot;I&apos;ll send him with you when you go down below. He just might prove useful - you never know.&quot;</string>
<string name="94484">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;&apos;s going to need more help than just that kobold down there. You better send me along, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="94485">&quot;You don&apos;t tell me what to do! I&apos;m in charge here, not you!&quot;</string>
<string name="94486">&quot;I&apos;ll send *you* back up to the top. Let Waterdeep know the invasion will stop. I&apos;m cleaning house, the drow are no more. Undermountain will be as it was before.&quot;</string>
<string name="94487">&quot;Please, Halaster. Send me down as well. &lt;FirstName&gt; will need help, and I have allies in the Underdark. The Seer also wants to stop the Valsharess. Please.&quot;</string>
<string name="94488">&quot;You make a good point, and you asked real nice. Very well, drow, I&apos;ll take your advice. You can go, too. I won&apos;t leave you here. I&apos;ll send you with &lt;FirstName&gt; to the camp of the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="94489">&quot;Enough time has been wasted, I want you to go. The Valsharess is waiting, far down below.&quot;</string>
<string name="94490">&quot;Goodbye, best wishes, I bid you good luck. Go kill the Valsharess, because until then you&apos;re stuck.&quot; </string>
<string name="94491">&quot;So sorry, no time, you really must go. Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s fine, you&apos;ll do well, I know.&quot;</string>
<string name="94492">&quot;&lt;FullName&gt; will have need of my skill in battle down below. You must send me, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="94493">&quot;If you&apos;re sending Deekin along with &lt;FullName&gt;, you better send me, too. My healing skills could be useful down in the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="94494">&quot;If you&apos;re sending the kobold down there, ye better send me too, wizard! The Underdark is full of shadows and traps and treasure! It&apos;s like I was born for that place!&quot;</string>
<string name="94495">&quot;What can I say? Everyone knows I&apos;m insane. No doubt you&apos;ll know better if this happens again.&quot;</string>
<string name="94496">&quot;Maybe I should have just left you there.&quot;</string>
<string name="94497">&quot;Please tell me you aren&apos;t speaking in rhyme.&quot;</string>
<string name="94498">&quot;You were expecting someone else? Who?&quot;</string>
<string name="94499">&quot;This was all a trap? You let yourself be captured?&quot;</string>
<string name="94500">&quot;Sorry, I didn&apos;t know.&quot;</string>
<string name="94501">&quot;I think I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="94502">&quot;I don&apos;t have time to listen to you two crackpots!&quot;</string>
<string name="94503">&quot;Maybe I can help solve this dilemma.&quot;</string>
<string name="94504">&quot;Is there some kind of reward for freeing you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94505">&quot;Could you guys settle this later?&quot;</string>
<string name="94506">&quot;Stop that! What do you think you&apos;re doing?&quot;</string>
<string name="94507">&quot;What did you just do to me?&quot;</string>
<string name="94508">&quot;I guess I don&apos;t have any choice but to go after this Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="94509">&quot;I&apos;ll find some way to break this geas!&quot;</string>
<string name="94510">&quot;You can&apos;t force me to serve you!&quot;</string>
<string name="94511">&quot;I&apos;d rather not have Deekin go with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="94512">&quot;At least I&apos;ll have some help.&quot;</string>
<string name="94513">&quot;I&apos;m ready. Send me down.&quot;</string>
<string name="94514">&quot;This isn&apos;t over, Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="94515">&quot;Wait. I need time to prepare myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="94516">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94517">&quot;This is the thanks I get for helping you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94518">A powerful force from within the portal prevents you from entering it.</string>
<string name="94519">By examining the portal more closely, it seems it might be possible to channel the energy hissing around the portal towards living beings instead of the portal itself.</string>
<string name="94520">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The magical complexity of this portal seems to be beyond your capabilities.</string>
<string name="94521">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt;You have successfully re-channeled the portal&apos;s energy.</string>
<string name="94522">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Leave the portal]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94523">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Set Trap DC: 25]&lt;/Start&gt; Try to channel the portal&apos;s energy towards living beings.</string>
<string name="94524">This formian communicates with you via telepathy. &quot;Follow me. I will take you down the passage as our Queen has promised, and we will fill in the tunnel behind you so it cannot be used again.&quot;</string>
<string name="94525">You receive an urgent, telepathic message from this creature: &quot;Protect the Queen! Protect the Queen!&quot;</string>
<string name="94526">Much to your surprise, this creature addresses you in the common tongue. &quot;Thank you for releasing me, &lt;race&gt; creature. You are &lt;race&gt;, are you not? I have trouble distinguishing between you bipeds.&quot;</string>
<string name="94527">&quot;As you wish, &lt;race&gt; creature. We will return to the hive and leave you to deal with the drow alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94528">&quot;Protect me, workers! Destroy this &lt;race&gt; creature!&quot;</string>
<string name="94529">&quot;I am the queen of this formian colony, and as such I have learned to master what you call speech. My workers, however, are only part of the collective mind and can only communicate through their thoughts.&quot;</string>
<string name="94530">&quot;I cannot stay to answer your questions, &lt;race&gt; creature. A colony without a queen cannot survive; I must return to the hive before my followers wither and die.&quot;</string>
<string name="94531">&quot;But know that you are a friend of the colony. You have saved a formian queen, and when the time is right the hive shall repay you. Goodbye, &lt;race&gt; creature - we will meet again.&quot;</string>
<string name="94532">&quot;You have the gratitude of the colony, and I declare you to be a friend of the hive. You have saved me from the drow, and when the time comes I will repay your actions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94533">&quot;But now I must return to the hive; a colony without a queen cannot long survive. I must return before my followers wither and die. Goodbye, &lt;race&gt; creature - we will meet again.&quot;</string>
<string name="94534">&quot;Your kind calls us formians. I am queen of this colony, and as such I have learned the common tongue. My workers, however, are part of the collective mind and can only communicate with their thoughts.&quot;</string>
<string name="94535">The formian queen tilts her head forward by way of greeting. &quot;And so we meet again, &lt;race&gt; creature, as we promised. The time has come for the hive to repay you for freeing me from the drow.&quot;</string>
<string name="94536">&quot;To the south is a drow camp. If you enter, you will be forced into a terrible battle against the dark elves - a battle you may not survive. But we know a way to avoid this confrontation.&quot; </string>
<string name="94537">&quot;In the northeast corner of this room is a hidden tunnel my people have dug beneath the earth. This tunnel leads to the chamber beyond, bypassing the drow camp entirely.&quot; </string>
<string name="94538">&quot;If you wish, one of my colony can guide you through the tunnel and past the drow. We will have to fill the tunnel behind you, so you will not be able to use it to come back this way.&quot;</string>
<string name="94539">&quot;As do we. They must be destroyed so they do not threaten the colony again. Very well, &lt;race&gt; creature: my colony will join you in your attack on the drow encampment.&quot;</string>
<string name="94540">&quot;Go there and we will appear once the battle begins, striking from below. Between us, we will slaughter our common foe!&quot;</string>
<string name="94541">&quot;After this, &lt;race&gt; creature, the colony&apos;s debt to you is repaid. Go to the passage in the northeast corner and one of my colony will appear to guide you through the tunnel.&quot;</string>
<string name="94542">&quot;While you go on through the tunnel, my colony will attack the drow. They must be destroyed so that they never threaten us again. Goodbye, &lt;race&gt; creature&quot;.</string>
<string name="94543">&quot;The drow are defeated, the colony is safe once again. We can return to our hive.&quot;</string>
<string name="94544">&quot;Our debt to you is paid, &lt;race&gt; creature. The hive owes you nothing; it is unlikely we will ever meet again.&quot;</string>
<string name="94545">&quot;Kill the drow! Kill them! Kill them all!&quot;</string>
<string name="94546">&quot;I don&apos;t have time for this. Just go.&quot;</string>
<string name="94547">&quot;Time to squash some bugs. Bye-bye, freak!&quot;</string>
<string name="94548">&quot;You speak common?&quot;</string>
<string name="94549">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94550">&quot;Is there some kind of reward for freeing you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94551">&quot;Yes, I&apos;m &lt;race&gt;. What are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94552">&quot;Forget it! I don&apos;t trust you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94553">&quot;Repay me? How?&quot;</string>
<string name="94554">&quot;But I want to fight the drow!&quot;</string>
<string name="94555">&quot;I accept your offer.&quot;</string>
<string name="94556">No way I&apos;m showing up when you&apos;re fighting.  Hazardous duty isn&apos;t part of my contract!</string>
<string name="94557">What! You again!  How dare you disturb my bath.  Go away. I need some rest.</string>
<string name="94558">squeak... squeak...</string>
<string name="94559">The rat scuttles back and forth in front of you, obviously wary.</string>
<string name="94560">Images of enourmous insects prowling the corridors meld with images of flight and escape through hidden passages.</string>
<string name="94561">The rat scurries off.</string>
<string name="94562">You see an image of the rat fleeing from a large drow army marching across a bridge. The rat scampers away down a narrow passage to the north of the bridge until it comes to an apparent dead end.</string>
<string name="94563">The rat sniffs at the stone wall before it for a brief second, then darts through a small crack in an otherwise hidden door.</string>
<string name="94564">You see an enormous colony of ant-like creatures located somewhere to the west of here.</string>
<string name="94565">Leave the rat alone.</string>
<string name="94566">Focus on the hidden passages.</string>
<string name="94567">Focus on the insects.</string>
<string name="94568">These strangely out of place rocks seem to conceal a passage behind them that leads into the cliff face.</string>
<string name="94569">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Do nothing.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94570">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Enter the passage.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94571">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94572">A small group of Drow recently passed through this area.</string>
<string name="94573">A small group of Drow tracks pick their way through this area.  It looks like a small patrol of them recently passed by.</string>
<string name="94574">Humanoid tracks are scattered about the ground in this area.</string>
<string name="94575">A small group of Drow tracks ends near a rock wall.  </string>
<string name="94576">A small group of Drow tracks ends near a rock wall.  They walked up purposefully and did not seem to be searching the surrounding area.</string>
<string name="94577">You have been requested to join the Hero PC in the Realm of the Reaper.  Do you wish to go?</string>
<string name="94578">No</string>
<string name="94579">Yes.</string>
<string name="94580">Smoke billows from the altar in front of you.</string>
<string name="94581">Peering more closely into the smoke you discern a strange shimmering vortex.  Possibly a gateway to another dimension.</string>
<string name="94582">Do nothing.</string>
<string name="94583">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Stick your hand into the vortex.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94584">There does not appear to be any way to open this gate...and the use of force seems to do nothing.</string>
<string name="94585">The Reaper seems to be some kind of custodian of this strange place.  He looks at you expectantly.</string>
<string name="94586">Behold - this door will take you to your party leader.</string>
<string name="94587">Behold - this door will return you.</string>
<string name="94588">Please send a request my party members to join me here.</string>
<string name="94589">No, I want to stick around here awhile.</string>
<string name="94590">I would like to jump to the PC Hero.</string>
<string name="94591">Yes, please teleport me back to where I last died.</string>
<string name="94592">Before you is a table filled with various ingredients and beakers to mix them in.</string>
<string name="94593">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Leave the table alone and walk away.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94594">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Spellcraft]&lt;/Start&gt;&lt;StartAction&gt; [Mix some ingredients together and see what happens.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94595">&quot;You mean you do not know?&quot; Her incredulous look quickly turns suspicious. &quot;Or are you playing with me now? I am already defeated, you need not toy with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="94596">The fairy sighs heavily. &quot;So you are here by chance, then. Yet another adventurer passing through Halaster&apos;s maze.&quot;</string>
<string name="94597">&quot;So I am undone, and the ogre wins the day. How unfortunate. Do what you will with me then, I care not. Death would be welcome.&quot;</string>
<string name="94598">The fairy&apos;s eyes go wide in fear for a moment and she backs away from you several steps. She seems near tears. &quot;How humiliating that an agent of that ogre could do this to me,&quot; she mumbles.</string>
<string name="94599">The fairy eyes you carefully for a long moment, and then smiles in a seductive manner. Her hand catches your attention as she runs in along her thigh slowly.</string>
<string name="94600">&quot;There is no need for us to be enemies, &lt;race&gt; man,&quot; she croons. &quot;I would gladly reward such a handsome creature as yourself, in exchange for my life...&quot;</string>
<string name="94601">She smiles coquettishly. &quot;How I do adore a man with... good sense. Very well, then, my pet. Come to me...&quot;</string>
<string name="94602">A wry smile appears and is gone a moment later. &quot;You are smarter than you seem. Very well, then. Will you at least allow me to bargain for my life?&quot;</string>
<string name="94603">Her eyes linger upon you for a moment longer, then she sighs heavily. &quot;As you wish. Will you at least allow me to bargain for my life?&quot;</string>
<string name="94604">She looks at you desperately. &quot;I am sure we can come to some kind of arrangement, if you will but spare my life.&quot;</string>
<string name="94605">&quot;You don&apos;t? Then... will you allow me to live?&quot;</string>
<string name="94606">&quot;There is gold in the chests behind me... but you no doubt will take what is there, regardless. Beyond that, I have little to offer you.&quot; Her lip starts to tremble. &quot;I simply beg you, please do not kill me.&quot;</string>
<string name="94607">&quot;You are most generous. Thank you for sparing my life. I shall bother you no further.&quot;</string>
<string name="94608">Her eyes harden. &quot;Then we will finish this now.&quot;</string>
<string name="94609">She nods slowly. &quot;Of course, &lt;race&gt; &lt;male/female&gt;. Ask what you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="94610">The fairy&apos;s fear suddenly returns and she shies away once more. She nods carefully. &quot;Of... of course, &lt;race&gt; one. Ask what you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="94611">The fairy&apos;s eyes widen, her fear returning. &quot;And what is to be done with me? Will you allow me to negotiate for my life?&quot;</string>
<string name="94612">&quot;It is an ogre mage, a brutish thug who believes that he should be the ruler of this level. I will never submit to him, so I gathered what allies I could and fought him.&quot;</string>
<string name="94613">&quot;That is all over now, of course. You have left me with nothing, even if you permit me to survive.&quot;</string>
<string name="94614">&quot;What do you wish to ask me, &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="94615">&quot;He makes his camp on the far side of this level of the dungeon, though he has moved his camp several times in the last weeks to avoid being attacked. You will smell him long before you find him.&quot;</string>
<string name="94616">&quot;I thought you to be an emissary of the ogre mage, perhaps... or someone equally disagreeable. One does not trust anyone in Undermountain, especially strangers.&quot;</string>
<string name="94617">She looks at you as if the answer should be obvious. &quot;Of course. With Halaster gone, all of the creatures of Undermountain have been free to do as they wish.&quot;</string>
<string name="94618">The fairy nods. &quot;Halaster has vanished. Nobody knows what has happened to him, he is just... gone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94619">&quot;When mad Halaster ruled Undermountain, he kept a strange peace. Creatures appeared or disappeared, the mountain changed around us... but none of us were permitted to get out of hand.&quot;</string>
<string name="94620">&quot;And then Undermountain stopped changing and chaos ensued. It only became worse when the drow came, of course.&quot;</string>
<string name="94621">&quot;They come to this level in small parties, hunting and gathering what they can. I think they come from deeper in Undermountain... but never have I seen their like prior to recently.&quot;</string>
<string name="94622">She looks away from you and shrugs. &quot;Perhaps they have something to do with the mad mage&apos;s disappearance. I truly do not know.&quot;</string>
<string name="94623">&quot;Undermountain has fallen into chaos ever since Halaster disappeared. I have not visited the levels deeper into the earth, but I have no doubt it is the same there.&quot;</string>
<string name="94624">The fairy shrugs. &quot;I do not know. Once there were stairs near here leading down, but the dread mage moved them, as he is wont to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="94625">&quot;There are teleportation portals on this level, but they do not lead down. They only jump you about the level - though I do not know if they are even working now that Halaster is gone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94626">She gestures around her. &quot;You already know this area, as you have barged through it. That is all that I truly know, I am sad to say.&quot;</string>
<string name="94627">&quot;Throughout the many years that I have been here, the dread mage has changed the level many times. New traps will appear, along with new creatures... and then one day they will be gone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94628">&quot;The ogre mage resides elsewhere on this level, along with his forces. I believe there are teleporting portals still working, though they may be malfunctioning now that Halaster is gone.&quot;</string>
<string name="94629">&quot;I am a fairy. A Fairy Queen, to be precise. And, like all the creatures in Undermountain I was brought here against my will by the mad wizard Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="94630">She casts her eyes down, ashamed. &quot;I... I wasn&apos;t always like this. When I first came here, I was like the others of my kind: small, delicate, beautiful. Now I am a lumbering beast!&quot;</string>
<string name="94631">&quot;When I first came here over fifty years ago I used magic to transform myself to this size. I... I thought I could use my beauty to convince Halaster to free me. But the mad wizard spurned my advances.&quot;</string>
<string name="94632">&quot;As punishment for trying to beguile him, he cast a spell on me, trapping me for a hundred years in this hideous, gigantic body!&quot; She buries her face in her hands, trying to hold back her tears.</string>
<string name="94633">Her shoulders hitch as she chokes back a sob. &quot;I&apos;ve tried everything, but there is no magic powerful enough to break the spell of an archmage. I&apos;ll just have to wait another 47 years, I guess.&quot;</string>
<string name="94634">&quot;Part of me hoped that when Halaster disappeared, the spell binding me to this form would be broken. Since it still persists, I must assume Halaster is still alive.&quot;</string>
<string name="94635">She wipes her eyes and gives you a wane smile. &quot;You are a kind &lt;man/woman&gt; to say that, but I can see clear enough what I am.&quot;</string>
<string name="94636">She shrugs. &quot;Halaster has been known to punish those who have tried to escape. However, now that he is gone I suppose I could leave if I wished. Though I am afraid he might return at any moment.&quot;</string>
<string name="94637">Suddenly she eyes you warily. &quot;You have... defeated him, you say? Does that mean he is dead? Have you killed him?&quot;</string>
<string name="94638">The fairy ponders this news for a moment. &quot;I see. That is unfortunate, but at least the oaf is as weakened as I am now. I will not lose everything... if you intend to spare me, as well, that is.&quot;</string>
<string name="94639">The fairy ponders this news for a moment. &quot;Then it seems we are not enemies after all. Had I known this was so, I would have rewarded you as soon as you entered my domain.&quot;</string>
<string name="94640">&quot;How unfortunate this battle had to happen between us. Perhaps you might be... willing to put this behind us? Would you allow me to negotiate for my life, &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="94641">&quot;The two of us have been locked in battle on this level for many moons, now. I would know his fate, &lt;race&gt; &lt;man/woman&gt;, before I meet my own.&quot;</string>
<string name="94642">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="94643">&quot;I truly do not know what you are talking about.&quot;</string>
<string name="94644">&quot;You wish to die? So be it.&quot; </string>
<string name="94645">&quot;I think we can negotiate on your fate, actually.&quot;</string>
<string name="94646">&quot;Tell me about this ogre you keep mentioning.&quot;</string>
<string name="94647">&quot;I have some questions&quot;</string>
<string name="94648">&quot;If you are referring to the ogre mage, I have already defeated him.&quot;</string>
<string name="94649">&quot;Enough. Time for you to die.&quot;</string>
<string name="94650">&quot;Back off! I&apos;ll have no tricks out of you, fairy!&quot;</string>
<string name="94651">&quot;What am I to do with you, I wonder?&quot;</string>
<string name="94652">&quot;Now that&apos;s the kind of proposal I like!&quot;</string>
<string name="94653">&quot;And allow you to use your fairy magic on me? Not a chance.&quot;</string>
<string name="94654">&quot;Not interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="94655">&quot;I don&apos;t want anything from you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94656">&quot;What can you offer me?&quot;</string>
<string name="94657">&quot;Just go. I don&apos;t want to see you again.&quot;</string>
<string name="94658">&quot;I don&apos;t trust you. I cannot allow you to live.&quot;</string>
<string name="94659">&quot;Never mind that. I have questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94660">&quot;I&apos;ll ask the questions here, if you don&apos;t mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="94661">&quot;I&apos;m done with questioning you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94662">&quot;Tell me about this ogre you keep mentioning.&quot;</string>
<string name="94663">&quot;I want to ask you something else.&quot;</string>
<string name="94664">&quot;Where do I find this ogre mage?&quot;</string>
<string name="94665">&quot;Why did you attack me?&quot;</string>
<string name="94666">&quot;You and this ogre mage fight to rule this level?&quot;</string>
<string name="94667">&quot;Halaster is gone?&quot;</string>
<string name="94668">&quot;The drow came?&quot;</string>
<string name="94669">&quot;What can you tell me about Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="94670">&quot;How do I get to the deeper levels of Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="94671">&quot;What can you tell me about this level?&quot;</string>
<string name="94672">&quot;Who are you and what are you doing here?&quot;</string>
<string name="94673">&quot;Aren&apos;t you a little big to be a fairy?&quot;</string>
<string name="94674">&quot;Quit your pathetic whining!&quot;</string>
<string name="94675">&quot;Serves you right for trying to trick a wizard.&quot;</string>
<string name="94676">&quot;You&apos;re not hideous. You&apos;re very beautiful.&quot;</string>
<string name="94677">&quot;You can&apos;t leave Undermountain?&quot;</string>
<string name="94678">&quot;The ogre is defeated.&quot;</string>
<string name="94679">&quot;He&apos;s alive, but his forces are mostly defeated.&quot;</string>
<string name="94680">&quot;The ogre is quite dead, I assure you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94681">&quot;Forget it. I have no use for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94682">&quot;I want some questions answered.&quot;</string>
<string name="94683">&quot;I&apos;m willing to talk about it.&quot;</string>
<string name="94684">&quot;Why should the ogre&apos;s fate matter to you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94685">Before you is a vine covered basin covered in elven runes and bathed in a green light.</string>
<string name="94686">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Place the Ancient Oak Branch in the Vine Covered Basin.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94687">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Nothing you do seems to affect the basin at the moment.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94688">&quot;Squeek... squeek.&quot;</string>
<string name="94689">The rat wonders if you might not have a spare bit of cheese on your person. Or a spare bit of drow flesh. Mmm... drow flesh.</string>
<string name="94690">The rats thinks that you smell well fed and wonders if maybe it should become an adventurer too.</string>
<string name="94691">The rat tells you that it had a pretty gem this morning, but it got eaten by a chicken. The chicken was then eaten by a cat, which was then torn apart by a pack of dogs.</string>
<string name="94692">The dogs then attacked a group of duergar, who killed most of the dogs. The duergar found the gem, but were then killed by a bunch of guards.</string>
<string name="94693">The rat then starts to tell you how the guards were eaten by dragons when you realize the rat is making this all up as he goes along.</string>
<string name="94694">The rat thinks that drow corpses are the sweetest tasting meat on the streets these days.</string>
<string name="94695">The rat wishes it could live in a flying city like its great, great, great grandfather did. Actually there are quite a few more greats in his explanation, but you get the picture.</string>
<string name="94696">The rat sniffs you and decides that you are not a corpse... yet.</string>
<string name="94697">&quot;Hello rat!&quot;</string>
<string name="94698">The strange mage brushes the dust from his sleeves before turning his wild-eyed gaze to you. He surveys you thoroughly up and down, twice, then sniffs dismissively.</string>
<string name="94699">Nathyrra seizes your arm and hisses into your ear: &quot;He&apos;s an archmage of tremendous power and unstable temperament. Don&apos;t make him angry!&quot;</string>
<string name="94700">Halaster cocks his head to the side. &quot;You really should listen to your friend. Talking back can lead to a gruesome end.&quot;</string>
<string name="94701">&quot;The last one to sass me was a bold orc named Grug. Ask him what happened, if you know how to speak slug.&quot;</string>
<string name="94702">There is a sudden flash of light and the room fills with colored smoke. When the air clears, you see not one but two versions of the mad wizard standing before you.</string>
<string name="94703">The first Halaster interrupts before the second can answer your question. &quot;Wait just a moment, my identical friend. You seem somewhat confused, and I want it to end.&quot; </string>
<string name="94704">&quot;You were nothing but a safety device. I created a clone, and put it on ice. I knew that one day I might get into trouble. I&apos;m the real Halaster, you&apos;re just my double.&quot;</string>
<string name="94705">The second Halaster shakes his head. &quot;I think you&apos;re mistaken, you were only a ploy. I let the drow catch you, you&apos;re naught but a toy!&quot;</string>
<string name="94706"> &quot;I know how you feel, but you&apos;re not even real. You&apos;re just a double to save me from trouble! It&apos;s hard to accept, but I&apos;m afraid that it&apos;s true. The original Halaster is me and not you.&quot;</string>
<string name="94707">The first Halaster throws his hands up in exasperation. &quot;Which is the clone, which is the master? How will we know the real Halaster? I can&apos;t believe this has happened. What a disaster!&quot;</string>
<string name="94708">Both versions of Halaster turn to look at you, their eyes dark with anger at the interruption. Then, they both smile as an idea pops simultaneously into their heads.</string>
<string name="94709">&quot;We&apos;ll settle this later, when we&apos;re just one on one. But first the Valsharess must suffer for what she has done.&quot;</string>
<string name="94710">&quot;Someone must get her, make her pay for her crime. I&apos;d do it myself, but I can&apos;t spare the time.&quot;</string>
<string name="94711">The first Halaster waves his hand, and you feel the power of his spell coursing through you. It feels as if a hundred tiny hooks have been latched onto your very soul.</string>
<string name="94712">&quot;Nothing much, just a spell to make sure you obey. I put a geas upon you, it&apos;s better this way.&quot;</string>
<string name="94713">&quot;Down to the Underdark is where you will go. You&apos;re working for me now, you can&apos;t really say no.&quot;</string>
<string name="94714">Nathyrra gasps. &quot;The geas will bind you to Halaster&apos;s service. He&apos;s compelled you to enter the Underdark and kill the Valsharess. If you don&apos;t obey him, you&apos;ll wither away and die.&quot;</string>
<string name="94715">&quot;Your dark elven friend speaks words that are true. I think she could help, so I&apos;ll send her down, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="94716">&quot;You have no choice but to do as I say. But once the Valsharess is dead, my spell goes away. After that I promise you&apos;ll truly be free... but don&apos;t do something foolish, like come after me.&quot; </string>
<string name="94717">&quot;You&apos;re sending &lt;FirstName&gt; down into the Underdark? &lt;He/She&gt;&apos;ll have need of my skill in battle. You better send me, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="94718">&quot;You&apos;re sending &lt;FirstName&gt; down into the Underdark? &lt;He/She&gt;&apos;ll have need of my healing. You better send me, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="94719">&quot;You&apos;re sending &lt;FirstName&gt; down into the Underdark? &lt;He/She&gt;&apos;ll have need of my skills. You better send me, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="94720">&quot;Yer sending &lt;FullName&gt; down into the Underdark? It&apos;s full of shadows and traps and treasure! It&apos;s like I was born for that place! You better send me down, too!&quot;</string>
<string name="94721">&quot;No, no, no - it won&apos;t work that way! It&apos;s up to me if you go or you stay. You don&apos;t give me orders here in my home! I&apos;m sending your friend down all alone!&quot;</string>
<string name="94722">&quot;Hey! Deekin not like it when people talk to Boss like that!&quot;</string>
<string name="94723">&quot;Your kobold is brave, though not too bright. Just the kind of ally you might need in this fight.&quot;</string>
<string name="94724">&quot;I&apos;ll send him with you when you go down below. He just might prove useful - you never know.&quot;</string>
<string name="94725">&quot;Don&apos;t say that, Boss! Deekin not let you down! You&apos;ll see!&quot;</string>
<string name="94726">&quot;Thanks, Boss! Deekin not let you down! You&apos;ll see.&quot;</string>
<string name="94727">&quot;I&apos;ll send him with you when you go down below. He just might prove useful - you never know.&quot;</string>
<string name="94728">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;&apos;s going to need more help than just that koblod down there. You better send me along, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="94729">&quot;You don&apos;t tell me what to do! I&apos;m in charge here, not you!&quot;</string>
<string name="94730">&quot;I&apos;ll send *you* back up to the top. Let Waterdeep know the invasion will stop. I&apos;m cleaning house, the drow are no more. Undermountain will be as it was before.&quot;</string>
<string name="94731">&quot;Please, Halaster. Send me down as well. &lt;FirstName&gt; will need help, and I have allies in the Underdark. The Seer also wants to stop the Valsharess. Please.&quot;</string>
<string name="94732">&quot;You make a good point, and you asked real nice. Very well, drow, I&apos;ll take your advice. You can go, too. I won&apos;t leave you here. I&apos;ll send you with &lt;FirstName&gt; to the camp of the Seer.&quot;</string>
<string name="94733">&quot;Enough time has been wasted, I want you to go. The Valsharess is waiting, far down below.&quot;</string>
<string name="94734">&quot;Goodbye, best wishes, I bid you good luck. Go kill the Valsharess, because until then you&apos;re stuck.&quot; </string>
<string name="94735">&quot;So sorry, no time, you really must go. Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s fine, you&apos;ll do well, I know.&quot;</string>
<string name="94736">&quot;&lt;FullName&gt; will have need of my skill in battle down below. You must send me, as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="94737">&quot;If you&apos;re sending Deekin along with &lt;FullName&gt;, you better send me, too. My healing skills could be useful down in the Underdark.&quot;</string>
<string name="94738">&quot;If you&apos;re sending the kobold down there, ye better send me too, wizard! The Underdark is full of shadows and traps and treasure! It&apos;s like I was born for that place!&quot;</string>
<string name="94739">&quot;What can I say? Everyone knows I&apos;m insane. No doubt you&apos;ll know better if this happens again.&quot;</string>
<string name="94740">&quot;Maybe I should have just left you there.&quot;</string>
<string name="94741">&quot;Please tell me you aren&apos;t speaking in rhyme.&quot;</string>
<string name="94742">&quot;You were expecting someone else? Who?&quot;</string>
<string name="94743">&quot;This was all a trap? You let yourself be captured?&quot;</string>
<string name="94744">&quot;Sorry, I didn&apos;t know.&quot;</string>
<string name="94745">&quot;I think I&apos;ll be going now.&quot;</string>
<string name="94746">&quot;I don&apos;t have time to listen to you two crackpots!&quot;</string>
<string name="94747">&quot;Maybe I can help solve this dilemma.&quot;</string>
<string name="94748">&quot;Is there some kind of reward for freeing you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94749">&quot;Could you guys settle this later?&quot;</string>
<string name="94750">&quot;Stop that! What do you think you&apos;re doing?&quot;</string>
<string name="94751">&quot;What did you just do to me?&quot;</string>
<string name="94752">&quot;I guess I don&apos;t have any choice but to go after this Valsharess.&quot;</string>
<string name="94753">&quot;I&apos;ll find some way to break this geas!&quot;</string>
<string name="94754">&quot;You can&apos;t force me to serve you!&quot;</string>
<string name="94755">&quot;I&apos;d rather not have Deekin go with me.&quot;</string>
<string name="94756">&quot;At least I&apos;ll have some help.&quot;</string>
<string name="94757">&quot;I&apos;m ready. Send me down.&quot;</string>
<string name="94758">&quot;This isn&apos;t over, Halaster.&quot;</string>
<string name="94759">&quot;Wait. I need time to prepare myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="94760">&quot;I want to ask you some questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="94761">&quot;This is the thanks I get for helping you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94762">The sword in the skeleton&apos;s hand glitters suddenly, almost leaping out of the corpse&apos;s grip as a voice speaks from within it.</string>
<string name="94763">&quot;There is no escape from the sword, now.&quot; The sword pauses for a moment, thinking. &quot;Well, none that I know of. My soul should have disappated long ago, but I was not about to let that happen.&quot;</string>
<string name="94764">&quot;Instead of properly dying I stubbornly tried to escape this sword and return to my body. Instead of being successful, I became... stuck...&quot;</string>
<string name="94765">&quot;Isn&apos;t that perfectly *obvious? I have been joined with this sword permanently now, doomed to remain attached to the weapon of some dead King who hardly needs it... or anything else, for that matter.&quot;</string>
<string name="94766">&quot;Please, I beg you! Have a heart, my &lt;lord/lady&gt;! Take me away from this hall and use me to chop all your enemies to ribbons... at least that would be a better fate than counting the dust mites upon the floor!&quot;</string>
<string name="94767">&quot;Hmmm, yes, there is *that*, isn&apos;t there? The catch, my dear friend, is that these so-called &quot;sleeping Kings&quot; that occupy this room do not take kindly to having their belongings removed.&quot;</string>
<string name="94768">&quot;That is how I was killed in the first place. Greedy me, and did I pay the price or didn&apos;t I? You look like a competent and tough young &lt;man/woman&gt;, however... how bad could it be?&quot;</string>
<string name="94769">&quot;*I* don&apos;t do anything. The sword, however, does the same thing it always does... it draws the life energy of its foes into itself, healing the wielder amongst other things. Not too shabby, if I do say so myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="94770">&quot;Yes, the sword has other powers. Shall I write you a catalogue? Just take me away from here and you can examine me at length, alright?&quot;</string>
<string name="94771">&quot;Then take me away and... and sell me to some merchant in the market, for the love of Mystra! Let me be sold to some collector or some other adventurer, please!&quot;</string>
<string name="94772">&quot;Or,&quot; here the weapon&apos;s voice gets desperate, &quot;or I have a better idea! Let me change my shape! A longsword no good for you? How about a dagger? Or a short sword? A greatsword! Any of those!&quot;</string>
<string name="94773">&quot;Coward! You call yourself an adventurer?! You&apos;re going to leave perfectly good booty just sitting about?!&quot;</string>
<string name="94774">&quot;Come on, you bucket of bones! Don&apos;t undead exist to kill off adventurers?! Do your job! Do something... do *anything*!&quot; </string>
<string name="94775">&quot;Even better! Just take me away from this dreadful place!&quot;</string>
<string name="94776">&quot;Of course, of course! Just take me away from this dreadful place and I shall change as you ask!&quot;</string>
<string name="94777">&quot;Excellent!&quot; You reach out your hand and take the longsword from the skeleton&apos;s loose grip. A second later, however, a deep glow emits from the skeleton&apos;s eye sockets and it begins to stir...</string>
<string name="94778">&quot;Excellent!&quot; You reach out your hand and take the sword from the skeleton&apos;s loose grip. Even as your hand encloses around the hilt, its blade shimmers and transforms into a different weapon.</string>
<string name="94779">A second later, however, a deep glow emits from the skeleton&apos;s eye sockets and it begins to stir...</string>
<string name="94780">&quot;Nonsense! You seem like a smart enough young &lt;man/woman&gt;, why would you believe such stories? Is your will so lacking that you&apos;re actually afraid I could somehow dominate you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94781">&quot;And besides... even if you do fear such a thing, you only need to sell me off and be done with me, no? All I wish is to be free from this timeless prison. Is that too much to ask?&quot;</string>
<string name="94782">&quot;A mage and adventurer, if you must know, though that holds very little relevance now beyond the fact that my intelligence is considerable and I... am... very... bored!&quot;</string>
<string name="94783">&quot;I&apos;m not exactly sure, come to think of it. I didn&apos;t get sucked into a calendar, you see. Four or five decades, perhaps? Maybe more? Maybe less?&quot;</string>
<string name="94784">&quot;Yes, well... that is a long story. Just let me say that the first chap I tried to ask for help decided to leave me be and looted my corpse of everything.&quot; He sighs again. &quot;And then the rats ate it.&quot;</string>
<string name="94785">&quot;Alright! Fine! That is the whole story! When you are forced to helplessly watch indignity after indignity being visited upon your body, you can&apos;t help but become a tad upset!&quot;</string>
<string name="94786">&quot;Is this some form of trick?&quot;</string>
<string name="94787">&quot;How is it that a sword can talk?&quot;</string>
<string name="94788">&quot;Err... who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="94789">&quot;And you seek to escape now?&quot;</string>
<string name="94790">&quot;Stuck? Stuck how?&quot;</string>
<string name="94791">&quot;What&apos;s the catch?&quot;</string>
<string name="94792">&quot;I might be interested... what do you do, exactly?&quot;</string>
<string name="94793">&quot;Amongst other things?&quot;</string>
<string name="94794">&quot;I have no need of a longsword, sorry.&quot;</string>
<string name="94795">&quot;I don&apos;t trust you. You&apos;ll remain where you are.&quot;</string>
<string name="94796">&quot;Perhaps remaining a longsword would be best.&quot;</string>
<string name="94797">&quot;I suppose I could use a powerful greatsword...&quot;</string>
<string name="94798">&quot;I suppose I could use a powerful short sword...&quot;</string>
<string name="94799">&quot;I suppose I could use a powerful dagger...&quot;</string>
<string name="94800">&quot;Forget it. You&apos;ll stay right here.&quot;</string>
<string name="94801">&quot;I shall take you, if I can.&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Take the sword.]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="94802">&quot;Perhaps if you became a greatsword, instead...&quot;</string>
<string name="94803">&quot;Perhaps if you became a longsword, instead...&quot;</string>
<string name="94804">&quot;Perhaps if you became a short sword, instead...&quot;</string>
<string name="94805">&quot;Perhaps if you became a dagger, instead...&quot;</string>
<string name="94806">&quot;I&apos;ve heard tales about intelligent weapons taking over their users...&quot;</string>
<string name="94807">&quot;And what were you in life, Enserric?&quot;</string>
<string name="94808">&quot;How long ago did this happen?&quot;</string>
<string name="94809">&quot;Where is your body? I don&apos;t see it anywhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="94810">&quot;How is that a long story?&quot;</string>
<string name="94811">Before you is a small wooden keg. It appears to have a small wick, similar to a candle, coming out of the top of the barrel. What do you wish to do?</string>

<string name="94831">The Matron</string>
<string name="94832">The Matron Mother of a drow family reigns supreme. The higher a house stands in drow society, the more power a Matron Mother can command.</string>
<string name="94833">Pappilon</string>
<string name="94834">Parley</string>
<string name="94835">Though far from the forest, this druid seems remarkably at ease in her surroundings.</string>
<string name="94836">Sabine</string>
<string name="94837">Tanarell</string>
<string name="94838">Drow Handmaiden</string>
<string name="94839">Drow Handmaidens carry a lot of respect and power in drow society. They reign over the inferior male drow counterparts with an iron fist, brooking no insults and often killing a male simply for getting in their way.</string>
<string name="94840">Jyslin</string>
<string name="94841">Female priestesses are the pinnacle of drow society, commanding the attention and obedience of all lesser drow.</string>
<string name="94842">Matron Mother</string>
<string name="94843">Drow mages are generally considered superior to the warriors of a drow society. Of course, males don&apos;t usually outrank female drow, period.</string>
<string name="94844">Berger</string>
<string name="94845">Flesh golems are the creations of powerful wizards. This one has a gruesome smile on its face. It could just be the unusual stitching that is forcing it to smile though.</string>
<string name="94846">Drow Elite Soldier</string>
<string name="94847">The Guard</string>
<string name="94848">The Guard is an elite force of Waterdhavian warriors, trained and chosen by the only openly acknowledged Lord of Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="94849">Cyphus</string>
<string name="94850">Ordinae</string>
<string name="94851">Although this man looks human, faint traces of elven blood reveal a mixed heritage. His face is careworn, as of one who has seen and experienced much hardship through out his life.</string>
<string name="94852">Drow Marksman</string>
<string name="94853">Like their fairer cousins, some drow pride themselves on their abilities with missle weapons.</string>
<string name="94854">Durnan</string>
<string name="94855">The confident demeanor and burly muscles on this innkeeper indicate a past rooted in either military or high adventure. Durnan is one of the most reputable people in Waterdeep. This is no small feat in a city filled with famed adventurers.</string>
<string name="94856">Frinli</string>
<string name="94857">Hinkille</string>
<string name="94858">This halfling moves with a quick confidence about the kitchen.</string>

<string name="94861">OLD Linu</string>
<string name="94862">Mother Salinka</string>
<string name="94863">The beauty of this woman at her peak must have been something to behold, because age certainly doesn&apos;t seem to have had much effect on her.</string>
<string name="94864">Merin</string>
<string name="94865">Falle</string>
<string name="94866">Mhaere</string>
<string name="94867">Mhaere is the innkeeper&apos;s wife. Strong and beautiful, her noble ideals as a paladin of Tyr keep patrons in line most of the time. Her cool competence is one of her greatest strengths, and a quality that draws a better crowd than is found in most taverns.</string>
<string name="94868">Refugee</string>
<string name="94869">This is just one of the many refugees who have come to Durnan&apos;s inn seeking shelter from the attacks on Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="94870">Citizen</string>
<string name="94871">This is one of the million citizens in Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="94872">Duergar Barbarian</string>
<string name="94873">Gate Captain</string>
<string name="94874">Grayban</string>

<string name="94876">Bone Golem Guardian</string>
<string name="94877">Drow Thief</string>
<string name="94878">Olgin Hasterean</string>
<string name="94879">Although this monster looks like a brutish thug, the fact that it can cast spells would imply a higher intelligence.</string>
<string name="94880">Fairy Sorceress</string>
<string name="94881">This would appear to be the ruler of the strangely twisted and evil fey folk here in Undermountain.</string>
<string name="94882">Harpy Minion</string>
<string name="94883">Fairy Minion</string>
<string name="94884">Turned cruel and evil, these fairies are a far cry from their usual mischevious but mostly harmless nature.</string>
<string name="94885">Tree Golem</string>
<string name="94886">This golem must have been made by the fairy, from the trees that somehow grow in Undermountain.</string>

<string name="94891">Goblin Siege Engineer</string>
<string name="94892">Goblin Picket</string>
<string name="94893">These goblins appear to be firing sdome kind of special, colored arrows.</string>
<string name="94894">Argo Blacktooth</string>
<string name="94895">This goblin is pulling colored levers and laughing maniacally for some reason.</string>

<string name="94904">Filthy Slave</string>
<string name="94905">Dire Bat</string>
<string name="94906">Drow Tactitian</string>
<string name="94907">The most powerful drow are almost always female. The female drow of this group have the most ornate, red armor and are probably the leaders of the invaders.</string>
<string name="94908">Drow Mine Guard</string>
<string name="94909">Formian Digger</string>
<string name="94910">Halaster</string>
<string name="94911">Blackcloak</string>
<string name="94912">Halaster Blackcloak is the ageless and insane creator of Undermountain.</string>
<string name="94913">Drow Commando</string>
<string name="94914">Bearing the markings of their fiendish parentage, these warriors tend to follow their chaotic heritage and hunt mortals as a pleasurable hobby.</string>
<string name="94915">Partially divine warriors enjoy some of the powers of the celestial, while maintaining a common link to the mortal realms.</string>
<string name="94916">Noble Warrior</string>
<string name="94917">This is a noble looking warrior.</string>
<string name="94918">Noble Elf Mage</string>
<string name="94919">The beauty of an elf is often even more pronounced in the face of an elven noble. Occasionally such beauty is marred by a streak of cruelty, but most elven nobles know how to hide such emotions.</string>
<string name="94920">Noble Dwarf Lord</string>
<string name="94921">Dwarf Lords have a long and noble history, which is often recited in the halls of the great kings of the past.</string>
<string name="94922">Sobrey</string>
<string name="94923">This mage&apos;s fingers move rapidly, but with a very dexterous and delicate touch across the pages of the book in front of him. He seems to be completely oblivious to his surroundings as he mutters quietly to himself.</string>
<string name="94924">Statue</string>
<string name="94925">Tamsil</string>
<string name="94926">Tamsil, the innkeeper&apos;s beautiful daughter, has a grace and confidence that give her the aura of nobility. Her smile and her innocent nature make her the popular target of boisterous attentions, which she deflects with humourous quips and a peircing frown.</string>
<string name="94927">Tavern Patron</string>
<string name="94928">Blacksmith</string>
<string name="94929">The blacksmith is busy hammering away at her anvil.</string>
<string name="94930">White</string>
<string name="94931">Thesta</string>
<string name="94932">A stunningly beautiful woman watches Durnan and other men with a predatory look. Other women she glances at only occasionally, frowning and raising her nose in contempt.</string>
<string name="94933">Deekin</string>
<string name="94934">Nathyrra</string>
<string name="94935">This strikingly beautiful, but dangerous drow slips in and out of the shadows almost without any effort. Her platinum hair contrasts with her skin to give her an almost ghostly aura. Her sudden appearances and disappearances only enhance her surreal image.</string>
<string name="94936">Malevolent Grig</string>
<string name="94937">Normally mischievous and lighthearted, these Grigs have become far more violent and cruel than their usual nature dictates.</string>
<string name="94938">Formian Slave</string>
<string name="94939">Formian Forgeworker</string>
<string name="94940">Formian Warrior</string>
<string name="94941">Minotaur Brute</string>
<string name="94942">Skeleton Bomb</string>
<string name="94943">Evil Nymph</string>
<string name="94944">What an nymph is doing in Undermountain, and why Halaster brought her here, is one of those philosophical questions that will probably never be answered satisfactorily.</string>
<string name="94945">Zombie Protector</string>
<string name="94946">Drow Expert Marksman</string>
<string name="94947">Like their fairer cousins, some drow pride themselves on their abilities with a longbow.</string>

<string name="94970">Orc Warpriest</string>
<string name="94971">Troll Bodyguard</string>
<string name="94972">Troll bodyguards are smarter than your average troll. They often hire themselves out to mages or other powerful creatures, in return for food and treasure.</string>
<string name="94973">The Reaper</string>
<string name="94974">This is the Reaper, a chilling creature who guards this plane of doors.</string>
<string name="94975">Djinni Bottle</string>
<string name="94976">This bottle holds Volkarion, a merchant djinni, who has access to wares from different planes of existence. He is trapped in this bottle and can be spoken to for purchasing these wares. Through the use of soul gems, Volkarion can give you access to new wares.</string>
<string name="94977">Shield of Lies</string>
<string name="94978">This magic shield grants additional protection to its wearer, but it doesn&apos;t bear the hallmarks of any specific maker.</string>
<string name="94979">To make life more difficult for her enemies, Joaquim Theest sacrificed part of her life energy to forge a powerful shield. When used properly, the will of an opponent is sapped, leaving him dazed and confused for a short time.</string>
<string name="94980">Half-Blood Gloves</string>
<string name="94981">These magical gloves are woven from thick reeds and radiate nature magic. Daelan found them while traveling through the Cloakwood forest, a gift from a mysterious druid that Daelan speaks of only very briefly. His memories of the druid appear to be quite personal to him, and all he mentions is that the gloves were a gift, supposedly meant for the half-blooded children of two races.</string>
<string name="94982">Drow Note</string>
<string name="94983">This scroll is written in a tight, elegant hand:

&quot;This is the equipment taken from the Red Sister&apos;s latest victim. When our mistress arrives she will want to inspect these items herself.&quot;</string>
<string name="94984">Inventory Note</string>
<string name="94985">  These items are intended for use only during an emergency. Please take only what you need.

Some special notes on our more exotic equipment:

  Potion of Clarity: These are useful for warding off fear effects and other mental distortions.
  Barkskin: Purchased these from druids outside the city proper -- they insist they will harden the skin of an adventurer. Probably most useful for those who do not wear armor.
  Ale:  Best used only in the most dire of cirumstances.

<string name="94986">Bloody Plate</string>
<string name="94987">Worn Book</string>
<string name="94988">This large tome has a rather interesting title: &quot;Shadows of Undrentide&quot;, written by one &quot;D. Scalesinger&quot;. Inside its pages is the full account of an adventure from earlier in your career... your first adventure, in fact. The facts seem a bit exaggerated, according to your memory, but that apparently didn&apos;t stop the book from becoming a great hit amongst the nobility in several major cities throughout Faerun. For a time, you had the unique experience of becoming a household name... people who you didn&apos;t know would shout out to you happily as you passed or treated you like a trusted friend. The fame eventually died down somewhat, which was a relief at the time, but you have held onto a copy of the book as a souvenir.

As for the author, a kobold bard by the name of Deekin, you haven&apos;t met him since those early days. Part of you has to wonder if you aren&apos;t owed some royalties...</string>
<string name="94989">Cloak of the Sentry</string>
<string name="94990">A cloak commonly found amongst the guardians of the rich and powerful, this cloak protects the wearer against attacks that could affect the mind. Since guards are often more physically strong, but mentally weak, such protection is a wise idea.</string>
<string name="94991">Darkfist&apos;s Tunic</string>
<string name="94992">Sabine&apos;s Tunic</string>

<string name="94994">Argali&apos;s Tunic</string>
<string name="94995">Confusion Toy</string>
<string name="94996">This small top is covered with delicate runes that, when spun, cause an opponent&apos;s mind to wander, making it difficult for them to concentrate on the battle. The top can be spun three times a day.</string>
<string name="94997">Craven Necklace</string>
<string name="94998">Amulets are necklaces with some form of large decoration or symbol. Most are ornamental, but some are potent magic items.</string>
<string name="94999">Hephanik the Cowardly was a king who constantly feared assassination. He ruled his kingdom with an iron fist, amassing a huge army, not to conquer other lands, but to protect him from his worst fear, an uprising of the peasantry. 
As part of his personal protections, Hephanik had his royal wizard craft him a necklace to keep him safe. Eventually, even the necklace was not enough to save him, as one of his concubines removed it and slit his throat while he slept.

<string name="95003">Dragon Tooth Amulet</string>
<string name="95004">The dragon tooth amulet that Deekin wears looks very much like one of the artifacts that was stolen from your mentor&apos;s home in Hilltop during your adventure involving Undrentide. When asked about it, Deekin merely shuffles from foot to foot and mumbles that it was given to him but little more. Regardless of its significance, Deekin doesn&apos;t seem willing to give it up to anyone... even you.</string>

<string name="95033">Handmaiden Dress</string>
<string name="95034">Honor and Death</string>
<string name="95035">The Rakshasha general, Kalikin, came from a long line of fierce warriors and cunning strategists. Their personal code of behavior was covered by the motto &quot;Honor and Death&quot;. The words represented the idea that chaos led to the propogation of lesser species, and through the bounds of honor one could work effectively to strike down these lesser races and fulfill the destiny of the one great race, the Rakshasha. This two-bladed sword was the weapon of choice for striking the blow against chaos.</string>
<string name="95036">Infernal Chain Female</string>
<string name="95037">This unusual admantite chainmail bears the markings of dark elf craftsmanship, but is fused with a strange, deep red alloy not known to you.</string>
<string name="95038">The deep burnished red of this armor comes from admantite tempered in infernal flames. Only the army of the Valsharess wears this armor, which is scaldingly hot to the touch.</string>

<string name="95062">Robe of the Night Skies</string>
<string name="95063">This deep blue robe covers heavy half-plate armor, both being particular to the elven Starsinger priestesses of Sehanine Moonbow. The robe and armor have mystical qualities which can only be used by a Starsinger and would be useless to others... not that Linu would readily give her armor up.</string>

<string name="95070">Darklord&apos;s Robes</string>
<string name="95071">Mithril</string>
<string name="95072">This is a light weight metal often used by the elves to create magical armor or weapons. In the hands of the right smith, the metal can be used to enhance magical items or to create new new items entirely. While the value of the unforged metal is high, once it is properly molded, the value climbs rapidly.</string>

<string name="95083">Halaster&apos;s Magnifying Glass</string>
<string name="95084">This magnifiying glass is warm to the touch and radiates powerful magic. However, it does little to amplify or improve the vision of the user. In fact, this glass doesn&apos;t appear to have any practical purpose whatsoever... short of using it to fry insects.</string>

<string name="95099">Green Chain</string>

<string name="95120">Star Frost</string>
<string name="95121">Tear Jerker</string>
<string name="95122">The Tear Jerker is a legendary dagger whose blade is said to be so cold that a simple touch could kill a man. On the elemental plane of fire, this weapon is considered one of the most loathsome daggers in existence. Mere possession of the weapon could mean permanent exile, or even death.</string>
<string name="95123">Scale Cap</string>
<string name="95124">This is a small red dragon scale folded into a small cap. Deekin says he found it lying around somewhere. He refuses to part with it.</string>

<string name="95130">Yawning Portal Dagger</string>
<string name="95131">This is a complimentary dagger supplied to all guests of the Yawning Portal Inn. The once flawless blade has been dulled from much use. A stamp on the hilt suggests that it was crafted by a cabal of wizards hidden along the Sword Coast.</string>
<string name="95132">Cloak of Bedazzlement</string>
<string name="95133">This cloak seems to shimmer in the light and is very hard for your eyes to focus on.</string>
<string name="95134">Drow Dagger</string>
<string name="95135">This dagger has many intricately carved runes all over its surface.  </string>
<string name="95136">The runes on this dagger identify it as belonging to the Red Sisters, a notorious sect of drow assassins.</string>
<string name="95137">Infernal Leather C</string>
<string name="95138">Sharwyn&apos;s Ring</string>
<string name="95139">This finely-wrought ring of platinum appears to be elven in origin and most likely was some form of engagement or promissory ring. It is something Sharwyn rarely talks about, though by the way she absently touches it when her thoughts appear far away its significance to her is obvious. The ring&apos;s enchantment is very strong, and it is almost impossible to remove from Sharwyn&apos;s person unless she wills it.</string>
<string name="95140">Tomi&apos;s Armor</string>
<string name="95141">This suit of dark leather appears to fit Tomi like a second skin and is not easily removed... not that Tomi would allow it to be, given the option. It is heavily enchanted and supposedly has something to do with Tomi&apos;s status as a Shadowdancer, something Tomi generally refuses to discuss.</string>

<string name="95273">An Unexpected Ally</string>
<string name="95274">You&apos;ve been approached Nathyrra, a drow who claims to be an agent for a mysterious group of rebels opposing the dark elves attacking Waterdeep. According to Nathyrra, the armies invading Waterdeep are being controlled by a powerful drow House Mother known only as the Matron. She also claims the Matron has captured Halaster and is holding him prisoner.

If Nathyrra is telling the truth, you may have a new ally in your quest to save Waterdeep. But if she&apos;s lying, trusting her could be deadly...</string>
<string name="95275">Nathyrra has approached you again, this time to warn you about a drow encampment. She&apos;s told you of a secret passage that will lead you to a pair of ballistae mounted on a ridge behind the camp. 

If her information is accurate, then using the ballistae could be an easy way to defeat the drow. But if she&apos;s lying you might be walking into a trap.</string>
<string name="95276">Nathyrra has shown up yet again. But instead of vanishing into the shadows, this time she&apos;s offered to help you in the final battle to free Halaster.

You should probably be grateful for any help you can get at this point, and she&apos;s proven herself trustworthy so far. Maybe once Halaster is free you can learn more about this mysterious ally and the group of rebels she represents.</string>
<string name="95277">Halaster has cast Nathyrra down into the Underdark with you. Hopefully she will be as useful an ally there as she was in Undermountain.</string>
<string name="95278">Daelan</string>
<string name="95279">You have discovered the body of Daelan- one of the adventurers you met in the Yawning Portal - on the first level of Undermountain.</string>
<string name="95280">You have raised Daelan from the dead, and the half-orc has decided to return to the Yawning Portal.</string>
<string name="95281">Even though you saved him from the grave, the half-orc doesn&apos;t seem to fond of you. The fact that you insulted his honor and genealogy probably has something to do with it. He&apos;s likely returned to the Yawning Portal, though it&apos;s doubtful he&apos;ll have anything nice to say to you there.</string>
<string name="95282">Daelan has refused to accept your apology for insulting him. He made it quite clear that he has no desire to forgive or forget.</string>
<string name="95283">Daelan has reluctantly agreed to forgive you for your previous attacks on his honor. The fact that you saved his life seems likely played a significant part in his decision.</string>
<string name="95284">You&apos;ve decided to kill Daelan, even though you just rescued him from a similar state. Once you&apos;re done with him, however, he&apos;ll probably stay dead.</string>
<string name="95285">You&apos;ve managed to convince Daelan to join you in your explorations of Undermountain. It probably won&apos;t take long for this battle-hardened warrior to prove his worth to your group.</string>
<string name="95286">Descent into Undermountain</string>
<string name="95287">The Yawning Portal has come under attack, the drow striking from Undermountain even as Durnan was in the middle of preparing an expedition to go in and explore the dungeon&apos;s depths.</string>
<string name="95288">The raids on Waterdeep are getting worse; even Durnan&apos;s inn has been attacked, as you know first hand. The drow sent to steal your equipment was likely only the first strike against you. The next time the results could be far more lethal.

Your only hope of stopping the attacks - both on Waterdeep and on you - is to go into Undermountain and discover why Halaster&apos;s magic no longer keeps those inside the dungeon from escaping to the surface.

Durnan feels the mad mage himself is to blame, but it is possible something may have happened to Halaster. And if so, what new enemy is behind these attacks? The answers await you below... if you survive.</string>
<string name="95289">You&apos;ve learned that Halaster has disappeared, leaving Undermountain in chaos. With the mage gone, the protections keeping the creatures from leaving his dungeon have also vanished. 

Durnan would be interested in what you have learned, though no doubt he will want you to try and discover where Halaster has gone, and why he left.</string>
<string name="95290">Durnan was interested in the news of Halaster&apos;s disappearance, and he&apos;s urged you to try and find out more. Has something happened to Halaster, or is his disappearance part of some grand, sinister scheme?</string>
<string name="95291">Halaster has been captured by the drow. With the mad mage out of the picture, the dark elves are moving freely through Undermountain, allowing them to strike at Waterdeep.

Durnan should be given this information as soon as possible, though he will likely want you to investigate these drow further.</string>
<string name="95292">To say Durnan was troubled by the news that Halaster has been captured by the drow would be an understatement. The innkeeper has asked you to try and discover more about this new enemy, including who is leading them and how they managed to imprison an archmage of Halaster&apos;s stature.

The answers you seek can only be found in the depths of Undermountain itself.</string>
<string name="95293">The leader of the drow invaders is a matron mother known only as &apos;The Valsharess&apos;. Though you still know little about her, you should at least advise Durnan of the name of the one who is behind the attacks on Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="95294">As expected, Durnan has asked you to try and discover more about the Valsharess.. including a way to stop her and her followers from destroying Waterdeep. According to Durnan, the key to stopping them is finding and releasing Halaster. Once the mad mage is in control of undermountain again, the attacks should come to an end.</string>
<string name="95295">You&apos;ve rescued Halaster from the clutches of the drow, and as a reward the wizard cast you down into the Underdark to exact vengeance on the Valsharess for imprisoning him. He also cast a geas on you to ensure your loyalty. Unless you find some other way to break the archmage&apos;s spell, the only way to free yourself from his service is to find the Valsharess and kill her.

On the bright side, Halaster did promise to end the attacks on Waterdeep.</string>
<string name="95296">Find Tamsil</string>
<string name="95297">Durnan and Mhaere&apos;s daughter, Tamsil, has gone down into Undermountain. Her worried parents want her returned safely to the surface.</string>
<string name="95298">Durnan and Mhaere&apos;s daughter, Tamsil, has gone down into Undermountain. Her worried parents want her returned safely to the surface.
Tamsil&apos;s body has been found, but she has been turned to stone.</string>
<string name="95299">Durnan and Mhaere&apos;s daughter, Tamsil, has gone down into Undermountain. Her worried parents want her returned safely to the surface.
Although her body was turned to stone, Durnan was pleased and went into the dungeon to save her himself.</string>
<string name="95300">Durnan and Mhaere&apos;s daughter, Tamsil, has gone down into Undermountain. Her worried parents want her returned safely to the surface. Although her body was turned to stone, she has been released from the spell and is returning to the relative safety of the Yawning Portal. Her parents will certainly want to thank her rescuers.</string>
<string name="95301">Durnan and Mhaere&apos;s daughter, Tamsil, has gone down into Undermountain. Her worried parents want her returned safely to the surface. Although her body was turned to stone, she has been released from the spell and is returning to the relative safety of the Yawning Portal. Her parents were grateful to have their daughter back.</string>
<string name="95302">Halaster&apos;s Slaves</string>
<string name="95303">You&apos;ve agreed to help a group of slaves trapped here in Undermountain. They&apos;ve located a portal that can lead them to Waterdeep, but they don&apos;t have the activation stone to use it.

Shareesh, the leader of the slaves, believes the stone is hidden away inside a djinni bottle at a drow encampment in the southern section of the dungeon. If you bring the stone to Shareesh, he can lead his people to freedom.</string>
<string name="95304">Halaster&apos;s slaves have revealed themselves to be Rakshasa in disguise. With their illusion shattered they resorted to a more direct approach and attacked you en masse.</string>
<string name="95305">Henchman</string>
<string name="95306">The lovely Talice, a drow thief/fighter has joined you as a henchman.</string>
<string name="95307">Krill Darkflame, a tiefling wizard/rogue, has joined you as a companion.</string>
<string name="95308">Your henchman has been killed.  You will have to raise them from the dead before they can rejoin you.
</string>
<string name="95309">Linu</string>
<string name="95310">You&apos;ve discovered the body of Linu La&apos;neral, the elven cleric from the Yawning Portal.</string>
<string name="95311">You&apos;ve managed to convince Linu to join you in your explorations of Undermountain. No doubt her healing skills will prove useful during your adventures.</string>
<string name="95312">You&apos;ve raised Linu from the dead, giving her another chance at life. After speaking with you, she&apos;s decided to return to the Yawning Portal.</string>
<string name="95313">You&apos;ve given Linu another chance at life, but any gratitude she may have felt towards you has been wiped away by your cruel words. Should you wish to speak to her again you can likely find her at the Yawning Portal, though it is unlikely she&apos;ll want to speak with you again.</string>
<string name="95314">You&apos;ve apologized to Linu for your previous actions, but she has refused to accept your apology and it&apos;s obvious she has little desire to even speak with you.</string>
<string name="95315">Linu has accepted your apology for your previous behavior. Her willingness to forgive you probably has something to do with the fact that you were responsible for raising her from the dead.</string>
<string name="95316">After raising Linu La&apos;neral from the dead, you&apos;ve decided to kill her again. This time, she&apos;ll likely stay a corpse.</string>
<string name="95317">Old Friends</string>
<string name="95318">Several members of your old adventuring party have entered Undermountain ahead of you.

<string name="95330">Relic of the Reaper</string>
<string name="95331">You have reclaimed the Relic of the Reaper - most prized of your possessions.  The artifact has been yours since you found it -- or perhaps, it found you -- in the Plane of Shadows many years ago.

The Relic of the Reaper will teleport you to a tiny nexus dimension ruled over by an enigmatic being you know only as the &apos;Reaper&apos;. The Reaper agreed long ago to serve you through the relic: you can use it to bind a location to one of the doors in the Reaper&apos;s realm, allowing you instant transportation there. The Reaper will also snatch you to his realm on the instant of your death. Both of these uses, the binding and the saving, cost the use of a Rogue Stone. More information can be gained from the Reaper, himself... though your strange servant has never exactly been forthcoming on the relic&apos;s true nature or even his own.</string>
<string name="95332">Rude Awakenings</string>
<string name="95333">You awoke from a troubling dream just in time to discover a drow thief. Unfortunately you were not in time to stop her from magically stealing all of your equipment.</string>
<string name="95334">Tamsil, the innkeeper&apos;s daughter, has informed you that her father Durnan is waiting for you in the main room downstairs.

<string name="95337">You have discovered the body of Sharwyn - one of the adventurers you met in the Yawning Portal - on the first level of Undermountain.</string>
<string name="95338">You have raised Sharwyn back to life.  She was quite grateful to you for giving her a second chance at life.</string>
<string name="95339">Sharwyn has joined you in your expedition to Undermountain. No doubt she&apos;ll prove a valuable member of your team.</string>
<string name="95340">The Armory</string>
<string name="95341">Although all your equipment has been stolen, you are free to visit the Yawning Portal&apos;s armory. There you should find suitable gear to replace the equipment that was taken from you.</string>
<string name="95342">You&apos;ve visited the armory of the Yawning Portal to try and replace your stolen gear. You can return at any time to help yourself to anything else in the armory if you feel the need.</string>
<string name="95343">The Sealed Passage</string>
<string name="95344">An Ogre Mage has informed you that the stairs down to the next level of UnderMountain are sealed with debris and garbage.  The only way to clear it is to cause an explosion. </string>
<string name="95345">You&apos;ve cleared a passage down to the next level of Undermountain.</string>

<string name="95348">You have raised Tomi back to life. He was quite grateful to you for giving him a second chance at life.</string>
<string name="95349">Tomi has joined you in your expedition to Undermountain. The rogue&apos;s skills should come in particularly useful in Halaster&apos;s trap filled dungeon.</string>
<string name="95350">Trapped in the Underdark</string>
<string name="95351">You&apos;ve been cast into the Underdark by the mad wizard Halaster. The archmage has given you a task: kill the Valsharess for imprisoning him and seizing control of Undermountain. To ensure you complete your mission, Halaster also cast a geas on you, binding you to his service.

Unless you find some other way to break the geas, the only way to be free of Halaster&apos;s power is to find and kill the drow known as the Valsharess.</string>
<string name="95352">Waterdeep Under Attack.</string>
<string name="95353">You have agreed to help The Guard clear this district of Waterdeep of attackers from the Underdark.</string>

<string name="95572">It is said that both you and Mephistopheles returned to the Nine Hells in the end, the archdevil ruling alongside you for a thousand years. He coached you on the treacherous ways of the Baatezu and kept you from harm, his loyalty to you secured by the power of his True Name. Together you waged many wars of conquest and for a time your influence spread throughout the Outer Planes. Legend claims that Mephistopheles would one day attempt to trick you as he did the Valsharess, but that in the end you humiliated him with defeat once more. This, however, is another story.</string>
<string name="95573">Though it meant a return to the Outer Planes, it is said that the great archdevil Mephistopheles was bound to your service by your use of his True Name. News from the depths of the Nine Hells is ever unreliable, but some claim that he served you faithfully, bowing and scraping before you even as he longed for your mortal life to expire. Some tales relate that Mephistopheles would attempt to trick you as he did the Valsharess, but that in the end you humiliated him with defeat once more. That, however, is another story.</string>
<string name="95574">It is said that the archdevil Mephistopheles abandoned his war of conquest, his desire to subjugate the mortal realms foiled by his defeat at your hands. He fled the world of Toril, never to return. Such tales rarely end so easily, however, and future stories claimed that Mephistopheles spent much of his future consumed with the desire for revenge upon the one who humbled him. Whether his plots proved successful, however, or whether you vanquished him again as you had the first time is another tale.</string>
<string name="95575">[MEPHISTOPHELES - FATE 2] Becomes kindhearted.

Commanded by his True Name, Mephistopheles had no choice but to obey. Every goodly act festered like a wound upon his heart, driving him to madness. Yet every good act begat another and another and threefold more until all that was devilish within him was consumed...</string>
<string name="95576">It is said that the great archdevil Mephistopheles collapsed into dust and existed no more. The world shuddered with his passing and all grew still for a time, but bringing an end to such beings is rarely so simple. Some tales claimed that Mephistopheles could never be completely destroyed on the Material Plane. They say his will lived on, and out of a desire for vengeance his body was eventually reformed on the Outer Planes. A day of reckoning was sure to follow someday... though that is another tale.</string>
<string name="95577">From the ashes of the devil&apos;s gambit, Waterdeep rose again, rebuilt and renewed with all the fervor of a vast and bustling city, its place as the jewel of Faerun reclaimed. Reunited with his family, Durnan restored the Yawning Portal to its former glory. He hung a portrait of you upon the mantelpiece and told your tale to all who sought the fire&apos;s warmth...</string>
<string name="95578">With your help, the havoc unleashed by the devil&apos;s gambit allowed an opportunity for you to gain power. Waterdeep was rebuilt under Durnan&apos;s guidance but other realms did not fare as well as your lust for conquest turned more and more of those cities under your thumb into a true, living hell. The legends claim that one day your power would be challenged and your terrors would become but a memory... but not now. And so you sat upon your darkened throne, pondering all the evils you had wrought...</string>
<string name="95579">Daelan Red Tiger returned to his homelands in the frozen north and accepted a position among the Elders of his Uthgardt tribe, finally finding the sense of acceptance and belonging he had sought for so many years. The tales say that the great Daelan lived to a ripe old age, fathering many children. He guarded the frozen northlands with a legendary sense of justice, combating many evils and seeing the Uthgardt through the most difficult times in their history. When the great barbarian breathed his last, his spirit was said to have risen and taken its place amongst the stars over Faerun, an inspiration for future outcasts to come.</string>
<string name="95580">After his experience in Undermountain, Tomi Undergallows left the Yawning Portal under suspicious circumstances and rumors of missing cutlery. Where he went from there is unknown, but tall tales of his exploits soon began to emerge. Tomi was said to be involved in a scheme to steal Elminster&apos;s pipe and, strangely, he was even reported to have ruled the pirate city of Luskan for a time. The truth of these tales is questionable at best and only one story is said to have any real merit: it is claimed that, shortly after leaving Waterdeep, Tomi met his end at the hand of a ragged, giggling maniac known only as &quot;Sammy...&quot;</string>
<string name="95581">As for Linu La&apos;neral, she finally returned to her home city of Evereska. The temple there, dedicated to Sehanine Moonbow, at long last forgave her for the accidents of her past and granted her the title of High Priestess. It took only a month for Linu to reduce the temple to ruins (purely an accident, of course) and she returned to Waterdeep once more. There she was said to have been a force of good in troubled times, guiding its citizens with a sense of justice and diplomacy that, as once noted by the Sage Elminster, &quot;held all the grace that her feet did not.&quot;</string>
<string name="95582">Sharwyn wrote a soulful ballad based on her experiences in Undermountain that somehow found its way to Cormyr and the ears of its Infant-King, Azoun V. Greatly enthralled, the young king insisted that she be offered a court position as Bard Laureate of the capital, Suzail. She accepted eagerly, her songs soon becoming an inspiration to the kingdom. Later stories emerged, suggesting that she fell in love with a man as gentle of heart as he was hideous in appearance. Abandoning her wealth and position, she left the security of the King&apos;s service to live in blissful poverty with her one true love. She was the beauty to his beast and their love would spawn a legend of its own... and Sharwyn, at last, would find the true happiness she so desperately sought.</string>
<string name="95583">Deep in the Underdark, the wake of your passing is still felt. The Seer survived Mephistopheles&apos; pillage of the region and became renowned as a leader of her people. Her followers still scour the depths for drow seeking to escape the despair and treachery of their life, bringing those they find to a new existence on the surface. The task is not an easy one, however, as the drow matrons constantly send assassins into the fold. But the Seer still survives and still names you in her prayers. Amongst her and her followers, you are remembered as a friend to all those who sought solace from the shadows...</string>
<string name="95584">Deep in the Underdark, the wake of your passing is still felt. The Seer survived Mephistopheles&apos; pillage of the region and her followers still search for those drow looking to escape the despair and treachery of their life, bringing those they find to a new existence on the surface.

The church of Eilistraee grow steadily in strength and your name is praised as a true friend of those who seek refuge from the shadows...</string>
<string name="95585">Deep in the Underdark, memories of your betrayal persisted for many years. The followers of Eilistraee were all dead by your treachery, however, and none were left to curse your name. Among the drow houses, you are honored as a devious outsider who showed no mercy for the weak...</string>
<string name="95586">With the help of the Shattered Mirror, the illithid of Zorvak&apos;Mur quickly came to dominate their region of the Underdark, driving back the drow and other lesser races. Under the guidance of the Overmind, many of them infiltrated secret societies of the surface world, spreading their influence far and wide even there...</string>
<string name="95587">With the death of their Overmind, the illithid of Zorvak&apos;Mur easily fell prey to the treachery of their so-called allies. The alliance between the illithid and the drow died with the Valsharess. It was not long before all at the outpost were enslaved to rival drow houses, their psionic powers tightly controlled, while the rest of their race returned to their previous doctrine of war against lesser enemies.</string>
<string name="95588">Despite the death of the Valsharess, the alliance she forged with the illithid persisted, becoming one of the defining features of her legacy. Under the protection of the drow and the guidance of the Overmind, the illithid flourished, many of them infiltrating the secret societies of the surface world...</string>
<string name="95589">Enraged by the slaughter of his priesthood, the dracolich Vix&apos;thra unleashed his wrath upon the village of Drearing&apos;s Deep. There were no survivors and the occasional mushroom is all that now lives amidst the blasted rubble. Ghosts are still said to haunt the place, however, and one of them, a lowly rock gnome, is said to cry your name out in rage and despair...</string>
<string name="95590">Freed from both the priesthood&apos;s brutal rule and the wrath of the dracolich, Vix&apos;thra, the community of Drearing&apos;s Deep struggled mightily to provide a refuge amidst the many evil races of the Underdark. Countless village leaders died in battle, though their spirit was never broken. Rumors spoke of an addled but kind-hearted rock-gnome who served as the community&apos;s true leader, masterminding its strategies from behind the scenes. Whatever the case, the freemen of Drearing&apos;s Deep survived battle after battle until, in time, the city became a veritable fortress, a bastion of hope for those yet enslaved and a proud beacon of freedom for those who had recently escaped...</string>
<string name="95591">As for Cania, little changed. Devils continued to mine their ice for the walls of Mephistar, the Spirits of the Dead continued to arrive and slowly join the ranks of the Lost, and the vast glacial wastes continued to hold the Knowers and their secrets close, buried deep beneath the glacial ice...</string>
<string name="95592">As for Cania, it is said to have achieved new greatness under your rulership, at least for a time. The City of Lost Souls, long neglected by Mephistopheles, grew into a thriving metropolis rivaling that of Sigil itself. Vast armies of the fiendish dead marched under your command, their fearsome weapons forged from the glacial ice. Few would ever uncover the secret to your power, however, and any who did were quickly silenced. For to rule the Hells, you had long since realized that you must keep your enemies close... and the Knowers even closer.</string>
<string name="95593">As for Cania, the disappearance of Mephistopheles left a power vacuum among the upper echelons of the Baatezu. Soon all the Hells of Baator descended into a vicious bloodbath as devil fought against devil, all of them eager for the throne. Wise as they may be, the Knowers were powerless against the onslaught and soon passed away amidst the slaughter&apos;s frenzy. Only the dread Asmodeus remained uninvolved, nursing his ancient wounds, content to let his lessers fight amongst themselves... </string>
<string name="95594">As for Cania, Mephistopheles surrendered it to the Knowers as you had commanded him. When the last of the devils had retreated through the Gatehouse, it is said that Cania finally slipped its moorings and became a separate plane once more, no longer the frozen Hell of Baator. Some stories claimed that other devils waged a long war in the years to come to retrieve it, but whether or not it was re-conquered is unknown. The Knowers held your name in reverence for ages to come, a mystery that scholars of the planes found intriguing as so little else was known of you...</string>
<string name="95595">[KNOWERS - FATE 3] Meph returns or devils are not reined in.

Angered by the role played by the Knowers in their master&apos;s downfall, lynch mobs of vengeful devils began to scour the Wastes of Cania, finally hunting the Knowers to extinction. The Knower of Places was the last to be found but even she could not hide away from the world forever...</string>

<string name="95601">Robbed of the woman he believed to be his one true love, the Sleeping Man fell into a deep despair. All hope left him and slowly, over the course of generations, he was claimed by the ice of Cania, his spirit joining with those of the Lost...</string>
<string name="95602">The ghost of Aribeth de Tylmarande wandered the mortal realm for many years, chaos and treachery following in her wake. She eventually turned her attention to the city of Neverwinter that she had once called home and there she haunted it with every fiber of her being. Calamity after calamity fell upon the city. Aribeth&apos;s name becoming a thing whispered only in fear and despair, until finally a hero came to the beleaguered city to stand against the ghost&apos;s tyranny and was victorious. That, however, is another tale...</string>
<string name="95603">The ghost of Aribeth de Tylmarande reveled with you amidst the heady spoils of war. She never grew old. She never lost her beauty nor did her passion for you fade. You loved each other until you were old and gray and triumphant. As you died, she leaned close, nibbling on your ear. &quot;I shall see you in the Hells,&quot; she whispered. She lingered on this plane for a time after your death until finally departing forever. The legends say that the two of you did meet once again in the Hells, as promised, continuing a reign of terror amongst the devils and planars...</string>
<string name="95604">Despite her betrayal in the final hour, you spared the ghost of Aribeth de Tylmarande a second and final death. She made no apologies but bowed low, acknowledging your prowess, before turning her back on you and departing through the city&apos;s shattered streets. You haven&apos;t seen her since but you can feel the malevolence of her spirit out there, somewhere, cruel and triumphant...</string>
<string name="95605">Dark-hearted and treacherous to the end, the ghost of Aribeth de Tylmarande was destroyed in the battle against Mephistopheles. As she died her second death, you couldn&apos;t help but feel a certain pride on her behalf. Even though she betrayed you, she remained true to the evil within herself...</string>
<string name="95606">The ghost of Aribeth de Tylmarande wandered the mortal realm for many years, eventually returning to the city of Neverwinter that was once her home. There she helped the sick, the lame, the poor until little by little, she felt the burden of her penance lifted. Some say that the Wounded God, Tyr, finally appeared to her then to welcome her at long last to the plane of Lunia. Tears filling her eyes, the ghost of Aribeth finally left this world forever. Only then did she find rest, a gentle spirit at last forgiven...</string>
<string name="95607">The ghost of Aribeth de Tylmarande never grew old. She never lost her beauty nor did her passion fade. You loved each other until you yourself became old and gray, and in your dying breath you promised that you would meet her on the other side. Aribeth wept after your passing and then herself faded from this world. Legend claims that she met you once more in the next life as promised, and that your love continues on... as do your adventures...</string>
<string name="95608">Overwhelmed with the guilt of having betrayed you in the final hour, Aribeth de Tylmarande begged for your forgiveness. Knowing that the true guilt lay with Mephistopheles, you sheathed your wrath and granted her your clemency. After that night, she remained loyal to you forevermore...</string>
<string name="95609">Destroyed in battle, the treacherous spirit of Aribeth de Tylmarande at last found rest. She was both fierce and fragile all at once, even to the end. As she died her second death, you could not help but feel that there was an intrinsic goodness to her, deep and at the root...</string>
<string name="95610">Nathyrra found a new life on Toril&apos;s surface, dwelling amongst the followers of the Seer. Using her training as a Red Sister, she served the Church by returning frequently to the Underdark, infiltrating her own kind to hold secret services within their midst and thereby spread the Seer&apos;s teachings. As a result of her bravery, many drow abandoned their foul worship of Llolth, the spider-god, in favor of Eilistraee&apos;s more enlightened teachings and one by one, she helped them make the long journey out of the enclosing darkness and into the surface light.</string>
<string name="95611">Nathyrra finally reached the surface she had dreamed of for so long, leaving behind the demons of her past. She returned to the Underdark many times, however, using her training as a Red Sister to infiltrate her kind and spread the Seer&apos;s teachings. As a result of her bravery, many drow abandoned their foul worship of Llolth, the spider-god, in favor of Eilistraee&apos;s more enlightened teachings. But after every journey into the darkness, she came back to you, the one she loved above all else, and together you learned to live under an open sky...</string>
<string name="95612">Ashamed by her betrayal of you, Nathyrra abandoned your company in the night, despite your efforts to forgive her. She returned to the Underdark and there rejoined with the followers of Eilistraee. Using her training as a Red Sister, she served the Church by infiltrating her own kind and holding secret services within their midst, spreading the Seer&apos;s teachings. Through her actions many drow were converted to the worship of Eilistraee but, in the quiet darkness of her heart she was never able to forgive herself for betraying you. She remained haunted by the memory and driven by it to the end of her days...</string>
<string name="95613">Nathyrra was killed in the final battle with Mephistopheles, a victim of her own doubts and failings. Unable to ever truly forgive herself for the crimes of her past, the darkness consumed her in the end...</string>
<string name="95614">The bards sing of Valen adventuring with you for a time, though the two of you eventually parted ways. The tales of his exploits throughout Faerun are many, but always the tiefling remained alone and apart from those he protected. Some claim that he found his way back to Sigil where he became an important figure within the city&apos;s powerful factions, unifying some and destroying others. Valen always remembered you as a friend and companion, however, someone with whom he had made a personal connection. He returned to you on numerous occasions, accompanying you in your exploits when he was not already embroiled in his own...</string>
<string name="95615">Valen escaped the loneliness of his blood at last, finding in you that other part of his soul that he had always missed. Though the two of you were not always together, you were also never truly apart, and more often than not you were inseperable during the greatest of your adventures. Even when the two of you returned to the planes, he claimed he no longer felt the call of the Blood War within his veins. His heart, he told you, was full enough with you alone...</string>
<string name="95616">It is said that Valen explored many places in Faerun after parting ways with you. In many ways, after betraying you, he became little more than a lost soul, doomed to wander alone forever, desiring nothing more than to be felled in battle. In time, he left Toril behind and returned to the planes, the call of the Blood War still pounding in his veins...</string>
<string name="95617">A victim of his own demonic taint and his inability to escape the powerful influence of the arch-devil Mephistopheles&apos;, it came as little surprise that Valen betrayed you in the end. He died in battle as he would have wanted, but his name was soon forgotten in the wake of your greater victory...</string>
<string name="95618">[DEEKIN REACHES END BATTLE - FATE 4] He lives out the remainder of his life.</string>
<string name="95619">Deekin would go on to become a legendary bard and adventurer in his own right, occasionally joining you in your exploits and often getting caught up in his own. He lived a good life in Waterdeep with many friends, becoming ever more famous and gaining the sense of confidence he had always lacked. He eventually returned as a celebrated hero to his former tribe in the Nether Mountains, however, becoming their first true diplomat and greatest chieftain. He led his tribe out of hiding and negotiated the founding of a permanent mixed-race settlement with a human farming community grateful for the protection they could offer. This unique community of kobolds became a valued bridge between the various groups of beasts and men who once had once known each other only in battle but now sought peace. Deekin&apos;s eventual passing was mourned by many... though you can be sure his legacy will live on in a new generation of Scalesingers eager to find their own adventures just as their father did before them...</string>
<string name="95620">Having fallen victim to Mephistopheles&apos; manipulation, Deekin berated himself for months after his attempt to betray you. The guilt gave birth to an inner resolve, however; a commitment to be true to himself and beholding to the powers of the world no more. Armed by this decision, he went on to a rather successful adventuring career, eventually returned as a celebrated hero to his former tribe in the Nether Mountains. He became their first true diplomat and greatest chieftain, leading them out of the caverns and founding a permanent mixed-race settlement with a human farming community grateful for the protection they could offer. This unique kobold community became a valued bridge between the various groups of beasts and men who once had once known each other only in battle but now sought peace.</string>
<string name="95621">Turned against you at the end by Mephistopheles, Deekin died an ignoble death, never having the chance to taste the true freedom he had always craved. In betraying you, he also ultimately betrayed himself, choosing instead to serve the will of others rather than his own...</string>
<string name="95622">You became a terror on the face of Toril, legends claiming that your armies spread the darkness that was within your heart over the lands of Faerun. You were yet another challenge for the heroes of the land to face, and it is said that upon your inevitable defeat by the forces of good you swore revenge. In tales told by drunken bards, your spirit festers in a dungeon far beneath a plain that remembers your ancient battles only by the old bones still bleaching in the sun. One day your ambition will demand your return... or so the bards will claim.</string>
<string name="95623">Saved from the destruction that would have been visited upon them by Mephistopheles, the citizens of Toril joined together in showering you with their gratitude. A holiday was named in your honor, and in the days to come you would rise in power, becoming confidante to the lords of nations who sought counsel from the wisest of champions. Legends conflict in their claims of where you went after this, some saying you disappeared mysteriously and some saying you rose to become a benevolent ruler... the only surety is that your name is uttered alongside the greatest heroes the Realms has ever known.</string>
<string name="95624">Word of your hell-borne alliance with Mephistopheles spread far and wide throughout the planes. Armies trembled before the two of you, lords and ladies pandered to your every whim, and evil permeated the ground upon which you trod. Nothing could stop you and nothing ever did...</string>
<string name="95625">When all was said and done and an end put to the fiendish plans of Mephistopheles, monuments to your victory were erected throughout the world of Toril. Over time, tales of your heroism grew into legends, then into myths. It is said you walked the planes and some say you walk them still, sowing the seeds of goodness and hope wherever you go...</string>
<string name="95626">News of your escape from the Hells and triumph over Mephistopheles spread far and wide throughout the realms. Armies trembled before you, lords and ladies pandered to your every whim, and evil permeated the ground upon which you trod. In time, some began to wonder if life under Mephistopheles might have been kinder. Old, now, and wise, you smile to yourself... Yes, they were probably right...</string>
<string name="95627">With Mephistopheles bound to your service, you quickly grew in power and status. Bards penned songs of the Devil Tamer and, through your adventures, you came to live a long life of wealth and privelege. Some loved you, some feared you but all gave you their respect. You were the Devil Tamer, the Hero of Waterdeep, a legend in your own time...</string>
<string name="95628">Yet not all sat so well with you for, when you commanded Mephistopheles, you had placed your trust in a devil&apos;s word. You used no True Name to bind him, nor did you extinguish the fire that was his life. To the end of your days, you possessed a certainty that somewhere in the vastness of the planes, the archdevil was licking his wounds and waiting for you, plotting his revenge. You watch and wait for that day to come, and when it does you know that you will have to fight him to the last breath.</string>
<string name="95629">As promised, however, you built an inn of your own in Waterdeep and people came from miles around to torment the fallen devil that was its chambermaid...</string>

<string name="95631">The end.</string>
<string name="95632">The end.</string>
<string name="95633">Like the other fiends inhabiting the town, this devil has the hunched appearance of a manual laborer. It probably works in the ice quarry with its fellow Baatezu.</string>
<string name="95634">The quarry worker looks at you in surprise, then peers over its shoulder to see if you were talking to anyone else. &quot;Who, me?&quot; it asks. &quot;How come?&quot;</string>
<string name="95635">&quot;Then pike off, berk. I&apos;ve got work to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="95636">&quot;You want a fight? Well you&apos;ve got one, then!&quot;</string>
<string name="95637">&quot;Well... That&apos;s actually not a bad reason. To be honest, I kind of like it... Now put &apos;em up, &lt;mister/missus&gt;!&quot;</string>
<string name="95638">&quot;Hmph. I&apos;ll show you evil, berk!&quot;</string>
<string name="95639">&quot;Demons? In Cania? Where!? Let me at them! I&apos;ll tear their hearts out! This Blood War ain&apos;t over yet!&quot;</string>
<string name="95640">&quot;Yeah, so? Are you going to make something of it?&quot;</string>
<string name="95641">&quot;Hmph! I&apos;m not demon or devil. I&apos;m a slaad! But don&apos;t you worry, I&apos;ll teach you the difference... I&apos;m going to give you a lesson you&apos;ll never forget...&quot;</string>
<string name="95642">&quot;Hmph. The Hellbreath Tavern&apos;s on the south side of town. Should be enough to warm up by.&quot;</string>
<string name="95643">&quot;Do I look like the barkeep, berk?&quot;</string>
<string name="95644">&quot;Gru&apos;ul, the quarry boss, he does some trading on the side. Gotta catch him in a good mood, though...&quot;</string>
<string name="95645">&quot;The quarry&apos;s just east of town, through the Quarry Office. All the Grinders are down there.&quot;</string>
<string name="95646">&quot;You won&apos;t find it here, berk. Head down the stairs to the Quarry proper and ask around down there.&quot;</string>
<string name="95647">&quot;The one Lazy&apos;s stuck in? Just look for the one with the imp in the gears.&quot;</string>
<string name="95648">&quot;Huh? Maybe ask the gith sensei. She knows about smart stuff like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="95649">The creature sighs impatiently. &quot;She&apos;s with the githzerai Pilgrims. They come here every now and then to pay their respects at the temple and drown their sorrows at the tavern, all right?&quot;</string>
<string name="95650">&quot;Outa my way. Gru&apos;ul gave me a holiday.&quot;</string>
<string name="95651">&quot;Gotta get back to work. Gru&apos;ul&apos;s orders...&quot; the creature mentions by way of apology.</string>
<string name="95652">&quot;Pike off,&quot; the creature mutters, shuffling off into the cold wind.</string>
<string name="95653">&quot;Harrumph. The Sleeping Man, is it?&quot; The creature spits a foul-smelling substance to the ground. &quot;May he rot and freeze and rot again! The Hells have no room for bastards like him from Elysium.&quot;</string>
<string name="95654">The pale white flesh of this muscular creature is scarred from countless beatings. A scorched branding mark identifies it as a prisoner of the Blood War. It seems skittish and nervous as you approach.</string>
<string name="95655">GENERIC DEVIL QUARRY WORKER. CAN BE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE CITY BUT CONCENTRATED AROUND THE QUARRY.</string>

<string name="95658">&quot;Ha ha... ha...? Er, I was only kidding...&quot;</string>
<string name="95659">&quot;I don&apos;t have to answer to you! Bring it on!&quot;</string>
<string name="95660">&quot;Because I feel like it!&quot;</string>
<string name="95661">&quot;Because you&apos;re evil!&quot;</string>
<string name="95662">&quot;Because you&apos;re a demon!&quot;</string>
<string name="95663">&quot;Because you&apos;re a devil!&quot;</string>
<string name="95664">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="95665">&quot;Could you tell me where I might find a warm drink?&quot;</string>
<string name="95666">&quot;Are there any stores around here?&quot;</string>
<string name="95667">&quot;I&apos;m looking for Quarry Grinder 5.&quot;</string>
<string name="95668">&quot;Where can I learn the Reaper&apos;s True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="95669">&quot;The gith sensei? Who&apos;s that?&quot;</string>
<string name="95670">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Leave]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="95671">&quot;I seek the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="95672">Quarry Grinder 5 hums contentedly, its past troubles long forgotten.</string>
<string name="95673">This Quarry Grinder has had its gear assembly dismantled. Various cogs and belts are scattered about the ice, slowly getting buried in the snow.</string>
<string name="95674">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; It doesn&apos;t take long for you to realize that you have no idea what you&apos;re doing. None of the gears seem to mesh together and somehow you always end up with a spare belt left over.</string>
<string name="95675">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; The assembly fits together in a fairly logical fashion. You snap the last belt into place and Quarry Grinder 5 hums into action, as good as new.</string>
<string name="95676">This Quarry Grinder appears to have an imp caught within its gears.</string>
<string name="95677">This Quarry Grinder seems to be in fine working condition.</string>
<string name="95678">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="95679">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Intelligence]&lt;/Start&gt; &lt;StartAction&gt;Repair the gear assembly.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="95680">Doing his best to avoid eye contact, the quarry boss tries to straighten a stack of papers on his desk. His claws get in the way, however, scattering them all over again.</string>
<string name="95681">&quot;Why are you always so damn polite? Honestly, that bile you&apos;re spewing gets right under my skin and just eats away. Graugh! See that? Just the thought of it is making me twitch!&quot;</string>
<string name="95682">&quot;Hey now, True Names are dangerous things. Wars have been fought over less than that, empires have fallen. I don&apos;t have what you&apos;re looking for and, even if I did, I wouldn&apos;t give it to you, so pike off...&quot;</string>
<string name="95683">&quot;Clueless berks... Welcome to the Outer Planes, you basket-weaving nitwit! The Nine Hells of Baator, to be exact!&quot;</string>
<string name="95684">&quot;This here is the City of Lost Souls, a remote outpost in the wastes of Cania, the Eighth Hell of Baator. Look up and you&apos;ll see Maladomini, the Seventh. Dig down and you&apos;ll find the Ninth, Nessus.&quot;</string>
<string name="95685">&quot;How many questions do you intend to ask, you annoying pea-brained gnat!? Some of the Hells are hot, some aren&apos;t, all right? Phlegethos, the Fourth Hell, has rivers of liquid fire! What does it matter?&quot;</string>
<string name="95686">&quot;The Big M? Tall, dark, and evil? You&apos;re lucky if you&apos;ll ever be half as bad as he is, you snot-nosed spawn of a rakshasan litter! He&apos;s the one who named me Quarry Boss, I&apos;ll have you know...&quot;</string>
<string name="95687">&quot;Get on with it, then, you smelly tongue-wagger. All this talking is making my scales itch!&quot;</string>
<string name="95688">&quot;Hrmph! What does any devil want? To slay a demon in the Blood War, to sow the seeds of evil and grow in power, to defeat Asmodeus and become Lord of the Ninth! All things come down to this!&quot;</string>
<string name="95689">&quot;Ha! Do we go for tea and play a little chess while warming our feet by his fires? Gnat-brained flat-head! The Big M has no time for the likes of me! Not that I don&apos;t have my ambitions, mind you...&quot; </string>
<string name="95690">&quot;But yes, now that you mention it, there were some nasty rumors about some drow she-wench in some distant world who discovered the Big M&apos;s True Name. It seemed too far-fetched to be true but who knows...&quot;</string>
<string name="95691">&quot;Mephistopheles, Lord of Cania, the Eighth Hell, beholden to none but Asmodeus, Lord of Nessus, the Ninth Hell, who is king of them all. Like me, he is of the Baatezu, the devilkind.&quot;</string>
<string name="95692">&quot;I bartered the latest shipment of ice for some goods from the capital. Them gith lightened their load with me, too. And then those damn fool spirits keep pawning off their heirlooms... Have a look around.&quot;</string>
<string name="95693">&quot;Farking quasit-lipped angel lovers! &apos;Sleeping Man this, Sleeping Man that!&apos; You pilgrims are giving me an ulcer! He&apos;s a planetar, all right? An angel in the Hells&apos; own depths... Now get over it!&quot;</string>
<string name="95694">Smoke rolls off of the quarry boss&apos; scaly flesh as he paces the small office. Broken furniture is scattered about and the walls bear the dented, smoldering marks of his meaty fists.</string>
<string name="95695">He sighs, shaking his head. &quot;Here we go again. What are you, some kind of paladin? Insolent pus-toad! Fine, you want a fight? Let&apos;s fight! But for crying out loud, at least tell me why!&quot;</string>
<string name="95696">&quot;So that&apos;s how it is, is it? You&apos;re worse than a monkey with a magic wand... Now get out of my sight!&quot;</string>
<string name="95697">&quot;Oooh, now you&apos;re talking big, little &lt;mister/missus&gt; fancy pants! That&apos;s it, you&apos;re going down!&quot;</string>
<string name="95698">&quot;Oooh, because you feel like it... Well I feel like bashing your puny little cranium into these cast iron walls, so let&apos;s get it on, you steaming pile of gorgon bile!&quot;</string>
<string name="95699">&quot;Of course I&apos;m evil, you addle-brained fiddle-twit! These are the Nine Hells! I&apos;m a devil! What part of this whole scenario don&apos;t you understand!? Oooh, I&apos;m gonna teach you a lesson...&quot;</string>
<string name="95700">&quot;At least get it right, you pea-brained fleece-ape! I&apos;m a devil! D-E-V-I-L! Baatezu! Got it?&quot;</string>
<string name="95701">&quot;The demons can go to heck for all I care, always bragging about how many more layers they have in their namby-pamby little Abyss! It&apos;s about quality, not quantity, damn it! Bloody trumpet blasters... Now where were we?&quot;</string>
<string name="95702">&quot;Of course I&apos;m a devil, you sniveling snot-monkey! This is Baator! Are you going to try to kill every last one of us? Oooh, I ought to teach you a lesson...&quot;</string>
<string name="95703">&quot;Scum-chewing bile-monger... So what is it? Speak up, now! I can barely hear your pathetic mewling...&quot;</string>
<string name="95704">&quot;Goodbye,&quot; he says, mocking you. He turns away, drives his smoldering fist into a nearby wall, and mutters some cruel invective under his breath.</string>
<string name="95705">&quot;Hey, it wasn&apos;t my idea to build a capital city out of ice and then fill it with steam baths! If this quarry doesn&apos;t stay operational, the Big M will be demoted to Lord of the Puddle! Now what&apos;s wrong with Quarry Grinder 5!?&quot;</string>
<string name="95706">&quot;Look at me. See this scaly skin? See these fiery eyes? I&apos;m a pit fiend! A PIT FIEND, for crying out loud! I LIKE cruelty, you nit-picking quasit-lover! Now what&apos;s really the matter with Quarry Grinder 5?&quot;</string>
<string name="95707">&quot;You motherless, arse-picking, half-witted clump of meaningless flea-bait! You dismantled my grinder? You venomous turkey-gobbler!&quot;</string>
<string name="95708">&quot;Not if I eat your leathery corpse for dinner, you won&apos;t... Rock licker...&quot;</string>
<string name="95709">&quot;You can and you will! Stupid skull-draggers... It&apos;s going to cost me 35,000 gold to get a specialist down here to fix it and another 15,000 for parts. Have you got 50,000 gold kicking around, nadwit?&quot;</string>
<string name="95710">&quot;Then don&apos;t but I&apos;ll remind you, you inconsequential runt, that I run the only store in town. If you want the goods I carry, then you&apos;d best stay on my good side... And I&apos;ll warn you, it&apos;s very small.&quot;</string>
<string name="95711">&quot;You&apos;d better be or I&apos;ll have your scrawny corpse for dinner, pus-maggot... Now go on, get out of here.&quot;</string>
<string name="95712">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Don&apos;t make me laugh, you puny little blood monkey... You bust it, you buy it, understood? 50,000 gold and I&apos;ll forget I ever hated your pathetic, pustulant guts!&quot;</string>
<string name="95713">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Whatever! Just hand it over so I can get the damn thing repaired. Slavering lickspittle...&quot;</string>
<string name="95714">&quot;Then don&apos;t but I&apos;ll remind you, you inconsequential runt, that I run the only store in town. If you want the goods I carry, then you&apos;d best stay on my good side... And I&apos;ll warn you, it&apos;s very small.&quot;</string>
<string name="95715">&quot;There&apos;s always an imp caught in it, hell-breath! Every day, it seems I have to go down there and feed another imp through! Imps are a dime a dozen but I&apos;ve only got one Quarry Grinder 5, you hear me!?&quot;</string>
<string name="95716">&quot;Horrible? Nonsense! That&apos;s commerce! Snot-buggering fiscal utopians... Have you got a better suggestion? Quarry Grinder 5 is down and, while it is, idle hands are the devils&apos; playground.&quot;</string>
<string name="95717">&quot;A playground&apos;s the last thing we need... Playgrounds lead to joy! Laughter! Children... Bah! I don&apos;t even want to think about it! We&apos;re devils, understood? Hard, mean, tough, fangs, horns, you know the drill.&quot;</string>
<string name="95718">&quot;Unh? An imp in my grinder? Maggot-snakes! Feed him through, then, feed him through! I&apos;ve got plenty of imps but only one Quarry Grinder 5, you hear me!?&quot;</string>
<string name="95719">&quot;A holiday? Meddling grub-zombie! Why, it&apos;ll be a cold day in hell before I ever... ever... Never mind! What reason could we possibly have for declaring a holiday!?&quot;</string>
<string name="95720">&quot;Stop wasting my time and go feed that damned imp through the grinder like I told you to! Bilious boil on my devil-in-law&apos;s bum...&quot;</string>
<string name="95721">&quot;Hrmph! Not a bad point, is it... And if the Big M&apos;s leaving Cania, that means he ain&apos;t coming back... And if he ain&apos;t coming back, he ain&apos;t going to need any more of this blasted ice...&quot;</string>
<string name="95722">&quot;There&apos;s no &apos;we&apos; about it, alright? It&apos;s my management style! Mine! Welcome to the Hells, here&apos;s your sledgehammer, got it? Entry-level sludge-mucker!&quot;</string>
<string name="95723">&quot;Horrible? Nonsense! That&apos;s commerce! Snot-buggering fiscal utopians... Have you got a better suggestion? Quarry Grinder 5 is down and, while it is, idle hands are the devils&apos; playground.&quot;</string>
<string name="95724">&quot;A playground&apos;s the last thing we need... Playgrounds lead to joy! Laughter! Children... Bah! I don&apos;t even want to think about it! We&apos;re devils, understood? Hard, mean, tough, fangs, horns, you know the drill.&quot;</string>
<string name="95725">&quot;That&apos;s the spirit! Rage-maddened dung-monkey... Come back when you&apos;re done. We&apos;ll wash up the blood and I&apos;ll show you what I&apos;ve got in stock, alright?&quot;</string>
<string name="95726">&quot;Then don&apos;t but I&apos;ll remind you, you inconsequential runt, that I run the only store in town. If you want the goods I carry, then you&apos;d best stay on my good side... And I&apos;ll warn you, it&apos;s very small.&quot;</string>

<string name="95729">&quot;You back-talking, goat-kneed little maggot! What do you want, then? Did you come here just to taunt me? I ought to turn your ears into coat-hooks...&quot;</string>
<string name="95730">&quot;What do you think I&apos;m proposing, cheese-knees!? Just a little trade... You give me the True Name of one of your precious henchmen and I give you a little artifact I scrounged up in Mephistar while you were away.&quot;</string>
<string name="95731">&quot;Oooh, I hate you!&quot;</string>
<string name="95732">&quot;You fark-blasted, lily-livered, dog-throwing stat-jumper! You had the chance! You clutched raw power in your measly little hands and you let it slip through your fingers forever... I&apos;ll never understand you mortals.&quot;</string>

<string name="95735">&quot;Hahahahahaaa! Take your little artifact, you foolish dog-licker! I&apos;d have surrendered even more to have a True Name such as this! This quarry shall have no equal!!&quot;</string>
<string name="95736">&quot;It&apos;s a relic of the Blood War. The pig-headed demon whelps... Suffice to say it&apos;s a nasty little thing that does various nasty little things to a wide range of other nasty little things. You&apos;ll like it, trust me.&quot;</string>
<string name="95737">&quot;I&apos;ve got a quarry to run, squid-for-brains! Imagine a worker who never complains, who never takes a break unless I tell them to, who never unionizes... Indentured servitude: it&apos;s a boss&apos; dream, berk!&quot;</string>
<string name="95738">&quot;No way! That artifact is bargaining power, that&apos;s what that is! Fiscal utopian dandies... There&apos;s no way I&apos;m giving it away for free!&quot;</string>
<string name="95739">Gru&apos;ul drums his fingers on the table impatiently, his heavy claws scarring the wood.</string>
<string name="95740">&quot;Why thank you, I think I will, you weasel-toed little braggart...&quot;</string>

<string name="95742">&quot;You&apos;re more cunning than I suspected, you mangy little... mangy little... Ahem. Sorry about that. You were wanting the artifact were you? Grrrrr... Will there be anything else?&quot;</string>

<string name="95745">&quot;A holiday? Yes, of course! &lt;LastName&gt; Day! We&apos;ll shut the quarry down, ship all the workers off to the tavern, and I&apos;ll cover the tab myself. We&apos;ll make it a monthly morale-boosting social event!&quot;</string>

<string name="95821">&quot;Goodbye, Gargelflaw.&quot;</string>
<string name="95822">A small imp slumps against the silent quarry grinder, his arm caught within its gears. Despite this, he seems infinitely comfortable, a huge smile playing across his face as he snores contentedly.</string>
<string name="95823">&quot;Nothing going on here. Don&apos;t mind me. I&apos;ll have Quarry Grinder 5 up again in no time, I promise.&quot;</string>
<string name="95824">Quarry Grinder 5 squeals and rattles like a pained beast. Something is clearly wrong with it and you suspect it has something to do with the fact that the hand of a nearby imp is wedged between the gears.</string>
<string name="95825">&quot;Ow! Eek, do you have to remind me? I&apos;m fine as long as I don&apos;t think of it. Gah! As for how it got stuck, I just sort of put my hand in it. On purpose... ish... Ouch! I think I&apos;m going to faint...&quot;</string>
<string name="95826">&quot;Yes, well... It seemed like a fine idea at the time... I was really quite sick and tired of all the quarry work, you see? I thought that if I just stuck my hand in there, I might get a... well, a moment&apos;s rest. It was quite nice, really...&quot;</string>
<string name="95827">&quot;Sure do. Can&apos;t remember a day when I didn&apos;t, to be honest. It seems they always need more ice in the capital. I&apos;m beginning to think it&apos;s just a means of keeping us out of trouble, mind you...&quot;</string>
<string name="95828">&quot;Well, I won&apos;t be telling you my True Name, of course, but everyone here just calls me Lazy...&quot;</string>
<string name="95829">&quot;That&apos;s a tall order, I&apos;ll have you know. The Reaper&apos;s been here in Lost Souls longer than anybody, except maybe the Sleeping Man, and the only one who&apos;s ever known his True Name is probably Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="95830">&quot;Yes, he swept through here in a big hurry to see the Reaper recently. Rumor in the quarry is that he found some way to get to the world of Toril. Everyone gets a holiday but me, it seems.&quot;</string>
<string name="95831">&quot;Yeah, the gith have a thing for him, it seems. Lucky bastards. I&apos;d travel the planes on some hare-brained pilgrimage, too, if I ever got a day off. But, noooo, Mephistopheles needs more ice.&quot;</string>
<string name="95832">&quot;Pilgrims. Religious folk. You&apos;ll find more of them in the tavern than the temple, though, if you ask me...&quot;</string>
<string name="95833">&quot;Definitely! Absolutely! Not a problem! It&apos;ll be just dandy, you have my word on that... I&apos;m just getting a... a feel for what&apos;s gone wrong down there. It&apos;s all under control.&quot;</string>
<string name="95834">&quot;Really? A holiday? How wonderful! It&apos;s just what I always wanted! Maybe I&apos;ll go visit my mother-in-law!&quot; The imp attempts to flap away, apparently forgetting that his arm remains entangled in the grinder.</string>
<string name="95835">&quot;Gah! My arm! I knew I was forgetting something... Golly, that&apos;s really going to hurt tomorrow. It hurts now, mind you, but tomorrow? Yikes, I don&apos;t even want to think about it...&quot;</string>
<string name="95836">&quot;No, I don&apos;t want to go back to work! Please Master Gru&apos;ul, anything but more work... Gah!&quot; The imp wakes with a sudden, frightened flap of his wings but his entangled arm returns him quickly to the ground. </string>
<string name="95837">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; Some parts of the gear assembly are still spinning and you&apos;re forced to give up before you become caught in the grinder as well.</string>
<string name="95838">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; It doesn&apos;t take long before you have the gear assembly apart, the various cogs and belts scattered on the ice before you. The imp&apos;s arm is horribly mangled and he wakes with a start.</string>
<string name="95839">&quot;My hand! I can feel my hand! Gah, that hurts! Put it back in! For the love of all that is evil, put the hand back in! Gah!&quot;</string>
<string name="95840">&quot;Yes, of course... Don&apos;t forget to put the Grinder back together, mind you. I don&apos;t think Gru&apos;ul will be pleased with the looks of that.&quot; With that, the imp flies off rather erratically, nursing his shattered arm.</string>
<string name="95841">&quot;Ow! Eek, do you have to remind me? I&apos;m fine as long as I don&apos;t think of it. Gah! As for how it got stuck, I just sort of put my hand in it. On purpose... ish... Ouch! I think I&apos;m going to faint...&quot;</string>
<string name="95842">&quot;Yes, well... It seemed like a fine idea at the time... I was really quite sick and tired of all the quarry work, you see? I thought that if I just stuck my hand in there, I might get a... well, a moment&apos;s rest. It was quite nice, really...&quot;</string>

<string name="95848">&quot;That&apos;s easy for you to say. You don&apos;t have to go back to work!&quot;</string>
<string name="95849">&quot;Wait! Wait, you&apos;re right! I can&apos;t go back to work like this! I&apos;d just be in the way! I&apos;m a genius! Sloth has set me free! Now I can live a life of one-armed luxury! No more pickaxe, no more ice...&quot;</string>

<string name="95885">&quot;Very well. I will try to take the changes we have made to heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="95886">&quot;Very well. I will refrain from my castings and trust to my blade instead.&quot;</string>
<string name="95887">&quot;Thank you. I will cast as I see fit, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="95888">&quot;I will refrain where I can, though I admit it goes against my calling as a paladin.&quot;</string>
<string name="95889">&quot;Of course. It is my duty as a paladin to keep us all in good health.&quot;</string>
<string name="95890">&quot;That is for the best. I know little of them.&quot;</string>
<string name="95891">&quot;I will do what I can, though the infernal things are often beyond my ken.&quot;</string>

<string name="95907">&quot;Of course. Would you prefer benefits that last over the longer term or only for the immediate future?&quot;</string>

<string name="95926">&quot;I am not at my best but my form holds together well enough. I vote we continue on.&quot;</string>
<string name="95927">&quot;Can you not see how much I fade? I have been worse but a chance to rest and restore my form would be appreciated.&quot;</string>
<string name="95928">&quot;I have all but faded. If we do not rest soon, I may disappear altogether.&quot;</string>
<string name="95929">&quot;There is a venom in me, a fearful poison.&quot;</string>
<string name="95930">&quot;I feel ill, as if a sickness courses through my ghostly veins.&quot;</string>
<string name="95931">&quot;I&apos;ve put some thought into it, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I still feel drawn to Neverwinter. There is a time when I would have sought to haunt the place but perhaps I can be its protector, its guide, somehow.&quot;</string>
<string name="95932">&quot;Yes, the future will come in its own time. Dwelling on it now will only slow its coming.&quot;</string>
<string name="95933">&quot;It has been on my mind for some time. I only hope my presence there can bring peace to my old home.&quot;</string>
<string name="95934">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;? It is not for you to allow or disallow... If it is an end you do not want for me, then you should have left me in the ice and never urged me to take up the mantle of my fallen paladinhood.&quot;</string>
<string name="95935">&quot;We are in search of the Reaper&apos;s True Name, are we not? Should we succeed, suddenly all things become possible...&quot;</string>
<string name="95936">&quot;It&apos;s my penance, I think. I must serve that which I betrayed in life. But it&apos;s more than that, too. I want to walk its streets once more in summer, to hear the singing in the temple... It would be a pleasant end for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="95937">&quot;Why I can&apos;t say I know... Not so long ago, I didn&apos;t feel I had a future left to ponder. Let me think on it a while.&quot;</string>
<string name="95938">&quot;Death does something to your thoughts. They become thick and woolen. Your memories cloud over for a while... Suddenly I had doubts and I no longer knew how I felt about my crimes...&quot;</string>
<string name="95939">&quot;I was scared of the Hells, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And when Mephistopheles came, he played my confusion like a toy... It wasn&apos;t until you came that I realized the Hells can pose no threat to that which is still good in me.&quot;</string>
<string name="95940">&quot;Of course. What is it you wish to ask?&quot;</string>
<string name="95941">&quot;Not if we persevere, no. Our quest is righteous and the gods will see us through, I have no doubt.&quot;</string>
<string name="95942">&quot;And I&apos;m happy that you did. You&apos;ve set me back upon the path of righteousness and I shall not forget it, you have my word.&quot;</string>
<string name="95943">&quot;Nonsense. You saw my distress and came to my aid. Despite all your gruff demeanor, I can still see the goodness you keep buried deep. It&apos;s that goodness that helped me find my own again.&quot;</string>
<string name="95944">&quot;I have heard that when warriors lose a limb in battle, sometimes they can still feel it. It is as if the limb exists but by virtue of their imagination alone. That is how it is but for all of me, every part...&quot;</string>
<string name="95945">&quot;The world seems dimmer through my eyes, the sounds less full, the tastes less rich. Everything is at it was in life, though I experience it as if through cotton batting...&quot;</string>
<string name="95946">&quot;Yes, there is only so much I can tell of this afterlife that will make sense to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="95947">&quot;I had no idea what to expect, to be honest. I had studied the Nine Hells in my training but it is one thing to read of Cania&apos;s frozen wastes and quite another to find myself almost a part of them...&quot;</string>
<string name="95948">&quot;Horrible? I admit I lived a fervent life so perhaps I miss the vibrancy of life more than most. But the Hells, I&apos;m sure, have greater horrors yet in store for me...&quot;</string>
<string name="95949">&quot;That it could be. If this is all the punishment the Hells have in store for me, I would be surprised. Though maybe you have already saved me from the worst of it, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="95950">&quot;I... This is so hard to talk about, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I betrayed the ones I loved, I failed them so utterly. I led an army of evil to the city&apos;s gates and marched them in to occupy and slaughter...&quot;</string>
<string name="95951">&quot;Yes, all this talk of Neverwinter drains me. I still find it hard to put to words.&quot;</string>
<string name="95952">&quot;I died on Neverwinter soil. At least I have that much to console me... One kind thing to come of all the destruction that I wrought. When the end came, it was almost merciful, as much as a violent death can be.&quot;</string>
<string name="95953">&quot;I guess Cania is where the gods put a soul like mine. Or maybe it was my soul that sought it out. In the end, the snow seems rather fitting, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="95954">&quot;Yes, they did. I only wish they could have done it sooner before I&apos;d damned myself so fully. To their credit, they took me by surprise. I had always thought I would outlive the war.&quot;</string>
<string name="95955">&quot;Why indeed... I ask myself that a lot. I think, at the heart of it, I was convinced that I was right and all the world was wrong around me. Oh, they did some bad things, made some mistakes but...&quot;</string>
<string name="95956">&quot;If the citizens of Neverwinter could not be perfect, I considered their failings a hypocrisy. Sometimes failings are just that: failings, nothing more. I was so self-righteous, I couldn&apos;t see the difference.&quot;</string>
<string name="95957">&quot;Pirates from Luskan, orc tribes, sellswords, ancient magical orders... I twisted them all around my finger and made them serve me. If only I could have done so for a more noble cause...&quot;</string>
<string name="95958">&quot;I received my powers from a crone named Morag, the last Empress of her ancient race... But in the end it was myself I served. It would be a lie to suggest otherwise.&quot;</string>
<string name="95959">&quot;Oh I grew up there! I ran as a child through its streets, I knew every nook and cranny, every weakness, every strength... If only I could have been ignorant of it all. Ignorance is bliss, they say...&quot;</string>
<string name="95960">&quot;If I had been been born a simpleton, my betrayal would have meant nothing! I was too smart for my own good, &lt;FirstName&gt;... With an artist&apos;s eye, I knew to destroy something of great beauty...&quot;</string>
<string name="95961">&quot;I... I&apos;m still trying to figure that out, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m ready to talk about it yet. Maybe we can talk about again sometime in the future...&quot;</string>
<string name="95962">&quot;Funny, I&apos;d been thinking the same thing...&quot;</string>
<string name="95963">&quot;Has anyone ever told you how passive aggressive you are?&quot;</string>
<string name="95964">&quot;Here? Fine, but make it quick.&quot;</string>
<string name="95965">&quot;Gladly! You can come crawling back to me at the Gatehouse when you run into trouble.&quot;</string>
<string name="95966">&quot;Why? I have no need of change. You are the one making all the mistakes!&quot;</string>
<string name="95967">&quot;Good. At least there are some things you chose not to meddle with...&quot;</string>
<string name="95968">&quot;As you wish. My blade grows hungry for the blood of innocents.&quot;</string>
<string name="95969">&quot;What now? Is dark magic back in vogue?&quot;</string>
<string name="95970">&quot;Yes, let them suffer...&quot;</string>
<string name="95971">&quot;Oh really... Maybe I will, maybe I won&apos;t...&quot;</string>
<string name="95972">&quot;Have it your way.&quot;</string>
<string name="95973">&quot;Consider it done. Though if I choose to leave one for you, consider it a present.&quot;</string>
<string name="95974">&quot;What a shame. I was just starting to enjoy myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="95975">&quot;I will strike from the darkness.&quot;</string>
<string name="95976">&quot;To the shadows it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="95977">&quot;Very well, I&apos;ll leave you to it.&quot;</string>
<string name="95978">&quot;Fine but I will be mocking you under my breath every time I do so.&quot;</string>
<string name="95979">&quot;Oh, so that&apos;s how it is, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="95980">&quot;Very well, I will try to keep to your foolish distance though I don&apos;t see how much it will truly help once the blood starts flowing.&quot;</string>
<string name="95981">&quot;It would be my pleasure.&quot;</string>
<string name="95982">&quot;Very well, we shall play it safe though he who risks nothing dies a fool.&quot;</string>
<string name="95983">&quot;Have you other &apos;changes&apos; you insist on making?&quot;</string>
<string name="95984">&quot;Fine, but the armor stays.&quot;</string>
<string name="95985">&quot;It would be my pleasure...&quot;</string>
<string name="95986">&quot;Ha! For how long would you like my powers to last?&quot;</string>
<string name="95987">&quot;What is it now?&quot;</string>
<string name="95988">&quot;Are you sure? I would hate for there to be any... slip-ups...&quot;</string>
<string name="95989">&quot;Who will suffer?&quot;</string>
<string name="95990">&quot;What else would you have me do, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="95991">&quot;Consider it done.&quot;</string>
<string name="95992">&quot;Of course...&quot;</string>
<string name="95993">&quot;Good, I was just starting to get bored with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="95994">&quot;All the Hells for a basement, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Don&apos;t worry about me.&quot;</string>
<string name="95995">&quot;Will there be anything else?&quot;</string>
<string name="95996">&quot;Curiosity killed the cat, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Don&apos;t push your luck.&quot;</string>
<string name="95997">&quot;Just pondering the evil I could sow, that is all.&quot;</string>
<string name="95998">&quot;I grow in power every day.&quot;</string>
<string name="95999">&quot;I&apos;ll be fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="96000">&quot;Like I could tear the head off a puppy, why?&quot;</string>
<string name="96001">&quot;Like I could haunt an entire continent. Let&apos;s keep moving.&quot;</string>
<string name="96002">&quot;None of your business, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have no need of your concern.&quot;</string>
<string name="96003">&quot;Evil, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Decidedly evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="96004">&quot;I am blinded. I cannot see a thing, be it in this world or the next!&quot;</string>
<string name="96005">&quot;I am not at the height of my powers but I am not far from them, either. I suggest we carry on.&quot;</string>
<string name="96006">&quot;I am fading, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can hold my form for some time yet but a chance to rest and restore my powers would be appreciated.&quot;</string>
<string name="96007">&quot;I am fading very fast. I fear it will not be much longer before you cannot even see me at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="96008">&quot;A poison courses through me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96009">&quot;I feel sickly, as if some disease wastes away at me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96010">&quot;I have decided that I am not yet done with Neverwinter. Don&apos;t you think the temple there could use a malevolent spirit? Or if holy ground proves troublesome, what of the castle there?&quot;</string>
<string name="96011">&quot;If it amuses you, though I must admit you are taking an uncanny interest in my affairs.&quot;</string>
<string name="96012">&quot;It has been on my mind for some time. I dare say, it sounds like a Hell of a good time, wouldn&apos;t you agree...?&quot;</string>
<string name="96013">&quot;And I&apos;ll never ask permission... I am sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but you have set me on a course and I will not be dissuaded. Neverwinter will fall and I will fashion my throne amidst its haunted ruins.&quot;</string>
<string name="96014">&quot;We are in search of the Reaper&apos;s True Name, are we not? Should we succeed, suddenly all things become possible...&quot;</string>
<string name="96015">&quot;To disturb its graveyards, despoil its grounds, and drive its citizens before me like rats. When I am done, not a single living soul will dare call that city home!&quot;</string>
<string name="96016">&quot;I can&apos;t say I&apos;m entirely sure yet. It seems not so long ago I had decided to surrender my ambitions altogether. But you&apos;re right, my malevolence is not yet spent.&quot;</string>
<string name="96017">&quot;I will ponder your question for a while. Perhaps I will have a better answer for you later.&quot;</string>
<string name="96018">&quot;Death does something to your thoughts. They become thick and woolen. Your memories cloud over for a while... Suddenly I had doubts, feelings of guilt over what I had done...&quot;</string>
<string name="96019">&quot;I was scared of the Hells, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I was raised by the church, remember? And Mephistopheles played my sorrows like a toy... It wasn&apos;t until you came that I realized that the Hells are not to be feared but embraced!&quot;</string>
<string name="96020">&quot;Of course. Mephistopheles is busy ravaging Toril and you feel like playing Twenty Questions... I don&apos;t have any problems with that if you don&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="96021">&quot;How very noble of you... I haven&apos;t decided if I&apos;m grateful to you or not. Perhaps I&apos;ll kill you some day and paw through your entrails to help me arrive at a decision.&quot;</string>
<string name="96022">&quot;How very funny. I don&apos;t recall thanking you. In fact, some day I may choose to kill you for it. But who&apos;s to say? You might make a fine minion...&quot;</string>
<string name="96023">&quot;You have unchained a great evil in me and what is more you never bound me to your cause. In time, you may come to regret that. Perhaps you already do... More&apos;s the pity.&quot;</string>
<string name="96024">&quot;I have heard that when warriors lose a limb in battle, sometimes they can still feel it. It is as if the limb exists but by virtue of their imagination alone. That is how it is but for all of me, every part...&quot;</string>
<string name="96025">&quot;I am because I believe myself to be. Maybe all of this is but the dreaming of a fetid corpse. For all I know, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you are but a maggot gnawing at my eye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96026">&quot;Feel the sudden need to change the subject, do you? That&apos;s a sign of weakness. Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll forgive it but I won&apos;t forget...&quot;</string>
<string name="96027">&quot;That would explain a lot, wouldn&apos;t it...&quot;</string>
<string name="96028">&quot;No, it&apos;s vile. There&apos;s a difference... Besides, I would think that you would take at least some responsibility for my words. You were, after all, the one to play the devil&apos;s advocate, as it were.&quot;</string>
<string name="96029">&quot;It has its moments. You should try it sometime... Regardless, as far as maggots go, you&apos;re not half-bad. It certainly beats contemplating one&apos;s destiny alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="96030">&quot;I brought it to its knees, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I cut a swath down the Sword Coast and led an army to its gates! I gave it a nightmare that it may wake from but it will never forget!&quot;</string>
<string name="96031">&quot;They say that curiosity killed the cat, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But go ahead. Proceed. Let&apos;s see how far you get before I grow weary of you...&quot;</string>
<string name="96032">&quot;I died on Neverwinter&apos;s frozen soil and cursed it with my blood. That was my victory, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Even they could not take that from me in the end.&quot;</string>
<string name="96033">&quot;I guess Cania is where the gods put a soul like mine. Or maybe it was my soul that sought it out. In the end, the snow seems rather fitting, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="96034">&quot;I may be dead but do I look defeated? Thanks to you, my vengeance has just begun... I broke their spirit. I held a mirror to their shame. I taught them how to loathe themselves and I am not done yet...&quot;</string>
<string name="96035">&quot;My Lord Nasher demanded justice so I delivered it to him in spades! I may not have loved Fenthick, the fool I was to marry, but nor did he deserve a callous execution!&quot;</string>
<string name="96036">&quot;He loved me and I saw no cause to disagree. He was a sheep among wolves and I took pity on him, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="96037">&quot;Long before humans ever set foot in the North, long before even the elves, it was the seat of a great empire. Time erased that empire but the one who ruled it lingered on.&quot;</string>
<string name="96038">&quot;Her name was Morag and I could see no justice more appropriate than restoring Neverwinter to its rightful owner. The tribes, the pirate clans, the ancient orders, the sellswords, I led them all to war.&quot;</string>
<string name="96039">&quot;And even then they groveled before me, bending and scraping, saying their foolish prayers. I was their paladin and they thought that would make me blind to their hypocrisy... Oh no, I saw it all...&quot;</string>
<string name="96040">&quot;The injustice of their law, the tyranny of their lord, the futility of their faith, the corruption of their guards. Everywhere I looked, there were lies. If ever there was a city that deserved its fate...&quot;</string>
<string name="96041">&quot;Ha! Don&apos;t be so presumptuous, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I hardly know you. I transformed, all right? I touched my destiny! It&apos;s a story you&apos;re not ready to hear... Come back when you&apos;ve earned it.&quot;</string>
<string name="96042">&quot;I teach, I instruct, I aid... but I do not lecture, &lt;FirstName&gt;, mark my words...&quot;</string>
<string name="96043">&quot;Perhaps it is different in some worlds than it is in ours but here, the Hells seem but another stop along the lengthy pilgrimage of the soul; a black bead along a string of pearls.&quot;</string>
<string name="96044">&quot;Death is a beginning, not an end. Life is but a fraction of our existence, a simple tutorial preparing us for the many lives beyond. The Heavens and the Hells lie along a continuum but even they cannot encompass all that is.&quot;</string>
<string name="96045">&quot;Whatever the Hells can throw my way, I deserve... But the burden has been light thus far. Almost too light. I can&apos;t help but think that something more dire yet awaits me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96046">&quot;According to my temple training, the outer planes are divinely morphic: He who rules the plane can also shape it. All this ice and lava is here because Mephistopheles wants it here.&quot;</string>
<string name="96047">&quot;I wonder what will happen now that he&apos;s gone...&quot;</string>
<string name="96048">&quot;Yes? We are still discussing the nature of the Hells, are we not?&quot;</string>
<string name="96049">&quot;It&apos;s precisely the arbitrary nature of the Hells that makes them so horrible, don&apos;t you see? If all this ice and lava had a logical reason for their existence, then they would lose their power over our minds.&quot;</string>
<string name="96050">&quot;I&apos;m not so sure. I think he&apos;s abandoned Cania. What worries me is that I suspect he hopes to make Toril his throne now.&quot;</string>
<string name="96051">&quot;He doesn&apos;t need it anymore. He who rules the deepest Hell of Baator rules them all! Asmodeus rules the Ninth but our friend is hoping to make Toril the Tenth and thereby seize the prize.&quot;</string>
<string name="96052">&quot;Yes, in Neverwinter, remember? One isn&apos;t just born a paladin. There is quite a lot of esoteric study involved. It just never occurred to me that I&apos;d get this much first-hand experience with the Hells...&quot;</string>
<string name="96053">&quot;Yes, I toil over them within my heart, fashioning them into the shapes of countless sorrows...&quot;</string>
<string name="96054">&quot;That is why I dare not forget, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I was a fool there, too, and some of their folly lies on my shoulders. I must believe that folly can be forgiven for otherwise despair shall be the only destiny I ever know.&quot;</string>
<string name="96055">&quot;I keep thinking of Lord Nasher as he stood before the mob to announce that both Fenthick and Desther were to die... I know now that it was fear I saw in him...&quot;</string>
<string name="96056">&quot;No, not happy ones at all... I keep thinking of Lord Nasher as he stood before the mob to announce that both Fenthick and Desther were to be put to death. I know now that it was fear I saw in him...&quot;</string>
<string name="96057">&quot;Don&apos;t you see? The mob in the streets, in their plague-struck squalor, held more power than a lord sitting in comfort on his throne! He ruled them but even so, he feared them. The plague was but a tool.&quot;</string>
<string name="96058">&quot;All Desther wanted was an angry mob, a weakened lord, and a paladin to lose her faith. We all played into his hand and that was why he grinned even as we burned him at the stake. Evil is insidious...&quot;</string>
<string name="96059">&quot;Lord Nasher insisted that, as paladin of Tyr, I be the one to declare their guilt but I refused. He was old, still sick, and didn&apos;t want to face the crowds waiting outside the temple doors.&quot;</string>
<string name="96060">&quot;But I made him do it and in that moment I could tell that I was on a darkening course. And when Fenthick fell and his neck snapped and his feet dangled... the darkness consumed me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96061">&quot;Desther claimed to be a Tyrran priest come from afar to serve the church but instead he spread disease with every blessing. Fenthick refused to see it and how could I doubt the man I told myself I loved...&quot;</string>
<string name="96062">&quot;They were both weak men in their own way. I should have spoken up. There should have been something I could say... Instead I left them to Lord Nasher and the mob.&quot;</string>
<string name="96063">--------- Random Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="96064">&quot;Power is a siren&apos;s song, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and responsibility a leaden weight. I pray I do not see you topple by it... Every True Name you learn is someone&apos;s fate within your hands. Be careful what you seek.&quot;</string>
<string name="96065">&quot;Power is a siren&apos;s song, &lt;FirstName&gt;. When faced with the option, how do you know you will not pick another? ...Every True Name you learn is someone&apos;s fate within your hands. Be careful what you seek.&quot;</string>
<string name="96066">&quot;Power is a siren&apos;s song, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It corrupts good and evil in equal measure. Every True Name you learn is someone&apos;s fate within your hands... Just be careful of what you seek.&quot;</string>
<string name="96067">&quot;No. Power is a siren&apos;s song, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once she&apos;s freed, you may not hear my warning. Listen to me now... Every True Name you learn is someone&apos;s fate within your hands. Be careful what you seek.&quot;</string>
<string name="96068">&quot;That may be so but it does not dissuade me from fearing the contrary. But I have said my piece. Go free the poor woman and do what you will do.&quot;</string>
<string name="96069">&quot;Yes, a little. I would be a fool to surrender my destiny so lightly... But it is for the sake of all the others that I warn you. Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, heed my words and do not damn yourself in your pursuit of power.&quot;</string>
<string name="96070">&quot;Thank you. You know I would not caution you lightly.&quot;</string>
<string name="96071">&quot;It&apos;s in the Neverwinter Wood, northeast of the city. Fenthick first kissed me there and we carved our initials in the tree... I was so foolish, then. Innocent, I guess...&quot;</string>
<string name="96072">&quot;Then, yes, there was a time... But after they hung him, I fled to that tree and cried like all my future was torn to shreds. I just couldn&apos;t be a paladin anymore, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I just couldn&apos;t see the justice...&quot;</string>
<string name="96073">&quot;No, I knew it even then. I didn&apos;t love him but it felt so good just to be loved... After they hung him, I fled to that tree and cried like my heart was broken. I couldn&apos;t be a paladin anymore, couldn&apos;t see the justice...&quot;</string>
<string name="96074">&quot;And I died young, too, and so did he. After they hung him I fled into the woods and found that tree and curled between its roots... I couldn&apos;t be a paladin anymore. I just couldn&apos;t see the justice in it...&quot;</string>
<string name="96075">&quot;What I couldn&apos;t bring myself to understand was that it wasn&apos;t justice for him, it was justice for me... If only I wouldn&apos;t have been so blind, perhaps there wouldn&apos;t have been so much horror in the world...&quot;</string>
<string name="96076">&quot;Go. Talk to this Knower of Places and learn from her what you can. After that, let us be done with this place. It holds too many memories of my wrongs.&quot;</string>
<string name="96077">&quot;It&apos;s not from here. I don&apos;t think any of these places are. I don&apos;t even think we&apos;re in Cania anymore, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="96078">&quot;But how could she know about that tree?&quot;</string>
<string name="96079">&quot;But that tree...&quot;</string>
<string name="96080">&quot;No, it had my initials in it... and a heart... I&apos;m telling you, I know that tree!&quot;</string>
<string name="96081">&quot;That one that flew by, just as we entered!&quot;</string>
<string name="96082">&quot;Well I was thinking of something a little more pleasurable...&quot;</string>
<string name="96083">&quot;Yes, it&apos;s a mimic, isn&apos;t it? But did you see how it grappled away like that? I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever heard of anything quite like it before... Come, let&apos;s get your clothes back. Your teeth are beginning to rattle.&quot;</string>
<string name="96084">&quot;Are you flirting with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96085">&quot;It is, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="96086">&quot;Whew! I&apos;m so sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s just... It feels good to laugh again. I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s been awhile... Now let&apos;s get those clothes back for you; I can hear your teeth rattling.&quot;</string>
<string name="96087">&quot;Take no insult. If I laugh, it is because you have more than exceeded my expectations, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="96088">&quot;I might be... This may come as a bit of a surprise but we paladins have been known to fall in love and marry on occasion...&quot;</string>
<string name="96089">&quot;I&apos;m a paladin, not a prude. This may come as a bit of a surprise but we&apos;ve been known to fall in love and even marry on occasion...&quot;</string>
<string name="96090">&quot;No? Then let us remember that for the future, &lt;FirstName&gt;... But right now we need to get your clothes back. I can hear your teeth rattling.&quot;</string>
<string name="96091">&quot;Yes, love... Is the word so frightening?&quot;</string>
<string name="96092">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean for you to feel uncomfortable... Let&apos;s go get your clothes back. I can hear your teeth rattling.&quot;</string>
<string name="96093">&quot;There is more to love than flesh alone, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Forget I even mentioned it...&quot;</string>
<string name="96094">&quot;I do too... But let&apos;s get your clothes back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can hear your teeth rattling.&quot;</string>
<string name="96095">&quot;Oh don&apos;t be such a child! I wasn&apos;t speaking of you anyway... I was speaking of Fenthick... Forget I even mentioned it...&quot;</string>
<string name="96096">&quot;To the dead, perhaps all things taste of life. I don&apos;t know, &lt;FirstName&gt;, maybe dust and time are my life now. The spirit grows old, I think, even after the body&apos;s gone...&quot;</string>
<string name="96097">&quot;I don&apos;t understand you! You&apos;re all full of support and encouragement one minute, then spite and vitriol in the next... Well I made my decision and, unlike you, I intend to stick with it.&quot;</string>
<string name="96098">&quot;So go do what you must with the Sleeping Man. The sooner it&apos;s done, the sooner you can go home.&quot;</string>
<string name="96099">&quot;And I didn&apos;t mean to be so maudlin. It seems like everything is moving so fast, that&apos;s all. Becoming a paladin again takes a little getting used to. I thought some of these emotions were gone forever...&quot;</string>
<string name="96100">&quot;But we came here to see the Sleeping Man. Come, let&apos;s do what we set out to do here...&quot;</string>
<string name="96101">&quot;And a sadness, too. Happiness because his love is coming to him, sadness because she is not yet here. That&apos;s how hope works, I think... The two mingle.&quot;</string>
<string name="96102">&quot;Fair enough. The sooner you learn the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name, the sooner you can return home.&quot;</string>
<string name="96103">&quot;It&apos;s good to be happy. I wasn&apos;t sure if I ever would be again. And to think that there was a time I took it for granted, &lt;FirstName&gt;... At any rate, let&apos;s do what we came here to do, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="96104">&quot;Some ghosts haunt and some are haunted. I guess I&apos;m one of the latter. But yes, thanks to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I guess I&apos;m hopeful... Now let&apos;s do what we came here to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="96105">&quot;How can you not feel it? Do you not even have an ounce of joy in you? An ounce of hope?&quot;</string>
<string name="96106">&quot;We all do, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Even me, and I&apos;ve got a lot more reasons never to go back than most. Maybe that&apos;s why we have to do it... Come, let&apos;s do what we came here to do and see where it leads us.&quot;</string>
<string name="96107">&quot;You&apos;re an impossible old grump, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I suppose I owe you that much. I suppose I didn&apos;t have much hope a while ago either, did I... Come, let&apos;s do what we came here to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="96108">&quot;No, &lt;FirstName&gt;, don&apos;t you see? Hope sustains us! How long has the Sleeping Man been here, an angel in the very depths of Baator, yet he lies here unmolested, even venerated.&quot;</string>
<string name="96109">&quot;He&apos;s here just as much as you are. And I am, too. Joy is about being able to find good even in bad situations. Hope is about trusting that bad situations will someday get better.&quot;</string>
<string name="96110">&quot;If you insist, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Do what you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="96111">&quot;Well... a lot, actually. But we can start with a little, I suppose... Now let&apos;s go do what we came here for.&quot;</string>
<string name="96112">&quot;I&apos;m not lecturing... It&apos;s just hard to see you so unhappy, that&apos;s all. I&apos;m just trying to help... Oh never mind, let&apos;s do what we came here for, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="96113">&quot;It is not vengeance that I seek, &lt;FirstName&gt;... All I ask for is a little hope. That a world that has seen a great evil can also see great good... And that a heart can say the same...&quot;</string>
<string name="96114">&quot;I suppose we have no time for delay... A great evil lurks in our home world, Toril. We must shine Tyr&apos;s light upon it and sap away its power. Come, let us make our peace with the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="96115">&quot;No... Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, do not do this...&quot;</string>
<string name="96116">&quot;But what I did was wrong! Countless innocents died by my actions and countless friends as well. To feel no guilt, no remorse, is to become cold to the world. It would be inhuman. Is that what you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96117">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The ability to take responsibility for my past is the only dignity that still remains to me... Is there anything you would ask in its stead?&quot;</string>
<string name="96118">&quot;I suppose the gods have their mysteries. But what is commanded in their tongue must have their sanction, for good or ill. By your command, I am atoned... Is there anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="96119">&quot;Then I will not suffer, you have my word. It shall be as you command. Is there anything more you would ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96120">&quot;A curse, then, upon your descendants. May they each come to know despair... It will be as you command. Have you any other sufferings to heap upon me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96121">&quot;My soul? But that is all I have! I know not what power it might grant you but, without it, I will join the Lost... Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="96122">&quot;For that, I thank you. Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, stop this madness! For my sake, I beg you, ask nothing more...&quot;</string>
<string name="96123">&quot;As you command, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="96124">&quot;But I am a paladin again, something I could not have achieved without you! ...Yet this is your command and I must obey... Damn you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, let there be nothing more you would ask of me!&quot;</string>
<string name="96125">&quot;But how can it be love? ...Alas, you have commanded me and I will love you in whatever fashion I am able until the end of my days... Is there anything else you demand of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96126">&quot;It&apos;s just... All I ever wanted was to be loved. Is it too late? I mean, what if I go through that portal and there&apos;s nothing there for me on the other side? I can&apos;t bear to simply relive things, lose myself in the past...&quot;</string>
<string name="96127">&quot;But do you love me, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="96128">&quot;More than anything in all the world. My only regret is that I had to die to find you. If you cannot love me in return, I understand. It was in the Hells that I met you, after all... But please, do you love me? Can you love me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96129">&quot;No? ...I suppose I should have known. Some things are too much to hope for in one life or the next.&quot;</string>
<string name="96130">&quot;Yes, well... loving you was against my better judgment, too...&quot;</string>
<string name="96131">&quot;And I with mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="96132">&quot;As you are mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="96133">You can feel Aribeth&apos;s malevolent eyes boring into you. You can tell she has something to say but she seems intent on making you be the one to ask her.</string>
<string name="96134">&quot;Madness is the wisdom of the enlightened.&quot;</string>
<string name="96135">&quot;Perhaps it is different in some worlds than it is in ours but here, the Hells are but another stop along the lengthy pilgrimage of the soul, a black bead along a string of pearls.&quot;</string>
<string name="96136">&quot;Death is a beginning, not an end. Life is but a fraction of our existence, a simple tutorial preparing us for the many lives beyond. The Heavens and the Hells lie along a continuum but even they can&apos;t encompass all that is.&quot;</string>
<string name="96137">&quot;It hardly seems enough, truth be told. The nature of punishment is that those who most deserve it are also those who take the most perverse pleasure in its administration.&quot;</string>
<string name="96138">&quot;For the truly black at heart, the Nine Hells hold all the pleasures that a paladin might find in Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia. Perhaps even a little more, if I dare say so myself...&quot;</string>
<string name="96139">&quot;Given the choice, I would make it a little warmer... And a lot more black, I think.&quot;</string>
<string name="96140">&quot;What more is there to say of the Hells, really...&quot;</string>
<string name="96141">&quot;I look good in black, that&apos;s all... What makes the Hells so horrible are their arbitrary nature, you see? If it were black for a reason, then that blackness would lose its power over the minds of its inhabitants.&quot;</string>
<string name="96142">&quot;I am beginning to think that it would not even be necessary. Mephistopheles has abandoned Cania. He hopes to make Toril his throne now. With a little ambition, all things are possible in the Nine Hells.&quot;</string>
<string name="96143">&quot;He doesn&apos;t need it anymore. He who rules the deepest Hell of Baator rules them all! Asmodeus rules the Ninth but our friend is hoping to turn Toril into the Tenth and thereby seize the prize.&quot;</string>
<string name="96144">&quot;According to my temple training, the outer planes are divinely morphic: He (or She) who rules the plane can also shape it. Why all this ice and lava side by side? It is because Mephistopheles made it so.&quot;</string>
<string name="96145">&quot;Yes, I toil over them within my heart, fashioning them into the shape that will be my vengeance...&quot;</string>
<string name="96146">&quot;That is why I refuse to forget it, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Fools must not be suffered. They must be purged and their foolish blood must form a paint so we can write our curses on their walls... So shall it be in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="96147">&quot;I keep thinking of Lord Nasher as he stood before the mob to announce that both Fenthick and Desther were to be put to death. I know now what it is I saw in him... Fear. Cold, hard fear.&quot;</string>
<string name="96148">&quot;Perhaps... But I keep thinking of Lord Nasher as he stood before the mob to announce that both Fenthick and Desther were to be put to death. I know now what it is I saw in him... Fear. Cold, hard fear.&quot;</string>
<string name="96149">&quot;Don&apos;t you see? The mob in the streets, in their plague-struck squalor, held more power than a lord sitting in comfort on his throne! He ruled them but even so, he feared them.&quot;</string>
<string name="96150">&quot;In the end, I could only hate Lord Nasher for so much. He was but a single man, a single vessel for my wrath and my wrath overflowed. It was upon the mob that I truly swore my vengeance...&quot;</string>
<string name="96151">&quot;Lord Nasher insisted that, as paladin of Tyr, I be the one to declare their guilt but I refused. The old man didn&apos;t want to face the crowds waiting outside the temple doors.&quot;</string>
<string name="96152">&quot;But I made him do it and in that moment I could tell that he was a small little man and that he hated me. And when Fenthick&apos;s neck snapped within that wretched noose... I knew I was transformed.&quot;</string>
<string name="96153">&quot;They were both fools. I told myself I loved the former and I suffered the latter in silence. I should have taken the chance to kill them both when I had it. Instead I left them to Lord Nasher and the mob.&quot;</string>
<string name="96154">&quot;Desther posed as a Tyrran priest come from afar to serve the church but instead he spread disease with every blessing. Fenthick refused to see it and how could I doubt the man I told myself I loved...&quot;</string>
<string name="96155">--------- Random Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="96156">&quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Come, let us ignore the pale-faced Knower for a spell and see if we can free the generals in her stead...&quot;</string>
<string name="96157">&quot;That much is true. We face a cunning and ruthless adversary. We must be cunning and ruthless in return... But you&apos;re right. Blinded by their fury, these generals would be nothing more than fodder.&quot;</string>
<string name="96158">&quot;It is names that hold power and the Knower of Names we must find. Let us pry from her every name she knows. With that as our arsenal, we will be invincible!&quot;</string>
<string name="96159">&quot;Well there&apos;s only one way to find out, isn&apos;t there... Are you not tempted by their power?&quot;</string>
<string name="96160">&quot;What are you implying, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I was a traitor too, if you haven&apos;t forgotten...&quot;</string>
<string name="96161">&quot;I already have... But as I was saying, we have some generals to consider...&quot;</string>
<string name="96162">&quot;Well you should have, you fool! I would betray you in a heartbeat if I thought it to be in my interest! Every moment of my loyalty, you grow deeper in my debt. Someday I will call it in... Now, about these generals...&quot;</string>
<string name="96163">&quot;Good. Because I never said you were wrong... Now, about these generals...&quot;</string>
<string name="96164">&quot;It&apos;s in the Neverwinter Wood, northeast of the city. Fenthick first kissed me there and we carved our initials in the tree... I was such a stupid girl. I should have burned that forest down!&quot;</string>
<string name="96165">&quot;After they hung him I fled into the woods and found our tree and curled between its roots. I could have burnt it then but instead I cried like a weak-willed girl and swore my vengeance.&quot;</string>
<string name="96166">&quot;No, I knew it even then. I didn&apos;t love him but it felt so good just to be loved... After they hung him, I fled to our tree in the woods and cried like my heart was broken and swore my vengeance.&quot;</string>
<string name="96167">&quot;And I died young, too, and so did he. After they hung him I fled into the woods and found our tree and curled between its roots. I cried like a baby and swore my vengeance.&quot;</string>
<string name="96168">&quot;I will have that vengeance still, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Go. Talk to this Knower of Places, wring from her the information that we need, and let us be done with this place. It holds too many memories of past weakness.&quot;</string>
<string name="96169">&quot;It&apos;s not from here. I don&apos;t think any of these places are. I don&apos;t even think we&apos;re in Cania anymore, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Can you imagine having this kind of power?&quot;</string>
<string name="96170">&quot;But how could she know about that tree?&quot;</string>
<string name="96171">&quot;But that tree...&quot;</string>
<string name="96172">&quot;No, it had my initials in it... and a heart... I&apos;m telling you, I know that tree!&quot;</string>
<string name="96173">&quot;That one that flew by, just as we entered!&quot;</string>
<string name="96174">&quot;Play the fool if you wish, it&apos;s none of my business...&quot;</string>
<string name="96175">&quot;No, it seems more appropriate that you suffer the indignity of my presence...&quot;</string>
<string name="96176">&quot;You think so, do you honey? That&apos;s nice but I prefer to prey on men... Now go retrieve your clothes. Your corpulent flesh disgusts me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96177">&quot;How much is it worth to you, my dear? 70,000 gold?&quot;</string>
<string name="96178">&quot;Mum&apos;s the word, honey bunch.&quot;</string>
<string name="96179">&quot;I threw that away long ago, princess... Now go put some other clothes on. Your corpulent flesh disgusts me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96180">&quot;Don&apos;t get me started, darling...&quot;</string>
<string name="96181">&quot;If I would have known you&apos;d be so easy to disrobe...&quot;</string>
<string name="96182">&quot;A touchy subject, is it? I&apos;ll have to remember that... Go retrieve your clothes, then. Your corpulent flesh disgusts me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96183">&quot;Not so fast, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I set the rules and you follow them. If you&apos;re a good boy, I might even tell you that I love you. For now, let&apos;s just say I&apos;ve taken a carnal interest...&quot;</string>
<string name="96184">&quot;I may be dead, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but the pleasures of the flesh are still as alluring and there are things I never had the chance to do in life... I will not promise you my love or loyalty but my lust is yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="96185">&quot;But first let&apos;s fry that little beast and make it suffer... It seems a fitting celebration.&quot;</string>
<string name="96186">She responds with stony silence, her eye boring jagged holes into your heart.</string>
<string name="96187">&quot;I feel like he&apos;s judging me, all right? He&apos;s a celestial, an angel. Perhaps he&apos;s even in Tyr&apos;s service... I have made my decisions and I will not be judged! Not by him, not by anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="96188">&quot;Fine, then let&apos;s be done with it. You had better know what you&apos;re doing...&quot;</string>
<string name="96189">&quot;He&apos;s fast asleep just like I&apos;m long dead... There may be some truth to it but it doesn&apos;t tell the whole story.&quot;</string>
<string name="96190">&quot;I don&apos;t know. He wants something from us, though, just like we want something from him. I can feel it. I can see it in how he sleeps... I just don&apos;t like owing favors to angels...&quot;</string>
<string name="96191">&quot;Vengeance... Then let us have ours, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Toril is ours by right. We show no mercy. We take no prisoners. We return home and we return to conquer... No turning back.&quot;</string>
<string name="96192">&quot;Yes, vengeance... Tell me true, though, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Do you really love me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96193">&quot;I don&apos;t want your pity! ...Toril is ours by right! We show no mercy. We take no prisoners. We return home and we return to conquer! We raze it to the ground, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and build anew... It&apos;s the only way.&quot;</string>
<string name="96194">&quot;Then let us tear these devils from our backs and slay them, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Toril is ours by right. We show no mercy. We take no prisoners. We return home and we return to conquer...&quot;</string>
<string name="96195">&quot;No... What are you doing? How dare you!&quot;</string>
<string name="96196">&quot;Good, I am glad you have come to your senses. Now let us hurry, Mephistopheles awaits.&quot;</string>
<string name="96197">&quot;Don&apos;t be silly, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You don&apos;t need to command me by my True Name for that! To the contrary, I revel in it. The books of history will remember me as a great evil... Anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="96198">&quot;My soul? But that is all I have! I know not what power it might grant you but, without it, I will join the Lost... Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="96199">&quot;For that, I thank you. Is there anything else you would force upon me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96200">&quot;As you command, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="96201">&quot;But I am a blackguard, a path I chose on your advice! ...But you leave me no choice. I will do as you command... Please let there be nothing more you would ask of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96202">&quot;My... My lord? ...You have commanded me and I will love you in whatever fashion I am able until the end of my days... Is there anything else you demand of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96203">&quot;But do you love me, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Do you really?&quot;</string>
<string name="96204">&quot;It will make what I am about to do a little easier...&quot;</string>
<string name="96205">&quot;Betray you...&quot;</string>
<string name="96206">&quot;It was just a game we played... I understand...&quot;</string>
<string name="96207">&quot;Good... I didn&apos;t want there to be any misconceptions...&quot;</string>
<string name="96208">&quot;Yes, well... loving you was against my better judgment, too...&quot;</string>
<string name="96209">&quot;And the blackness of my own...&quot;</string>
<string name="96210">&quot;As you are mine...&quot;</string>
<string name="96211">Aribeth smiles sadly amidst the gathering gloom. You find yourself wondering if it pains the dead to die again.</string>
<string name="96212">Aribeth leers at you from the gathering gloom. She seems to have taken pleasure in the terror of another death.</string>
<string name="96213">------- This line must be placed at the end of inter-party banter ---------</string>
<string name="96214">&quot;Must you always seek out the light? I am an assassin, Aribeth, a Red Sister. It is what I was born to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="96215">&quot;It&apos;s just that I turn around and you&apos;re not there...&quot;</string>
<string name="96216">&quot;Oh I&apos;m there, my Lady. I promise you that.&quot;</string>
<string name="96217">&quot;But if I can&apos;t see you, how do I know you&apos;re not...&quot;</string>
<string name="96218">&quot;Not what? Not about to slice your throat? Slice &lt;FirstName&gt;&apos;s? Look, I&apos;ve known &lt;him/her&gt; longer than you. &lt;FirstName&gt; *chose* me. You&apos;re the one who shouldn&apos;t be trusted!&quot;</string>
<string name="96219">&quot;What do you mean? &lt;He/She&gt; saved me from becoming one of the Lost! I have something to live for again! Why can&apos;t you trust me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96220">&quot;I should ask the same of you but if you want my answer, here it is: You make it look a little too easy! A few empty words and suddenly you&apos;re born again!&quot;</string>
<string name="96221">&quot;I&apos;ve lived all my life on the knife edge, trying to figure out right from wrong, good from evil, and I&apos;m still on that knife edge! There is no resolution, no happily ever after! So why should there be for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="96222">&quot;This is my happily ever after? Cursed to wander a frozen Hell in penance for my crimes, hounded by an arrogant drow who believes she&apos;s the only one who&apos;s ever suffered?&quot;</string>
<string name="96223">&quot;When the dawn comes, sure it comes all at once but that doesn&apos;t make the night before it any shorter! I&apos;ve had my night already. I lived through it, I died through it... Maybe you&apos;ll have to do the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="96224">&quot;Please, just leave me alone, all right?&quot;</string>
<string name="96225">&quot;I keep my own counsel, spirit, and recommend you do the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="96226">&quot;But I&apos;m curious, my sister... Who was this Valsharess you served?&quot;</string>
<string name="96227">&quot;She was the leader of the house I was sworn to protect.&quot;</string>
<string name="96228">&quot;And powerful, too, I hear...&quot;</string>
<string name="96229">&quot;She was greatly feared, yes... But in the end she was weak. Her power was not her own. She relied on a male&apos;s power, on Mephistopheles, and that is why she fell.&quot;</string>
<string name="96230">&quot;Yes, it is a good thing that we are all women here. Men bring nothing but despair and the treachery of the heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="96231">&quot;You speak as if from experience...&quot;</string>
<string name="96232">&quot;In life, I served many men and all of them betrayed me. Lord Nasher, Tyr himself, Fenthick... It is only in serving women that I&apos;ve been strong. Morag, &lt;FirstName&gt;, myself...&quot;</string>
<string name="96233">&quot;Yourself?&quot;</string>
<string name="96234">&quot;You are still young, little sister. There will come a time when it will become clear to you that there is no one left worth serving.&quot;</string>
<string name="96235">&quot;Yes, Aribeth... I understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="96236">&quot;Like you rely on &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="96237">&quot;I rely on nothing but the sharpness of my blades and my training as a Red Sister! Leave &lt;FirstName&gt; out of this!&quot;</string>
<string name="96238">&quot;But how, little sister? It is because of him that we are here, it is his quest we follow. In the end, who will be saved? Your precious Seer? My Neverwinter? Don&apos;t be a fool!&quot;</string>
<string name="96239">&quot;I didn&apos;t exactly ask to come to the Hells! They were thrust upon me, just as you were! That &lt;FirstName&gt; is trapped here as well has nothing to do with it!&quot;</string>
<string name="96240">&quot;Have you grown so used to not being seen that now you cannot see yourself? &lt;FirstName&gt; has everything to do with it! This is his story, can&apos;t you tell?&quot;</string>
<string name="96241">&quot;Then when I get the chance, I will make it my own!&quot;</string>
<string name="96242">&quot;As will I, little sister. As will I...&quot;</string>
<string name="96243">&quot;I keep hearing voices, m&apos;Lady. It is as if the very essence of this plane hunts me. And then the anger, it just builds and builds in me. Gah! I don&apos;t know how much longer I can contain it all.&quot;</string>
<string name="96244">&quot;Listen to my voice, then. Focus on my voice and tune all the others out. The outer planes live and breathe of their own accord. Devils are literally borne of Cania&apos;s essence, like fruit from a larger tree.&quot;</string>
<string name="96245">&quot;I cannot do it, m&apos;Lady! I will never make it home. I am a demon in Baator, it will never let me leave!&quot;</string>
<string name="96246">&quot;You must. I will help you. I was one of the Lost, remember? I was one with this plane but for a moment, like sap in the tree. It cannot hurt you, it cannot claim you. It can only take you if you give yourself to it.&quot;</string>
<string name="96247">&quot;Listen to my voice... Cania, it is I, the Lady Aribeth, the one who was Lost within you but then was Found. This man, Valen, is not your enemy. He will pass through you like the wind and then be gone...&quot;</string>
<string name="96248">&quot;Let him go. His blood is of the Tanar&apos;ri, of your enemies in the Abyss, but his heart is of the world of Toril which is not yours to claim. Listen to my voice, the voice of one who was Lost, and let him go...&quot;</string>
<string name="96249">&quot;It... It&apos;s receding. The voices... Thank you, m&apos;Lady. I dare not think what would have become of me had you not been here.&quot;</string>
<string name="96250">&quot;Don&apos;t thank me yet, Valen. Just pray it doesn&apos;t come back before we return home. If it does, it will want us both and it will be very, very mad... Come on, let&apos;s keep moving.&quot;</string>
<string name="96251">&quot;Why do you still haunt me, ghost? I am the one who grows stronger. If the demon in me grows, it is because it is but half of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96252">&quot;Or are you but half of it? Only half of your father&apos;s greatness, only half your father&apos;s power... Look at you grow, Valen. How long until your true nature eats a hole through this thin coat of righteousness?&quot;</string>
<string name="96253">&quot;You&apos;re just a spirit! You know nothing of my fate, of what will or will not be!&quot;</string>
<string name="96254">&quot;Do you really believe that, Valen? I am of the dead. I am one whose fate is long since spent. In a way, I am your destiny. I am what you will become. Mark my words: The demon in you grows and will soon consume you.&quot;</string>
<string name="96255">&quot;Lies! I would rather kill myself than be consumed!&quot;</string>
<string name="96256">&quot;Then it seems you have a decision to make, don&apos;t you, Valen...&quot;</string>
<string name="96257">&quot;I will take you with me if I go, devil!&quot;</string>
<string name="96258">&quot;Really? How romantic... Very well, you know where I sleep.&quot;</string>
<string name="96259">&quot;A little, Lady Aribeth. I anger more quickly here and it always feels as if something watches me... What of you?&quot;</string>
<string name="96260">&quot;Thanks to &lt;FirstName&gt;, I must admit that the Hells have not been the torment I had expected. I deserved far worse, that I know. In many ways, my soul is less troubled now than it had been in life.&quot;</string>
<string name="96261">&quot;Perhaps Cania does not affect me as much as it might some other tieflings. My father was a demon, after all, rather than a devil. He would only have come to Baator in times of battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="96262">&quot;The Blood War.&quot;</string>
<string name="96263">&quot;Yes, the war between evils. I admit that my yearning to paint my blade with Mephistopheles&apos; black blood stems from more than just vengeance or the cause of good. The demon in me wants it as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="96264">&quot;That is fair, as long as the human in you wants it as well. You may not think it but your mother&apos;s heritage is strong in you and far more vital in the end.&quot;</string>
<string name="96265">&quot;Thank you, Aribeth. Those are heartening words to hear in this cold place.&quot;</string>
<string name="96266">&quot;What do you mean, dead one...&quot;</string>
<string name="96267">&quot;You are in the Hells, now, tiefling. Does your fiendish blood boil here, bubble up to reach the surface? If ever there was a time to tap your father&apos;s heritage...&quot;</string>
<string name="96268">&quot;I chart my own course, witch. Neither my father&apos;s nor my mother&apos;s but one between. Besides, my father was a demon, not a devil. If his blood were to boil here, it would be of rage and the smell of battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="96269">&quot;Evil is evil, fool! It is the Blood War that holds us back! The forces of good are weak but at least they stand united. Meanwhile we children of evil prey upon each other, wasting all our strength and cunning!&quot;</string>
<string name="96270">&quot;Look, woman, I&apos;m no general and from what I hear, you weren&apos;t all that great a one yourself! I&apos;ve heard the story of Neverwinter... If you&apos;re so cunning, how come you&apos;re dead?&quot;</string>
<string name="96271">&quot;Enough!&quot;</string>
<string name="96272">&quot;You were captured and executed! You&apos;re nothing but a story now! A footnote! Nobody cares!&quot;</string>
<string name="96273">&quot;Enough...&quot;</string>
<string name="96274">&quot;Nobody cares... So either you work with me or you don&apos;t. I didn&apos;t pick this fight, all right? I&apos;m just here to do a job and get home again...&quot;</string>
<string name="96275">&quot;Deekin is cold all right but not too cold. He wears socks!&quot;</string>
<string name="96276">&quot;You wear socks? How delightful!&quot;</string>
<string name="96277">&quot;Wool socks. Deekin&apos;s grandma made them for him long ago. And mittens. &apos;Don&apos;t forget to sun on the rocks!&apos; she&apos;d always say. Or &apos;You&apos;ll catch your death of cold, you will!&apos; Then she&apos;d feed Deekin insects. The yummy ones.&quot;</string>
<string name="96278">&quot;It&apos;s strange to think back to Neverwinter and my days in the temple there. Everything seemed so black and white. I never would have known that a kobold could be so charming...&quot;</string>
<string name="96279">&quot;Of course, it&apos;s very hard to strum a lute with one&apos;s mittens on... Gloves would have been a lot more practical, Deekin thinks... Do you know how to knit, Miss Aribeth?&quot;</string>
<string name="96280">&quot;Ha! No, Deekin, I haven&apos;t a clue how to knit! I&apos;m afraid it was one of those things that just didn&apos;t seem important at the time... When we get home, maybe your grandma can teach me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96281">&quot;For you, anything, Miss Aribeth! She does talk your ear off, though. Something about snow being over her head and paths running uphill both ways. It never made any sense to Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="96282">&quot;Deekin wears socks!&quot;</string>
<string name="96283">&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;</string>
<string name="96284">&quot;Wool socks. Deekin&apos;s grandma made them for him long ago. And mittens. &apos;Don&apos;t forget to sun on the rocks!&apos; she&apos;d always say. Or &apos;You&apos;ll catch your death of cold, you will!&apos; Then she&apos;d feed Deekin insects. The yummy ones.&quot;</string>
<string name="96285">&quot;Forget I asked...&quot;</string>
<string name="96286">&quot;Of course, it&apos;s very hard to strum a lute with one&apos;s mittens on... Gloves would have been a lot more practical, Deekin thinks... Do you know how to knit? ...Miss Aribeth? ...Hello?&quot;</string>
<string name="96287">&quot;Deekin writes a new song for if... for when he goes back to his kobold home.&quot;</string>
<string name="96288">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ll get you home, little one. You have my word... In the meantime, maybe you could sing that song for me...&quot;</string>
<string name="96289">&quot;Deekin not finished yet but it go like this: &apos;The mighty wise kobold, Deekin the Green got sent to the Hells by aaaaccident. He did nothing wrong! Honest, it&apos;s true! He got sent to the Hells by aaaaccident...&apos;&quot;</string>
<string name="96290">&quot;There now, I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll understand. And it sounds like it will be a very nice song...&quot;</string>
<string name="96291">&quot;It rhymes better in kobold, of course...&quot;</string>
<string name="96292">&quot;I&apos;m sure it does, little one. I&apos;m sure it does.&quot;</string>
<string name="96293">&quot;Deekin not be underfoot! Your foot always be over Deekin! Bad foot! Bad!&quot;</string>
<string name="96294">&quot;Bad? Your little brain can&apos;t comprehend even half of what it means to be bad, lizard. Do you want me to show you what bad really is?&quot;</string>
<string name="96295">&quot;Umm... not really, evil lady.&quot;</string>
<string name="96296">&quot;Not really? You&apos;re like an insolent child... Call me by my name!&quot;</string>
<string name="96297">&quot;N-not really, M-miss Aribeth...&quot;</string>
<string name="96298">&quot;Good. Then stay out from underfoot as I commanded in the first place... And leave me alone...&quot;</string>
<string name="96299">&quot;He was devouring us, eating our very souls to build his army... I&apos;ll serve no army! Never again! I served Tyr, I served Lord Nasher, I served Morag and her Old Ones! All my life I&apos;ve worn their colors, waved their flags...&quot;</string>
<string name="96300">&quot;I&apos;ll not serve Mephistopheles now, after I&apos;ve gambled and lost so much! ...So yes, I challenged him. The other spirits thought I did it for them but they are fools. I serve only myself, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="96301">&quot;Mephistopheles found humor in my challenge and heard me out, listening patiently until I ran out of words to speak. There, in the silence, he gave voice to the one secret I have harbored within me for so long...&quot;</string>
<string name="96302">&quot;Fenthick Moss, cleric of Tyr, hung as a traitor, the man I was about to marry, the man I&apos;ve always said I loved... I never loved him... I never loved him and somehow Mephistopheles knew the truth.&quot;</string>
<string name="96303">&quot;Don&apos;t you see? When they hung him, I abandoned my church, my faith, my god. I led an army of evil against Neverwinter, my own city. I wrought destruction on the world and damned my soul to the Hells...&quot;</string>
<string name="96304">&quot;And to have not done that out of love, out of grief, out of righteous anger? My entire life has been a lie. A paladin of vanity, a blackguard of denial, they were equal poisons coursing through my veins.&quot;</string>
<string name="96305">&quot;Isn&apos;t there? Evil is a choice you make. That is the source of its power. Failing to do good is simply complacency, sloth. True evil is the wilful pursuit of corruption and villainy.&quot;</string>
<string name="96306">&quot;Evil for evil&apos;s sake... You present an argument I can&apos;t refute, firestarter. Very well, my hatred of the world has been fueled by your fire and hardened by this ice...&quot;</string>
<string name="96307">&quot;The Hells... Cania... You present an argument I can&apos;t refute, firestarter. One can only fight one&apos;s destiny for so long. Very well, my hatred of the world has been fueled by your fire and hardened by this ice...&quot;</string>
<string name="96308">&quot;On this blade, on my names, both true and given, and on all the devils in the depths of Baator, I commit all the days that remain to me to the pursuit of evil for evil&apos;s sake. May they learn to fear me!&quot;</string>
<string name="96309">&quot;Nonsense. I was wretched at it. Plagued by guilt, blinded by anger, filled with doubt... In life, I played at being evil, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="96310">&quot;I have had my vengeance and while it lasted, it was sweet indeed. As for power, I have no taste for it. If I am to be evil, I will be evil for evil&apos;s sake itself. There is no evil more cold than that.&quot;</string>
<string name="96311">&quot;Yes, I do. I doubt everything, even myself. Gods can make mistakes, as can devils, as can ghosts, as can mortals. How could Tyr still want me after all I&apos;ve done?&quot; </string>
<string name="96312">&quot;I did, I truly did. It&apos;s true I did not love Fenthick but there was no justice in his hanging, just appeasement of a mob and the weakness of an aging ruler.&quot;</string>
<string name="96313">&quot;Justice, then... You present an argument I can&apos;t refute, firestarter. Perhaps my faith has been refined by your fire and strengthened by this ice. Very well, I shall do as you say...&quot;</string>
<string name="96314">&quot;Let Tyr decide... You present an argument I can&apos;t refute, firestarter. Perhaps my faith has been refined by your fire and strengthened by this ice. Very well, I shall do as you say...&quot;</string>
<string name="96315">&quot;No, but I acted all the same. Righteous is the one who does what&apos;s right when surrounded on all sides by evil. I did not.&quot;</string>
<string name="96316">&quot;Righteous... You present an argument I can&apos;t refute, firestarter. Perhaps my faith has been refined by your fire and strengthened by this ice. Very well, I shall do as you say...&quot;</string>
<string name="96317">&quot;On this blade, on my names, both true and given, and on all the good and evil I have done in life, I commit all the days that remain to me, for better or for worse, to Tyr and to his justice. Let it be so!&quot;</string>
<string name="96318">&quot;I don&apos;t see Tyr down here in the Hells... I don&apos;t need some god to take responsibility for what I&apos;ve done. I made my actions knowingly and knowingly I pay the price.&quot;</string>
<string name="96319">&quot;As a paladin, I was loved, I was venerated, I was lifted up unto that narrow pedestal. In their eyes, I could do no wrong nor speak no ill. What would you have done in my place?&quot;</string>
<string name="96320">&quot;If you tell someone they are perfect, they will show you they are flawed... I sowed the seeds of my own destruction because I needed humbling. So did all those who made such high demands of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96321">&quot;Then he has succeeded, for here I am in the middle of things, neither good nor evil, neither paladin nor blackguard, wanting nothing but to become nothing and meld my soul into the essence of Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="96322">&quot;He was a well-intentioned fool but a fool nonetheless. But he was young and a priest of the Church I served. To marry him was to marry the Church. It all seemed too perfect to be wrong...&quot;</string>
<string name="96323">&quot;Then why do I know his words are true? I never loved Fenthick... I wish I had.&quot;</string>
<string name="96324">Lady Aribeth runs her ghostly fingers through her hair. You can feel her tension channeling through you, passing through your bones and dissipating.</string>
<string name="96325">&quot;What of it? I have seen evil done in a good man&apos;s name and nobility in a cause the good despised. Does that make me good? Does that make me evil? No, only cynical and jaded and weary of the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="96326">&quot;That&apos;s funny. I don&apos;t think I know myself anymore. I know my name, I know the facts and details, I know the story of my fall... I was once a paladin of Tyr, there was a plague, I loved a man...&quot;</string>
<string name="96327">&quot;All of it seems like some horrible fairy tale, like a story about someone else from long ago. Maybe that&apos;s all it was... Maybe that&apos;s how you knew it as well. I don&apos;t know... I try to forget those times.&quot;</string>
<string name="96328">&quot;Do you want the truth? What if I told you that I don&apos;t like who I was in life. I don&apos;t even know if I like who I am now. It seems better to become one of the Lost, numb even to memories.&quot;</string>
<string name="96329">&quot;I see that...&quot;</string>
<string name="96330">&quot;What do you care indeed, firestarter... So leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="96331">&quot;No, I don&apos;t think you do. Please, leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="96332">&quot;I do. Please, just leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="96333">&quot;Why did you light that fire?&quot;</string>
<string name="96334">&quot;Yes, but I was trying to be forgotten... I attacked you for your memory.&quot;</string>
<string name="96335">&quot;And I have answers I had no intention to give. I attacked you for your curiosity.&quot;</string>
<string name="96336">&quot;Maybe so but it was my mistake to make. I attacked you for your self-righteousness.&quot;</string>
<string name="96337">&quot;You know nothing of torture, of anguish, of pain! I attacked you for your ignorance.&quot;</string>
<string name="96338">&quot;Well I didn&apos;t need yours so I attacked you for your selfishness.&quot;</string>
<string name="96339">&quot;What makes you think I want your pity? I attacked you for your arrogance.&quot;</string>
<string name="96340">&quot;I&apos;m a traitor, will you trust me? I&apos;m dead, will you return me to life? I&apos;m hated, will you love me? I&apos;ve lost my innocence, will you help me find it? ...Save your breath. There are some things you can&apos;t get back.&quot;</string>
<string name="96341">&quot;You have &apos;saved&apos; me for a foolish question of faith? What makes you think I have the answers? Go beg the gods for your precious answers and may they spite you as they have me.&quot;</string>
<string name="96342">&quot;There&apos;s the rub, isn&apos;t it? Everyone wants answers and we&apos;ll travel to the ends of everything to find them, only to learn that they were never there to begin with.&quot;</string>
<string name="96343">&quot;I played the sensei&apos;s little game, I learned her Five-Fold Precious Mysteries, and to what end? The dreams of the Sleeping Man are just that: dreams... They can be shattered like any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="96344">&quot;Help? Must I? I played the sensei&apos;s little game, I learned her Five-Fold Precious Mysteries, and to what end? The dreams of the Sleeping Man are just that: dreams... They can be shattered like any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="96345">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;If it&apos;s so important to you, then you don&apos;t deserve to know. Perhaps that will teach not to disturb a Lady&apos;s rest...&quot;</string>
<string name="96346">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You want to know the answer? The Fifth-Fold Mystery? &apos;She will find you by the Gates of Cania.&apos; That&apos;s your foolish answer. Make of it what you will, firestarter.&quot;</string>
<string name="96347">&quot;They made a corpse of the man I loved, a mockery of the justice I believed in, and a demon of the woman I became. You should have let me join the Lost for I have little else to keep me here.&quot;</string>
<string name="96348">&quot;And who are you to ask such a thing? Please, it is better that I forget him... It would be better yet to forget it all... Just leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="96349">Ice melts from her face like tears and her hair clings damply to her brow. For the first time, you realize that she&apos;s beautiful. Confused, frightened, and defiant, she attacks.</string>

<string name="96462">&quot;All right, enough of this discussion.&quot;</string>

<string name="96464">&quot;What are you going to do when all this is over?&quot;</string>
<string name="96465">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="96466">&quot;A sound plan. I&apos;m impressed, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="96467">&quot;No, I won&apos;t allow it.&quot;</string>
<string name="96468">&quot;Assuming you can leave Cania...&quot;</string>
<string name="96469">&quot;To what end?&quot;</string>
<string name="96470">&quot;Why did you almost become one of the Lost?&quot;</string>
<string name="96471">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>

<string name="96476">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="96477">&quot;Much as I expected, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="96478">&quot;It must be horrible for you!&quot;</string>
<string name="96479">&quot;It could be worse...&quot;</string>

<string name="96481">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>

<string name="96484">&quot;But they defeated you. They turned you back...&quot;</string>
<string name="96485">&quot;Why would you do such a thing?&quot;</string>
<string name="96486">&quot;Whose army did you lead?&quot;</string>
<string name="96487">&quot;But who did you serve?&quot;</string>
<string name="96488">&quot;But before that. There was a time you called the city home.&quot;</string>

<string name="96490">&quot;No, that&apos;s it.&quot;</string>

<string name="96625">&quot;Well I have no time to hear your religious lectures.&quot;</string>

<string name="96628">&quot;The Hells are a little colder than I expected, that&apos;s for sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="96629">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="96630">&quot;Why ice and lava? It doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot;</string>
<string name="96631">&quot;Mephistopheles is coming back, isn&apos;t he?&quot;</string>

<string name="96635">&quot;Keep them to yourself. I have no time to hear them.&quot;</string>

<string name="96637">&quot;What memories?&quot;</string>
<string name="96638">&quot;Not happy memories, I assume?&quot;</string>
<string name="96639">&quot;Why would Lord Nasher have been scared?&quot;</string>
<string name="96640">&quot;Tell me of their deaths.&quot;</string>
<string name="96641">&quot;Tell me of Fenthick and Desther.&quot;</string>

<string name="96644">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. All we want is the Gatekeeper&apos;s.&quot;</string>
<string name="96645">&quot;If that&apos;s what it takes to do good in the world.&quot;</string>

<string name="96647">&quot;Stop lecturing me, all right? I can handle it!&quot;</string>
<string name="96648">&quot;What&apos;s the matter? Scared I might learn yours?&quot;</string>
<string name="96649">&quot;I&apos;ll keep it in mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="96650">&quot;You give sound advice, Aribeth. I will heed it well.&quot;</string>
<string name="96651">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96652">&quot;Where do you recognize it from?&quot;</string>
<string name="96653">&quot;Innocent?&quot;</string>
<string name="96654">&quot;You thought you loved him.&quot;</string>
<string name="96655">&quot;You were young.&quot;</string>
<string name="96656">&quot;But you&apos;ve never been here before.&quot;</string>
<string name="96657">&quot;Where do you recognize the tree from?&quot;</string>
<string name="96658">&quot;I think we&apos;ve found the Knower of Places, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="96659">&quot;Don&apos;t get your hopes up.&quot;</string>
<string name="96660">&quot;It&apos;s just any old tree.&quot;</string>
<string name="96661">&quot;What tree?&quot;</string>
<string name="96662">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96663">&quot;Yes, I&apos;m plotting a painful demise for the little beast...&quot;</string>
<string name="96664">&quot;And I couldn&apos;t help see the look of interest on yours...&quot;</string>
<string name="96665">&quot;You&apos;d be shocked too. It&apos;s rather cold down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="96666">&quot;Keep you hands to yourself, ghost. I&apos;m not interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="96667">&quot;Hey now, I thought you were supposed to be good!&quot;</string>
<string name="96668">&quot;Mind your own business... And stop laughing.&quot;</string>
<string name="96669">&quot;Well keep your hands to yourself. I&apos;m not interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="96670">&quot;Are you flirting with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96671">&quot;Expectations? I thought you were supposed to be good!&quot;</string>
<string name="96672">&quot;Well I&apos;m not interested, all right?&quot;</string>
<string name="96673">&quot;A surprise but not an unwelcome one.&quot;</string>
<string name="96674">&quot;Love?&quot;</string>
<string name="96675">&quot;I... I just don&apos;t think I&apos;m ready for it, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="96676">&quot;When it comes to dead girls? Yes. Definitely frightening.&quot;</string>
<string name="96677">&quot;Frightening? Terrifying is more like it!&quot;</string>
<string name="96678">&quot;No, I think I like it...&quot;</string>
<string name="96679">&quot;Whoa, slow down. Marry?&quot;</string>
<string name="96680">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96681">&quot;All I feel is the weight of dust and time.&quot;</string>
<string name="96682">&quot;It serves you right, you traitor...&quot;</string>
<string name="96683">&quot;Good, I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not the only one.&quot;</string>
<string name="96684">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to be so harsh.&quot;</string>
<string name="96685">&quot;Yes, I can. There&apos;s a happiness here.&quot;</string>
<string name="96686">&quot;All right, let&apos;s get down to business.&quot;</string>
<string name="96687">&quot;It&apos;s good to see you happy.&quot;</string>
<string name="96688">&quot;That&apos;s how you are, too, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="96689">&quot;It&apos;s all in your head. Now stop your prancing around.&quot;</string>
<string name="96690">&quot;I just want to go home, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="96691">&quot;Fine, I can feel it! But you can&apos;t make me like it...&quot;</string>
<string name="96692">&quot;Hope just gets you killed.&quot;</string>
<string name="96693">&quot;Being trapped in the Nine Hells put a damper on things...&quot;</string>
<string name="96694">&quot;Let&apos;s just drop it, all right? We&apos;ve got work to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="96695">&quot;You&apos;re right, I need to loosen up a little.&quot;</string>
<string name="96696">&quot;I&apos;m not interested in a lecture on virtues, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="96697">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96698">&quot;Through that portal is vengeance, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="96699">&quot;True, I must face Mephistopheles with no evil in my heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="96700">&quot;Hope, then. It doesn&apos;t matter. Just follow.&quot;</string>
<string name="96701">&quot;To each their own. For me, it is vengeance.&quot;</string>
<string name="96702">&quot;It&apos;s all right. I&apos;m going with you.&quot;</string>

<string name="96708">&quot;You are right. I will not ask that of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="96709">&quot;Don&apos;t you see? This is your atonement... It&apos;s all right...&quot;</string>
<string name="96710">&quot;I just don&apos;t want to see you suffer so.&quot;</string>
<string name="96711">&quot;Yes, Aribeth. Dead and cold...&quot;</string>
<string name="96712">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="96713">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>

<string name="96744">&quot;What memories?&quot;</string>
<string name="96745">&quot;I would think that would make you happy.&quot;</string>
<string name="96746">&quot;Why would Lord Nasher have been scared?&quot;</string>
<string name="96747">&quot;Tell me of their deaths.&quot;</string>
<string name="96748">&quot;Tell me of Fenthick and Desther.&quot;</string>
<string name="96749">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96750">&quot;I like the way you think, Aribeth...&quot;</string>
<string name="96751">&quot;Why bother? Mephistopheles already beat them once.&quot;</string>
<string name="96752">&quot;I don&apos;t think they&apos;re interested...&quot;</string>
<string name="96753">&quot;Too risky. Traitors can&apos;t be trusted...&quot;</string>
<string name="96754">&quot;Read into it what you wish, dead one.&quot;</string>
<string name="96755">&quot;I&apos;m sorry. I didn&apos;t mean it that way, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="96756">&quot;That&apos;s precisely what I&apos;m implying. I have my eye on you...&quot;</string>
<string name="96757">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96758">&quot;Where do you recognize it from?&quot;</string>
<string name="96759">&quot;Burned it down?&quot;</string>
<string name="96760">&quot;You thought you loved him.&quot;</string>
<string name="96761">&quot;You were young.&quot;</string>
<string name="96762">&quot;But you&apos;ve never been here before.&quot;</string>
<string name="96763">&quot;Where do you recognize the tree from?&quot;</string>
<string name="96764">&quot;I think we&apos;ve found the Knower of Places, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="96765">&quot;Don&apos;t get your hopes up. We have work to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="96766">&quot;It&apos;s just any old tree.&quot;</string>
<string name="96767">&quot;What tree?&quot;</string>
<string name="96768">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96769">&quot;Actually, I think I&apos;ll stay like this. It&apos;s quite freeing, really.&quot;</string>
<string name="96770">&quot;Well go savor it somewhere else.&quot;</string>
<string name="96771">&quot;That&apos;s not all you&apos;re savoring...&apos;</string>
<string name="96772">&quot;If you tell a soul, I&apos;ll gouge your eyes out...&quot;</string>
<string name="96773">&quot;Fine. Take the money and keep your mouth shut.&quot;</string>
<string name="96774">&quot;Your life?&quot;</string>
<string name="96775">&quot;You hideous little blackmailer!&quot;</string>
<string name="96776">&quot;Hands off, harlot. I&apos;m not interested in your baited lures.&quot;</string>
<string name="96777">&quot;Tit for tat, my dear. Now it&apos;s your turn.&quot;</string>
<string name="96778">&quot;If I would have known you&apos;d be so interested...&quot;</string>
<string name="96779">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96780">&quot;Deal with it, princess...&quot;</string>
<string name="96781">&quot;What&apos;s making you so uncomfortable?&quot;</string>
<string name="96782">&quot;I don&apos;t like it here, either, but we need his help.&quot;</string>
<string name="96783">&quot;Nonsense. He&apos;s fast asleep.&quot;</string>
<string name="96784">&quot;Then what&apos;s the whole story?&quot;</string>
<string name="96785">&quot;Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="96786">&quot;Through that portal is vengeance, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="96787">&quot;It&apos;s all right. I&apos;m going with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="96788">&quot;We all have devils on our back, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="96789">&quot;Let&apos;s go.&quot;</string>
<string name="96790">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Aribeth]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Va&apos;ardalia the Twinsouled...&quot;</string>
<string name="96791">&quot;Nothing. Never mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="96792">&quot;Feel no guilt regarding what transpired in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="96793">&quot;Surrender your soul to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="96794">&quot;If it means losing you, then no.&quot;</string>
<string name="96795">&quot;Yes, I am sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="96796">[VFX. ARIBETH TURNS TO ICE. PLAYER GETS SOME ENHANCEMENT. EVIL ALIGNMENT HIT]</string>
<string name="96797">&quot;I command you to pursue good, not evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="96798">&quot;I command you to love me!&quot;</string>
<string name="96799">&quot;That is all, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="96800">&quot;What does it matter?&quot;</string>
<string name="96801">&quot;Do you want me to?&quot;</string>
<string name="96802">&quot;What are you about to do?&quot;</string>
<string name="96803">&quot;Then no, Aribeth. I never did...&quot;</string>
<string name="96804">&quot;Then yes, against my better judgment, I&apos;m afraid I do.&quot;</string>
<string name="96805">&quot;Then yes, with all the blackness of my heart...&quot;</string>

<string name="96807">&quot;No, Aribeth. I never did...&quot;</string>
<string name="96808">&quot;Well, we&apos;ve had our fun but I wouldn&apos;t call it love...&quot;</string>

<string name="96814">&quot;Come, fell spirit. Let us finish what we started.&quot;</string>
<string name="96815">&quot;Do what you will. I have no further use for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="96816">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96817">&quot;I understand you challenged Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="96818">&quot;How did Mephistopheles respond?&quot;</string>
<string name="96819">&quot;Why is whether or not you loved him so important?&quot;</string>
<string name="96820">&quot;Once you&apos;ve embraced evil, there&apos;s no turning back.&quot;</string>
<string name="96821">&quot;Fine. Tyr chose you as his paladin, then. Do you doubt his wisdom?&quot;</string>
<string name="96822">&quot;Then pursue it now with all the blackness of your heart!&quot;</string>
<string name="96823">&quot;You&apos;re in the Nine Hells. It&apos;s a bit late to doubt your true nature.&quot;</string>
<string name="96824">&quot;You were very good at being evil, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="96825">&quot;Don&apos;t you wish to be powerful? To have your vengeance?&quot;</string>
<string name="96826">&quot;Tyr chose you as his paladin. Do you doubt his wisdom?&quot;</string>
<string name="96827">&quot;Fine. Once you&apos;ve embraced evil, there&apos;s no turning back.&quot;</string>
<string name="96828">&quot;You acted out of a sense of justice.&quot;</string>
<string name="96829">&quot;Let Tyr decide if he will take you.&quot;</string>
<string name="96830">&quot;You did not act alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="96831">&quot;Then be righteous, here in the depths of Baator.&quot;</string>
<string name="96832">&quot;Then it is Tyr&apos;s mistake, not yours.&quot;</string>
<string name="96833">&quot;If not for love, why did you do it?&quot;</string>
<string name="96834">&quot;Mephistopheles wants you to feel that way.&quot;</string>
<string name="96835">&quot;You were to marry. How could you not love him?&quot;</string>
<string name="96836">&quot;Mephistopheles is just toying with your emotions.&quot;</string>
<string name="96837">&quot;I live by my own laws as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="96838">&quot;But what of morality, of good and evil?&quot;</string>
<string name="96839">&quot;I think I know you from somewhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="96840">&quot;Why do you try to forget them?&quot;</string>
<string name="96841">&quot;I won&apos;t let that happen.&quot;</string>
<string name="96842">&quot;Fine, what do I care?&quot;</string>
<string name="96843">&quot;I understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="96844">&quot;You don&apos;t want that.&quot;</string>
<string name="96845">&quot;Why did you attack me?&quot;</string>
<string name="96846">&quot;I thought I knew you from somewhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="96847">&quot;I had questions I wanted to ask you.&quot;</string>
<string name="96848">&quot;I believed you were making a mistake.&quot;</string>
<string name="96849">&quot;I wanted to torture you.&quot;</string>
<string name="96850">&quot;I needed your help.&quot;</string>
<string name="96851">&quot;I felt sorry for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="96852">&quot;You were cold so I warmed you.&quot;</string>
<string name="96853">&quot;I seek the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="96854">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="96855">&quot;Do you know the answer or don&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="96856">&quot;Please, m&apos;Lady, you must help.&quot;</string>
<string name="96857">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Persuade]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Then tell me the answer.&quot;</string>
<string name="96858">&quot;How have the gods spited you?&quot;</string>
<string name="96859">&quot;Who was this man you loved?&quot;</string>
<string name="96860">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="96861">&lt;StartAction&gt;Use three Velox Berries to ignite a large fire.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="96862">&lt;StartAction&gt;Use two Velox Berries to ignite a medium fire.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="96863">&lt;StartAction&gt;Use one Velox Berry to ignite a small fire.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="96864">&lt;StartAction&gt;Light a fire with flint and tinder.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="96865">A sad-faced, shimmering form coalesces before you. It is a spirit of the dead, banished here to Cania. If it weren&apos;t for the frost that clings to its transparent shape, you doubt you&apos;d be able to see it at all.</string>
<string name="96866">&quot;It&apos;s so cold out here, always this biting, clawing cold... Stay inside if you can or stop by a fire to warm yourself... See the ones with green sparks? Even they are barely enough... It&apos;s only a matter of time, you see...&quot;</string>
<string name="96867">&quot;Would that I did... Would that I did... Those who know the Reaper&apos;s True Name can command him to let you travel anywhere, anywhere at all... To my knowledge, there is only one who holds that answer...&quot;</string>
<string name="96868">&quot;Mephistopheles, curse his name...&quot;</string>
<string name="96869">&quot;Welcome to the City of Lost Souls, our threadbare encampment in the frozen wastes of Cania... We built it here, around the very Gates themselves... Did we do it recently? ...Maybe... It&apos;s so hard to recall...&quot;</string>
<string name="96870">The spirit fades out of existence before you, only to reappear, a new layer of frost upon its skin.</string>
<string name="96871">&quot;New to the planes, are you? ...Well, the world you once knew is but one of many, all of them jostling for dominance and space within the multiverse...&quot;</string>
<string name="96872">&quot;This world or plane is called Cania, one of a handful of planes that, combined, form the realm of Baator... Together with many other such realms, it forms the Outer Planes, where spirits are sent upon their death.&quot;</string>
<string name="96873">&quot;There are countless other planes and groups of planes as well, each serving some greater purpose, but they are too numerous to describe, let alone count... You&apos;ll have to figure it all out on your own...&quot;</string>
<string name="96874">&quot;Here in Baator, there are only the Nine, with Asmodeus, King of Devils, living in the deepest... But in the Abyss, where live the demons, the places of torment are said to be infinite in their number and variety...&quot;</string>
<string name="96875">&quot;There&apos;s very little difference, some would say... Nonetheless, they are bitter enemies and have waged their vicious Blood War across the planes for almost an eternity...&quot;</string>
<string name="96876">&quot;But both devils and demons conspire within their own ranks, as well, so perhaps it is simply in the nature of all fiends to fight... Those questions are better left for philosophers than the spirits of the dead...&quot;</string>
<string name="96877">&quot;We spirits, of course, though there are less and less of us every day... The devils themselves maintain an outpost here as well, the ice they quarry being in great demand in Cania&apos;s distant capital.&quot;</string>
<string name="96878">&quot;And then there are the githzerai pilgrims who have traveled here to see the Sleeping Man and now are unable to return home...&quot;</string>
<string name="96879">The spirit rubs its hands together for warmth, a dusting of frost trickling from between its fingers.</string>
<string name="96880">&quot;I know little about the Sleeping Man save that he sleeps in the city&apos;s northwest quarter and has been doing so for as long as anyone can remember... Some say he&apos;s been there since the dawn of time itself...&quot;</string>
<string name="96881">&quot;A couple of decades ago, a githzerai woman built a temple around him and has been leading Pilgrimages from the planes here to worship him... No doubt she would know more...&quot;</string>
<string name="96882">&quot;Monks and scholars, for the most part... Now they loiter at the Hellbreath Tavern on the south side of town, sipping mulled ale and counting their coppers...&quot;</string>
<string name="96883">&quot;Who knows why devils do anything? You&apos;d best ask Gru&apos;ul, the Quarry Boss.&quot;</string>
<string name="96884">&quot;Mephistopheles has an army of the dead in the distant world of Toril and he&apos;s devouring our souls so he can animate them... He&apos;s taken so many of us as it is and still he needs more... Every one of us in a plume of white...&quot;</string>
<string name="96885">&quot;Yes, about the city&apos;s inhabitants?&quot;</string>
<string name="96886">&quot;One tried... She was the boldest among us, the one most full of life... She confronted Mephistopheles and, in his anger, he did something to her... It&apos;s only a matter of time before she joins the Lost...&quot;</string>
<string name="96887">&quot;The Lost Souls are spirits who no longer yearn for life... They are the ones who have given up... The ice consumes them and they are absorbed into the very essence of despair that forms the plane of Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="96888">&quot;Here is where the Scrivener has etched the names of the Lost into the ice that they may be remembered... Here, by the Gates of Cania, where spirits lose hope that they will ever be able to return home.&quot;</string>
<string name="96889">&quot;We spirits tend not to use names here... Death has brought us to Cania because of the horrible acts we committed in life... It is better to leave all vestiges of that life behind... It is better to forget...&quot;</string>
<string name="96890">&quot;Only when we are Lost are our names engraved in the ice for all to know... If we reach that point, it no longer matters...&quot;</string>
<string name="96891">&quot;It was done by a creature called the Scrivener but now its former guide has been devoured by Mephistopheles... Without anyone to guide the Scrivener, no one knows what will happen.&quot;</string>
<string name="96892">&quot;I&apos;m not really sure if it&apos;s a who or a what... In some ways, it almost seems more like a pet than a person... Yet its former guide taught it to form simple word pictures, so who&apos;s to say...&quot;</string>
<string name="96893">&quot;But, for as long as anyone here can remember, the Scrivener&apos;s been the one to carve the names of the Lost into the ice... If you look close, the ice is full of them, buried deep... That&apos;s how the city got its name...&quot;</string>
<string name="96894">&quot;Just another dead soul like the rest of us... But the Dabusi are a gentle race, committed to lives of service... Their native tongue consists of word pictures that they project above their head...&quot;</string>
<string name="96895">&quot;Just another dead soul like the rest of us... But now he&apos;s just another victim of Mephistopheles&apos; devouring... So many have been taken... So many...&quot;</string>
<string name="96896">&quot;She came here full of anger and passion and hope... She was like a fire in this cold place and all of us were drawn to her warmth... When Mephistopheles came to the Gates to announce the Devouring, she challenged him...&quot;</string>
<string name="96897">&quot;Whatever he did, it drained her of that fire... Refusing to speak, she sealed herself in the cave at the center of town... Now she dwells within it, slowly growing cold, becoming one of the Lost...&quot;</string>
<string name="96898">&quot;Yes, there is... You can put the poor spirit out of her misery... Thanks to Mephistopheles, she&apos;s already all but Lost... It&apos;s only a matter of time...&quot;</string>
<string name="96899">&quot;To help her, you must help the Scrivener... When the Scrivener carves her name into the ice, at that moment will her soul finally join the Lost... It&apos;s not peace but it&apos;s better than torment...&quot;</string>
<string name="96900">The spirit shudders but you cannot tell if it is from fear or a sudden gust of chill wind. &quot;It is a fate worse than death, worse than the Hells... To have one&apos;s soul devoured is to become nothing at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="96901">&quot;Asmodeus banned the other Lords of Hell from going there because evil sown on that plane can lead to great power... Somehow Mephistopheles found a way, though, and now his power knows no bounds...&quot;</string>
<string name="96902">&quot;Etched between the countless layers of ice all about the city are the names of the Lost... Not their True Names, for no one knows of those... These are the names they had in life... It&apos;s to help us remember...&quot;</string>
<string name="96903">The spirit&apos;s teeth begin to chatter, their ghostly click somehow the most substantial thing about them.</string>
<string name="96904">&quot;The Lost Souls are spirits who no longer yearn for life... They are the ones who have given up... The ice consumes them and they are absorbed into the very essence of despair that forms the plane of Cania.&quot;</string>

<string name="96940">&quot;I&apos;m not really sure if it&apos;s a who or a what... In some ways, it almost seems more like a pet than a person... Yet its former guide taught it to form simple word pictures, so who&apos;s to say...&quot;</string>
<string name="96941">&quot;But, for as long as anyone here can remember, the Scrivener&apos;s been the one to carve the names of the Lost into the ice... If you look close, the ice is full of them, buried deep... That&apos;s how the city got its name...&quot;</string>
<string name="96942">&quot;Just another dead soul like the rest of us... But the Dabusi are a gentle race, committed to lives of service... Their native tongue consists of word pictures that they project above their head...&quot;</string>
<string name="96943">&quot;Just another dead soul like the rest of us... But now he&apos;s just another victim of Mephistopheles&apos; devouring... So many have been taken... So many...&quot;</string>
<string name="96944">&quot;She came here full of anger and passion and hope... She was like a fire in this cold place and all of us were drawn to her warmth... When Mephistopheles came to the Gates to announce the Devouring, she challenged him...&quot;</string>
<string name="96945">&quot;Whatever he did, it drained her of that fire... Refusing to speak, she sealed herself in the cave at the center of town... Now she dwells within it, slowly growing cold, becoming one of the Lost...&quot;</string>
<string name="96946">&quot;Yes, there is... You can put the poor spirit out of her misery... Thanks to Mephistopheles, she&apos;s already all but Lost... It&apos;s only a matter of time...&quot;</string>
<string name="96947">&quot;To help her, you must help the Scrivener... When the Scrivener carves her name into the ice, at that moment will her soul finally join the Lost... It&apos;s not peace but it&apos;s better than torment...&quot;</string>
<string name="96948">The spirit shudders but you cannot tell if it is from fear or a sudden gust of chill wind. &quot;It is a fate worse than death, worse than the Hells... To have one&apos;s soul devoured is to become nothing at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="96949">&quot;Asmodeus, King of the Devils, banned the other Lords of Hell from going there because evil sown on that plane can lead to great power... Mephistopheles found a way, however, and now his power knows no bounds...&quot;</string>
<string name="96950">&quot;I know little about the Sleeping Man save that he sleeps in the city&apos;s northwest quarter and has been doing so for as long as anyone can remember... Some say he&apos;s been there since the dawn of time itself...&quot;</string>
<string name="96951">&quot;A couple of decades ago, a githzerai woman built a temple around him and has been leading Pilgrimages from the planes here to worship him... No doubt she would know more...&quot;</string>
<string name="96952">&quot;It is true that the souls of the dead, once Lost and absorbed into Cania, return as devils... But all vestiges of their past life are lost, including the name they bore in life...&quot;</string>
<string name="96953">&quot;Only the True Names remain and that is not the name etched into the city walls... I&apos;m afraid there is nothing there that can help you...&quot;</string>
<string name="96954">&quot;Who am I now? ...A ghost, a petitioner, a spirit of the dead, a memory of what has passed... Who was I once? ...A traitor, a murderer, a seller of children? ...I&apos;ve almost forgotten now... Something that made me choose this...&quot;</string>
<string name="96955">&quot;What is good? ...What is evil? ...Perhaps I killed my one true love... Perhaps I sold one child to feed two others... Perhaps I betrayed something I could not believe in... Then again, perhaps I didn&apos;t...&quot;</string>
<string name="96956">&quot;Either way, it doesn&apos;t matter... Whatever else I did in life, what matters is that I chose to come here, to eke out my existence in this place of threadbare tents... And now that I&apos;m here, it&apos;s only a matter of time...&quot;</string>
<string name="96957">&quot;Either until Mephistopheles devours our souls for his new army or until we succumb to the cold and become one of the Lost... I just want to live, to return home... But that&apos;s not possible...&quot;</string>
<string name="96958">The spirit sighs wistfully, its ghostly breath hung white with frost.</string>
<string name="96959">&quot;As do we all, even if for just a moment... That&apos;s why so many gather here, in the City of Lost Souls, waiting, hoping, dreaming, and slowly growing cold... It&apos;s only a matter of time...&quot;</string>
<string name="96960">&quot;Mephistopheles has sealed the Gates and we spirits can no longer pass through... There was a time when we could return and haunt the places of our death, at least, but no more... Not from here...&quot;</string>
<string name="96961">&quot;No, but it is close... When you&apos;re there, you can almost smell things again, almost taste things... You see the faces of those you loved, those you hated... To feel emotions again, that&apos;s almost living...&quot;</string>
<string name="96962">&quot;He didn&apos;t want to be followed, perhaps... Besides, I don&apos;t think he&apos;s coming back... He&apos;s stronger in the world of Toril and devouring more of our souls every day... Every one of us in a plume of white...&quot;</string>
<string name="96963">&quot;The Lost Souls are spirits who no longer yearn for life... They are the ones who have given up... The ice consumes them and they are absorbed into the very essence of despair that forms the plane of Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="96964">&quot;Here, by the Gates of Cania, is where the Scrivener has etched the names of the Lost into the ice that they may be remembered... There is one among us who confronted Mephistopheles... Now she has almost joined the Lost as well...&quot;</string>
<string name="96965">&quot;She came here full of anger and passion and hope... She was like a fire in this cold place and all of us were drawn to her warmth... When Mephistopheles came to the Gates to announce the Devouring, she challenged him...&quot;</string>
<string name="96966">&quot;Whatever he did, it drained her of that fire... Refusing to speak, she sealed herself in the cave at the center of town... Now she dwells within it, slowly growing cold, becoming one of the Lost...&quot;</string>
<string name="96967">&quot;Yes, there is... You can put the poor spirit out of her misery... Thanks to Mephistopheles, she&apos;s already all but Lost... It&apos;s only a matter of time...&quot;</string>
<string name="96968">&quot;To help her, you must help the Scrivener... When the Scrivener carves her name into the ice, at that moment will her soul finally join the Lost... It&apos;s not peace but it&apos;s better than torment...&quot;</string>
<string name="96969">&quot;I&apos;m not really sure if it&apos;s a who or a what... In some ways, it almost seems more like a pet than a person... Yet its former guide taught it to form simple word pictures, so who&apos;s to say...&quot;</string>
<string name="96970">&quot;But, for as long as anyone here can remember, the Scrivener&apos;s been the one to carve the names of the Lost into the ice... If you look close, the ice is full of them, buried deep... That&apos;s how the city got its name...&quot;</string>
<string name="96971">&quot;Just another dead soul like the rest of us... But the Dabusi are a gentle race, committed to lives of service... Their native tongue consists of word pictures that they project above their head...&quot;</string>
<string name="96972">&quot;Just another dead soul like the rest of us... But now he&apos;s just another victim of Mephistopheles&apos; devouring... So many have been taken... So many...&quot;</string>
<string name="96973">&quot;Yes, he has an army of the dead in the distant world of Toril and he&apos;s drawing on our essence to animate them... He&apos;s devoured so many of us as it is and still he needs more... Every one of us in a plume of white...&quot;</string>
<string name="96974">The spirit shivers briefly in the cold, waiting for you to continue.</string>
<string name="96975">&quot;One tried... She was the boldest among us, the one most full of life... She confronted Mephistopheles and, in his anger, he did something to her... It&apos;s only a matter of time before she joins the Lost...&quot;</string>
<string name="96976">&quot;The Lost Souls are spirits who no longer yearn for life... They are the ones who have given up... The ice consumes them and they are absorbed into the very essence of despair that forms the plane of Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="96977">&quot;Here is where the Scrivener has etched the names of the Lost into the ice that they may be remembered... Here, by the Gates of Cania, where spirits lose hope that they will ever be able to return home.&quot;</string>
<string name="96978">&quot;We spirits tend not to use names here... Death has brought us to Cania because of the horrible acts we committed in life... It is better to leave all vestiges of that life behind... It is better to forget...&quot;</string>
<string name="96979">&quot;Only when we are Lost are our names engraved in the ice for all to know... If we reach that point, it no longer matters...&quot;</string>
<string name="96980">&quot;It was done by a creature called the Scrivener but now its former guide has been devoured by Mephistopheles... Without anyone to guide the Scrivener, no one knows what will happen.&quot;</string>

<string name="96991">&quot;Yes, the Sleeping Man... In his own way, he is dead like us... Exiled and far from home... Some say it is his sorrow that permeates this place and draws us to it...&quot;</string>
<string name="96992">&quot;Why is he sad? ...Why did he leave? ...Why did he come here to Cania? The answers are all the same: His heart had known no love... That is the sorrow of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="96993">&quot;It&apos;s almost warm in here... Not like outside... It&apos;s almost enough to take off the chill, the clawing, biting chill... Even so, it&apos;s only a matter of time...&quot;</string>
<string name="96994">GENERIC GHOST. FEMALE OR OLD MAN. MULTIPLES. CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE IN CITY BUT WILL CONCENTRATE NEAR GATES.</string>
<string name="96995">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="96996">&quot;Do you know the Reaper&apos;s True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="96997">&quot;Who?&quot;</string>
<string name="96998">&quot;What is this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="96999">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>

<string name="97001">&quot;Eight Hells? How many are there, anyway?&quot;</string>

<string name="97055">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="97056">&quot;You were sent here because you&apos;re evil?&quot;</string>
<string name="97057">&quot;It&apos;s only a matter of time until what?&quot;</string>
<string name="97058">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="97059">&quot;I want to return home, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="97060">&quot;Why can&apos;t you live again?&quot;</string>
<string name="97061">&quot;Why haunt a place? That&apos;s not living.&quot;</string>

<string name="97081">&quot;Toril? That&apos;s where I&apos;m from...&quot;</string>
<string name="97082">&quot;I seek the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="97083">&quot;Why is he sad?&quot;</string>
<string name="97084">The creature seems happy to see you and eager to resume its search.</string>
<string name="97085">The odd little creature follows close on your heel, waiting expectantly for you to lead it to the proper stone.</string>
<string name="97086">The creature dodges your blow, apparently having already learned to expect this of you. It resumes its sniffing about, eager to find the stone it seeks.</string>
<string name="97087">The creature&apos;s body is covered in a hard carapace. You graze one of its razor-sharp edges, slicing through your well-worn boots and into your foot.</string>
<string name="97088">The creature&apos;s body is covered in a hard carapace. It feels warm to the touch, however, despite the dreadful cold. The creature nuzzles your hand, grateful for the attention.</string>
<string name="97089">The strange creature emits a sharp crackling noise, then runs around in a circle excitedly. It seems quite pleased that you know its name.</string>
<string name="97090">At the Sleeping Man&apos;s name, the creature crackles with enthusiasm. A picture forms above its head, depicting a winged man walking alongside the creature, throwing sticks for it to fetch.</string>
<string name="97091">The picture shifts and refocuses to show five question marks arranged in a row. The second of them pulses with a blue glow.</string>
<string name="97092">Images swarm above the creature&apos;s head. A snake-like creature swims through water while &quot;1+1=2&quot; glows brightly amidst a sea of more complex equations and a music note emerges from between closed lips.</string>
<string name="97093">The creature seems pleased that it was able to help, though it soon begins sniffing about, eager to find the stone it seeks.</string>
<string name="97094">The creature seems unsure how to express its intent more clearly. Almost apologetically, it forms the image of a rectangular stone pillar, buried in the ice amidst the city&apos;s squalor.</string>
<string name="97095">The creature crackles in apparent glee. It seems to enjoy this sort of game.</string>
<string name="97096">The creature sits on the frozen ground, patiently waiting for you to formulate your thoughts.</string>
<string name="97097">The creature conjures up an image of a gray, rectangular pillar jutting up from the ice amidst the city&apos;s squalor. There appears to be something written down the side.</string>
<string name="97098">The creature shows you a series of four pictures: A traveler&apos;s resting house, a shark cutting through the water, a close-up of a winking face, and steam rising from a cup and saucer.</string>
<string name="97099">The creature shows you a man on his deathbed, then two others standing side by side, then a fourth man&apos;s leg, bared between his ankle-high boots and knee-length breeches.</string>
<string name="97100">The creature shows you a sturdy oak, full with leaves, then a boy held in his father&apos;s arms. This second image seems to be focused on the boy rather than the father. </string>
<string name="97101">The creature sniffs around the base of the stone, confused. Dissatisfied, it trots back to the previous stone to re-orient itself.</string>
<string name="97102">The creature sniffs around the base of the stone, confused. Dissatisfied, it waits for you to move on.</string>
<string name="97103">The creature sniffs around the base of the stone. It crackles excitedly, grateful that you were able to lead it to the right one.</string>
<string name="97104">This appears to be the final stone. The creature sniffs around its base, and then heads toward one of the icy walls nearby.</string>
<string name="97105">Content with its handiwork, the Scrivener stands aside as you peer into the pale blue ice. There, so recently etched, you read the name &quot;Aribeth de Tylmarande.&quot;</string>
<string name="97106">Peering closer at the pale blue ice, you see the recently carved name, &quot;Aribeth de Tylmarande.&quot;</string>
<string name="97107">The creature seems too weary to argue with you but you can sense that it is as glad to be rid of you as you are of it. With plodding steps, it wanders off into the snow, leaving you alone.</string>
<string name="97108">The creature seems too weary to crackle any further but you can sense its gratitude. With plodding steps, it wanders off into the snow, leaving you alone.</string>
<string name="97109">The creature forms an image of the frozen woman passing by at the head of an angry crowd of spirits, leading them toward the gates. The image fades away sadly.</string>
<string name="97110">The creature crackles in acknowledgement. It appears weary now that its task is done.</string>
<string name="97111">Now the creature shows you a series of four pictures: A traveler&apos;s resting house, a shark cutting through the water, a close-up of a winking face, and steam rising from a cup and saucer.</string>
<string name="97112">Now the creature shows you a man on his deathbed, then two others standing side by side, then a fourth man&apos;s leg, bared between his ankle-high boots and knee-length breeches.</string>
<string name="97113">A small, dog-like creature paces back and forth before the cave entrance, whining in frustration. As you approach, it turns to you, apparently eager for help.</string>
<string name="97114">The creature dodges your blow, apparently having already learned to expect this of you. It resumes its whining at the cavern entrance.</string>
<string name="97115">The creature&apos;s body is covered in a hard carapace. You graze one of its razor-sharp edges, slicing through your well-worn boots and into your foot.</string>
<string name="97116">The creature&apos;s body is covered in a hard carapace. It feels warm to the touch, however, despite the dreadful cold. The creature nuzzles your hand, grateful for the attention, though it continues to whimper softly.</string>
<string name="97117">The creature stops whining and seems to focus its attention on you. To your surprise, an image begins to form above its head, illuminated by a dim blue light that seems to filter through from above.</string>
<string name="97118">Looking closer, you see a woman sheathed in ice and perfectly still. A look of utter despair marks her cold, blue face and only the merest breath escapes her frozen lips. The creature resumes its whining.</string>
<string name="97119">The creature forms an image of an icy wall, etched with countless names. The wall seems infinitely long, scrolling by in dizzying twists and turns to finally reveal a single blank space where a new one can be carved.</string>
<string name="97120">The image then transforms into a series of carved rectangular stones that the creature seems to use for navigation. You can sense the creature&apos;s desire to go to one of them but you can&apos;t determine which one.</string>
<string name="97121">A pair of images coalesces above the creature&apos;s head. The first image is that of a sturdy oak, full with leaves.</string>
<string name="97122">The second image is of a boy held in a man&apos;s arms. You can see a family resemblance between them but the father doesn&apos;t seem to be the focus of the image.</string>
<string name="97123">The creature crackles contentedly, eager to be off. It clings closely to your heels, following your lead.</string>
<string name="97124">The creature seems unsure how to express its intent more clearly. The images it showed you must provide some means of distinguishing between the different stones. You&apos;ll have to pay closer attention to them.</string>
<string name="97125">A new image begins to form. In this one, the woman&apos;s frozen statue is slowly sinking into the ice below it, subsumed into the glacial mass. In time, there is nothing left but a sense of emptiness.</string>
<string name="97126">Jumping up excitedly, the creature emits a series of sharp crackling noises, seemingly in confirmation to your question.</string>
<string name="97127">The creature ignores your question, continuing to whine at the cavern&apos;s barricaded entrance.</string>
<string name="97128">The strange creature emits a sharp crackling noise, then runs around in a circle excitedly. It seems quite pleased that you know its name. Glancing at the cave entrance, however, it resumes its previous whining.</string>
<string name="97129">At the Sleeping Man&apos;s name, the creature crackles with enthusiasm. A picture forms above its head, depicting a winged man walking alongside the creature, throwing sticks for it to fetch.</string>
<string name="97130">The picture shifts and refocuses to show five question marks arranged in a row. The second of them pulses with a blue glow.</string>
<string name="97131">Images swarm above the creature&apos;s head. A snake-like creature swims through water while &quot;1+1=2&quot; glows brightly amidst a sea of more complex equations and a music note emerges from between closed lips.</string>
<string name="97132">The creature seems pleased that it was able to help, though it soon resumes its whining before the cavern entrance.</string>
<string name="97133">The creature seems unsure how to express its intent more clearly. Almost apologetically, it forms the image of a rectangular stone pillar, buried in the ice amidst the city&apos;s squalor.</string>
<string name="97134">The crackling drops in pitch, becoming angrier, before the creature ignores you, leaving you to the cold.</string>
<string name="97135">The creature crackles sharply, eager to continue.</string>
<string name="97136">The creature sits, waiting patiently as you formulate your thoughts.</string>
<string name="97137">The creature seems too weary to crackle any further. With plodding steps, it wanders off into the snow, leaving you alone.</string>
<string name="97138">THE SCRIVENER, A DOG-LIKE CREATURE WHINING AT THE ENTRANCE TO ARIBETH&apos;S CAVE. IT SPEAKS IN MENTALLY PROJECTED IMAGES, REBUS-STYLE. </string>
<string name="97139">&quot;All right, let&apos;s carry on, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="97140">&lt;StartAction&gt;Kick the creature.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97141">&lt;StartAction&gt;Pet the creature.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97142">&quot;Are you the Scrivener?&quot;</string>
<string name="97143">&quot;I seek the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man...&quot;</string>
<string name="97144">&quot;You know the Second-Fold Mystery. Show me.&quot;</string>
<string name="97145">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="97146">&quot;I don&apos;t understand...&quot;</string>
<string name="97147">&quot;So this is a guessing game, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="97148">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="97149">&quot;Remind me what these stones look like.&quot;</string>
<string name="97150">&quot;What stone am I leading you to again?&quot;</string>
<string name="97151">&quot;Finally. Now get lost, dog meat, I&apos;ve got work to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="97152">&quot;There we go. Do you feel better now?&quot;</string>
<string name="97153">&quot;Did you know her at all?&quot;</string>
<string name="97154">&quot;That&apos;s the frozen woman, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="97155">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97156">&lt;StartAction&gt;Kick the creature.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97157">&lt;StartAction&gt;Pet the creature.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97158">&quot;What are you whining about now?&quot;</string>
<string name="97159">&quot;What&apos;s the matter, little fellow?&quot;</string>
<string name="97160">&quot;So she&apos;s freezing to death. What&apos;s the big deal?&quot;</string>
<string name="97161">&quot;How can I help?&quot;</string>
<string name="97162">&quot;Which stone do you want me to take you to?&quot;</string>
<string name="97163">&quot;All right, off we go, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="97164">&quot;So this is a guessing game, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="97165">&quot;I don&apos;t understand...&quot;</string>
<string name="97166">&quot;What&apos;s happening to her?&quot;</string>
<string name="97167">&quot;She&apos;s in that cave?&quot;</string>
<string name="97168">&quot;Who is she?&quot;</string>
<string name="97169">&quot;Are you the Scrivener?&quot;</string>
<string name="97170">&quot;I seek the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man...&quot;</string>
<string name="97171">&quot;You know the Second-Fold Mystery. Show me.&quot;</string>
<string name="97172">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="97173">&quot;I don&apos;t understand...&quot;</string>
<string name="97174">&quot;Stupid mutt...&quot;</string>
<string name="97175">&quot;So this is a guessing game, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="97176">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="97177">A sea of names has been etched into the ice, buried between its countless layers. Many of them are so deep that you can only make out their dim outlines amidst the soft blue light.</string>
<string name="97178">This woman is stooped over a small bush, picking berries from it and placing them in a small pouch beside her on the ice.</string>
<string name="97179">&quot;If I knew the Reaper&apos;s True Name, would I be picking nettles in Baator&apos;s depths in the dim hope that I won&apos;t freeze to death?&quot;</string>
<string name="97180">&quot;From the Material Plane, are you? Hmph. Well you can forget it, there&apos;s no going home. The Gates are closed for you and me both. We stay here until we freeze or die of boredom.&quot;</string>
<string name="97181">&quot;Pfft. Do you have a better idea? Give it up, berk, you&apos;re trapped and clueless to boot.&quot;</string>
<string name="97182">&quot;Who, Swift? He had plans to wake the Sleeping Man &apos;til the sensei put a stop to him. I don&apos;t know the details but he&apos;s not making himself any friends. The Hells are bad enough without a comedian.&quot;</string>
<string name="97183">&quot;Ask him, I want no part of it. Oh, and I don&apos;t recommend trusting him any farther than you can throw him, especially where money&apos;s concerned. My gold&apos;s paid for more of his tavern bill than I care to admit.&quot;</string>
<string name="97184">&quot;This here&apos;s a Velox Nettle. They&apos;ve got deep roots going down to the lava pools beneath the ice and their berries store the heat. It&apos;s the only way to start a decent fire around here.&quot;</string>
<string name="97185">&quot;Sure, but make it quick, it&apos;s freezing out here.&quot;</string>
<string name="97186">&quot;The tavern keeper&apos;s been letting some of us pay our tabs with them so he&apos;ll have a few. The Quarry Master might have some as well. Other than that, you&apos;ll just have to find them where they grow.&quot;</string>
<string name="97187">&quot;As I said, though, they like what heat they can find. If you spy a steam fissure like this in the ice, there&apos;ll probably be a Velox Nettle basking in that little bit of warmth.&quot;</string>
<string name="97188">&quot;If you spy some wood, you just break the berries open over it and the heat will set it alight. A single berry won&apos;t get you a whole lot of warmth, though. I recommend a good three-berry fire if you can afford it.&quot;</string>
<string name="97189">&quot;What are you, daft? It&apos;s freezing cold out here and there isn&apos;t enough room in the tavern for everybody. You&apos;ve got to sleep somewhere, right? And for that you&apos;re going to need a good fire.&quot;</string>
<string name="97190">&quot;Bah! Mage-fire&apos;s so unpredictable. Here one second and gone the next. It&apos;s fine for burning things but if you need to cook or make camp out here, you&apos;re going to need Velox Berries.&quot;</string>
<string name="97191">&quot;Have you tried it?&quot;</string>
<string name="97192">&quot;The Mysteries? Don&apos;t bother, I&apos;m sure the sensei made all of them up. I&apos;m willing to bet there isn&apos;t even a Sleeping Man at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="97193">&quot;We sold everything we owned to come on this Pilgrimage. We&apos;ve traveled all the way from Limbo, only to end up trapped in the Eighth Hell of Baator for all eternity. And, now that we&apos;re here, she won&apos;t even let us see him.&quot;</string>
<string name="97194">&quot;Not until we learn the Five-Fold Mysteries, she says. Well, I&apos;ve figured out the third one and it reads like a three-penny fantasy novel. Just the sort of romantic notion that the sensei would dream up...&quot;</string>
<string name="97195">&quot;Why did he leave? Because his heart had known no love. Utter rubbish. She&apos;s created this Sleeping Man out of whole cloth and, what&apos;s worse, she&apos;s become hopelessly smitten with this character she&apos;s created.&quot;</string>
<string name="97196">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="97197">&quot;Do you know the Reaper&apos;s True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="97198">&quot;I need to return home to the world of Toril.&quot;</string>
<string name="97199">&quot;That&apos;s a defeatist attitude...&quot;</string>
<string name="97200">&quot;That winged chap in the tavern... You know him?&quot;</string>
<string name="97201">&quot;How did he plan to wake the Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97202">&quot;What are you picking?&quot;</string>
<string name="97203">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="97204">&quot;Where can I find these Velox Berries?&quot;</string>
<string name="97205">&quot;How do these berries work?&quot;</string>
<string name="97206">&quot;Why do you need to start a fire?&quot;</string>
<string name="97207">&quot;Mage-fire doesn&apos;t work?&quot;</string>
<string name="97208">&quot;Flint and tinder doesn&apos;t work?&quot;</string>
<string name="97209">&quot;I seek answers to the Five-Fold Mysteries.&quot;</string>
<string name="97210">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="97211">&quot;Romantic?&quot;</string>
<string name="97212">Worry lines crease this shrewish woman&apos;s mottled, ash-grey face. You can tell that there are countless other places she would rather be than here.</string>
<string name="97213">Fierce-looking as he is, this man seems intensely bored. His dour expression seems well suited to the gray pallor of his face.</string>
<string name="97214">&quot;If I knew the Reaper&apos;s True Name, would I be huddled around this fire right now, trying not to freeze?&quot;</string>
<string name="97215">&quot;If I knew the Reaper&apos;s True Name, would I be sitting in a smoky tavern in the depths of Baator, frittering away my life&apos;s savings on foul-smelling mulled ale?&quot;</string>
<string name="97216">&quot;From the Material Plane are you? Hmph. Well you can forget it, there&apos;s no going home. The Gates are closed for you and me both. We stay here until we freeze or die of boredom.&quot;</string>
<string name="97217">&quot;Pfft. Do you have a better idea? Give it up, berk, you&apos;re trapped and clueless to boot.&quot;</string>
<string name="97218">The githzerai gives you a sullen glare before turning away in boredom.</string>
<string name="97219">&quot;Why so perky, berky? You&apos;re stuck here just as much as we are, freezing in the cold, huddling around campfires... What I&apos;d give to be back in Limbo.&quot;</string>
<string name="97220">&quot;Sensei Dharvana came to our monastery, preaching about the teachings of the Sleeping Man. It all sounded so wonderful... We sold all our belongings to finance our Pilgrimage here, to Cania, so we could see him.&quot;</string>
<string name="97221">&quot;Only now the Gates have been closed and we&apos;re trapped here and the sensei won&apos;t even let us see this stupid Sleeping Man that we came here to see. Truth be told, I don&apos;t even think he exists.&quot;</string>
<string name="97222">&quot;She says the Pilgrimage is a lesson in patience. No one&apos;s allowed to see the Sleeping Man until they&apos;ve solved a bunch of mysteries about him. It&apos;s all just made up anyways...&quot;</string>
<string name="97223">&quot;Well I got as far as the third one before I gave up. The sensei wanted us to know why he left his home and I got to thinking about why all of us left on this Pilgrimage.&quot;</string>
<string name="97224">&quot;Our hearts had known no love. We lived this drab, gray existence in the wastes of Limbo and along came the sensei, so full of life and passion. She had found something to love and I guess we wanted that, too.&quot;</string>
<string name="97225">&quot;Look, if you&apos;re that curious, go ask the sensei. I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll tell you all about him.&quot;</string>
<string name="97226">&quot;Sensei Dharvana, she&apos;s the one who got us into this mess. You can find her out in the temple with her precious Sleeping Man in the northwest quarter of town. Big ornate place, you can&apos;t miss it.&quot;</string>
<string name="97227">&quot;Being trapped in the Eighth Hell with no hope for return isn&apos;t enough of a mess for you, is that it?&quot;</string>
<string name="97228">&quot;It&apos;s my home plane. I&apos;m from Limbo, born and raised. My great great grandfather built the monastery I grew up in, shaped it out of pure chaos. Now I&apos;ll never see it again.&quot;</string>
<string name="97229">&quot;Why so perky, berky? You&apos;re stuck here just as much as we are, coming in from the awful cold, drinking our life&apos;s savings away on mulled ale, suffering the jibes of that tiefling, Swift...&quot;</string>
<string name="97230">&quot;The Hells had a jester, so it seems. Thanks for putting an end to him when you did, mate. A bunch of us were thinking of doing the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="97231">&quot;The Hells have a jester, so it seems. Swift hooked up with us along the way and has made a nuisance of himself ever since. He had a tiff with the sensei recently, and now he&apos;s here drowning his sorrows.&quot;</string>
<string name="97232">&quot;The joker had plans to wake the Sleeping Man. I&apos;m not saying he exists, mind you, but you don&apos;t go rubbing salt in another berk&apos;s wounds. It doesn&apos;t matter. Let him and the sensei have their fight.&quot;</string>
<string name="97233">&quot;Look, if you&apos;re that curious, go ask the sensei. I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll tell you all about him.&quot;</string>
<string name="97234">&quot;Sensei Dharvana, she&apos;s the one who got us into this mess. You can find her out in the temple with her precious Sleeping Man in the northwest quarter of town. Big ornate place, you can&apos;t miss it.&quot;</string>
<string name="97235">&quot;Look, if you&apos;re that curious, go ask the sensei. I&apos;m sure she&apos;ll tell you all about him.&quot;</string>
<string name="97236">&quot;Being trapped in the Eighth Hell with no hope for return isn&apos;t enough of a mess for you, is that it?&quot;</string>
<string name="97237">&quot;Who, Swift? He had plans to wake the Sleeping Man &apos;til the sensei put a stop to him. I don&apos;t know the details but he&apos;s not making himself any friends. The Hells bad enough without a comedian.&quot;</string>
<string name="97238">&quot;Ask him, I want no part of it. Oh, and I don&apos;t recommend trusting him any farther than you can throw him, especially where money&apos;s concerned. My gold&apos;s paid for more of his tavern bill than I care to admit.&quot;</string>
<string name="97239">&quot;The Mysteries? Don&apos;t bother, I&apos;m sure the sensei made all of them up. I&apos;m willing to bet there isn&apos;t even a Sleeping Man at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="97240">&quot;We sold everything we owned to come on this Pilgrimage. We&apos;ve traveled all the way from Limbo, only to end up trapped in the Eighth Hell of Baator for all eternity. And, now that we&apos;re here, she won&apos;t even let us see him.&quot;</string>
<string name="97241">&quot;Not until we learn the Five-Fold Mysteries, she says. Well, I&apos;ve figured out the third one and it reads like a three-penny fantasy novel. Just the sort of romantic notion that the sensei would dream up...&quot;</string>
<string name="97242">&quot;Why did he leave? Because his heart had known no love. Utter rubbish. She&apos;s created this Sleeping Man out of whole cloth and, what&apos;s worse, she&apos;s become hopelessly smitten with this character she&apos;s created.&quot;</string>
<string name="97243">GENERIC GITHZERAI PILGRIM, BOTH GENDERS. MULTIPLES PLACED BUT THEY&apos;RE FOUND PRIMARILY AROUND THE TAVERN AND TEMPLE (BUT NOT INSIDE THE TEMPLE).</string>
<string name="97244">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="97245">&quot;Do you know the Reaper&apos;s True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="97246">&quot;I need to return home to the world of Toril.&quot;</string>
<string name="97247">&quot;That&apos;s a defeatist attitude...&quot;</string>
<string name="97248">&quot;Been here long?&quot;</string>
<string name="97249">&quot;Why so glum, chum?&quot;</string>
<string name="97250">&quot;Why did you come here?&quot;</string>
<string name="97251">&quot;Why won&apos;t she let you see him?&quot;</string>
<string name="97252">&quot;What kinds of mysteries?&quot;</string>
<string name="97253">&quot;Who&apos;s the Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97254">&quot;The sensei? Who&apos;s that?&quot;</string>
<string name="97255">&quot;What mess did the sensei get you into?&quot;</string>
<string name="97256">&quot;Limbo? Where&apos;s that?&quot;</string>
<string name="97257">&quot;Tiefling?&quot;</string>
<string name="97258">&quot;Why, what issue did you have with him?&quot;</string>
<string name="97259">&quot;What issue did he have with the sensei?&quot;</string>
<string name="97260">&quot;Who&apos;s the Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97261">&quot;The sensei? Who&apos;s that?&quot;</string>
<string name="97262">&quot;Who&apos;s the Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97263">&quot;What mess did the sensei get you into?&quot;</string>
<string name="97264">&quot;That winged chap in the tavern... You know him?&quot;</string>
<string name="97265">&quot;How did he plan to wake the Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97266">&quot;I seek answers to the Five-Fold Mysteries.&quot;</string>
<string name="97267">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="97268">&quot;Romantic?&quot;</string>
<string name="97269">The old tiefling has his deck of cards out again. He cocks you a smile as you approach.</string>
<string name="97270">An elderly man with a lopsided grin casually shuffles cards at a side table, occasionally earning the scowls of some of the more dour-faced patrons. Two horns protrude from his forehead, one slightly chipped.</string>
<string name="97271">&quot;Then you&apos;re a fool beyond words. So much so that I&apos;ll take a bit of pity on you and give you a second chance. Now tell me true: how much is a True Name worth?&quot;</string>
<string name="97272">&quot;Not enough, not near enough... But thank you, I&apos;ll take that as a down payment. Now tell me true, berk: how much is a True Name worth?&quot;</string>
<string name="97273">&quot;Not enough, not near enough... But thank you, I&apos;ll take that as a down payment. Now tell me true, berk: how much is a True Name worth?&quot;</string>
<string name="97274">&quot;Not enough, not near enough... But thank you, I&apos;ll take that as a down payment. Now tell me true, berk: how much is a True Name worth?&quot;</string>
<string name="97275">&quot;Not enough, not near enough... But thank you, I&apos;ll take that as a down payment. Now tell me true, berk: how much is a True Name worth?&quot;</string>
<string name="97276">&quot;Easily said for a &lt;man/woman&gt; who has nothing. No wits, no guile, no sense of humor... Keep your money and possessions. You bore me, you poor sod.&quot;</string>
<string name="97277">&quot;Fine, fine. I&apos;ve been around these old birds long enough not to be clueless and I reckon I&apos;ve figured out the sensei&apos;s fourth-fold mystery, at any rate.&quot;</string>
<string name="97278">The man&apos;s compulsive card-shuffling slows briefly before resuming. &quot;She and I had a little tussle, you could say.&quot;</string>
<string name="97279">&quot;I suppose stranger things have been called the same. I&apos;ve been around these old birds long enough not to be clueless and I reckon I&apos;ve figured out the sensei&apos;s fourth-fold mystery, at any rate.&quot;</string>
<string name="97280">&quot;Alright, it&apos;s a fair enough tale to spin... Long before the devils laid claim to Cania, it was home to a race called the Knowers. They were collectors, catalogers of lore and some say they&apos;re still alive out there.&quot;</string>
<string name="97281">&quot;Let the sensei call it her fourth-fold mystery if she wishes but, when the Sleeping Man came to Cania, he came in search of one Knower in particular: the Knower of Places.&quot;</string>
<string name="97282">&quot;Oh, an old bard gets around and lore is our specialty. Any bard in Baator can tell you a smattering about the Knowers. For a traveling man such as myself, I take a keen interest in the Knower of Places.&quot;</string>
<string name="97283">&quot;Think of it: the planes are too vast to comprehend! In such a reality, what answer becomes prized above all else? The Sleeping Man was wise, I&apos;ll give him that. He knew to ask the &apos;Where&apos; of things.&quot; </string>
<string name="97284">&quot;There&apos;s the rub, berk. The Knowers were never warriors and the devils drove them to the brink of extinction. The story goes that the Knower of Places knew a place where she could hide and so she did.&quot;</string>
<string name="97285">&quot;And who would know a better place to hide than her? I doubt the Sleeping Man ever found her. From the looks of things, he exhausted himself in the trying of it. Sorry, berk.&quot;</string>
<string name="97286">&quot;Oh, long enough I reckon. Long enough to have figured out the fourth-fold mystery of the Sleeping Man, at any rate. He came here looking for someone and I think I know who.&quot;</string>
<string name="97287">&quot;The Sleeping Man? Well, long ago, before the devils laid their claim on Cania, this place was home to a race called the Knowers. They were collectors, catalogers of lore and it&apos;s said that some of them still survive.&quot;</string>
<string name="97288">&quot;Let the sensei call it her fourth-fold mystery if she wishes but, when the Sleeping Man came to Cania, he came in search of one Knower in particular: the Knower of Places.&quot;</string>
<string name="97289">&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll find her in the temple just north of here, tending to the Sleeping Man. The sensei is the one who brought all of these pouting pilgrims here. Not a single sense of humor to be shared among them, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="97290">&quot;Oh, an old bard gets around and lore is our specialty. Any bard in Baator can tell you a smattering about the Knowers. For a traveling man such as myself, I take a keen interest in the Knower of Places.&quot;</string>
<string name="97291">&quot;Think of it: the planes are too vast to comprehend! In such a reality, what answer becomes prized above all else? The Sleeping Man was wise, I&apos;ll give him that. He knew to ask the &apos;Where&apos; of things.&quot; </string>
<string name="97292">&quot;There&apos;s the rub, berk. The Knowers were never warriors and the devils drove them to the brink of extinction. The story goes that the Knower of Places knew a place where she could hide and so she did.&quot;</string>
<string name="97293">&quot;And who would know a better place to hide than her? I doubt the Sleeping Man ever found her. From the looks of things, he exhausted himself in the trying of it. Sorry, berk.&quot;</string>
<string name="97294">The horned man spits and the shuffling of his cards grows all the more fierce. &quot;If you&apos;ve got questions about the Sleeping Man, go talk to the sensei. I&apos;ve washed my hands of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="97295">&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll find her in the temple just north of here, tending to the Sleeping Man. The sensei is the one who brought all of these pouting pilgrims here. Not a single sense of humor to be shared among them, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="97296">&quot;Just a harmless joke was all. These pouting pilgrims keep prattling on about &apos;the Sleeping Man this&apos; and &apos;the Sleeping Man that.&apos; The thought of waking the old guy up started tickling my funny bone.&quot;</string>
<string name="97297">&quot;Needless to say, when the sensei caught wind of it, she didn&apos;t take too kindly to the idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="97298">&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll find her in the temple just north of here, tending to the Sleeping Man. The sensei is the one who brought all of these pouting pilgrims here. Not a single sense of humor to be shared among them, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="97299">&quot;Oh, an old bard gathers a few trinkets along the way. There&apos;s an instrument-maker in Sigil whose trumpets are fashioned with a small portal to the Plane of Pandemonium...&quot;</string>
<string name="97300">&quot;Put your lips to it and blow and all the howling winds of that mad place blow with you. I was planning to lean up close and put it right to his ear... Nothing can sleep through such a cacophony, not even the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="97301">&quot;Oh, it&apos;s just some of the sensei&apos;s mumbo-jumbo. She&apos;s turned the Sleeping Man into a religion for all these pouting pilgrims, and the five mysteries have become an initiation rite of sorts.&quot;</string>
<string name="97302">&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll find her in the temple just north of here, tending to the Sleeping Man. The sensei is the one who brought all of these pouting pilgrims here. Not a single sense of humor to be shared among them, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="97303">&quot;You&apos;re clueless, then, are you berk? That&apos;s okay, someone&apos;s got to be clueless or the rest of us wouldn&apos;t have anyone to explain things to. You see, &apos;Where&apos; is a difficult sort of question in the planes.&quot;</string>
<string name="97304">&quot;Look up and maybe Limbo&apos;s way above us somewhere. Or maybe, if you travel far enough east, you&apos;ll get there. Or Limbo could be through this knothole in the wood or maybe Limbo&apos;s just a different way of seeing things.&quot;</string>
<string name="97305">&quot;Don&apos;t we all. The only ones who seem content to stay are the devils themselves and most of them only because someone more powerful threatened them with worse. Welcome to the City of Lost Souls, friend.&quot;</string>
<string name="97306">&quot;Who does? The planes aren&apos;t there to be understood, berk. You&apos;ll go mad trying to. The best advice is just to let go and learn to accept the planes for what they are. When you do that, you&apos;ll no longer be clueless.&quot;</string>
<string name="97307">&quot;Have you no eyes? The tavern&apos;s full of them! Grey skin, dour faces, overly pious with their whispered voices, all of them led to the depths of the Nine Hells by that fool lass, the sensei. All of it in the name of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="97308">The horned man spits and the shuffling of his cards grows all the more fierce. &quot;If you&apos;ve got questions about the Sleeping Man, go talk to the sensei. I&apos;ve washed my hands of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="97309">&quot;Just a harmless joke was all. These pouting pilgrims keep prattling on about &apos;the Sleeping Man this&apos; and &apos;the Sleeping Man that.&apos; The thought of waking the old guy up started tickling my funny bone.&quot;</string>
<string name="97310">&quot;Needless to say, when the sensei caught wind of it, she didn&apos;t take too kindly to the idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="97311">&quot;Oh, an old bard gathers a few trinkets along the way. There&apos;s an instrument-maker in Sigil whose trumpets are fashioned with a small portal to the Plane of Pandemonium...&quot;</string>
<string name="97312">&quot;Put your lips to it and blow and all the howling winds of that mad place blow with you. I was planning to lean up close and put it right to his ear... Nothing can sleep through such a cacophony, not even the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="97313">&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll find her in the temple just north of here, tending to the Sleeping Man. The sensei is the one who brought all of these pouting pilgrims here. Not a single sense of humor to be shared among them, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="97314">&quot;Recent enough.&quot; The slapping sound of the card&apos;s shuffling slows briefly before resuming. &quot;I had me a little tussle with the sensei.&quot;</string>
<string name="97315">&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll find her in the temple just north of here, tending to the Sleeping Man. The sensei is the one who brought all of these pouting pilgrims here. Not a single sense of humor to be shared among them, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="97316">&quot;Have you no eyes? The tavern&apos;s full of them! Grey skin, dour faces, overly pious with their whispered voices, all of them led to the depths of the Nine Hells by that fool lass, the sensei. All of it in the name of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="97317">The horned man spits, never interrupting his shuffling of the cards. &quot;If you&apos;ve got questions about the Sleeping Man, go talk to the sensei. I&apos;ve washed my hands of it.&quot;</string>
<string name="97318">&quot;Just a harmless joke was all. These pouting pilgrims keep prattling on about &apos;the Sleeping Man this&apos; and &apos;the Sleeping Man that.&apos; The thought of waking the old guy up started tickling my funny bone.&quot;</string>
<string name="97319">&quot;Needless to say, when the sensei caught wind of it, she didn&apos;t take too kindly to the idea.&quot;</string>
<string name="97320">&quot;Oh, an old bard gathers a few trinkets along the way. There&apos;s an instrument-maker in Sigil whose trumpets are fashioned with a small portal to the Plane of Pandemonium...&quot;</string>
<string name="97321">&quot;Put your lips to it and blow and all the howling winds of that mad place blow with you. I was planning to lean up close and put it right to his ear... Nothing can sleep through such a cacophony, not even the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="97322">His shuffling stops, the deck of cards slipping into his pocket as he reaches for another. &quot;Nothing is free, berk, but it doesn&apos;t look like I&apos;ll be using it, not with the sensei watching me like a hawk...&quot;</string>
<string name="97323">&quot;For the price of a little entertainment, I&apos;d be willing to let you keep the blasted thing. Are you interested?&quot;</string>
<string name="97324">&quot;Sure, sure. It&apos;s good to have questions. Keeps the mind sharp.&quot;</string>
<string name="97325">&quot;Alright, I&apos;m going to teach you a little card trick. I&apos;ll let you shuffle the deck and then I&apos;m going to draw a card. You can ask five &apos;yes or no&apos; questions about the card and then you have to guess what it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="97326">&quot;Aces are low, Kings are high, and there&apos;s no Joker here but me, understood?&quot;</string>
<string name="97327">&quot;Sure thing. It&apos;s a simple card trick. You shuffle the deck and then I&apos;m going to draw a card. You get to ask five &apos;yes or no&apos; questions about the card and then you have to guess what it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="97328">&quot;One more thing. Let&apos;s up the ante: Empty your pockets onto the table. I&apos;ll let you know when it&apos;s enough. If you win, you get it all back and the trumpet besides. If you lose, I sweep the table and we play again.&quot;</string>
<string name="97329">&quot;They&apos;re the only ones I play by. If you don&apos;t like them, then there&apos;s no game. If you change your mind, just come back and ask me about that trumpet.&quot;</string>
<string name="97330">The old man paws through your belongings, biting the gold and squinting at everything in the dim light. At long last, he turns his attention back to you...</string>
<string name="97331">&quot;Perfect.&quot; He eyes you as you shuffle the cards. With a disarming smile, he draws one from the deck.</string>
<string name="97332">&quot;Fine, but quitters pay, berk.&quot; You watch as the old bard sweeps the contents of the table into his satchel.</string>
<string name="97333">&quot;Okay, no more questions. Come on, give me your best guess, berk. What card do you think it was?&quot;</string>
<string name="97334">The tiefling fingers the items on the table as he awaits your question. He seems well pleased with your ante.</string>
<string name="97335">The old man seems distracted, almost bored by your ponderous deliberations.</string>
<string name="97336">A sly grin comes over the tiefling&apos;s face as you ponder what question to ask.</string>
<string name="97337">Your opponent sighs heavily and readjusts himself in his seat.</string>
<string name="97338">&quot;No.&quot; &lt;StartCheck&gt;[Wisdom: Failure] You have no idea whether or not he&apos;s telling the truth.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97339">&quot;No.&quot; &lt;StartCheck&gt;[Wisdom: Success] You&apos;re pretty sure he&apos;s lying to you.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97340">&quot;No.&quot; &lt;StartCheck&gt;[Wisdom: Success] You&apos;re pretty sure he&apos;s telling the truth.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97341">&quot;Yes.&quot; &lt;StartCheck&gt;[Wisdom: Failure] You have no idea whether or not he&apos;s telling the truth.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97342">&quot;Yes.&quot; &lt;StartCheck&gt;[Wisdom: Success] You&apos;re pretty sure he&apos;s lying to you.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97343">&quot;Yes.&quot; &lt;StartCheck&gt;[Wisdom: Success] You&apos;re pretty sure he&apos;s telling the truth.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97344">&quot;Okay, no more questions. Come on, give me your best guess, berk. What card do you think it was?&quot;</string>
<string name="97345">The old bard carefully keeps his face devoid of all emotion. You suspect you&apos;re not the first person he&apos;s played this game with.</string>
<string name="97346">&quot;Wrong, my friend. Wrong, wrong, wrong.&quot; He tosses the card facedown onto the table where it bursts into flame and is gone. He sweeps your ante into his satchel. &quot;Ready for another try?&quot;</string>
<string name="97347">He bursts into gales of laughter and reaches over to clap you on the back. &quot;Well done, my friend, well done! Clear the table for yourself and take the trumpet too! You&apos;ll do well in these parts.&quot;</string>
<string name="97348">He claps his hands and a new deck of cards suddenly emerges between his fingers. With a final wink in your direction, he busies himself with his shuffling.</string>
<string name="97349">A bead of sweat trickles down the old man&apos;s brow. &quot;Heh. Coming down to the wire, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="97350">&quot;Only two questions left, now. Keep them coming.&quot;</string>
<string name="97351">&quot;You&apos;ve got three more questions so I recommend you put them to good use.&quot;</string>
<string name="97352">The old tiefling chuckles to himself and shakes his head. &quot;Pick up the pace a little, berk. You&apos;ve still got four questions left.&quot;</string>
<string name="97353">&quot;Cough up, little &lt;man/woman&gt;. That&apos;s not near enough. I&apos;m looking for something on the order of 5,000 gold on that table.&quot;</string>
<string name="97354">&quot;Those are higher stakes than the 5,000 gold I&apos;d been expecting. If you want to take something off the table, I won&apos;t hold it against you...&quot;</string>
<string name="97355">&quot;I came to the Hells for a holiday, berk. I don&apos;t get scared.&quot; With a disarming smile, he draws a card from the deck.</string>
<string name="97356">&quot;Aye, we&apos;re called tieflings, berk. Devils and demons being what they are, I reckon there&apos;s fiendish blood in most of us, to be honest. Angels just don&apos;t get around as much, if you catch my meaning.&quot;</string>
<string name="97357">&quot;My... My True Name! How could you know such a thing!? Ack, I can feel its tug upon my soul... What do you want from me, fiend?&quot;</string>
<string name="97358">&quot;Y-y-yes, of course. Other questions! How can I help?&quot;</string>
<string name="97359">&quot;If it is fame you seek, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;, fame I can grant you. The bardic services of Arden Swift are at your service from this moment to my dying day... Is there anything else you wish of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="97360">&quot;Caddisthwaite the Doomed, is it? Well I&apos;ll show the gods and the bloody tavernkeeper, too...&quot;</string>
<string name="97361">&quot;My winnings? Damn you, then, take it all! Easy come, easy go, they say... Is there anything else you demand, &lt;Master/Mistress&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="97362">The bard winks at you but continues shuffling his cards. He&apos;s trying to make eye contact with one of the other patrons and apparently has no desire to talk with you any more than he has to.</string>
<string name="97363">The old tiefling pauses in his card shuffling, cackling with laughter as you approach.</string>
<string name="97364">A MALE TIEFLING WHO FELL IN WITH THE GITHZERAI PILGRIMAGE. CAN BE FOUND IN THE HELLBREATH TAVERN.</string>
<string name="97365">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="97366">&quot;Do you know the Reaper&apos;s True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="97367">&quot;It&apos;s not worth anything.&quot;</string>
<string name="97368">&quot;Here, have 10,000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="97369">&quot;Here, have 50,000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="97370">&quot;Here, have 100,000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="97371">&quot;Here, have 250,000 gold.&quot;</string>
<string name="97372">&quot;I&apos;ll give you everything I have.&quot;</string>
<string name="97373">&quot;Why you rotten, lying thief!&quot; &lt;StartAction&gt;[Attack]&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97374">&quot;I&apos;m trying to learn the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="97375">&quot;Look, can you help me with the mysteries or not?&quot;</string>
<string name="97376">&quot;You have something against the sensei?&quot;</string>
<string name="97377">&quot;What kind of tussle are we talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="97378">&quot;It&apos;s a matter of convenience, that&apos;s all.&quot;</string>
<string name="97379">&quot;It&apos;s not mumbo-jumbo. It&apos;s a matter of faith.&quot;</string>
<string name="97380">&quot;Please, I must learn the Five-Fold Mysteries.&quot;</string>
<string name="97381">&quot;How did you figure out the mystery?&quot;</string>
<string name="97382">&quot;Have you ever asked the Knower of Places anything?&quot;</string>
<string name="97383">&quot;What brings you to these parts?&quot;</string>
<string name="97384">&quot;How long have you been traveling with them?&quot;</string>
<string name="97385">&quot;Who did he seek?&quot;</string>
<string name="97386">&quot;Who&apos;s the sensei?&quot;</string>
<string name="97387">&quot;How did you figure out the mystery?&quot;</string>
<string name="97388">&quot;Have you ever asked the Knower of Places anything?&quot;</string>
<string name="97389">&quot;The Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97390">&quot;Who&apos;s the sensei?&quot;</string>
<string name="97391">&quot;Wash your hands of what?&quot;</string>
<string name="97392">&quot;Who&apos;s the sensei?&quot;</string>
<string name="97393">&quot;How did you plan to wake the Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97394">&quot;What&apos;s a fourth-fold mystery?&quot;</string>
<string name="97395">&quot;Who&apos;s the sensei?&quot;</string>
<string name="97396">&quot;Where&apos;s Limbo?&quot;</string>
<string name="97397">&quot;I just need to find a way out of Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="97398">&quot;I don&apos;t understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="97399">&quot;Pilgrims?&quot;</string>
<string name="97400">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="97401">&quot;The Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97402">&quot;Wash your hands of what?&quot;</string>
<string name="97403">&quot;How did you plan to wake the Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97404">&quot;Who&apos;s the sensei?&quot;</string>
<string name="97405">&quot;What&apos;s with the horns?&quot;</string>
<string name="97406">&quot;That chip in your horn must be pretty recent.&quot;</string>
<string name="97407">&quot;What kind of tussle are we talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="97408">&quot;Who&apos;s the sensei?&quot;</string>
<string name="97409">&quot;Pilgrims?&quot;</string>
<string name="97410">&quot;The Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97411">&quot;Wash your hands of what?&quot;</string>
<string name="97412">&quot;How did you plan to wake the Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97413">&quot;Can I borrow your trumpet?&quot;</string>
<string name="97414">&quot;Not right now. I&apos;ve still got a few questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="97415">&quot;Sure, just tell me the rules.&quot;</string>
<string name="97416">&quot;Could you repeat the rules for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="97417">&quot;Sounds easy. Let&apos;s do it.&quot;</string>
<string name="97418">&quot;I don&apos;t like those rules.&quot;</string>
<string name="97419">&quot;Sure, I&apos;ll let you know when my ante&apos;s on the table.&quot;</string>
<string name="97420">&quot;I quit. Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="97421">&quot;Enough questions. I want to guess the card.&quot;</string>
<string name="97422">&quot;Is it more valuable than a...&quot;</string>

<string name="97453">&quot;Spades?&quot;</string>

<string name="97474">&quot;Clubs.&quot;</string>
<string name="97475">&quot;Fine. I&apos;ll let you know when I&apos;ve changed my ante.&quot;</string>
<string name="97476">&quot;Getting scared, old man? Go ahead, pick a card.&quot;</string>
<string name="97477">&quot;I know the rules. I&apos;ll let you know when my ante&apos;s on the table.&quot;</string>
<string name="97478">&quot;Fiendish blood?&quot;</string>
<string name="97479">&quot;Planning to burn the place down, are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="97480">&quot;So, about your plans to wake the Sleeping Man...&quot;</string>
<string name="97481">&quot;Caddisthwaite the Doomed...&quot;</string>
<string name="97482">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="97483">&quot;Write an epic song about me and sing it throughout the planes.&quot;</string>
<string name="97484">&quot;I want you to start a fight with the tavernkeeper.&quot;</string>
<string name="97485">&quot;Give me all of your winnings.&quot;</string>
<string name="97486">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="97487">&quot;That is alright. They have little inherent value and are easily fashioned. I always keep a few on hand for new Pilgrims that come my way.&quot;</string>
<string name="97488">&quot;Among the githzerai, crystals of various sorts are used to focus and amplify the thoughts of others, making them easier to read. I&apos;m not sure if it will work for one such as you.&quot;</string>
<string name="97489">&quot;Simply wear it about your neck as you reach out to the Sleeping Man. With a little luck, you will see his dreams.&quot;</string>
<string name="97490">The sensei smiles as you approach but her eyes remain closed in meditation. In your mind, you feel her grant you permission to speak.</string>
<string name="97491">&quot;Before they can behold the Sleeping Man, new Pilgrims must answer his Five-Fold Mysteries: Who is he? From where did he come? Why did he leave? Who did he seek? What was the answer?&quot;</string>
<string name="97492">&quot;All who come to the Sleeping Man are Pilgrims on this journey we call life. Like him, we travel the planes, restless for answers. Like him, we&apos;ll someday find them.&quot;</string>
<string name="97493">&quot;There are countless ways: spells, portals, vortices, shifting banks of fog or shadow. Not all work in all places, either. Here in Cania, there are only two: the Gate and the tributaries of the River Styx.&quot;</string>
<string name="97494">&quot;The Gate leads almost anywhere, provided the Reaper will do your bidding. The tributaries of the River Styx, however, flow only downwards, to Nessus, the Ninth and final layer of Baator. I have not traveled them, nor do I intend to.&quot;</string>
<string name="97495">&quot;Beyond using his True Name to bind him to your will as Mephistopheles has, I cannot say. Perhaps the Sleeping Man once knew. Until he dreams the answer, my Pilgrims and I are trapped here, just like you.&quot;</string>
<string name="97496">&quot;The Sleeping Man dreams many things and, when he does, those dreams dance across the surface of his thoughts where I can see them. Much of what I have learned of his mysteries I learned through dreams.&quot;</string>
<string name="97497">&quot;His dreams have formed the very tenets of my faith and brought my Pilgrims and I closer to our enlightenment. Through his dreams I have come to know the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man...&quot;</string>
<string name="97498">&quot;Who is he? From where did he come? Why did he leave? Who did he seek? What was the answer? ...All who wish to behold the Sleeping Man must learn these Five-Fold Mysteries.&quot;</string>
<string name="97499">&quot;Where would such a tale begin and where would it end? The planes are as infinite in variety as they are in their number. They cannot be described; they must be lived.&quot;</string>
<string name="97500">&quot;My home monastery in Limbo floats within a sphere of water that, in turn, orbits an ever-changing chunk of rock on which grows and dies an endless forest. What words can make that plain?&quot;</string>
<string name="97501">&quot;It is refreshing to see such an inquisitive mind. As the Sleeping Man teaches, until you find your answer, you must never stop asking questions. Now what is it you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="97502">&quot;I am a sensei of the githzerai. I have trained all my life to read the surface thoughts of those before me.&quot;</string>
<string name="97503">&quot;It is refreshing to see such an inquisitive mind. As the Sleeping Man teaches, until you find your answer, you must never stop asking questions. Now what is it you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="97504">&quot;Once, long ago, we were almost human. The Mindflayers held an empire that spanned the planes and, under their vicious command, we suffered countless centuries of slavery.&quot;</string>
<string name="97505">&quot;Little by little, we adapted. Our skin turned grey and mottled from lack of sun and leathery to withstand the beatings. They prized the mind above all else and bred us accordingly. Over time, our minds became like theirs.&quot;</string>
<string name="97506">&quot;Slowly, we learned to defend ourselves against their mental probing and small pockets of escaped slaves emerged. A hero by the name of Gith rose up among their number and ultimately overthrew the oppressors.&quot;</string>
<string name="97507">&quot;Together with our brothers, the githyanki, we are the children of that rebellion, many generations now removed. A split came between the githyanki and ourselves but that is a story for another time.&quot;</string>
<string name="97508">&quot;The githyanki keep largely to the Astral Plane and the githzerai to our monasteries on the plane of Limbo though some, like myself, still travel beyond.&quot;</string>
<string name="97509">&quot;There are countless ways: spells, portals, vortices, shifting banks of fog or shadow. Not all work in all places, either. Here in Cania, there are only two: the Gate and the tributaries of the River Styx.&quot;</string>
<string name="97510">&quot;The Gate leads almost anywhere, provided the Reaper will do your bidding. The tributaries of the River Styx, however, flow only downwards, to Nessus, the Ninth and final layer of Baator. I have not traveled them, nor do I intend to.&quot;</string>
<string name="97511">&quot;Beyond using his True Name to bind him to your will as Mephistopheles has, I cannot say. Perhaps the Sleeping Man once knew. Until he dreams the answer, my Pilgrims and I are trapped here, just like you.&quot;</string>
<string name="97512">&quot;The Sleeping Man dreams many things and, when he does, those dreams dance across the surface of his thoughts where I can see them. Much of what I have learned of his mysteries I learned through dreams.&quot;</string>

<string name="97522">&quot;There are countless ways: spells, portals, vortices, shifting banks of fog or shadow. Not all work in all places, either. Here in Cania, there are only two: the Gate and the tributaries of the River Styx.&quot;</string>
<string name="97523">&quot;The Gate leads almost anywhere, provided the Reaper will do your bidding. The tributaries of the River Styx, however, flow only downwards, to Nessus, the Ninth and final layer of Baator. I have not traveled them, nor do I intend to.&quot;</string>

<string name="97530">&quot;Why do any of us journey so far from home? I&apos;m afraid that is the third-fold mystery of the Sleeping Man. You will have to answer it yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="97531">&quot;Just as Cania is home to many sorts of devils, so too are there many types of angels, ranging from the lowly archons, to the mighty devas, planetars, and solars.&quot;</string>
<string name="97532">&quot;From many places. Some say the angels are all around us, even here. As for where the Sleeping Man is from, that is his second-fold mystery and you will have to discover that yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="97533">&quot;Before they can behold the Sleeping Man, new Pilgrims must answer his Five-Fold Mysteries: Who is he? From where did he come? Why did he leave? Who did he seek? What was the answer?&quot;</string>
<string name="97534">&quot;It is refreshing to see such an inquisitive mind. As the Sleeping Man teaches, until you find your answer, you must never stop asking questions. Now what is it you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="97535">&quot;Since you have asked, I shall answer. This is the first-fold mystery of the Sleeping Man, so remember it well... He is a celestial planetar, a creature of good. Like you and like I, he is a Pilgrim, traveling the planes.&quot;</string>

<string name="97539">&quot;Once, long ago, we were almost human. The Mindflayers held an empire that spanned the planes and, under their vicious command, we suffered countless centuries of slavery.&quot;</string>
<string name="97540">&quot;Little by little, we adapted. Our skin turned grey and mottled from lack of sun and leathery to withstand the beatings. They prized the mind above all else and bred us accordingly. Over time, our minds became like theirs.&quot;</string>
<string name="97541">&quot;Slowly, we learned to defend ourselves against their mental probing and small pockets of escaped slaves emerged. A hero by the name of Gith rose up among their number and ultimately overthrew the oppressors.&quot;</string>
<string name="97542">&quot;Together with our brothers, the githyanki, we are the children of that rebellion, many generations now removed. A split came between the githyanki and ourselves but that is a story for another time.&quot;</string>

<string name="97649">&quot;Why do any of us journey so far from home? I&apos;m afraid that is the third-fold mystery of the Sleeping Man. You will have to answer it yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="97650">&quot;Just as Cania is home to many sorts of devils, so too are there many types of angels, ranging from the lowly archons, to the mighty devas, planetars, and solars.&quot;</string>
<string name="97651">&quot;From many places. Some say the angels are all around us, even here. As for where the Sleeping Man is from, that is his second-fold mystery and you will have to discover that yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="97652">&quot;Before they can behold the Sleeping Man, new Pilgrims must answer his Five-Fold Mysteries: Who is he? From where did he come? Why did he leave? Who did he seek? What was the answer?&quot;</string>
<string name="97653">&quot;I am Dharvana, a sensei of the githzerai and a fellow Pilgrim of the Sleeping Man. I have made the journey to be by his side many times and every time I&apos;ve grown in wisdom.&quot;</string>
<string name="97654">&quot;It is refreshing to see such an inquisitive mind. As the Sleeping Man teaches, until you find your answer, you must never stop asking questions. Now what is it you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="97655">&quot;Since you have asked, I shall answer. This is the first-fold mystery of the Sleeping Man, so remember it well... He is a celestial planetar, a creature of good. Like you and like I, he is a Pilgrim, traveling the planes.&quot;</string>
<string name="97656">&quot;It is refreshing to see such an inquisitive mind. As the Sleeping Man teaches, until you find your answer, you must never stop asking questions. Now what is it you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="97657">&quot;I am a sensei of the githzerai. I have trained all my life to read the surface thoughts of those before me.&quot;</string>
<string name="97658">&quot;It is refreshing to see such an inquisitive mind. As the Sleeping Man teaches, until you find your answer, you must never stop asking questions. Now what is it you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="97659">&quot;Once, long ago, we were almost human. The Mindflayers held an empire that spanned the planes and, under their vicious command, we suffered countless centuries of slavery.&quot;</string>
<string name="97660">&quot;Little by little, we adapted. Our skin turned grey and mottled from lack of sun and leathery to withstand the beatings. They prized the mind above all else and bred us accordingly. Over time, our minds became like theirs.&quot;</string>
<string name="97661">&quot;Slowly, we learned to defend ourselves against their mental probing and small pockets of escaped slaves emerged. A hero by the name of Gith rose up among their number and ultimately overthrew the oppressors.&quot;</string>
<string name="97662">&quot;Together with our brothers, the githyanki, we are the children of that rebellion, many generations now removed. A split came between the githyanki and ourselves but that is a story for another time.&quot;</string>
<string name="97663">&quot;The githyanki keep largely to the Astral Plane and the githzerai to our monasteries on the plane of Limbo though some, like myself, still travel beyond.&quot;</string>
<string name="97664">&quot;There are countless ways: spells, portals, vortices, shifting banks of fog or shadow. Not all work in all places, either. Here in Cania, there are only two: the Gate and the tributaries of the River Styx.&quot;</string>
<string name="97665">&quot;The Gate leads almost anywhere, provided the Reaper will do your bidding. The tributaries of the River Styx, however, flow only downwards, to Nessus, the Ninth and final layer of Baator. I have not traveled them, nor do I intend to.&quot;</string>
<string name="97666">&quot;Beyond using his True Name to bind him to your will as Mephistopheles has, I cannot say. Perhaps the Sleeping Man once knew. Until he dreams the answer, my Pilgrims and I are trapped here, just like you.&quot;</string>
<string name="97667">&quot;The Sleeping Man dreams many things and, when he does, those dreams dance across the surface of his thoughts where I can see them. Much of what I have learned of his mysteries I learned through dreams.&quot;</string>
<string name="97668">&quot;His dreams have formed the very tenets of my faith and brought my Pilgrims and I closer to our enlightenment. Through his dreams I have come to know the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man...&quot;</string>

<string name="97672">&quot;As masters of mind, body, and spirit, we sensei lead our fellow githzerai both to greater wisdom and to victory over our enemies. In your language we would be known as monks though much is lost in the translation.&quot;</string>
<string name="97673">&quot;We githzerai strive to be a peaceful people and have separated ourselves from others in our attempts to find that peace.&quot;</string>
<string name="97674">&quot;Our brothers, the githyanki, continue to hunt us, however, and we have not yet forgiven the Mindflayers who we once served as slaves. It could be argued that our enemies have made us who we are.&quot;</string>
<string name="97675">&quot;Of a sort... Your mind is like a vast library and my talents let me run my finger across the spines of its many tomes. I can read their titles and guess their contents but I can never take them down and truly read.&quot;</string>
<string name="97676">&quot;Even with its limits, it is a gift I treasure for this is how, title by title, spine by spine, I have come to know the secret wisdom of the Sleeping Man. It is through my gift that I have touched his dreams.&quot;</string>

<string name="97729">&quot;Very well. Let us see if you are ready... Answer me, Pilgrim: Who is the Sleeping Man?&quot;</string>
<string name="97730">&quot;Yes, his is a pure soul with no trace of pride or vice or vengeance. In following him, we take on his beneficence... Now answer me, Pilgrim: From where did he come?&quot;</string>
<string name="97731">&quot;That he does. Elysium is a place of beauty and peace and perfection, yet he turned his back on it and never returned, choosing instead to roam the planes... So answer me, Pilgrim: Why did he leave?&quot;</string>
<string name="97732">&quot;He knew that without passion we are nothing and thus he journeyed many years in search of his true love. His journey brought him here, to the frozen wastes of Cania... Answer me, Pilgrim: Who did he seek?&quot;</string>
<string name="97733">&quot;The Knowers ruled this plane before the Baatezu claimed it as one of their Hells. In his wisdom, the Sleeping Man asked simply where his true love would be found... Tell me, Pilgrim: What was the answer?&quot;</string>
<string name="97734">&quot;I am sorry, but it&apos;s clear you are not ready to enter his resting chamber. Spend some time pondering his Five-Fold Mysteries and then return to me. As the Sleeping Man teaches, some things are worth waiting for.&quot;</string>
<string name="97735">&quot;So he returned here, to the Gates, content in the knowledge that she would find him. Weary from his journeys, he fell asleep. That was all long, long ago but still he waits here, dreaming of his true love.&quot;</string>
<string name="97736">&quot;You have mastered the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man, Pilgrim. When you enter his chambers, wear this crystal around your neck... It will help you see his dreams.&quot;</string>

<string name="97745">You can feel the sensei&apos;s mind probing your own, questioning your intent. If you want to pick this lock, you&apos;ll have to wait until her attentions are focused elsewhere.</string>
<string name="97746">You feel the familiar probe of the sensei&apos;s mind. She smiles eagerly at your return.</string>
<string name="97747">&quot;Welcome back, Pilgrim. The Sleeping Man has been dreaming of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="97748">&quot;Much better now that you have opened the gates for us to return home to Limbo. Word had spread among my Pilgrims and we are all simply saying our goodbyes in time for the long journey home.&quot;</string>
<string name="97749">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, at least for that much. As much as I appreciate my times here in the Temple, it is time for me to lead my people home.&quot;</string>
<string name="97750">&quot;He dreamed of you in the face of a clock that was buried deep beneath the snow. In the icy cold, the Blood War between devils and demons that raged around you staggered to a halt, its anger fully spent.&quot;</string>
<string name="97751">&quot;I&apos;m still trying to determine what it means, &lt;FirstName&gt;. For what it&apos;s worth, he seemed proud of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="97752">&quot;You have? Why, it&apos;s a miracle... It&apos;s the fulfilment of the Sleeping Man&apos;s dreams, a fulfilment of his prophecies. Please, you must tell me who it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="97753">&quot;But his one true love! Will you not tell me?&quot;</string>
<string name="97754">&quot;A fellow angel then... A part of me had hoped that it would be a mortal. One of us. Maybe even me... If we can be loved, we can be redeemed. If the angels can only pity us, then faith is hollow... I don&apos;t know...&quot;</string>
<string name="97755">&quot;The one imprisoned by Mephistopheles following the Molikroth rebellion? He was going to ask where she was imprisoned but, not realizing she was his love, he instead asked where his love would find him!&quot;</string>
<string name="97756">&quot;The Knower of Places? Why, she was the one who told him to wait here for his love. How very strange... And to think that he has waited all this time for a woman he has already met.&quot;</string>
<string name="97757">&quot;Nathyrra? I can hardly believe it! Never in my wildest dreams dared I believe that his love would come to him while I yet live. You must be extremely honored to have such an important companion in your midst.&quot;</string>
<string name="97758">&quot;Aribeth? I can hardly believe it! Never in my wildest dreams dared I believe that his love would come to him while I yet live. It is a great honor to have known her.&quot;</string>
<string name="97759">&quot;Forgive me, I must go and ponder the significance of this. Please, make yourself at home here in the temple as I may not return for some time.&quot;</string>
<string name="97760">&quot;Lady Aribeth? The spirit? No, how can this be? She came here, she learned his Five Mysteries, she watched him sleep! But then she became one of the Lost... His one true love is gone forevermore...&quot;</string>
<string name="97761">&quot;I must go and ponder the significance of this at once, &lt;FirstName&gt;. He had faith that his true love would find him and that there would be a happy ending. I built my faith on his! If he was wrong...&quot;</string>
<string name="97762">&quot;You, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I can hardly believe it! Never in my wildest dreams dared I believe that his love would come to him while I yet live. It is a great honor to have met you.&quot;</string>
<string name="97763">&quot;But you must be very weary from your travels and warmed by the thought of your love&apos;s proximity. I will leave you with him now, that the two of you may have some privacy.&quot;</string>
<string name="97764">&quot;No, do not tell me, I do not wish to know it. To know it is to face the temptation of using it and to use it is to taint the purity of his will with the impurity of my own. Please, that is a secret you must carry to the grave.&quot;</string>
<string name="97765">&quot;If that is your wish, Pilgrim...&quot;</string>
<string name="97766">&quot;I am glad you have come to your senses. I do not know how many other True Names you know but I pray you use only those you must. The rest, you must never tell a soul... Please, leave me to the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="97767">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You show a greater wisdom than I often give you credit for. Now please, leave me with the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="97768">&quot;A curse on you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, for that is power I did not seek and now I must carry it with me to my grave. I can only pray that my will is strong enough to never use it. Now please, leave me with the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="97769">&quot;I believe that we all have the right to pursue our own destiny, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Using someone&apos;s True Name against them violates that right... The Reaper has already had his True Name used against him.&quot;</string>
<string name="97770">&quot;In such cases, sometimes you must use his True Name to set things right. But it is a fine line. Take care that you do not become like the very devil whom you fight.&quot;</string>
<string name="97771">&quot;My... My True Name. I can feel it... But Misguided? No, it can&apos;t be! Please tell me it isn&apos;t true... I have built my entire life around my faith in the Sleeping Man. Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, as a friend...&quot;</string>
<string name="97772">The sensei seems grateful for the change in topic.</string>
<string name="97773">&quot;His true love? I am the one he waits for? Oh, I am such a fool, &lt;FirstName&gt;! All these years I&apos;ve wasted... No, not wasted for I have spent them loving him, but even so... I must wake him, musn&apos;t I...&quot;</string>
<string name="97774">&quot;With that fool? Very well, if that is all you ask of me, then I shall do it as soon as you are gone. He means well but he must learn someday that not everything can be a joke. Is there more?&quot;</string>
<string name="97775">&quot;How, &lt;FirstName&gt;? Tell me how I can do this. Tell me how you can do this to me! Without faith, without him, I am nothing... But you leave me with no choice... Farewell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Farewell my sleeping love...&quot;</string>
<string name="97776">&quot;No! My love! How dare you do this to us! I will find her, I must!&quot;</string>
<string name="97777">&quot;No, &lt;FirstName&gt;. He must not be disturbed... It&apos;s no use, is it? You have commanded me and so I must... Very well, though I can think of no action more abhorrent that you could make me do.&quot;</string>
<string name="97778">As she approaches the Sleeping Man, you can feel a pulse of energy pass through your mind. Her tears landing like dew upon his face, she whispers something into his ear and he awakes.</string>
<string name="97779">&quot;Who are you? Both of you... I have seen you in my dreams... Why have you woken me, woman?&quot;</string>
<string name="97780">&quot;I am sorry, my lord, for had the choice been mine, you would still be at rest... But the &lt;man/woman&gt; over there holds dominion over me, forcing me to act against my will.&quot;</string>
<string name="97781">&quot;What evil is this? By the power of Celestia&apos;s Heavens, release this woman from whatever foul magic you have used against her!&quot;</string>

<string name="98075">&quot;It is my companion, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="98076">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;It is my companion, Nathyrra.&quot;</string>
<string name="98077">&quot;It is Lady Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="98078">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;It is Lady Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="98079">&quot;It is you, Sensei Dharvana.&quot;</string>
<string name="98080">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;It is you, Sensei Dharvana.&quot;</string>
<string name="98081">&quot;I am his one true love.&quot;</string>
<string name="98082">&lt;StartAction&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I am his one true love.&quot;</string>
<string name="98083">&quot;I have learned the Sleeping Man&apos;s True Name.&quot;</string>
<string name="98084">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="98085">&quot;You are right, sensei. True Names are dangerous and to be kept secret.&quot;</string>
<string name="98086">&quot;Fine, I won&apos;t tell you then.&quot;</string>
<string name="98087">&quot;The Sleeping Man is called Celesfa&apos;ar the Patient.&quot;</string>
<string name="98088">&quot;I don&apos;t understand. Why wouldn&apos;t you want to know his name?&quot;</string>
<string name="98089">&quot;Fa&apos;arethia the Misguided...&quot;</string>
<string name="98090">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="98091">&quot;You are the Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love.&quot;</string>
<string name="98092">&quot;Reconcile yourself with the tiefling called Arden Swift.&quot;</string>
<string name="98093">&quot;Abandon your faith. Put the Sleeping Man behind you.&quot;</string>
<string name="98094">&quot;I command you to wake the Sleeping Man...&quot;</string>
<string name="98095">A word is carved into this stone pillar: &quot;Elysium&quot;</string>
<string name="98096">A word is carved into this stone pillar: &quot;Coordinate.&quot;</string>
<string name="98097">A word is carved into this stone pillar: &quot;Dimension.&quot;</string>
<string name="98098">A word is carved into this stone pillar: &quot;Infinity.&quot;</string>
<string name="98099">A word is carved into this stone pillar: &quot;Treason.&quot;</string>
<string name="98100">A word is carved into this stone pillar: &quot;Alternate.&quot;</string>
<string name="98101">You feel somewhat unnerved beneath the dragon&apos;s malevolent gaze. Only in the outer planes, you surmise, would such a creature choose to be a tavernkeeper.</string>
<string name="98102">&quot;Can I get you something?&quot; it growls, the corners of its mighty maw curling up in what looks to be an angry sneer.</string>
<string name="98103">The tavernkeeper smiles the toothy smile of a true businessman. &quot;I brew a fine Velox Berry Firewater but supply doesn&apos;t always keep up with demand... Bring me five Velox Berries and you&apos;ll have earned yourself a pint.&quot;</string>
<string name="98104">&quot;I know how to run a tavern, hunt for my supper, and make a fine swill. The rest I leave to berks like you... Now were you wanting a drink or not?&quot;</string>
<string name="98105">The dragon&apos;s cruel laugh reverberates throughout the tavern. You hear a tankard shatter in the room beyond. &quot;Give it up, berk. Pull up a chair and have a drink, you&apos;re here to stay.&quot;</string>
<string name="98106">You spy a cold glint in the tavern-keeper&apos;s eye. &quot;Gru&apos;ul and I have an arrangement regarding the off-duty quarry workers so here&apos;s where they spend their coin. Some of the spirits come here, too, devil knows why.&quot;</string>
<string name="98107">&quot;As for them Githzerai, they&apos;re new here and nothing but trouble, nursing their swill like it&apos;s all they have left in life. That winged fellow with them, though, he drinks it hard and fast. I just hope he&apos;s good for the money...&quot;</string>
<string name="98108">The dragon&apos;s warm breath smells like a rotting carcass. You think you can see someone&apos;s limb caught between its teeth. &quot;Sleeping, you say? Passed out, more like it...&quot;</string>
<string name="98109">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="98110">&quot;Have you got anything to chase off the cold?&quot;</string>
<string name="98111">&quot;Nevermind.&quot;</string>
<string name="98112">&lt;StartAction&gt;Hand over 5 Velox Berries.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="98113">&quot;Do you know the Reaper&apos;s True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="98114">&quot;I need to return home to the world of Toril.&quot;</string>
<string name="98115">&quot;Tell me about your patrons.&quot;</string>
<string name="98116">&quot;I seek the Five-Fold Mysteries of the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="98117">&lt;StartAction&gt;[View Store]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;What have you got?&quot;</string>
<string name="98118">A brief prayer is written on this card in the Sleeping Man&apos;s graceful scrawl:
   As a child, I learned to Hope.
   When I became a man, my Hope matured into Faith.
   With my old age approaching, I pray my Faith bears Love upon its branches.</string>
<string name="98119">The Sleeping Man staggers to his feet, confused by the sudden commotion.</string>
<string name="98120">The Sleeping Man, now wide awake, looks to you expectantly.</string>
<string name="98121">The Sleeping Man squints into the dim green light, his eyes not yet accustomed to the waking world.</string>
<string name="98122">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Aye, she was quick for sure. Assassins of the Blood War are constantly about, sowing chaos where they can...&quot;</string>
<string name="98123">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Aye, the Hells are full of such and they can take a thousand forms. You were right to destroy her fiendish essence.&quot;</string>
<string name="98124">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Aye, the Hells are full of such. In such cases, it is often best to grant them the mercies of a second death.&quot;</string>
<string name="98125">&quot;Yes, I see that now. The Githzerai are rigid in their faith, worshippers of notions and philosophies rather than the gods. Let her godless faith be her solace now, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="98126">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Your lies betray you, mortal! I am an angel, born of Mount Celestia, and untruth withers beneath my gaze!&quot;</string>
<string name="98127">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Jealous or no, to just taste of love, even for a moment... Do you think my one true love will kill me? No, do not answer. It is not a fate I wish to consider.&quot;</string>
<string name="98128">&quot;You tell the truth, I see... But what god did she worship and what is this temple she spoke of? I am still at the Gates of Cania, no?&quot;</string>
<string name="98129">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;To the south, you say? The glaciers must have shifted, carried me away! But wait, I must not fret. If she is to meet me there then it will be so.&quot;</string>
<string name="98130">&quot;No glacial drift can void that simple truth. Perhaps you have even seen her, my one true love, already gathered at the Gate! Maybe you brought her to me! Tell me, is she here?&quot;</string>
<string name="98131">&quot;Good, good, then all is well... But that trumpet, it would seem to me that you have risked much to sound that blast. Why so?&quot;</string>
<string name="98132">&quot;Good, good, then all is well... Yet you cut me, deep and quick, did you not? The wound heals but look, the scar remains. Why did you do that?&quot;</string>
<string name="98133">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;What devil are you to have killed her then? ...No, I sense no fiendish blood in you. An evil, perhaps, but no devilry.&quot;</string>
<string name="98134">&quot;You are like that trumpet that you blew: a devil&apos;s sound without the devil&apos;s lips... Fair enough, then, but for that woman&apos;s life I demand an answer: Have you seen my one true love? Tell me, is she here?&quot;</string>
<string name="98135">&quot;Yet you cut me, deep and quick. The wound may heal, but look, the scar remains. Fair enough, but in return, I demand an answer: Have you seen my one true love? Tell me, is she here?&quot;</string>
<string name="98136">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Well, if you wish to kill all the devils of Cania, you have my blessing, then. My only advice is don&apos;t burn out too young.&quot;</string>
<string name="98137">&quot;I admit I have not heard of such a figure but wide are the Planes and unceasing their variety. Still, it smacks of heresy. You were right to put her down.&quot;</string>
<string name="98138">&quot;Me? I can sense the truth of it but the very notion... it&apos;s horrible! Did she not see the heresy in it? You were right to do away with her before such notions spread.&quot;</string>
<string name="98139">&quot;I swear, it was as if that fell trumpet blast had summoned her from some planar depths to the attack.... It would seem to me that you have risked much to sound that blast. Why so?&quot;</string>
<string name="98140">&quot;Yet you cut me, deep and quick. Why did you do that?&quot;</string>
<string name="98141">&quot;Well now that I&apos;m awake, I must ask you: Have you seen my true love? Is she here? A part of me is almost scared to ask.&quot;</string>
<string name="98142">&quot;You have run out of options so you come to me? Here I am, an angel in the depths of Cania, sleeping away the years as I wait for my one true love and you think that I have options?&quot;</string>
<string name="98143">&quot;I don&apos;t know how to help you. All I know is that I&apos;m waiting for my one true love. Have you seen her? Is she here?&quot;</string>
<string name="98144">&quot;Well you have succeeded in that and then some. But why wake me? Why now? My one true love, is she here?&quot;</string>
<string name="98145">&quot;Very well. If I can wait for her this long, there is no harm in waiting longer... What is it that you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="98146">&quot;Alas, you are not the first to have tried... Somewhere, banished to the furthest wastes of Cania, is a creature called the Knower of Names... The one portion of my quest I was never able to complete...&quot;</string>
<string name="98147">&quot;Home... I barely remember it. I have searched so long and even now, my quest is incomplete... Somewhere, banished to the wastes of Cania, is a creature I have never seen called the Knower of Names...&quot;</string>
<string name="98148">&quot;I have never heard of this Reaper of whom you speak but as for True Names, I have learned a little. Somewhere between too much and not enough, it always seemed.&quot;</string>
<string name="98149">&quot;Aye, that was the sole portion of my quest that I was unable to complete... Somewhere, banished to the furthest wastes of Cania, is a creature called the Knower of Names...&quot;</string>
<string name="98150">&quot;Where? Bring her to me! I would look upon her face!&quot;</string>
<string name="98151">&quot;And I did not mean to be so overzealous. When one pins one&apos;s entire life upon a single thing, one tends to lose sight of all outside that goal. But tell me please, this time for true, is my true love here?&quot;</string>
<string name="98152">&quot;There is a malice I sense about you, Lady, though a prettier face I have not seen. You leave me unsure... Prove to me you are my true love, however, and I shall love you even in your malice.&quot;</string>
<string name="98153">&quot;O virtuous woman, daughter of a thousand tears, can it be true? You are a creature of great beauty, that is sure. But are you my one true love? Bring me proof and I shall love you forevermore.&quot;</string>
<string name="98154">&quot;You? But... But you are not as I had expected... Forgive me but, fool that I am, I have come to yearn for... for more, somehow... No, I cannot believe it. Bring me proof and I shall believe you but not before.&quot;</string>
<string name="98155">&quot;Her? But she is dead and by your own fell hand! No! I will not believe it! You are but a devil sent to tempt me! If you wish me to believe it, you must bring me proof. All else is falsehood!&quot;</string>
<string name="98156">&quot;I know of but one proof, the sole portion of my quest that I was unable to complete... Somewhere, banished to the furthest wastes of Cania, is a creature called the Knower of Names...&quot;</string>
<string name="98157">&quot;Yes, about my one true love. Have you seen her?&quot;</string>
<string name="98158">&quot;Mephistopheles imprisoned her in the furthest wastes of Cania but the wastes are vast and I know not where her prison lies. But there is one who does and I have relied upon her services once before...&quot;</string>
<string name="98159">&quot;That said, I know a ring that will reveal the path that leads to the Knower of Places. She will answer only one question. It is vital that you ask her where you will find the Knower of Names.&quot;</string>
<string name="98160">&quot;Ah, about the Knower of Names and how I hoped to learn the place to which Mephistopheles banished her...&quot;</string>
<string name="98161">&quot;It is a puzzle ring fashioned for me by a modron from the plane of Mechanus. It operates by virtue of hope. Long ago there was an answer I hoped to find and this ring forged the path and led me to it.&quot;</string>
<string name="98162">&quot;The Ephemeral is also known as the permeating plane of Hope. What you hope for, it reveals. Be careful, however, as some things exist only in the Ephemeral and others not at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="98163">&quot;Yes, about the ring and my search for the Knower of Places...&quot;</string>
<string name="98164">&quot;Before I slept, I built a vault to keep the ring&apos;s three pieces safe. Here, let me summon forth the gate... Oh, and forgive the guardians: it was late and I was tired.&quot;</string>
<string name="98165">&quot;How can it not? It is we who shape our possessions not our possessions who in the end shape us. Though dim may be its light, hope is everywhere, even in the ice of Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="98166">&quot;It is a plane that permeates all existence. It&apos;s almost more a perspective, a way of seeing or interpreting things than it is a true plane. You cannot travel there, for instance...&quot;</string>
<string name="98167">&quot;Nor do I know of any creature that calls it home yet it is always there. It was the path of Hope that led me all the way from Mechanus to the Knower of Places here in Cania. It will do the same for you.&quot;</string>
<string name="98168">&quot;Yes, the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus. It&apos;s a paradise of sorts for some. In that plane, there is a city called Regulus that is home to mechanical creatures called modrons.&quot;</string>
<string name="98169">&quot;They come in many shapes and sizes, some of them cubes, others dodecahedrons. The one who fashioned my ring was an outcast, crippled torus, grizzled and old but full of skill...&quot;</string>
<string name="98170">&quot;I was an angel descending to the depths of the Nine Hells. If I was captured and the ring fell into devils&apos; hands, it would lead them to the Knower of Places. I didn&apos;t dare endanger her like that.&quot;</string>
<string name="98171">&quot;The ring is fashioned in three separate pieces that fit together in only one way. If I was captured, I could collapse it and they would never know the better.&quot;</string>
<string name="98172">&quot;Oh, she will answer more if you ask them right. But as for her domain of knowledge, all the wheres of things, she will only answer one. I never asked her why that is but it was true all the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="98173">&quot;One of the few Knowers who still remains. So much has been lost to this foolish Blood War... But she is safe, making her home in a place where even the devils will not find her.&quot;</string>
<string name="98174">&quot;Why, you get to learn the name of my one true love! There is nothing more valuable in all the world!&quot;</string>
<string name="98175">&quot;An eternal paradise, then. My love and I will bring you with us when we return to Elysium!&quot;</string>
<string name="98176">&quot;Then what is it that you want? Tell me and if it be in my power to give you, it is yours!&quot;</string>
<string name="98177">&quot;Yes, let us speak of the Knower of Places. Long has it been since I last spoke to her and the words she spoke have changed my life forever.&quot;</string>
<string name="98178">&quot;Then who better to seek out than his one-time lover, the Knower of Names, banished by Mephistopheles for fear she might be used against him?&quot;</string>
<string name="98179">&quot;I seek the truth and you seek a weapon. She is both! Her truth is your sword, her knowledge his bane! So seek her out and find her... If you will not do it for me, do it for yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="98180">&quot;They say there is no place like home and, if that is true, who better to assist you than the Knower of Places? Please, just go to her and all will be made well for both of us.&quot;</string>
<string name="98181">&quot;No, I do not but if it is a name you seek then it is the Knower of Names that you must find! Our needs, they run in concert, our quests, they are as one... If you will not do it for me, then do it for yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="98182">&quot;Simply ask her for the name of my true love and then return to me with its beautiful sound upon your lips. I will be able to tell if you speak the truth.&quot;</string>
<string name="98183">&quot;Because names are power. Disguised as one Baron Molikroth, Mephistopheles led a rebellion against his own forces to reveal those who his lover, the Knower of Names, had said would betray him.&quot;</string>
<string name="98184">&quot;In the end he banished eleven of his generals and her as well for he feared that others might use her against him. He sent her away and bid all the Hells forget her... Aye, names are power here, and weakness too.&quot;</string>
<string name="98185">&quot;The Knowers, or ancient baatorians, were creatures of great wisdom and equal innocence. Frozen Cania was their home long before the devils lay claim to it in their endless Blood War against the demons.&quot;</string>
<string name="98186">&quot;I faced a choice, a place where I was granted only a single question, a single answer. Do I gamble everything and learn my true love&apos;s identity, with no guarantee of ever finding her...?&quot;</string>
<string name="98187">&quot;Or do I play it safe and learn where she might find me, knowing then at least that we shall have the fortune to gaze upon each other&apos;s face, unrecognized but still in love... I chose the latter.&quot;</string>
<string name="98188">&quot;Yes, everyone must have one, even a fool such as I and I have searched for her all my long, long life... I have it on good authority that she will find me here and so I wait for her. So tell me, is she here?&quot;</string>
<string name="98189">You return to the dais, drawn once more to gaze upon the pale green skin of this strange man. Something about being in his presence makes you feel peaceful.</string>
<string name="98190">Words, worn thin with age, have been carved into the dais of the Sleeping Man. &quot;She will meet you by the Gates of Cania,&quot; they read in the room&apos;s green glow. </string>
<string name="98191">The winged figure of the Sleeping Man rests before you in the dim green light. Cautious, you edge closer.</string>
<string name="98192">As you approach the Sleeping Man, you can feel the sensei&apos;s amulet begin to hum inside your pack.</string>
<string name="98193">The amulet around your neck begins to hum as you approach the Sleeping Man and a dim light begins to grow within it.</string>
<string name="98194">The Sleeping Man&apos;s rest is a deep one that has lasted for untold centuries. You doubt that waking him from his peaceful slumber will be easy.</string>
<string name="98195">You draw your blade, testing its edge upon your thumb where it quickly draws a bead of red. Satisfied, you drive your knife deep into the Sleeping Man&apos;s thigh, pulling it downwards to leave a gaping wound.</string>
<string name="98196">Blood fills the wound, overflowing onto the dais below, painting it the most beautiful red you have ever seen. Even as you watch, the wound begins to heal... The Sleeping Man wakes with a painful groan.</string>
<string name="98197">The sound rings off the chamber&apos;s thick stone walls but the Sleeping Man doesn&apos;t so much as stir. You realize that it will take something far louder than one &lt;man/woman&gt;&apos;s voice to wake him.</string>
<string name="98198">You bring the trumpet to your lips and blow. For the barest moment it seems as if the multiverse itself has fallen silent. Then, with a ripping, tearing sound, come the screaming winds of Pandemonium.</string>
<string name="98199">The trumpet is sucking all the breath from your lungs. You try to stop blowing but you cannot. Just when you are about to black out, the shrieking fades... Before you, the Sleeping Man stirs and wakes.</string>
<string name="98200">The amulet feels warm against your chest. A dim green light grows within its crystalline heart.</string>
<string name="98201">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; The room is too cold and the worries of the world weigh too heavily upon you. You find yourself unable to concentrate on the amulet and soon give up in disgust.</string>
<string name="98202">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; You focus your thoughts on the crystal, slowly letting the worries of the world slip away. At last, your soul grows still and you find yourself floating through a pale white haze.</string>
<string name="98203">Through the haze drift the sounds of battle. &quot;Down with Mephistopheles! Long live Baron Molikroth!&quot; someone cries. &quot;Molikroth is lord of Cania!&quot; cries another. &quot;The battle is ours!&quot;</string>
<string name="98204">The pale white curtain parts to reveal a dozen devils and a stranger, white as the mist that cloaks her. One devil, the Baron, looms above the rest, obese and toady. He clears his throat to speak.</string>
<string name="98205">His form stretching, growing taller and darker, the Baron thanks the generals for their assistance. They cower in fear before him as he slowly takes his true form: that of Mephistopheles, the Lord they thought defeated.</string>
<string name="98206">The pale woman steps forward, a single tear clinging to her cheek. &quot;But what of me, my love? I gave you the True Names of those who would betray you and it has come to pass. Do you believe me now?&quot;</string>
<string name="98207">&quot;You are the Knower of Names, my love,&quot; he responds in tender voice, &quot;and it is you most of all that I must banish. Names hold too much power in this place and I&apos;ll not have you used against me.&quot;</string>
<string name="98208">The entire maddened world seems to hang suspended in that tear. &quot;Please,&quot; she cries, &quot;if you love me, don&apos;t let me be banished! I&apos;ll stay with you in Mephitis.&quot;</string>
<string name="98209">Mephistopheles smiles wanly in return. &quot;But, my sweet, I don&apos;t love you... I never did.&quot; With that, he sends her hurtling through the starless sky, a flaming comet headed for the furthest wastes of Cania.</string>
<string name="98210">The tear falls to the ice and shatters. In each shard is the image of the Sleeping Man, frost clinging to his lips, marching through a purple haze. A doorway looms before him, set into the ice.</string>
<string name="98211">You open the door and the Sleeping Man stumbles through, grateful to be free from the icy winds. You feel yourself being pulled through more doors, down corridors, through rooms...</string>
<string name="98212">Suddenly you&apos;re in a room and a voice says &quot;You have many questions but I can only answer one.&quot; You can feel the torment of the Sleeping Man as he ponders what to ask.</string>
<string name="98213">&quot;It is want for love that brought me here, Knower. While I yearn to know where my true love is today or where I might learn the name by which I&apos;ll know her, no answer you can give would help me.&quot;</string>
<string name="98214">&quot;Instead I ask where it is that I will meet her. Tell me that and I shall wait there &apos;til she has found me. Let that be my question, Knower, and answer true.&quot;</string>
<string name="98215">The Knower&apos;s answer is buried in a squall of purple snow as the Sleeping Man returns to the Gates of Cania. He removes a ring from his finger and the world is white again.</string>
<string name="98216">When he removed the ring from his finger, it split back into the three interconnecting bands from which it was fashioned. He built a chamber for the ring below the ice, that it might be safe.</string>
<string name="98217">Atop the chambers he built himself a stone bed, heated from below. He waited many days for his true love. When she did not come, he slowly fell asleep, content in the knowledge that she would find him there.</string>
<string name="98218">Alas, the Sleeping Man has settled into a deeper slumber, void of dreams. Try as you might, you cannot reach him there.</string>
<string name="98219">The city doesn&apos;t seem to exist in the Sleeping Man&apos;s dream. Instead, the Gatehouse&apos;s portal lies exposed atop a plain of ice. The city must have built up around it at a later date as the Gatehouse saw more use.</string>
<string name="98220">The answer given by the Knower of Places still resounds in the Sleeping Man&apos;s subconscious: &quot;She will find you by the Gates of Cania...&quot;</string>
<string name="98221">A dizzying array of questions tumble through the Sleeping Man&apos;s mind. Where am I? Where do I belong? Where was the Knower of Names banished to? Where must I go?</string>
<string name="98222">Where will I meet my one true love? Where is she now? Where will she die? Where will I die? Where can good be found? Where can evil be vanquished? Where can I find the truth?</string>
<string name="98223">The voice is a female one, not unlike that of the Knower of Names from the Sleeping Man&apos;s previous dream. It&apos;s as if she had an older sister. A part of you realizes that she is called the Knower of Places.</string>
<string name="98224">You find it difficult to focus on the features of the room. It somehow seems to be many places all at once or maybe not a place at all. You don&apos;t know quite what to make of it.</string>
<string name="98225">The haze seems to permeate everything, even the ice itself. Looking past the Sleeping Man, you see a string of red arrows burning bright in the purple air, leading him towards the door.</string>
<string name="98226">Somehow it all seems tied to a ring he wears upon his finger, a ring that has charted a course for him through the wastelands.</string>
<string name="98227">He&apos;s shivering, almost dead from the cold but something, either passion or madness, still burns bright in his eyes. He has come in search of answers and those answers, at long last, are near.</string>
<string name="98228">You seem unable to refocus on the shattered tear and before long it fades away to nothing. It seems that dream is over and a new one has begun.</string>
<string name="98229">There seems to be nothing for you to focus on, no concept in the dream for you to cling to. It is as if the Sleeping Man has never heard of the Reaper.</string>
<string name="98230">Through the mist comes the image of a remote glacier, its surface pocked by twelve smoldering pits. The pits slowly fill with drifting snow, the banished ones buried beneath its frigid weight.</string>
<string name="98231">The Sleeping Man seems to consider the plane of Cania a recent addition to the Hells of Baator, with the Knower of Names somehow belonging to its previous existence.</string>
<string name="98232">You get the sense that other such ancient baatorians must have existed in the Sleeping Man&apos;s time, though even then they seem a rarity, hunted by the devils to near extinction.</string>
<string name="98233">One by one, Mephistopheles calls his treacherous generals by name, their True Name, and sends them hurtling through Cania&apos;s starless sky like meteors, wrapped in hellish flame.</string>
<string name="98234">&quot;You are banished,&quot; he declares, &quot;to the furthest wastes of Cania! May the glaciers bury you and may all memory of your passing be stripped from the Hells of Baator! By your True Names, I command it so!&quot;</string>
<string name="98235">He seems younger in this dream than you remember him, yet taller, too. The arrogance of triumph swirls about him, dark and almost corporeal. There is a certain sense of glee as well, a pride in his deceit.</string>
<string name="98236">It seems Baron Molikroth was a ruse, a devil&apos;s deceit through which Mephistopheles was able to uncover those who conspired against his throne.</string>
<string name="98237">Their voices are gruff and guttural, interspersed with the gnashing of teeth. They are Generals on the devil&apos;s side of the Blood War and high-ranking ones at that.</string>
<string name="98238">One voice is different, though: nervous and not devilish at all. Ancient as it is, the voice seems to hold a wisdom far beyond its years. It knows too much... It knows that treachery is afoot, yet it stays silent.</string>
<string name="98239">The dream is all around you, each aspect so richly textured that there seems no end to its depth, to its completeness. You focus on the Baron&apos;s name and are filled with a sudden unease.</string>
<string name="98240">Something is wrong and you find yourself filled with a sense of impending doom. There is treachery afoot and you can sense that there is something Baron Molikroth has not told those who follow him.</string>
<string name="98241">The Sleeping Man&apos;s dreamscape shifts and ripples in response to your curiosity. You sense the voice of an old storyteller, the smell of sour ale, the warmth of a fire.</string>
<string name="98242">This must be a story the Sleeping Man had heard, long ago. A story he had sought out. A story of an uprising here in Cania, devil against devil in a war for rulership over the Eighth Hell.</string>
<string name="98243">You can barely discern the slow rise and fall of his well-muscled torso. His breath coalesces into small puffs in the cool air, the feathers of his wings fluttering slightly in the drafty room.</string>
<string name="98244">There is a sadness in his face and a weariness that hangs upon his brow but the corners of his mouth are turned upwards in a gentle smile. Something about him feels undeniably holy.</string>
<string name="98245">The Sleeping Man, now wide awake, looks to you expectantly.</string>
<string name="98246">The Sleeping Man rests atop his dais, unchanged since last you saw him. You wonder how long he&apos;s been there and how much longer he&apos;s prepared to wait. You realize that you have no means to read his dreams...</string>
<string name="98247">You lean close and breathe the Sleeping Man&apos;s True Name. &quot;Celesfa&apos;ar the Patient...&quot; He stirs slightly at your voice as if somehow knowing, even in deepest sleep, that someone commands him.</string>
<string name="98248">The Sleeping Man relaxes, fading deeper into his slumber.</string>
<string name="98249">The Sleeping Man stirs and wakes, his eyes still unaccustomed to the temple&apos;s pale green light. &quot;What is the meaning of this? Why have you woken me?&quot;</string>
<string name="98250">The Sleeping Man stirs and wakes, his eyes still unaccustomed to the temple&apos;s pale green light.</string>
<string name="98251">&quot;Pilgrim &lt;LastName&gt;! Why have you woken him!? What is the meaning of this?&quot; You can sense her panic, her ill intent. You watch as her hands clench into fists and she prepares to attack.</string>
<string name="98252">If the sensei heard your words, she gives no indication of it. With a wrathful scream, she descends on you.</string>
<string name="98253">Stunned, the sensei pauses, unable to harm the one who commands her.</string>
<string name="98254">&quot;But... No, I will not fight her! What is going on? This is madness!&quot;</string>
<string name="98255">&quot;You have quite the explaining to do, Pilgrim, but it appears I have no choice but to hear you out. Continue then...&quot;</string>
<string name="98256">&quot;Yes, you have quite the explaining to do indeed. What is the meaning of all this commotion?&quot;</string>
<string name="98257">You nod to the Sleeping Man. &quot;I have dreamed the name of my one true love,&quot; he proclaims amidst the celestial light that is beginning to swirl about him.</string>
<string name="98258">&quot;She is a celestial deva by the name of Lavoera. I will return to my home in search of her. If she is an angel already born, then there are likely to be records... &quot;</string>
<string name="98259">&quot;It is the Knower of Names, imprisoned by Mephistopheles in some far-off and secret place following the Molikroth Rebellion...&quot;</string>
<string name="98260">&quot;It is the Knower of Places who I met once, long ago. I pray she is well...&quot;</string>
<string name="98261">&quot;She is Nathyrra, a woman of the drow. Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="98262">&quot;She is a githzerai known as the Sensei Dharvana. Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="98263">&quot;She is a spirit known as Lady Aribeth. Do you know of her?&quot;</string>
<string name="98264">&quot;It is you, &lt;FullName&gt;. You are the one I have waited for.&quot; He stands before you, kissing you, pulling you into his celestial embrace. &quot;My one true love,&quot; he whispers.</string>
<string name="98265">As suddenly as she came, the sensei is gone, leaving you and the Sleeping Man alone amidst the echoes of her rage.</string>
<string name="98266">&quot;Who was that? I barely caught a glimpse of her.&quot;</string>
<string name="98267">[SMAN THINKS HE KNOWS HIS ONE TRUE LOVE] &quot;Then I thank you for your protection. Just now I dreamed the name of my one true love and I would hate to be cut down before I lay eyes on her.&quot;</string>
<string name="98268">&quot;Yes, well you have quite the explaining to do. What is the meaning of all this commotion?&quot;</string>
<string name="98269">&quot;Well you woke me from a dream wherein I heard the name of my one true love,&quot; he proclaims amidst the celestial light that is beginning to swirl about him.</string>
<string name="98270">&quot;You condemn yourself with your own words and have banished my one true love! You have brought my wrath upon you, you fool!&quot;</string>
<string name="98271">The muscles of the Sleeping Man ripple and twist, his body contorting as if from some fevered dream. He cries out in anguish, then all is still. With your fingers to his neck, you find no pulse. His body is already growing cold.</string>
<string name="98272">His stirring stops abruptly, his muscles tense, as if the Sleeping Man&apos;s entire subconscious hangs upon this thread.</string>
<string name="98273">The Sleeping Man waits, eyes closed, still commanded by his True Name.</string>
<string name="98274">He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98275">He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98276">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; The Sleeping Man rolls over, turning his back to you. You get the sense that he doesn&apos;t believe you.</string>
<string name="98277">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98278">He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98279">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; The Sleeping Man rolls over, turning his back to you. You get the sense that he doesn&apos;t believe you.</string>
<string name="98280">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98281">He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98282">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; The Sleeping Man rolls over, turning his back to you. You get the sense that he doesn&apos;t believe you.</string>
<string name="98283">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98284">He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98285">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; The Sleeping Man rolls over, turning his back to you. You get the sense that he doesn&apos;t believe you.</string>
<string name="98286">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98287">He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98288">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; The Sleeping Man rolls over, turning his back to you. You get the sense that he doesn&apos;t believe you.</string>
<string name="98289">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; He smiles at the name and is at peace.</string>
<string name="98290">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failed Save vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; The Sleeping Man rolls over, turning his back to you. You get the sense that he doesn&apos;t believe you.</string>
<string name="98291">He turns to you, his eyes open, his mouth a warm smile. Reaching up, he kisses you, pulling you into his celestial embrace. His mouth tastes like morning flowers. &quot;My one true love,&quot; he whispers.</string>
<string name="98292">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Saved vs. Discern Lies]&lt;/Start&gt; He turns to you, his eyes open, his mouth a warm smile. Reaching up, he kisses you, pulling you into his celestial embrace. &quot;My one true love,&quot; he whispers.</string>
<string name="98293">A look of shock crosses his face, the mark of your hand still white upon it. His voice comes to you then, laden with confusion and regret. &quot;I&apos;m... I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. What have I done to displease you?&quot;</string>
<string name="98294">Hesitant and shy, he cups a hand behind your neck. Leaning in, eyes closed, he places the tenderest kiss in all the world upon your lips.</string>
<string name="98295">&quot;On edge? What is it that causes my love so much grief?&quot;</string>
<string name="98296">&quot;My very existence? But... But you are my one true love! Am I not yours? Have I waited so long only to know the torment of your scorn? It would have been better if I had died in my sleep...&quot;</string>
<string name="98297">&quot;Farewell, then. I give you my undying love and take your scorn with me... The Hells know no torment such as mine. I can only pray the next life is not as cruel.&quot;</string>
<string name="98298">&quot;Forgive me, my dear, for you are right. I fear I have built this moment up too much within my heart and now must suffer for it. Please, do not scorn me for my love.&quot;</string>
<string name="98299">A line of worry creases his brow. &quot;Is something the matter, my love?&quot;</string>
<string name="98300">&quot;I... I smell bad? My love, I have traveled countless leagues to find you and have slept for millennia in the depths of the Nine Hells waiting for you to arrive! If a bath is all you ask of me I will do it but...&quot;</string>
<string name="98301">You smile to yourself as the look of terror on the Sleeping Man&apos;s face widens into a broad grin. He throws his head back and laughs the richest, warmest laugh you have ever heard.</string>
<string name="98302">&quot;You&apos;re right, I had almost forgotten my sense of humor in this place. It feels good to laugh again and I have you to thank for it. But tell me in truth, what worry lurks beneath your jest?&quot;</string>
<string name="98303">&quot;You don&apos;t understand. You won&apos;t find a bath in all of Cania! I doubt there are even any in all the Hells of Baator!&quot;</string>
<string name="98304">&quot;Fine, fine, I&apos;ll do it! I&apos;ll figure something out! But where will I meet you once I have?&quot;</string>
<string name="98305">&quot;My place? But I haven&apos;t been back to Elysium for eons! It&apos;s probably a horrible mess... No, don&apos;t worry! I&apos;ll bathe and then clean -- no, clean and then bathe! It doesn&apos;t matter, I&apos;ll see you there!&quot;</string>
<string name="98306">&quot;Then I will meet you there, freshly bathed, and we can talk. Maybe we can go somewhere for tea or I can treat you to supper! Do you like lamb? No, don&apos;t answer, it will be a surprise. I&apos;ll see you there!&quot;</string>
<string name="98307">&quot;Then stay! Don&apos;t move a muscle! I&apos;ll be back as soon as I possibly can! I promise you that, &lt;FirstName&gt;, on my love!&quot;</string>
<string name="98308">&quot;It&apos;s over? But it&apos;s barely begun! ...Fine, a curse on you and all your gender, then! May your black heart rot within you breast... I wasted my life for you. We are done here, &lt;FullName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="98309">&quot;But you&apos;ve only just arrived... What can be so pressing?&quot;</string>
<string name="98310">&quot;Will you be returning? Where shall I find you?&quot;</string>
<string name="98311">&quot;Yes, my home in Elysium. I have been long away... May the gods shine favor upon you in what you must do, then. I will prepare my home in paradise for your coming.&quot;</string>
<string name="98312">&quot;Go then, my dear, and do whatever it is that you must do. If I do not hear from you within a week, I will look for you in this place you call Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="98313">&quot;Then I shall wait up here in the rafters for you until your return. I pray you do not tarry long, my love, as your kiss is like a fountain in the desert and I thirst for more...&quot;</string>
<string name="98314">&quot;Then I shall wait up here in the rafters until you are ready... Do what you must, my love, but return to me before you are old and gray and your life is spent. While I will wait for you, time will not...&quot;</string>
<string name="98315">&quot;I have come to Baator itself to find you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I shall let no evil come between us. I will fight this evil by your side, in love&apos;s own name, if you will allow it.&quot;</string>
<string name="98316">&quot;Love is never in the way but, if that is your wish, I will not interfere. Where shall I find you when your battle is ended, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="98317">&quot;I understand. If that is your wish, I will not interfere... When the battle has ended, however, where shall I find you?&quot;</string>
<string name="98318">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;? Do you speak true? I confess, I had dreamed of more... But at least I have beheld your face. I have heard your voice. I have tasted of your lips...&quot;</string>
<string name="98319">&quot;I have waited long for this and I would wait as long again to see you twice... Oh love, my fate is empty but my heart at least is full. The memory of you will sustain me... Farewell, then, my one true love...&quot;</string>
<string name="98320">&quot;Yes, my home in Elysium. I have been long away... May the gods shine favor upon you in the face of evil, then. Fight your battle well while I prepare my home in paradise for your coming.&quot;</string>
<string name="98321">&quot;In the city of Waterdeep on the world of Toril... Go then, my dear, and with my love. I will find you there once your battle is won.&quot;</string>
<string name="98322">&quot;And I will wait up here in the rafters for you to the end of time, my love... May the gods show favor on you in the face of evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="98323">&quot;For you I would move the Heavens and the earth... The world of Toril, you say, on the Material Plane? Go my dear, and with my love. I will find you there and be beside you when it comes time for battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="98324">He tastes your lips, your tongue, becoming increasingly passionate. &quot;I have been waiting for this moment all of my life, &lt;FirstName&gt;&quot; he murmurs, tears streaming freely from his gray-green eyes.</string>
<string name="98325">Something in you tenses, then, some memory of the vengeance you have yet to take on your nemesis, Mephistopheles. A line of worry crosses the Sleeping Man&apos;s brow. &quot;Is something the matter, my love?&quot;</string>
<string name="98326">THE SLEEPING MAN. A FALLEN PLANETAR WHO JOURNEYED TO CANIA LONG AGO TO FIND HIS TRUE LOVE. FOUND IN THE TEMPLE THAT BEARS HIS NAME.</string>
<string name="98327">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;I have no idea. It was as if she came out of nowhere.&quot;</string>
<string name="98328">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;A she-devil, bent on my destruction.&quot;</string>
<string name="98329">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;A vengeful spirit, I&apos;m afraid.&quot;</string>
<string name="98330">&quot;It was a woman of the Githzerai.&quot;</string>
<string name="98331">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;Just a jealous lover, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="98332">&quot;That was the sensei. She runs the temple here.&quot;</string>
<string name="98333">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;The Gates of Cania? No, they lie far to the south.&quot;</string>
<string name="98334">&quot;You are in the City of Lost Souls, at the foot of Cania&apos;s gates.&quot;</string>
<string name="98335">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;She worshipped Tyr, the god of goodly justice.&quot;</string>
<string name="98336">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Lie]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;She worshipped the devil Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="98337">&quot;She worshipped some being called the Sleeping Man.&quot;</string>
<string name="98338">&quot;It was you she worshipped.&quot;</string>
<string name="98339">&quot;I&apos;m not sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="98340">&quot;I needed to get that woman&apos;s attention.&quot;</string>
<string name="98341">&quot;I have run out of options and need your help.&quot;</string>
<string name="98342">&quot;I needed to wake you.&quot;</string>
<string name="98343">&quot;No, she isn&apos;t, but I have some requests to make of you.&quot;</string>
<string name="98344">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="98345">&quot;I must stop Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="98346">&quot;I wish to return home to the world of Toril.&quot;</string>
<string name="98347">&quot;Do you know the Reaper&apos;s True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="98348">&quot;Yes, she is...&quot;</string>
<string name="98349">&quot;Sorry, I have misspoken. I did not mean to cause alarm.&quot;</string>
<string name="98350">&quot;She is right here, the Lady Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="98351">&quot;It is I. I am your true love.&quot;</string>
<string name="98352">&quot;She is there, that corpse upon the floor.&quot;</string>
<string name="98353">&quot;What proof do you require to know your love?&quot;</string>
<string name="98354">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="98355">&quot;How do I find this Knower of Names?&quot;</string>
<string name="98356">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="98357">&quot;Then tell me of this ring.&quot;</string>
<string name="98358">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="98359">&quot;All right, show me the ring.&quot;</string>
<string name="98360">&quot;How can it operate by virtue of hope?&quot;</string>
<string name="98361">&quot;What is a permeating plane?&quot;</string>
<string name="98362">&quot;Modrons? Mechanus? What are you talking about?&quot;</string>
<string name="98363">&quot;What do you mean it&apos;s a puzzle ring?&quot;</string>
<string name="98364">&quot;Why will she only answer one question?&quot;</string>
<string name="98365">&quot;Who&apos;s this Knower of Places?&quot;</string>
<string name="98366">&quot;What&apos;s in it for me?&quot;</string>
<string name="98367">&quot;Yeah, well, it&apos;s not enough...&quot;</string>
<string name="98368">&quot;Not interested...&quot;</string>
<string name="98369">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="98370">&quot;I must stop Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="98371">&quot;I wish to return home to the world of Toril.&quot;</string>
<string name="98372">&quot;Do you know the Reaper&apos;s True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="98373">&quot;What proof can she offer you?&quot;</string>
<string name="98374">&quot;Why is she banished?&quot;</string>
<string name="98375">&quot;What sort of creature has a name like that?&quot;</string>
<string name="98376">&quot;Why were you unable to complete your quest?&quot;</string>
<string name="98377">&quot;Your one true love?&quot;</string>

<string name="98483">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, let&apos;s start over.&quot;</string>
<string name="98484">&quot;It was nothing. I am simply on edge, that is all.&quot;</string>
<string name="98485">&quot;Your very existence displeases me.&quot;</string>
<string name="98486">&quot;You presume too much, planetar.&quot;</string>
<string name="98487">&lt;StartAction&gt;Break away.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="98488">&quot;You smell bad.&quot;</string>
<string name="98489">&quot;I was teasing. If you love me, you&apos;ll need to learn how to laugh.&quot;</string>
<string name="98490">&quot;Good. Bathe yourself at once and then we can talk.&quot;</string>
<string name="98491">&quot;I&apos;m counting... One... Two...&quot;</string>
<string name="98492">&quot;You won&apos;t... You&apos;d best say your goodbyes now.&quot;</string>
<string name="98493">&quot;I will meet you in paradise, where you belong.&quot;</string>
<string name="98494">&quot;I&apos;ll be in the city of Waterdeep in my homeworld of Toril.&quot;</string>
<string name="98495">&quot;I&apos;ll wait for you right here, by the Gates of Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="98496">&quot;I&apos;m not interested in your excuses. This relationship is over!&quot;</string>
<string name="98497">&quot;I have to go.&quot;</string>
<string name="98498">&quot;I&apos;m sorry but that&apos;s none of your business.&quot;</string>
<string name="98499">&quot;I&apos;m not coming back... You&apos;d best say your goodbyes now.&quot;</string>
<string name="98500">&quot;I will see you in paradise, where you belong.&quot;</string>
<string name="98501">&quot;Come find me in the city of Waterdeep in my homeworld of Toril.&quot;</string>
<string name="98502">&quot;I will return to you here, by the Gates of Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="98503">&quot;I&apos;m just not ready for this, all right?&quot;</string>
<string name="98504">&quot;Evil is afoot in my home world of Toril.&quot;</string>
<string name="98505">&quot;No, you&apos;d just be in the way.&quot;</string>
<string name="98506">&quot;No, it is something I must do alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="98507">&quot;You won&apos;t... You&apos;d best say your goodbyes now.&quot;</string>
<string name="98508">&quot;Let us meet in paradise, where you belong.&quot;</string>
<string name="98509">&quot;In the city of Waterdeep.&quot;</string>
<string name="98510">&quot;I will return to you here, by the Gates of Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="98511">&quot;You would help me?&quot;</string>
<string name="98512">&lt;StartAction&gt;Kiss him back.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="98513">The Knower of Places hovers about you with her gossamer wings, eager for your attention.</string>
<string name="98514">Amidst the chaos of the place, you spy a woman&apos;s face, a butterfly&apos;s wings, a coquettish glance... It seems the Sleeping Man&apos;s ring has led you at long last to the Knower of Places.</string>
<string name="98515">&quot;Yes, you should have asked where to find patience, you should have asked! Many find their one true love but who finds patience in this world? Such an answer would have been worth far more...&quot;</string>
<string name="98516">&quot;Your accord? It&apos;s like a ball of string, a ball of countless cords, not your own at all! You don&apos;t have his wings, you don&apos;t wear his skin but you&apos;ll ask his questions all the same. You have his ring, you see?&quot;</string>
<string name="98517">&quot;No? Are you sure? You wear his ring and there&apos;s only one, only one in all the world and here it is, you see? Here it is. You don&apos;t have his wings, you don&apos;t wear his skin but you&apos;ll ask his question sure enough.&quot;</string>
<string name="98518">&quot;But come, Planetar, my friend, my only friend, my one true friend in all this world, let us talk together of old times. A million questions but none of Where. You asked that question once already, nevermore.&quot;</string>
<string name="98519">&quot;Please, my precious Planetar, it breaks my heart to see you beg me so. I cannot tell you that. You know how true that is, I told you long ago.&quot;</string>
<string name="98520">&quot;Perhaps not. Perhaps you come here with your own desires and needs, separate from those of my fair Planetar... But it&apos;s a pretty thing to believe that he might come back for me... Very well, two answers I will give you, then:&quot;</string>
<string name="98521">&quot;Of course I don&apos;t, my love, my Planetar. Only one question, I vowed, because I dare not have you see the picture whole. It&apos;s already clear I cannot be your one true love, don&apos;t you see?&quot;</string>
<string name="98522">&quot;I dare not leave the safety of this place, yet I know your love will find you elsewhere. Frail and jealous is my heart. Did you expect me to give you away upon a silver platter, an apple in your mouth?&quot;</string>
<string name="98523">&quot;Well, hope has led you this far, Planetar. I suppose there is nothing that can prevent it from taking you to the end... I will give you two answers to your question for it is the second you have asked me.&quot;</string>
<string name="98524">&quot;Then who am I to deny you of your heart&apos;s desire? ...Very well, I will give you two answers to your question for it is the second you have asked of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="98525">&quot;The first answer lies in the ring that led you here. Let its three bands of hope be tempered with this fourth band that I have fashioned from my despair. It will lead you to her prison as this has led you here.&quot;</string>
<string name="98526">&quot;You are not the first to seek their prison and not the first to find it. Time is a twelve-spoked wheel and with every hour of our lives another spoke has come and gone...&quot;</string>
<string name="98527">&quot;No. Thank you, my Planetar, for everything and nothing all at once. You have made a shadow out of me... Your spoke has passed, however, and it is time you go. Pursue your quest before I fade away entirely...&quot;</string>
<string name="98528">&quot;No, do not thank me... Forget me... That would be better, I think. Yes, forget me, my Planetar and, with the passing of the spokes, maybe I will forget you...&quot;</string>
<string name="98529">&quot;It is what it is, my Planetar. Maybe with the passing of the spokes, you will understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="98530">&quot;If you love somebody, set them free... For otherwise your heart shall be clutched between their teeth forevermore. Let their freedom become your own...&quot;</string>
<string name="98531">You glance at the ring upon your finger. The three golden bands that have always been there are now entwined with what appears to be grasping black tendrils, frozen in place and cold as iron.</string>
<string name="98532">&quot;Because that question involves a Where and I told you yours already, long ago when last I saw you. Only one, I told you then. Only one question, only one answer. I told you that, my Planetar...&quot;</string>
<string name="98533">&quot;A sister you call her? Yes, I can see why you might think of us in that way. She was the youngest of us, born after the devils first claimed the ice of Cania as their own... Young and sweet, pretty and foolish...&quot;</string>
<string name="98534">&quot;O, Planetar... She loved too much, too fast, too hard, too passionately. We were all harlots of knowledge and they loved us for our minds. Even you, even Mephistopheles, one and the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="98535">&quot;We tried to warn her &apos;gainst a devil&apos;s heart but that only made her ardor stronger. Perhaps she thought to change him, perhaps the waters of her heart ran darker than we knew...&quot;</string>
<string name="98536">&quot;But yes, she loved him and was loved by him, or so it seems before he betrayed her and cast her out and banished her in flames to a place I cannot tell you, Planetar...&quot;</string>
<string name="98537">&quot;Hush, Planetar... See how hard it is for you to say? You never loved me but at least you believed me. Who am I to ask for more, my Planetar? Who am I to ask for more?&quot;</string>
<string name="98538">&quot;Those are pretty words to hear, Planetar, made all the prettier by your lips. But if you had loved me you would have stayed with me and if you love me now, you&apos;d do the same. It&apos;s the deeds that speak...&quot;</string>
<string name="98539">&quot;I... I have. Oh I try not to, Planetar, I try so hard, but some questions have no answers or no answers that make sense or no answers that don&apos;t say too much or too little all at once... I try not to, Planetar.&quot;</string>
<string name="98540">&quot;You, Planetar, only you, just like I told you before, only you. I&apos;ve loved others in their time but I haven&apos;t seen anyone for so long now, only you. I can be true to you, Planetar. Only you...&quot;</string>
<string name="98541">&quot;Ah, Planetar, it is not a place at all. It is a noplace, a nonplace, an unplace, a place between places, a space between spaces, an intraverse where you alone have found me. Do you like it? Stay with me here.&quot;</string>
<string name="98542">&quot;You are the Planetar because you wear his ring, ask his questions, pursue his quest. I, too, am who I am, an amalgam of faces and places and cases of things.&quot;</string>
<string name="98543">&quot;Every time a scorpion stings, another angel&apos;s lost its wings... She&apos;ll find you by the Gates of Cania, Planetar, I told you that once already. Once and once alone, I told you that.&quot;</string>
<string name="98544">THE RIDDLE-SPEAKING &apos;KNOWER OF PLACES,&apos; FOUND IN THE WASTES OF CANIA.</string>
<string name="98545">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="98546">&quot;Yeah, I got tired of waiting.&quot;</string>
<string name="98547">&quot;I come of my own accord.&quot;</string>
<string name="98548">&quot;I&apos;m not the Planetar.&quot;</string>
<string name="98549">&quot;Where is the Knower of Names imprisoned?&quot;</string>
<string name="98550">&quot;But I&apos;m not your Planetar!&quot;</string>
<string name="98551">&quot;You just don&apos;t want to tell me!&quot;</string>
<string name="98552">&quot;No, but I had hoped you would.&quot;</string>
<string name="98553">&quot;Yes, I did...&quot;</string>
<string name="98554">&quot;And the second answer?&quot;</string>
<string name="98555">&quot;Thanks for nothing.&quot;</string>
<string name="98556">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="98557">&quot;What&apos;s that supposed to mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="98558">&quot;Thank you.&quot;</string>
<string name="98559">&lt;StartAction&gt;Look at the Sleeping Man&apos;s ring.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="98560">&quot;Why can&apos;t you tell me?&quot;</string>
<string name="98561">&quot;Tell me about your sister, the Knower of Names.&quot;</string>
<string name="98562">&quot;She let herself be loved by Mephistopheles?&quot;</string>
<string name="98563">&quot;The Planetar doesn&apos;t love you.&quot;</string>
<string name="98564">&quot;I love you for more than just your mind...&quot;</string>
<string name="98565">&quot;Do you ever lie?&quot;</string>
<string name="98566">&quot;Who do you love?&quot;</string>
<string name="98567">&quot;What is this place?&quot;</string>
<string name="98568">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="98569">&quot;I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about.&quot;</string>
<string name="98570">The Knower of Names turns to you, a sadness clinging to her pale face.</string>
<string name="98571">Suddenly the Knower of Names is there before you, pale, white, and triumphant. Her youthful features shine beneath the icy pallor of her skin and she leans toward you, whispers in your ear...</string>
<string name="98572">&quot;Ah, True Names... Every name has its price and every price a name. The gods declare it so. Now whose True Name do you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="98573">&quot;Very well. We had been discussing your True Name...&quot;</string>
<string name="98574">&quot;I have already told you that the one you know as the Reaper of Cania is called Hecugoth the Abandoned in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98575">&quot;Ah, I can sense that this is the name you truly seek. The gods demand a strange price for it, though... There are two items that have aided you in your quest: a ring and an amulet. You must surrender them.&quot;</string>
<string name="98576">&quot;The one you know as the Reaper of Cania is called Hecugoth the Abandoned in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98577">&quot;I have already told you that the one you know as the devil Mephistopheles, Lord of the Eighth Hell, is called Thra&apos;axfyl the Ambitious in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98578">&quot;The one thing that could have unraveled my love&apos;s duplicity during the False Rebellion would have been the realization that he and Baron Molikroth were one and the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="98579">&quot;He took steps to ensure that the truth would never come to light and he forbade me to ever speak his name. Forgive me and my heart that loved him but that is one name I cannot tell you... Perhaps there is another?&quot;</string>
<string name="98580">&quot;Very well, though the gods must still have their price and for one such as him, it was always high... Are you willing to sacrifice 500,000 gold to learn Mephistopheles&apos; True Name?&quot;</string>
<string name="98581">&quot;The one you know as the devil Mephistopheles, Lord of the Eighth Hell, is called Thra&apos;axfyl the Ambitious in the gods&apos; tongue... Damn you, Hellwalker, is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98582">&quot;I have already told you that I am called Phyreshi the Knower in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98583">&quot;The gods demand a sacrifice of 200,000 gold if you are to learn my True Name... Are you willing to make that sacrifice?&quot;</string>
<string name="98584">&quot;Though you know me as the Knower of Names, I am called Phyreshi the Knower in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98585">&quot;I have already told you that the one you know as Arden Swift is called Caddisthwaite the Doomed in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98586">&quot;The gods demand a sacrifice of 100,000 gold if you are to learn the True Name of the one you know as Arden Swift... Are you willing to make that sacrifice?&quot;</string>
<string name="98587">&quot;The one you know as Arden Swift is called Caddisthwaite the Doomed in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98588">&quot;I have already told you that the one you know as the Sensei Dharvana is called Fa&apos;arethia the Misguided in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98589">&quot;The gods demand a sacrifice of 100,000 gold if you are to learn the True Name of the one you know as the Sensei Dharvana... Are you willing to make that sacrifice?&quot;</string>
<string name="98590">&quot;The one you know as the Sensei Dharvana is called Fa&apos;arethia the Misguided in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98591">&quot;I have already told you that the one you know as Gru&apos;ul the Quarry Boss is called Gargelflaw the Vile in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98592">&quot;The gods demand a sacrifice of 100,000 gold if you are to learn the True Name of the one you know as Gru&apos;ul the Quarry Boss... Are you willing to make that sacrifice?&quot;</string>
<string name="98593">&quot;The one you know as Gru&apos;ul the Quarry Boss is called Gargelflaw the Vile in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98594">&quot;I have already told you that there is no one true love written upon the stars for you. It is your destiny and asking again will not change it... Now is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98595">&quot;I have already told you that your one true love is called Cwylgarion the Strong in the gods&apos; tongue. You do not know him yet though you will in time... Is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98596">&quot;I have already told you that your one true love is called Celesfa&apos;ar the Patient in the gods&apos; tongue. You know him as the Sleeping Man... Is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98597">&quot;I have already told you that your one true love is called Oeskathine the Demonwrestler in the gods&apos; tongue. You know him as Valen... Is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98598">&quot;I have already told you that your one true love is called Cassanduria the Beautiful in the gods&apos; tongue. You do not know her yet though you will in time... Is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98599">&quot;I have already told you that your one true love is called Qeyifalia the Skyseeker in the gods&apos; tongue. You know her as Nathyrra... Is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98600">&quot;I have already told you that your one true love is called Va&apos;ardalia the Twinsouled in the gods&apos; tongue. You know her as the Lady Aribeth... Is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98601">&quot;The gods demand a sacrifice of 300,000 gold if you are to learn the True Name of your one true love... Are you willing to make that sacrifice?&quot;</string>
<string name="98602">&quot;I am sorry, Hellwalker, but the gods have written no name upon the stars that can be called your one true love. It appears that you are destined to journey through life alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="98603">&quot;Love is a hard, hard thing and its absence even harder... I am sorry, Hellwalker, but there is little I can do or say to soften the impact of the truth... Come, perhaps there is another name you wish to learn.&quot;</string>
<string name="98604">&quot;The gods do not lie...&quot;</string>
<string name="98605">&quot;Your one true love is called Cwylgarion the Strong in the gods&apos; tongue. You do not know him yet though someday you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="98606">&quot;Love is a hard, hard thing but I admit, this is not the reaction I had expected. The gods have seen fit to bless you with a true love to call your own. Why do you fight this?&quot;</string>

<string name="98609">&quot;Your one true love is called Oeskathine the Demonwrestler in the gods&apos; tongue. You know him as Valen.&quot;</string>
<string name="98610">&quot;Love is a hard, hard thing but I admit, this is not the reaction I had expected. The gods have seen fit to bless you with a true love to call your own. Why do you fight this?&quot;</string>
<string name="98611">&quot;The gods do not lie...&quot;</string>
<string name="98612">&quot;Your one true love is called Cassanduria the Beautiful in the gods&apos; tongue. You do not know her yet though someday you will.&quot;</string>

<string name="98618">&quot;Your one true love is called Va&apos;ardalia the Twinsouled in the gods&apos; tongue. You know her as the Lady Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="98619">&quot;Love is a hard, hard thing but I admit, this is not the reaction I had expected. The gods have seen fit to bless you with a true love to call your own. Why do you fight this?&quot;</string>
<string name="98620">&quot;As I warned you, knowledge has its price. You have asked to see what the gods have written upon the stars and I have told you. Now you must live with the consequences... Is there more you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98621">&quot;I am glad the truth pleases you. Not all react so warmly... Now is there another name you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="98622">&quot;The gods do not lie...&quot;</string>
<string name="98623">&quot;I have already told you that an Astral Deva known in your tongue as Lavoera is named as the Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love... Is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98624">&quot;I have already told you that I am named as the Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love... Is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98625">&quot;I have already told you that my sister, the one you know as the Knower of Names is the Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love... Is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>

<string name="98629">&quot;I have already told you that you are named as the Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love... Is there another name you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98630">&quot;The gods demand a sacrifice of 300,000 gold if you are to learn the True Name of the Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love... Are you willing to make that sacrifice?&quot;</string>
<string name="98631">&quot;The Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love is called Zyramethia the Young in the gods&apos; tongue... She is an Astral Deva who goes by the name of Lavoera among your kind.&quot;</string>
<string name="98632">&quot;The gods do not lie...&quot;</string>
<string name="98633">&quot;The Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love is called Phyreshi the Knower in the gods&apos; tongue... It is I, the one you call the Knower of Names.&quot;</string>
<string name="98634">&quot;No, Hellwalker... Out of respect for my sister, the one you call the Knower of Places, I shall not go. It would break her heart...&quot;</string>
<string name="98635">&quot;The peril of knowing the truth of things is that one must live with the consequences of that knowledge. It is something we Knowers struggle with every day of our lives...&quot;</string>
<string name="98636">&quot;That I am and that I shall always be... It is enough just to know that, a comfort and a burden all at once.&quot;</string>
<string name="98637">&quot;You have commanded me by my True Name, Hellwalker... Very well, once we are done here, I shall go the side of the one you call the Sleeping Man, that I might be his one true love...&quot;</string>
<string name="98638">&quot;But let us talk of better things... Surely there must be another name you wish to learn.&quot;</string>
<string name="98639">&quot;There are men you pursue because they are your one true love and there are men you pursue because they are not. When one is barred to you, it is only natural to seek the other...&quot;</string>
<string name="98640">&quot;The gods do not lie...&quot;</string>
<string name="98641">&quot;The Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love is called Cordemylia the Knower in the gods&apos; tongue. You know her as the Knower of Places...&quot;</string>

<string name="98649">&quot;The gods do not lie...&quot;</string>
<string name="98650">&quot;The Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love is... It is you, Hellwalker...&quot;</string>
<string name="98651">&quot;Love is a hard, hard thing but I admit, this is not the reaction I had expected. The gods have seen fit to have an angel love you with all his heart. Why do you fight this?&quot;</string>
<string name="98652">&quot;As I warned you, knowledge has its price. You have asked to see what the gods have written upon the stars and I have told you. Now you must live with the consequences... Is there more you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98653">&quot;He has waited for a very long time; A few more hours will cause no harm... Come, are there any other names you wish to know?&quot;</string>
<string name="98654">&quot;The gods do not lie...&quot;</string>
<string name="98655">&quot;I have already told you that the one you know as the Sleeping Man is called Celesfa&apos;ar the Patient in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>

<string name="98668">&quot;The gods demand a sacrifice of 200,000 gold if you are to learn the True Name of the one you know as Lady Aribeth... Are you willing to make that sacrifice?&quot;</string>
<string name="98669">&quot;The price of knowledge is always high. There are none who understand this better than I for I have paid in full... Yet some names are less costly than others. Perhaps there is another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>
<string name="98670">&quot;The one you know as the Lady Aribeth is called Va&apos;ardalia the Twinsouled in the gods&apos; tongue... Is there another you wish to learn?&quot;</string>

<string name="98689">&quot;How long is an age in an ageless place? I can give no certain figure except to say that I have been here since the False Rebellion of Baron Molikroth.&quot;</string>
<string name="98690">&quot;It was a plot to overthrow the one known as Mephistopheles as Lord of Cania, or so those who took part in it were led to believe. They followed the charismatic Baron Molikroth blindly to their doom.&quot;</string>
<string name="98691">&quot;Yes, no more talk of memories, Hellwalker. I have few left that bring me happiness.&quot;</string>
<string name="98692">&quot;I regret that it was I who started it... I loved him, Mephistopheles, and in an effort to protect him, I asked the gods to name any who might betray him. The names they gave were among his closest companions.&quot;</string>
<string name="98693">&quot;He did not believe me and so he hatched this duplicitous plot to prove me wrong. I alone knew the truth of it... Alas, the gods do not lie. In his anger, he banished me here with the rebel traitors...&quot;</string>
<string name="98694">&quot;The lower ranks were slaughtered in battle. The rebel generals, eleven in number, were banished to this icy prison by the one known as Mephistopheles.&quot;</string>
<string name="98695">&quot;The so-called Baron was none other than Mephistopheles himself. Suspicious of dissent among his generals, he staged the Rebellion that he might identify his betrayers, even among his closest friends.&quot;</string>
<string name="98696">&quot;Because that is who you are, who you have always been, who you will yet become. The gods have written it upon the stars... Your presence darkens even this dark place, Hellwalker.&quot;</string>
<string name="98697">&quot;Because that is who you are, who you have always been, who you will yet become. The gods have written it upon the stars... You are a bridge to span this dark chasm, Hellwalker.&quot;</string>
<string name="98698">&quot;Because that is who you are, who you have always been, who you will yet become. The gods have written it upon the stars... You bring light into a dark place, Hellwalker.&quot;</string>
<string name="98699">&quot;When it comes to names, there is no mistake that I can make. That is as much my gift as it is my curse...&quot;</string>
<string name="98700">&quot;The name you speak is the one you have given yourself. The name I speak is the one given you by the gods. Guard it jealously for it has cost you much.&quot;</string>
<string name="98701">&quot;I have been known as the Knower of Names among the tongues of men and the devils call me an ancient baatorian. But my True Name is spoken in the tongue of power, written upon the stars by the very gods.&quot;</string>
<string name="98702">&quot;Such names are valuable and each one has a price. By freeing me, you have paid the price for your own, thus have I spoken it to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="98703">THE REBELLIOUS &apos;KNOWER OF NAMES,&apos; BURIED BENEATH THE ICE OF CANIA&apos;S MORE REMOTE WASTES.</string>
<string name="98704">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="98705">&quot;There is another name I wish to know.&quot;</string>
<string name="98706">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="98707">&quot;The Reaper&apos;s...&quot;</string>
<string name="98708">&quot;The Puzzle Ring and the Sensei&apos;s Amulet? They may have them.&quot;</string>
<string name="98709">&quot;Mephistopheles&apos;...&quot;</string>
<string name="98710">&quot;Speak Mephistopheles&apos; True Name, Phyreshi the Knower!&quot;</string>
<string name="98711">&quot;Yes, here is the 500,000 gold the gods demand.&quot;</string>

<string name="98719">&quot;Yes, here is the 100,000 gold the gods demand.&quot;</string>
<string name="98720">&quot;My one true love&apos;s...&quot;</string>
<string name="98721">&quot;Yes, here is the 300,000 gold the gods demand.&quot;</string>
<string name="98722">&quot;No, it can&apos;t be!&quot;</string>
<string name="98723">&quot;Phew! They&apos;re more hassle than they&apos;re worth anyway.&quot;</string>
<string name="98724">&quot;No true love? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98725">&quot;No, it can&apos;t be!&quot;</string>
<string name="98726">&quot;My heart loves another.&quot;</string>
<string name="98727">&quot;I do not know him.&quot;</string>
<string name="98728">&quot;Someone I don&apos;t yet know? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98729">&quot;The Sleeping Man? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98730">&quot;No, it can&apos;t be!&quot;</string>
<string name="98731">&quot;My heart loves another.&quot;</string>
<string name="98732">&quot;I have no interest in him.&quot;</string>
<string name="98733">&quot;I barely know him.&quot;</string>
<string name="98734">&quot;Thank you, Knower. His name is music to my ears.&quot;</string>
<string name="98735">&quot;Valen? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98736">&quot;No, it can&apos;t be!&quot;</string>
<string name="98737">&quot;My heart loves another.&quot;</string>
<string name="98738">&quot;I do not know her.&quot;</string>
<string name="98739">&quot;Someone I don&apos;t yet know? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98740">&quot;No, it can&apos;t be!&quot;</string>
<string name="98741">&quot;She&apos;s the Sleeping Man&apos;s true love as well!&quot;</string>
<string name="98742">&quot;Nathyrra? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98743">&quot;No, it can&apos;t be!&quot;</string>
<string name="98744">&quot;She is soft and kind and weak!&quot;</string>
<string name="98745">&quot;Her heart is black and cruel!&quot;</string>
<string name="98746">&quot;She&apos;s dead! She&apos;s become one of the Lost!&quot;</string>
<string name="98747">&quot;She&apos;s the Sleeping Man&apos;s true love as well!&quot;</string>
<string name="98748">&quot;My heart loves another.&quot;</string>
<string name="98749">&quot;I have no interest in her.&quot;</string>
<string name="98750">&quot;I barely know her.&quot;</string>
<string name="98751">&quot;Thank you, Knower. Her name is music to my ears.&quot;</string>
<string name="98752">&quot;Aribeth? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98753">&quot;That of the Sleeping Man&apos;s one true love...&quot;</string>
<string name="98754">&quot;Yes, here is the 300,000 gold the gods demand.&quot;</string>
<string name="98755">&quot;A Deva? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98756">&quot;That&apos;s wonderful! Return with me at once so we can tell him!&quot;</string>
<string name="98757">&quot;I understand...&quot;</string>
<string name="98758">&quot;But you are his one true love!&quot;</string>
<string name="98759">&quot;Phyreshi the Knower, I command you to go to the Sleeping Man!&quot;</string>
<string name="98760">&quot;What of your love for Mephistopheles?&quot;</string>
<string name="98761">&quot;Barred to you? Return with me at once and you shall see him!&quot;</string>
<string name="98762">&quot;You? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98763">&quot;The Knower of Places? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98764">&quot;The sensei? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98765">&quot;Nathyrra? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98766">&quot;That&apos;s horrible! This can&apos;t be happening!&quot;</string>
<string name="98767">&quot;She&apos;s dead!&quot;</string>
<string name="98768">&quot;It just doesn&apos;t seem like a good fit.&quot;</string>
<string name="98769">&quot;I&apos;m the one that loves him!&quot;</string>
<string name="98770">&quot;That&apos;s wonderful! I must return to tell him!&quot;</string>
<string name="98771">&quot;Lady Aribeth? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98772">&quot;That&apos;s horrible! This can&apos;t be happening to me!&quot;</string>
<string name="98773">&quot;He&apos;s a bloody angel, for crying out loud!&quot;</string>
<string name="98774">&quot;My heart loves another.&quot;</string>
<string name="98775">&quot;I have no interest in him.&quot;</string>
<string name="98776">&quot;I barely know him.&quot;</string>
<string name="98777">&quot;That&apos;s wonderful! I must return to tell him!&quot;</string>
<string name="98778">&quot;Me? Is that true?&quot;</string>
<string name="98779">&quot;The Sleeping Man&apos;s...&quot;</string>
<string name="98780">&quot;Yes, here is the 100,000 gold the gods demand.&quot;</string>
<string name="98781">&quot;Deekin&apos;s...&quot;</string>
<string name="98782">&quot;Yes, here is the 200,000 gold the gods demand.&quot;</string>
<string name="98783">&quot;Nathyrra&apos;s...&quot;</string>

<string name="98785">&quot;Valen&apos;s...&quot;</string>
<string name="98786">&quot;Yes, here is the 200,000 gold the gods demand.&quot;</string>
<string name="98787">&quot;Aribeth&apos;s...&quot;</string>
<string name="98788">&quot;Not right now, Knower.&quot;</string>
<string name="98789">&quot;Yes, here is the 200,000 gold the gods demand.&quot;</string>
<string name="98790">&quot;Mine...&quot;</string>
<string name="98791">&quot;I must return to the City of Lost Souls. Can you get me there?&quot;</string>
<string name="98792">&quot;How long have you been imprisoned here?&quot;</string>
<string name="98793">&quot;A False Rebellion? What do you mean?&quot;</string>
<string name="98794">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="98795">&quot;And what role did you play in this False Rebellion?&quot;</string>
<string name="98796">&quot;What happened to the Rebels?&quot;</string>
<string name="98797">&quot;Who was this Baron and why did he bring them doom?&quot;</string>
<string name="98798">&quot;Why do you call me Scourge of Cania?&quot;</string>
<string name="98799">&quot;Why do you call me Judge of Cania?&quot;</string>
<string name="98800">&quot;Why do you call me Light of Cania?&quot;</string>
<string name="98801">&quot;You must be mistaken. My name is &lt;FullName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="98802">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</string>
<string name="98803">Sweat beads on Durnan&apos;s face. He calls out orders, his voice almost lost in the din of battle. He seems older than you remember him and his shoulders sag with the weight of many defeats. He turns to you, surprised.</string>
<string name="98804">&quot;Wherever you&apos;ve been, it&apos;s good to have you back, my friend. The drow threat was just a mask for an even greater horror. Our priests say the arch-devil Mephistopheles has been let loose upon the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="98805">&quot;Tamsil, my daughter, escaped by caravan to Neverwinter. Mhaere, however... I haven&apos;t seen her in days... Times are dire: the priests say the arch-devil Mephistopheles has been let loose upon the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="98806">&quot;Get in line, my friend. In hindsight, the drow encroachment on Undermountain was just a mask for an even greater horror. Somehow the arch-devil you speak of has been let loose upon the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="98807">&quot;There are some things I never understood about you but, dead or no, I must say I&apos;m relieved to see your face again. The priests say the arch-devil Mephistopheles has been let loose upon the world.&quot;</string>

<string name="98810">&quot;He will destroy us all, &lt;FirstName&gt;... All the realms will fall... Blessings upon those who die for the rest will become his slaves... Maybe there is a reason for your coming in this hour but I cannot see it.&quot;</string>
<string name="98811">&quot;You would have me order my men into the very fires of the Nine Hells! Damn you, &lt;FirstName&gt;! You haven&apos;t been here! You haven&apos;t seen what I&apos;ve seen! If you&apos;re so brave and foolish, face him yourself! I can&apos;t do it...&quot;</string>
<string name="98812">&quot;Then may the gods grant you strength. With every battle, he grows in power. We&apos;ve had reports that he&apos;s on his way here. I&apos;ll order my men to pull back when he arrives... You&apos;re our only hope, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>

<string name="99003">You see some footprints set deep in the snow. The bulk of them appear to come from some form of giant humanoid, though there are some smaller ones that you can&apos;t quite identify.</string>
<string name="99004">You spy a collection of footprints set deep in the snow. Most appear to be the oversized bootprints of a band of Frost Giants, though you also spy some smaller ones that look to belong to a family of ice trolls.</string>
<string name="99005">Though the tracks clearly mingle, they show no signs of conflict. While you doubt the two groups met for a purely social engagement, they likely had to negotiate an end to some minor dispute.</string>
<string name="99006">You stumble upon some bloodstains in the well-trampled snow, but you&apos;re not sure what to make of them.</string>
<string name="99007">You see some bloodstains in the well-trampled snow. Some of the footprints seem to be trollish in origin.</string>
<string name="99008">You spy some bloodstains in the well-trampled snow and quickly ascertain that the trolls must have sent a small raiding party to capture some of the Frost Giants&apos; hunting wolves.</string>
<string name="99009">Judging by the blood, one of the trolls must have been unable to contain its hunger, biting into one of the still-warm carcasses before returning safely home.</string>
<string name="99010">You stumble upon some chunks of ice beneath the drifting snow and wonder how they might have been formed.</string>
<string name="99011">You see a somewhat regular pattern of ice chunks rising out of the drifting snow. They almost seem to form a line of footprints but the pattern gets chaotic as it nears the unmistakable trails left by the Frost Giants. </string>
<string name="99012">An intensely hot creature, presumably some form of fire elemental, has left icy footprints where the snow that melted beneath its feet has since re-frozen.</string>
<string name="99013">Judging by the chaos of the tracks, there were more than one of them and they were able to surprise a patrolling Frost Giant and lay him low. The impression left by his fallen body is deep indeed.</string>
<string name="99014">Pools of ichor and puddles of slush are all that mark the scene of the fiendish battle you just witnessed.</string>
<string name="99015">Pools of ichor and puddles of slush mark the scene of the fiendish battle you just witnessed. The trail of blood leads through the shattered wall and to the battle that still rages beyond.</string>
<string name="99016">Pools of ichor and puddles of slush mark the scene of the fiendish battle you just witnessed. The trail of blood leads through the shattered wall and to the battle that still rages beyond.</string>
<string name="99017">Examining the trail more closely, you note that both sets of prints show signs of extensive weariness and past injury, as if the skirmish in which they were engaged had been raging for quite some time.</string>
<string name="99018">You stumble across a set of heavy footprints almost entirely obscured by the falling snow. They must be quite old, still visible only by virtue of their substantial depth and size.</string>
<string name="99019">You see a pair of tracks almost entirely obscured by the falling snow. Though the tracks are quite old, you can see that one is of a relatively average-sized humanoid and the other from a fairly large, misshapen devil.</string>
<string name="99020">You see a pair of tracks almost entirely obscured by the falling snow. The tracks are quite old but it&apos;s clear that a relatively frail human male, probably a wizard of some sort, had approached one of the nearby pits.</string>
<string name="99021">It appears that he must have performed some form of ritual that melted the ice and freed one of the prisoners, a heavyset, misshapen pit fiend.</string>
<string name="99022">A brief altercation apparently ensued, the pit fiend clearly making short work of the one who freed him. The fiend&apos;s awkward gait left its telltale trail into the battlefield.</string>
<string name="99023">Evidence of the recent battle is already being buried beneath a layer of Cania&apos;s endless snow.</string>
<string name="99024">By studying the fading tracks of the warring fiends and their countless war machines, you can almost decipher the various fronts, feints, and strategies of the recent battle.</string>
<string name="99025">You wonder if either side knew the importance of what lay beneath the featureless stretch of ice over which they fought...</string>
<string name="99026">Judging by the tracks of the warring fiends and their countless war machines, the recent battle had been waging for some time, constantly criss-crossing the battlefield as one side or the other achieved the upper hand.</string>
<string name="99027">The lesser fiends were clearly the first to die, followed shortly thereafter by an extended artillery barrage that destroyed the bulk of both sides&apos; war machines.</string>
<string name="99028">By the time you arrived, the demons had gained a slight advantage and pushed the front into new territory. The advance depleted their supplies however, forcing them to resort to throwing the ruins of what remained.</string>
<string name="99029">You wonder if either side knew the importance of what lay beneath the featureless stretch of ice over which they fought...</string>
<string name="99030">The wolf sniffs at you cautiously, ready to dart back and regroup at the first sign of sudden movement.</string>
<string name="99031">The alpha wolf nods at you and you swear you see it wink before it returns its attention to the frolicking pups.</string>
<string name="99032">The alpha wolf howls into the windswept sky and his howl tells a story...</string>
<string name="99033">There were pups here once, the lifeblood of the pack. But then came giants who destroyed the den and stole the pups away to raise as hunting dogs. If only the pups could return home, the pack would be strong again.</string>
<string name="99034">The alpha wolf stands strong and fierce before you, snarling. You can smell the fear of the other wolves.</string>
<string name="99035">Growling, the alpha wolf clamps its jaws around your neck, drawing a single bead of blood before letting go. It howls into the windswept sky and the tension of the moment fades.</string>
<string name="99036">His howl tells a story: There were pups here once, the lifeblood of the pack. But then came giants who destroyed the den and stole the pups away to raise as hunting dogs. If only the pups could return home, the pack would be strong again.</string>
<string name="99037">The wolf pup bites at your heels, eager to play.</string>
<string name="99038">Yipping excitedly, the wolf pups flee their enclosure.</string>
<string name="99039">The wolf seems happy to see you.</string>
<string name="99040">The wolf sniffs at you cautiously, ready to dart back and regroup at the first sign of sudden movement.</string>
<string name="99041">The wolf remains wary of you but seems willing to let you pass. You sense that it wants you to present yourself to the pack&apos;s alpha wolf.</string>
<string name="99042">&lt;StartAction&gt;Bare your neck to its jaws.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99043">&lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the alpha wolf.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99044">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99045">&lt;StartAction&gt;Let it sniff.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99046">&lt;StartAction&gt;Attack it.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99047">You cannot fit through the entrance to the wolf den.</string>
<string name="99048">It would not be wise to approach the wolf den in that form.</string>
<string name="99049">The gate is locked.</string>
<string name="99050">A wall of ancient crates blocks your path, bound in some strange, unknown metal. Magic swirls around the barricade, making it clear that it is not as casual as it appears.</string>
<string name="99051">There seems to be a small break in the magic, however, and some enterprising rats have managed to exploit the barrier&apos;s weakness and chew a hole through to the other side.</string>
<string name="99052">Something glints in the darkness beyond. Gold? Rat&apos;s eyes? A hidden foe? The gloom makes it too hard to tell.</string>
<string name="99053">Flying doesn&apos;t seem like an option anymore, as you are definitely too large to fit through the hole in your current form.</string>
<string name="99054">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99055">&lt;StartAction&gt;Peek through the hole.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99056">&lt;StartAction&gt;Fly through the hole.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99057">You&apos;ve socketed both ears into the previously earless statue. To your surprise, the gargoyle&apos;s mouth has opened, revealing a small switch.</string>
<string name="99058">You hear the sounds of three distinct gongs rung in order. Their ringing reverberates through the entire chamber.</string>
<string name="99059">You&apos;ve socketed one of the ears into the statue, but the second hole remains empty.</string>
<string name="99060">On close inspection, you notice that this statue was carved without ears. Instead, small, neatly carved holes mark where they should be, as if they were designed to be socketed in separately.</string>
<string name="99061">&lt;StartAction&gt;Press the switch.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99062">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place the other ear into the remaining hole.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99063">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99064">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place both ears into the holes.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99065">&lt;StartAction&gt;Place an ear into one of the holes.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99066">The crystal at the center of the Sensei&apos;s Amulet sparkles and glints, as if hungry for light. There is something strange about the refractions but you&apos;re not quite sure what it is.</string>
<string name="99067">The Sensei&apos;s Amulet holds more power within it than you initially believed. At certain angles, its crystalline center catches the light, briefly shifting your form. Little by little, you feel you are mastering these newfound powers.</string>
<string name="99068">Battered, weary, and surprised, you clasp the Sensei&apos;s Amulet in your hands. The light is brighter out here beyond the city&apos;s grime and somehow it seems tied to your recent unexpected transformations.</string>
<string name="99069">Each time you shifted form, you swear you saw a flash of light glint off the crystal at the amulet&apos;s heart. Cautious, you decide to experiment further.</string>
<string name="99070">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put the amulet away.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99071">&lt;StartAction&gt;Shift into Wolf form.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99072">&lt;StartAction&gt;Catch the light along the crystal&apos;s length.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99073">&lt;StartAction&gt;Shift into Earth Elemental form.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99074">&lt;StartAction&gt;Catch the light along the crystal&apos;s width.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99075">&lt;StartAction&gt;Shift into Pixie form.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99076">&lt;StartAction&gt;Catch the light along the crystal&apos;s height.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99077">&lt;StartAction&gt;Put the amulet away.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99078">&lt;StartAction&gt;Catch the light along the crystal&apos;s length.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99079">&lt;StartAction&gt;Catch the light along the crystal&apos;s width.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99080">&lt;StartAction&gt;Catch the light along the crystal&apos;s height.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99081">The rat blinks at you, twitching his nose before returning his attention to sniffing at the floor before him.</string>
<string name="99082">The rat stares up at you with eyes that seem as old as these caves. Reflected in their darkened pools, you see a series of images flashing by in rapid succession.</string>
<string name="99083">You see bones and rotting flesh, glittering objects of desire and, above all, the constant struggle to survive.</string>
<string name="99084">A warm feeling of gratitude emanates from the rat. You get the distinct impression that it wants you to see its prized nest, but you aren&apos;t sure how you could fit through the hole it&apos;s chewed.</string>
<string name="99085">It squeaks in fear and runs away.</string>
<string name="99086">The rat seems very possessive of the treasure it has gathered over the course of its long life. You get the sense that it is stashed away in a safe place where only a rat could go or fit.</string>
<string name="99087">The rotting flesh and bones bring a sense of comfort, a sense of home. The rat seems to be using the decay from these caves to form its nest.</string>
<string name="99088">&lt;StartAction&gt;Leave.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99089">&lt;StartAction&gt;Feed the rat some seeds.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99090">&lt;StartAction&gt;Attack the rat.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99091">&lt;StartAction&gt;Focus on the images of the glittering objects.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99092">&lt;StartAction&gt;Focus on the images of death and decay.&lt;/Start&gt;</string>
<string name="99093">The rat blinks at you, twitching his nose before returning to gnaw on the ankle of the corpse before him.</string>
<string name="99094">[EVIL] &quot;Out of my way.&quot;</string>
<string name="99095">---------- Random Pop-Ups Start Here ------------</string>
<string name="99096">&quot;But our journey isn&apos;t yet done. Are you sure?&quot;</string>
<string name="99097">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. May Tyr guide our steps into the future, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="99098">&quot;Here? Very well, but hurry back as soon as you are able, as I will miss your warmth and company.&quot;</string>
<string name="99099">&quot;I... I&apos;m sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, it was not my intention to offend... I suppose I will return to the Gatehouse and pray for your quick and safe return.&quot;</string>
<string name="99100">&quot;Yes, what do you feel would be more suitable?&quot;</string>
<string name="99101">&quot;Very well. I will try to take the changes we have made to heart.&quot;</string>
<string name="99102">&quot;Very well. I will refrain from my castings and trust to my blade instead.&quot;</string>
<string name="99103">&quot;Thank you. I will cast as I see fit, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="99104">&quot;I will refrain where I can, though I admit it goes against my calling as a paladin.&quot;</string>
<string name="99105">&quot;Of course. It is my duty as a paladin to keep us all in good health.&quot;</string>
<string name="99106">&quot;That is for the best. I&apos;m liable to break a nail.&quot;</string>
<string name="99107">&quot;I will do what I can, though the infernal things are often beyond my ken.&quot;</string>
<string name="99108">&quot;Good. I&apos;m afraid this armor doesn&apos;t leave me soft of foot.&quot;</string>
<string name="99109">&quot;I will attack from the shadows when I can, though I must admit I prefer to keep my battles more straightforward.&quot;</string>
<string name="99110">&quot;I will do what I can to remain quiet and out of sight.&quot;</string>
<string name="99111">&quot;I will leave you to it, then, and not interfere.&quot;</string>
<string name="99112">&quot;I will do what I am able should a lock be encountered.&quot;</string>
<string name="99113">&quot;Of course. How far do you feel is suitable?&quot;</string>
<string name="99114">&quot;I shall attempt to follow you at that distance, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="99115">&quot;With Tyr&apos;s might, I shall drive back our enemies!&quot;</string>
<string name="99116">&quot;By Tyr&apos;s might, I will shield you as long as I am able.&quot;</string>
<string name="99117">&quot;Have you any other tactical issues you wish to discuss?&quot;</string>
<string name="99118">&quot;Very well but I&apos;ll not let you have my armor.&quot;</string>
<string name="99119">&quot;I can try. Let me sort through your pack and see what you have.&quot;</string>
<string name="99120">&quot;I have several... which do you want me to use?&quot;</string>
<string name="99121">&quot;In Tyr&apos;s name.&quot;</string>
<string name="99122">&quot;In Tyr&apos;s name.&quot;</string>
<string name="99123">&quot;Of course. Would you prefer benefits that last over the longer term or only for the immediate future?&quot;</string>
<string name="99124">&quot;Of course. What spell should I cast for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="99125">&quot;Are you certain that is the spell you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="99126">&quot;As you wish. Who would you like me to cast it on?&quot;</string>
<string name="99127">&quot;Is there anything else I can do to help?&quot;</string>
<string name="99128">&quot;At once.&quot;</string>
<string name="99129">&quot;Yes, I could use a break. It&apos;s always pleasant to sit and chat awhile.&quot;</string>
<string name="99130">&quot;Is there anything more I can do for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="99131">&quot;I&apos;ve been wondering why I don&apos;t try to run away from myself when I attempt to Turn Undead...&quot;</string>
<string name="99132">&quot;Is there anything more you&apos;d like to chat about?&quot;</string>
<string name="99133">&quot;A little cold but I&apos;ve been colder, haven&apos;t I...&quot;</string>
<string name="99134">&quot;I&apos;m doing fine. Let&apos;s keep moving.&quot;</string>
<string name="99135">&quot;My complexion&apos;s a little pale, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="99136">&quot;I&apos;m doing all right. It&apos;s you I&apos;m worried about.&quot;</string>
<string name="99137">&quot;No storm can stir my inmost calm.&quot;</string>
<string name="99138">&quot;Healthy and hale.&quot;</string>
<string name="99139">&quot;Not bad for a paladin in hell, wouldn&apos;t you agree?&quot;</string>
<string name="99140">&quot;I am well enough. And you?&quot;</string>
<string name="99141">&quot;Something blinds me. I can see nothing of this world or the next.&quot;</string>
<string name="99142">&quot;I am not at my best but my form holds together well enough. I vote we continue on.&quot;</string>
<string name="99143">&quot;Can you not see how much I fade? I have been worse but a chance to rest and restore my form would be appreciated.&quot;</string>
<string name="99144">&quot;I have all but faded. If we do not rest soon, I may disappear altogether.&quot;</string>
<string name="99145">&quot;There is a venom in me, a fearful poison.&quot;</string>
<string name="99146">&quot;I feel ill, as if a sickness courses through my ghostly veins.&quot;</string>
<string name="99147">[POST-MIMIC] &quot;I&apos;ve put some thought into it, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and I still feel drawn to Neverwinter. There is a time when I would have sought to haunt the place but perhaps I can be its protector, its guide, somehow.&quot;</string>
<string name="99148">&quot;Yes, the future will come in its own time. Dwelling on it now will only slow its coming.&quot;</string>
<string name="99149">&quot;It has been on my mind for some time. I only hope my presence there can bring peace to my old home.&quot;</string>
<string name="99150">&quot;&lt;FirstName&gt;? It is not for you to allow or disallow... If it is an end you do not want for me, then you should have left me in the ice and never urged me to take up the mantle of my fallen paladinhood.&quot;</string>
<string name="99151">&quot;We are in search of the Reaper&apos;s True Name, are we not? Should we succeed, suddenly all things become possible...&quot;</string>
<string name="99152">&quot;It&apos;s my penance, I think. I must serve that which I betrayed in life. But it&apos;s more than that, too. I want to walk its streets once more in summer, to hear the singing in the temple... It would be a pleasant end for me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99153">[PRE-MIMIC] &quot;Why I can&apos;t say I know... Not so long ago, I didn&apos;t feel I had a future left to ponder. Let me think on it a while.&quot;</string>
<string name="99154">&quot;Death does something to your thoughts. They become thick and woolen. Your memories cloud over for a while... Suddenly I had doubts and I no longer knew how I felt about my crimes...&quot;</string>
<string name="99155">&quot;I was scared of hell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. And when Mephistopheles came, he played my confusion like a toy... It wasn&apos;t until you came that I realized hell can pose no threat to that which is still good in me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99156">&quot;Of course. What is it you wish to ask?&quot;</string>
<string name="99157">&quot;Not if we persevere, no. Our quest is righteous and the gods will see us through, I have no doubt.&quot;</string>
<string name="99158">&quot;And I&apos;m happy that you did. You&apos;ve set me back upon the path of righteousness and I shall not forget it, you have my word.&quot;</string>
<string name="99159">&quot;Nonsense. You saw my distress and came to my aid. Despite all your gruff demeanor, I can still see the goodness you keep buried deep. It&apos;s that goodness that helped me find my own again.&quot;</string>
<string name="99160">&quot;I have heard that when warriors lose a limb in battle, sometimes they can still feel it. It is as if the limb exists but by virtue of their imagination alone. That is how it is but for all of me, every part...&quot;</string>
<string name="99161">&quot;The world seems dimmer through my eyes, the sounds less full, the tastes less rich. Everything is at it was in life, though I experience it as if through cotton batting...&quot;</string>
<string name="99162">&quot;Yes, there is only so much I can tell of this afterlife that will make sense to you.&quot;</string>
<string name="99163">&quot;I had no idea what to expect, to be honest. I had studied the hells in my training but it is one thing to read of Cania&apos;s frozen wastes and quite another to find myself almost a part of them...&quot;</string>
<string name="99164">&quot;Horrible? I admit I lived a fervent life so perhaps I miss the vibrancy of life more than most. But hell, I&apos;m sure, has greater horrors yet in store for me...&quot;</string>
<string name="99165">&quot;That it could be. If this is all the punishment hell has in store for me, I would be surprised. Though maybe you have already saved me from the worst of it, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="99166">[POST-MIMIC] &quot;I... This is so hard to talk about, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I betrayed the ones I loved, I failed them so utterly. I led an army of evil to the city&apos;s gates and marched them in to occupy and slaughter...&quot;</string>
<string name="99167">&quot;Yes, all this talk of Neverwinter drains me. I still find it hard to put to words.&quot;</string>
<string name="99168">&quot;I died on Neverwinter soil. At least I have that much to console me... One kind thing to come of all the destruction that I wrought. When the end came, it was almost merciful, as much as a violent death can be.&quot;</string>
<string name="99169">&quot;I guess Cania is where the gods put a soul like mine. Or maybe it was my soul that sought it out. In the end, the snow seems rather fitting, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="99170">&quot;Yes, they did. I only wish they could have done it sooner before I&apos;d damned myself so fully. To their credit, they took me by surprise. I had always thought I would outlive the war.&quot;</string>
<string name="99171">&quot;Why indeed... I ask myself that a lot. I think, at the heart of it, I was convinced that I was right and all the was wrong around me. Oh, they did some bad things, made some mistakes but...&quot;</string>
<string name="99172">&quot;If the citizens of Neverwinter could not be perfect, I considered their failings a hypocrisy. Sometimes failings are just that: failings, nothing more. I was so self-righteous, I couldn&apos;t see the difference.&quot;</string>
<string name="99173">&quot;Pirates from Luskan, orc tribes, sellswords, ancient magical orders... I twisted them all around my finger and made them serve me. If only I could have done so for a more noble cause...&quot;</string>
<string name="99174">&quot;I received my powers from a crone named Morag, the last Empress of her ancient race... But in the end it was myself I served. It would be a lie to suggest otherwise.&quot;</string>
<string name="99175">&quot;Oh I grew up there! I ran as a child through its streets, I knew every nook and cranny, every weakness, every strength... If only I could have been ignorant of it all. Ignorance is bliss, they say...&quot;</string>
<string name="99176">&quot;If I had been been born a simpleton, my betrayal would have meant nothing! I was too smart for my own good, &lt;FirstName&gt;... With an artist&apos;s eye, I knew to destroy something of great beauty...&quot;</string>
<string name="99177">[PRE-MIMIC] &quot;I... I&apos;m still trying to figure that out, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m ready to talk about it yet. Maybe we can talk about again sometime in the future...&quot;</string>
<string name="99178">&quot;Funny, I&apos;d been thinking the same thing...&quot;</string>
<string name="99179">&quot;Has anyone ever told you how passive aggressive you are?&quot;</string>
<string name="99180">&quot;Here? Fine, but make it quick.&quot;</string>
<string name="99181">&quot;Gladly! You can come crawling back to me at the Gatehouse when you run into trouble.&quot;</string>
<string name="99182">&quot;Why? I have no need of change. You are the one making all the mistakes!&quot;</string>
<string name="99183">&quot;Good. At least there are some things you chose not to meddle with...&quot;</string>
<string name="99184">&quot;As you wish. My blade grows hungry for the blood of innocents.&quot;</string>
<string name="99185">&quot;What now? Is dark magic back in vogue?&quot;</string>
<string name="99186">&quot;Yes, let them suffer...&quot;</string>
<string name="99187">&quot;Oh really... Maybe I will, maybe I won&apos;t...&quot;</string>
<string name="99188">&quot;Have it your way.&quot;</string>
<string name="99189">&quot;Consider it done. Though if I choose to leave one for you, consider it a present.&quot;</string>
<string name="99190">&quot;What a shame. I was just starting to enjoy myself.&quot;</string>
<string name="99191">&quot;I will strike form the darkness.&quot;</string>
<string name="99192">&quot;To the shadows it is.&quot;</string>
<string name="99193">&quot;If you want my opinion, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you&apos;re beyond help.&quot;</string>
<string name="99194">&quot;Fine but I will be mocking you under my breath every time I do so.&quot;</string>
<string name="99195">&quot;Oh, so that&apos;s how it is, is it?&quot;</string>
<string name="99196">&quot;Very well, I will try to keep to your foolish distance though I don&apos;t see how much it will truly help once the blood starts flowing.&quot;</string>
<string name="99197">&quot;It would be my pleasure.&quot;</string>
<string name="99198">&quot;Very well, we shall play it safe though he who risks nothing dies a fool.&quot;</string>
<string name="99199">&quot;Have you other &apos;changes&apos; you insist on making?&quot;</string>
<string name="99200">&quot;Fine, but the armor stays.&quot;</string>
<string name="99201">&quot;It would be my pleasure...&quot;</string>
<string name="99202">&quot;Ha! For how long would you like my powers to last?&quot;</string>
<string name="99203">&quot;What is it now?&quot;</string>
<string name="99204">&quot;Are you sure? I would hate for there to be any... slip-ups...&quot;</string>
<string name="99205">&quot;Who will suffer?&quot;</string>
<string name="99206">&quot;What else would you have me do, then?&quot;</string>
<string name="99207">&quot;Consider it done.&quot;</string>
<string name="99208">&quot;Of course...&quot;</string>
<string name="99209">&quot;Good, I was just starting to get bored with you.&quot;</string>
<string name="99210">&quot;All hell for a basement, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Don&apos;t worry about me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99211">[ANYTHING ELSE?]</string>
<string name="99212">&quot;Curiosity killed the cat, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Don&apos;t push your luck.&quot;</string>
<string name="99213">&quot;Just pondering the evil I could sow, that is all.&quot;</string>
<string name="99214">&quot;I grow in power every day.&quot;</string>
<string name="99215">&quot;I&apos;ll be fine.&quot;</string>
<string name="99216">&quot;Like I could tear the head off a puppy, why?&quot;</string>
<string name="99217">&quot;Like I could haunt an entire continent. Let&apos;s keep moving.&quot;</string>
<string name="99218">&quot;None of your business, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I have no need of your concern.&quot;</string>
<string name="99219">&quot;Evil, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Decidedly evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="99220">&quot;I am blinded. I cannot see a thing, be it in this world or the next!&quot;</string>
<string name="99221">&quot;I am not at the height of my powers but I am not far from them, either. I suggest we carry on.&quot;</string>
<string name="99222">&quot;I am fading, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can hold my form for some time yet but a chance to rest and restore my powers would be appreciated.&quot;</string>
<string name="99223">&quot;I am fading very fast. I fear it will not be much longer before you cannot even see me at all.&quot;</string>
<string name="99224">&quot;A poison courses through me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99225">&quot;I feel sickly, as if some disease wastes away at me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99226">[POST-MIMIC] &quot;I have decided that I am not yet done with Neverwinter. Don&apos;t you think the temple there could use a malevolent spirit? Or if holy ground proves troublesome, what of the castle there?&quot;</string>
<string name="99227">&quot;If it amuses you, though I must admit you are taking an uncanny interest in my affairs.&quot;</string>
<string name="99228">&quot;It has been on my mind for some time. I dare say, it sounds like a hell of a good time, wouldn&apos;t you agree...?&quot;</string>
<string name="99229">&quot;And I&apos;ll never ask permission... I am sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but you have set me on a course and I will not be dissuaded. Neverwinter will fall and I will fashion my throne amidst its haunted ruins.&quot;</string>
<string name="99230">&quot;We are in search of the Reaper&apos;s True Name, are we not? Should we succeed, suddenly all things become possible...&quot;</string>
<string name="99231">&quot;To disturb its graveyards, despoil its grounds, and drive its citizens before me like rats. When I am done, not a single living soul will dare call that city home!&quot;</string>
<string name="99232">[PRE-MIMIC] &quot;I can&apos;t say I&apos;m entirely sure yet. It seems not so long ago I had decided to surrender my ambitions altogether. But you&apos;re right, my malevolence is not yet spent.&quot;</string>
<string name="99233">&quot;I will ponder your question for a while. Perhaps I will have a better answer for you later.&quot;</string>
<string name="99234">&quot;Death does something to your thoughts. They become thick and woolen. Your memories cloud over for a while... Suddenly I had doubts, feelings of guilt over what I had done...&quot;</string>
<string name="99235">&quot;I was scared of hell, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I was raised by the church, remember? And Mephistopheles played my sorrows like a toy... It wasn&apos;t until you came that I realized that hell is not to be feared but embraced!&quot;</string>
<string name="99236">&quot;Of course. Mephistopheles is busy ravaging Toril and you feel like playing Twenty Questions... I don&apos;t have any problems with that if you don&apos;t.&quot;</string>
<string name="99237">&quot;How very noble of you... I haven&apos;t decided if I&apos;m grateful to you or not. Perhaps I&apos;ll kill you some day and paw through your entrails to help me arrive at a decision.&quot;</string>
<string name="99238">&quot;How very funny. I don&apos;t recall thanking you. In fact, some day I may choose to kill you for it. But who&apos;s to say? You might make a fine minion...&quot;</string>
<string name="99239">&quot;You have unchained a great evil in me and what is more you never bound me to your cause. In time, you may come to regret that. Perhaps you already do... More&apos;s the pity.&quot;</string>
<string name="99240">&quot;I have heard that when warriors lose a limb in battle, sometimes they can still feel it. It is as if the limb exists but by virtue of their imagination alone. That is how it is but for all of me, every part...&quot;</string>
<string name="99241">&quot;I am because I believe myself to be. Maybe all of this is but the dreaming of a fetid corpse. For all I know, &lt;FirstName&gt;, you are but a maggot gnawing at my eye.&quot;</string>
<string name="99242">&quot;Feel the sudden need to change the subject, do you? That&apos;s a sign of weakness. Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll forgive it but I won&apos;t forget...&quot;</string>
<string name="99243">&quot;That would explain a lot, wouldn&apos;t it...&quot;</string>
<string name="99244">&quot;No, it&apos;s vile. There&apos;s a difference... Besides, I would think that you would take at least some responsibility for my words. You were, after all, the one to play the devil&apos;s advocate, as it were.&quot;</string>
<string name="99245">&quot;It has its moments. You should try it sometime... Regardless, as far as maggots go, you&apos;re not half-bad. It certainly beats contemplating one&apos;s destiny alone.&quot;</string>
<string name="99246">[POST-MIMIC] &quot;I brought it to its knees, &lt;FirstName&gt;! I cut a swath down the Sword Coast and led an army to its gates! I gave it a nightmare that it may wake from but it will never forget!&quot;</string>
<string name="99247">&quot;They say that curiosity killed the cat, &lt;FirstName&gt;. But go ahead. Proceed. Let&apos;s see how far you get before I grow weary of you...&quot;</string>
<string name="99248">&quot;I died on Neverwinter&apos;s frozen soil and cursed it with my blood. That was my victory, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Even they could not take that from me in the end.&quot;</string>
<string name="99249">&quot;I guess Cania is where the gods put a soul like mine. Or maybe it was my soul that sought it out. In the end, the snow seems rather fitting, don&apos;t you think?&quot;</string>
<string name="99250">&quot;I may be dead but do I look defeated? Thanks to you, my vengeance has just begun... I broke their spirit. I held a mirror to their shame. I taught them how to loathe themselves and I am not done yet...&quot;</string>
<string name="99251">&quot;My Lord Nasher demanded justice so I delivered it to him in spades! I may not have loved Fenthick, the fool I was to marry, but nor did he deserve a callous execution!&quot;</string>
<string name="99252">&quot;He loved me and I saw no cause to disagree. He was a sheep among wolves and I took pity on him, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="99253">&quot;Long before humans ever set foot in the North, long before even the elves, it was the seat of a great empire. Time erased that empire but the one who ruled it lingered on.&quot;</string>
<string name="99254">&quot;Her name was Morag and I could see no justice more appropriate than restoring Neverwinter to its rightful owner. The tribes, the pirate clans, the ancient orders, the sellswords, I led them all to war.&quot;</string>
<string name="99255">&quot;And even then they groveled before me, bending and scraping, saying their foolish prayers. I was their paladin and they thought that would make me blind to their hypocrisy... Oh no, I saw it all...&quot;</string>
<string name="99256">&quot;The injustice of their law, the tyranny of their lord, the futility of their faith, the corruption of their guards. Everywhere I looked, there were lies. If ever there was a city that deserved its fate...&quot;</string>
<string name="99257">[PRE-MIMIC] &quot;Ha! Don&apos;t be so presumptuous, &lt;FirstName&gt;... I hardly know you. I transformed, all right? I touched my destiny! It&apos;s a story you&apos;re not ready to hear... Come back when you&apos;ve earned it.&quot;</string>
<string name="99258">&quot;I teach, I instruct, I aid... but I do not lecture, &lt;FirstName&gt;, mark my words...&quot;</string>
<string name="99259">&quot;Perhaps it is different in some worlds than it is in ours but here, hell seems but another stop along the lengthy pilgrimage of the soul; a black bead along a string of pearls.&quot;</string>
<string name="99260">&quot;Death is a beginning, not an end. Life is but a fraction of our existence, a simple tutorial preparing us for the many lives beyond. Heaven and hell are a continuum but even they can&apos;t encompass all that is.&quot;</string>
<string name="99261">&quot;Whatever hell can throw my way, I deserve... But the burden has been light thus far. Almost too light. I can&apos;t help but think that something more dire yet awaits me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99262">&quot;According to my temple training, the outer planes are divinely morphic: He who rules the plane can also shape it. All this ice and lava is here because Mephistopheles wants it here.&quot;</string>
<string name="99263">&quot;I wonder what will happen now that he&apos;s gone...&quot;</string>
<string name="99264">&quot;Yes? We are still discussing the nature of hell, are we not?&quot;</string>
<string name="99265">&quot;It&apos;s precisely hell&apos;s arbitrary nature that makes it so horrible, don&apos;t you see? If the ice and lave had a logical reason for their existence, then they would lose their power over our minds.&quot;</string>
<string name="99266">&quot;I&apos;m not so sure. I think he&apos;s abandoned Cania. What worries me is that I suspect he hopes to make Toril his throne now.&quot;</string>
<string name="99267">&quot;He doesn&apos;t need it anymore. He who rules the deepest hell of Baator rules them all! Asmodeus rules the Ninth but our friend is hoping to make Toril the Tenth and thereby seize the prize.&quot;</string>
<string name="99268">&quot;Yes, in Neverwinter, remember? One isn&apos;t just born a paladin. There is quite a lot of esoteric study involved. It just never occurred to me that I&apos;d get this much first-hand experience with hell...&quot;</string>
<string name="99269">&quot;Yes, I toil over them within my heart, fashioning them into the shapes of countless sorrows...&quot;</string>
<string name="99270">&quot;That is why I dare not forget, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I was a fool there, too, and some of their folly lies on my shoulders. I must believe that folly can be forgiven for otherwise despair shall be the only destiny I ever know.&quot;</string>
<string name="99271">&quot;I keep thinking of Lord Nasher as he stood before the mob to announce that both Fenthick and Desther were to be hung... I know now that it was fear I saw in him...&quot;</string>
<string name="99272">&quot;No, not happy ones at all... I keep thinking of Lord Nasher as he stood before the mob to announce that both Fenthick and Desther were to be hung. I know now that it was fear I saw in him...&quot;</string>
<string name="99273">&quot;Don&apos;t you see? The mob in the streets, in their plague-struck squalor, held more power than a lord sitting in comfort on his throne! He ruled them but even so, he feared them. The plague was but a tool.&quot;</string>
<string name="99274">&quot;All Desther wanted was an angry mob, a weakened lord, and a paladin to lose her faith. We all played into his hand and that was why he grinned even as we burned him at the stake. Evil is insidious...&quot;</string>
<string name="99275">&quot;Lord Nasher insisted that, as paladin of Tyr, I be the one to declare their guilt but I refused. He was old, still sick, and didn&apos;t want to face the crowds waiting outside the temple doors.&quot;</string>
<string name="99276">&quot;But I made him do it and in that moment I could tell that I was on a darkening course. And when Desther fell and his neck snapped and his feet dangled... the darkness consumed me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99277">&quot;Desther claimed to be a Tyrist come from afar to serve the church but instead he spread disease with every blessing. Fenthick refused to see it and how could I doubt the man I told myself I loved...&quot;</string>
<string name="99278">&quot;They were both weak men in their own way. I should have spoken up. There should have been something I could say... Instead I left them to Lord Nasher and the mob.&quot;</string>
<string name="99279">--------- Random Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="99280">&quot;Power is a siren&apos;s song, &lt;FirstName&gt;, and responsibility a leaden weight. I pray I do not see you topple by it... Every True Name you learn is someone&apos;s fate within your hands. Be careful what you seek.&quot;</string>
<string name="99281">&quot;Power is a siren&apos;s song, &lt;FirstName&gt;. When faced with the option, how do you know you will not pick another? ...Every True Name you learn is someone&apos;s fate within your hands. Be careful what you seek.&quot;</string>
<string name="99282">&quot;Power is a siren&apos;s song, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It corrupts good and evil in equal measure. Every True Name you learn is someone&apos;s fate within your hands... Just be careful of what you seek.&quot;</string>
<string name="99283">&quot;No. Power is a siren&apos;s song, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Once she&apos;s freed, you may not hear my warning. Listen to me now... Every True Name you learn is someone&apos;s fate within your hands. Be careful what you seek.&quot;</string>
<string name="99284">&quot;That may be so but it does not dissuade me from fearing the contrary. But I have said my piece. Go free the poor woman and do what you will do.&quot;</string>
<string name="99285">&quot;Yes, a little. I would be a fool to surrender my destiny so lightly... But it is for the sake of all the others that I warn you. Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, heed my words and do not damn yourself in your pursuit of power.&quot;</string>
<string name="99286">&quot;Thank you. You know I would not caution you lightly.&quot;</string>
<string name="99287">&quot;It&apos;s in the Neverwinter Wood, northeast of the city. Fenthick first kissed me there and we carved our initials in the tree... I was so foolish, then. Innocent, I guess...&quot;</string>
<string name="99288">&quot;Then, yes, there was a time... But after they hung him, I fled to that tree and cried like all my future was torn to shreds. I just couldn&apos;t be a paladin anymore, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I just couldn&apos;t see the justice...&quot;</string>
<string name="99289">&quot;No, I knew it even then. I didn&apos;t love him but it felt so good just to be loved... After they hung him, I fled to that tree and cried like my heart was broken. I couldn&apos;t be a paladin anymore, couldn&apos;t see the justice...&quot;</string>
<string name="99290">&quot;And I died young, too, and so did he. After they hung him I fled into the woods and found that tree and curled between its roots... I couldn&apos;t be a paladin anymore. I just couldn&apos;t see the justice in it...&quot;</string>
<string name="99291">&quot;What I couldn&apos;t bring myself to understand was that it wasn&apos;t justice for him, it was justice for me... If only I wouldn&apos;t have been so blind, perhaps there wouldn&apos;t have been so much horror in the world...&quot;</string>
<string name="99292">&quot;Go. Talk to this Knower of Places and learn from her what you can. After that, let us be done with this place. It holds too many memories of my wrongs.&quot;</string>
<string name="99293">&quot;It&apos;s not from here. I don&apos;t think any of these places are. I don&apos;t even think we&apos;re in Cania anymore, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="99294">&quot;But how could she know about that tree?&quot;</string>
<string name="99295">&quot;But that tree...&quot;</string>
<string name="99296">&quot;No, it had my initials in it... and a heart... I&apos;m telling you, I know that tree!&quot;</string>
<string name="99297">&quot;That one that flew by, just as we entered!&quot;</string>
<string name="99298">[MALE] &quot;Well I was thinking of something a little more pleasurable...&quot;</string>
<string name="99299">&quot;Yes, it&apos;s a mimic, isn&apos;t it? But did you see how it grappled away like that? I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever heard of anything quite like it before... Come, let&apos;s get your clothes back. Your teeth are beginning to rattle.&quot;</string>
<string name="99300">[MALE] &quot;Are you flirting with me?&quot;</string>
<string name="99301">[MALE] &quot;Cold down where, exactly...?&quot;</string>
<string name="99302">&quot;Whew! I&apos;m so sorry, &lt;FirstName&gt;. It&apos;s just... It feels good to laugh again. I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s been awhile... Now let&apos;s get those clothes back for you; I can hear your teeth rattling.&quot;</string>
<string name="99303">[MALE] &quot;Take no insult. If I laugh, it is because you have more than exceeded my expectations, &lt;FirstName&gt;.&quot;</string>
<string name="99304">&quot;I might be... This may come as a bit of a surprise but we paladins have been known to fall in love and marry on occasion...&quot;</string>
<string name="99305">&quot;I&apos;m a paladin, not a prude. This may come as a bit of a surprise but we&apos;ve been known to fall in love and marry on occasion...&quot;</string>
<string name="99306">&quot;No? Then let us remember that for the future, &lt;FirstName&gt;... But right now we need to get your clothes back. I can hear your teeth rattling.&quot;</string>
<string name="99307">&quot;Yes, love... Is the word so frightening?&quot;</string>
<string name="99308">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean for you to feel uncomfortable... Let&apos;s go get your clothes back. I can hear your teeth rattling.&quot;</string>
<string name="99309">&quot;There is more to love than flesh alone, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Forget I even mentioned it...&quot;</string>
<string name="99310">&quot;I do too... But let&apos;s get your clothes back, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I can hear your teeth rattling.&quot;</string>
<string name="99311">&quot;Oh don&apos;t be such a child! I wasn&apos;t speaking of you anyway... I was speaking of Fenthick... Forget I even mentioned it...&quot;</string>
<string name="99312">&quot;To the dead, perhaps all things taste of life. I don&apos;t know, &lt;FirstName&gt;, maybe dust and time are my life now. The spirit grows old, I think, even after the body&apos;s gone...&quot;</string>
<string name="99313">&quot;I don&apos;t understand you! You&apos;re all full of support and encouragement one minute, then spite and vitriol in the next... Well I made my decision and, unlike you, I intend to stick with it.&quot;</string>
<string name="99314">&quot;So go do what you must with the Sleeping Man. The sooner it&apos;s done, the sooner you can go home.&quot;</string>
<string name="99315">&quot;And I didn&apos;t mean to be so maudlin. It seems like everything is moving so fast, that&apos;s all. Becoming a paladin again takes a little getting used to. I thought some of these emotions were gone forever...&quot;</string>
<string name="99316">&quot;But we came here to see the Sleeping Man. Come, let&apos;s do what we set out to do here...&quot;</string>
<string name="99317">&quot;And a sadness, too. Happiness because his love is coming to him, sadness because she is not yet here. That&apos;s how hope works, I think... The two mingle.&quot;</string>
<string name="99318">&quot;Fair enough. The sooner you learn the Gatekeeper&apos;s True Name, the sooner you can return home.&quot;</string>
<string name="99319">&quot;It&apos;s good to be happy. I wasn&apos;t sure if I ever would be again. And to think that there was a time I took it for granted, &lt;FirstName&gt;... At any rate, let&apos;s do what we came here to do, yes?&quot;</string>
<string name="99320">&quot;Some ghosts haunt and some are haunted. I guess I&apos;m one of the latter. But yes, thanks to you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, I guess I&apos;m hopeful... Now let&apos;s do what we came here to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="99321">&quot;How can you not feel it? Do you not even have an ounce of joy in you? An ounce of hope?&quot;</string>
<string name="99322">&quot;We all do, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Even me, and I&apos;ve got a lot more reasons never to go back than most. Maybe that&apos;s why we have to do it... Come, let&apos;s do what we came here to do and see where it leads us.&quot;</string>
<string name="99323">&quot;You&apos;re an impossible old grump, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but I suppose I owe you that much. I suppose I didn&apos;t have much hope a while ago either, did I... Come, let&apos;s do what we came here to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="99324">&quot;No, &lt;FirstName&gt;, don&apos;t you see? Hope sustains us! How long has the Sleeping Man been here, an angel in the very depths of hell, yet he lies here unmolested, even venerated.&quot;</string>
<string name="99325">&quot;He&apos;s here just as much as you are. And I am, too. Joy is about being able to find good even in bad situations. Hope is about trusting that bad situations will someday get better.&quot;</string>
<string name="99326">&quot;If you insist, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Do what you will.&quot;</string>
<string name="99327">&quot;Well... a lot, actually. But we can start with a little, I suppose... Now let&apos;s go do what we came here for.&quot;</string>
<string name="99328">&quot;I&apos;m not lecturing... It&apos;s just hard to see you so unhappy, that&apos;s all. I&apos;m just trying to help... Oh never mind, let&apos;s do what we came here for, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="99329">&quot;It is not vengeance that I seek, &lt;FirstName&gt;... All I ask for is a little hope. That a world that has seen a great evil can also see great good... And that a heart can say the same...&quot;</string>
<string name="99330">&quot;I suppose we have no time for delay... A great evil lurks in our home world, Toril. We must shine heaven&apos;s light upon it and sap away its power. Come, let us make our peace with the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="99331">&quot;No... Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, do not do this...&quot;</string>
<string name="99332">&quot;But what I did was wrong! Countless innocents died by my actions and countless friends as well. To feel no guilt, no remorse, is to become cold to the world. It would be inhuman. Is that what you ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="99333">&quot;Thank you, &lt;FirstName&gt;. The ability to take responsibility for my past is the only dignity that still remains to me... Is there anything you would ask in its stead?&quot;</string>
<string name="99334">&quot;I suppose the gods have their mysteries. But what is commanded in their tongue must have their sanction, for good or ill. By your command, I am atoned... Is there anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="99335">&quot;Then I will not suffer, you have my word. It shall be as you command. Is there anything more you would ask of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="99336">&quot;A curse, then, upon your descendants. May they each come to know despair... It will be as you command. Have you any other sufferings to heap upon me?&quot;</string>
<string name="99337">&quot;My soul? But that is all I have! I know not what power it might grant you but, without it, I will join the Lost... Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="99338">&quot;For that, I thank you. Please, &lt;FirstName&gt;, stop this madness! For my sake, I beg you, ask nothing more...&quot;</string>
<string name="99339">&quot;As you command, &lt;FirstName&gt;...&quot;</string>
<string name="99340">&quot;But I am a paladin again, something I could not have achieved without you! ...Yet this is your command and I must obey... Damn you, &lt;FirstName&gt;, let there be nothing more you would ask of me!&quot;</string>
<string name="99341">&quot;But how can it be love? ...Alas, you have commanded me and I will love you in whatever fashion I am able until the end of my days... Is there anything else you demand of me?&quot;</string>
<string name="99342">[ROMANCE 1] &quot;It&apos;s just... All I ever wanted was to be loved. Is it too late? I mean, what if I go through that portal and there&apos;s nothing there for me on the other side? I can&apos;t bear to simply relive things, lose myself in the past...&quot;</string>
<string name="99343">&quot;But do you love me, &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="99344">&quot;More than anything in all the world. My only regret is that I had to die to find you. If you cannot love me in return, I understand. It was in hell that I met you, after all... But please, do you love me? Can you love me?&quot;</string>
<string name="99345">&quot;No? ...I suppose I should have known. Some things are too much to hope for in one life or the next.&quot;</string>
<string name="99346">&quot;Yes, well... loving you was against my better judgment, too...&quot;</string>
<string name="99347">&quot;And I with mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="99348">&quot;As you are mine.&quot;</string>
<string name="99349">You can feel Aribeth&apos;s malevolent eyes boring into you. You can tell she has something to say but she seems intent on making you be the one to ask her.</string>

<string name="99354">&quot;For the truly black at heart, hell holds all the pleasure that a paladin might find in heaven. Perhaps even a little more, if I dare say so myself...&quot;</string>
<string name="99355">&quot;Given the choice, I would make it a little warmer... And a lot more black, I think.&quot;</string>
<string name="99356">&quot;What more is there to say of hell, really...&quot;</string>
<string name="99357">&quot;I look good in black, that&apos;s all... What makes hell so horrible is its arbitrary nature, you see? If it were black for a reason, then that blackness would lose its power over the minds of its inhabitants.&quot;</string>
<string name="99358">&quot;I am beginning to think that it would not even be necessary. Mephistopheles has abandoned Cania. He hopes to make Toril his throne now. With a little ambition, all things in hell are possible.&quot;</string>
<string name="99359">&quot;He doesn&apos;t need it anymore. He who rules the deepest hell of Baator rules them all! Asmodeus rules the Ninth but our friend is hoping to turn Toril into the Tenth and thereby seize the prize.&quot;</string>
<string name="99360">&quot;According to my temple training, the outer planes are divinely morphic: He (or She) who rules the plane can also shape it. Why all this ice and lava side by side? It is because Mephistopheles made it so.&quot;</string>
<string name="99361">&quot;Yes, I toil over them within my heart, fashioning them into the shape that will be my vengeance...&quot;</string>
<string name="99362">&quot;That is why I refuse to forget it, &lt;FirstName&gt;. Fools must not be suffered. They must be purged and their foolish blood must form a paint so we can write our curses on their walls... So shall it be in Neverwinter.&quot;</string>
<string name="99363">&quot;I keep thinking of Lord Nasher as he stood before the mob to announce that both Fenthick and Desther were to be hung. I know now what it is I saw in him... Fear. Cold, hard fear.&quot;</string>
<string name="99364">&quot;Perhaps... But I keep thinking of Lord Nasher as he stood before the mob to announce that both Fenthick and Desther were to be hung. I know now what it is I saw in him... Fear. Cold, hard fear.&quot;</string>
<string name="99365">&quot;Don&apos;t you see? The mob in the streets, in their plague-struck squalor, held more power than a lord sitting in comfort on his throne! He ruled them but even so, he feared them.&quot;</string>
<string name="99366">&quot;In the end, I could only hate Lord Nasher for so much. He was but a single man, a single vessel for my wrath and my wrath overflowed. It was upon the mob that I truly swore my vengeance...&quot;</string>
<string name="99367">&quot;Lord Nasher insisted that, as paladin of Tyr, I be the one to declare their guilt but I refused. The old man didn&apos;t want to face the crowds waiting outside the temple doors.&quot;</string>
<string name="99368">&quot;But I made him do it and in that moment I could tell that he was a small little man and that he hated me. And when Desther fell and his neck snapped and his feet dangled... I knew I was transformed.&quot;</string>
<string name="99369">&quot;They were both fools. I told myself I loved the former and I suffered the latter in silence. I should have taken the chance to kill them both when I had it. Instead I left them to Lord Nasher and the mob.&quot;</string>
<string name="99370">&quot;Desther posed as a Tyrist come from afar to serve the church but instead he spread disease with every blessing. Fenthick refused to see it and how could I doubt the man I told myself I loved...&quot;</string>
<string name="99371">--------- Random Conversations begin here ----------</string>
<string name="99372">&quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Come, let us ignore the pale-faced Knower for a spell and see if we can free the generals in her stead...&quot;</string>
<string name="99373">&quot;That much is true. We face a cunning and ruthless adversary. We must be cunning and ruthless in return... But you&apos;re right. Blinded by their fury, these generals would be nothing more than fodder.&quot;</string>
<string name="99374">&quot;It is names that hold power and the Knower of Names we must find. Let us pry from her every name she knows. With that as our arsenal, we will be invincible!&quot;</string>
<string name="99375">&quot;Well there&apos;s only one way to find out, isn&apos;t there... Are you not tempted by their power?&quot;</string>
<string name="99376">&quot;What are you implying, &lt;FirstName&gt;? I was a traitor too, if you haven&apos;t forgotten...&quot;</string>
<string name="99377">&quot;I already have... But as I was saying, we have some generals to consider...&quot;</string>
<string name="99378">&quot;Well you should have, you fool! I would betray you in a heartbeat if I thought it to be in my interest! Every moment of my loyalty, you grow deeper in my debt. Someday I will call it in... Now, about these generals...&quot;</string>
<string name="99379">&quot;Good. Because I never said you were wrong... Now, about these generals...&quot;</string>
<string name="99380">&quot;It&apos;s in the Neverwinter Wood, northeast of the city. Fenthick first kissed me there and we carved our initials in the tree... I was such a stupid girl. I should have burned that forest down!&quot;</string>
<string name="99381">&quot;After they hung him I fled into the woods and found our tree and curled between its roots. I could have burnt it then but instead I cried like a weak-willed girl and swore my vengeance.&quot;</string>
<string name="99382">&quot;No, I knew it even then. I didn&apos;t love him but it felt so good just to be loved... After they hung him, I fled to our tree in the woods and cried like my heart was broken and swore my vengeance.&quot;</string>
<string name="99383">&quot;And I died young, too, and so did he. After they hung him I fled into the woods and found our tree and curled between its roots. I cried like a baby and swore my vengeance.&quot;</string>
<string name="99384">&quot;I will have that vengeance still, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Go. Talk to this Knower of Places, wring from her the information that we need, and let us be done with this place. It holds too many memories of past weakness.&quot;</string>
<string name="99385">&quot;It&apos;s not from here. I don&apos;t think any of these places are. I don&apos;t even think we&apos;re in Cania anymore, &lt;FirstName&gt;... Can you imagine having this kind of power?&quot;</string>
<string name="99386">&quot;But how could she know about that tree?&quot;</string>
<string name="99387">&quot;But that tree...&quot;</string>
<string name="99388">&quot;No, it had my initials in it... and a heart... I&apos;m telling you, I know that tree!&quot;</string>
<string name="99389">&quot;That one that flew by, just as we entered!&quot;</string>
<string name="99390">&quot;Play the fool if you wish, it&apos;s none of my business...&quot;</string>
<string name="99391">&quot;No, it seems more appropriate that you suffer the indignity of my presence...&quot;</string>
<string name="99392">&quot;You think so, do you honey? That&apos;s nice but I prefer to prey on men... Now go retrieve your clothes. Your corpulent flesh disgusts me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99393">&quot;How much is it worth to you, my dear? 70,000 gold?&quot;</string>
<string name="99394">&quot;Mum&apos;s the word, honey bunch.&quot;</string>
<string name="99395">&quot;I threw that away long ago, princess... Now go put some other clothes on. Your corpulent flesh disgusts me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99396">&quot;Don&apos;t get me started, darling...&quot;</string>
<string name="99397">[MALE] &quot;If I would have known you&apos;d be so easy to disrobe...&quot;</string>
<string name="99398">&quot;A touchy subject, is it? I&apos;ll have to remember that... Go retrieve your clothes, then. Your corpulent flesh disgusts me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99399">&quot;Not so fast, &lt;FirstName&gt;. I set the rules and you follow them. If you&apos;re a good boy, I might even tell you that I love you. For now, let&apos;s just say I&apos;ve taken a carnal interest...&quot; [SET ROMANCE TO 1]</string>
<string name="99400">&quot;I may be dead, &lt;FirstName&gt;, but the pleasures of the flesh are still as alluring and there are things I never had the chance to do in life... I will not promise you my love or loyalty but my lust is yours.&quot; [SET ROMANCE TO 1]</string>

<string name="99403">&quot;I feel like he&apos;s judging me, all right? He&apos;s a celestial, an angel. Perhaps he&apos;s even in Tyr&apos;s service... I have made my decisions and I will not be judged! Not by him, not by anyone.&quot;</string>
<string name="99404">&quot;Fine, then let&apos;s be done with it. You had better know what you&apos;re doing...&quot;</string>
<string name="99405">&quot;He&apos;s fast asleep just like I&apos;m long dead... There may be some truth to it but it doesn&apos;t tell the whole story.&quot;</string>
<string name="99406">&quot;I don&apos;t know. He wants something from us, though, just like we want something from him. I can feel it. I can see it in how he sleeps... I just don&apos;t like owing favors to angels...&quot;</string>

<string name="99413">&quot;Don&apos;t be silly, &lt;FirstName&gt;. You don&apos;t need to command me by my True Name for that! To the contrary, I revel in it. The books of history will remember me as a great evil... Anything more?&quot;</string>
<string name="99414">&quot;My soul? But that is all I have! I know not what power it might grant you but, without it, I will join the Lost... Are you sure this is what you want?&quot;</string>
<string name="99415">&quot;For that, I thank you. Is there anything else you would force upon me?&quot;</string>

<string name="99429">------- This line must be placed at the end of inter-party banter ---------</string>
<string name="99430">&quot;Must you always seek out the light? I am an assassin, Aribeth, a Red Sister. It is what I was born to do.&quot;</string>
<string name="99431">&quot;It&apos;s just that I turn around and you&apos;re not there...&quot;</string>
<string name="99432">&quot;Oh I&apos;m there, my Lady. I promise you that.&quot;</string>
<string name="99433">&quot;But if I can&apos;t see you, how do I know you&apos;re not...&quot;</string>
<string name="99434">&quot;Not what? Not about to slice your throat? Slice &lt;FirstName&gt;&apos;s? Look, I&apos;ve known &lt;him/her&gt; longer than you. &lt;FirstName&gt; *chose* me. You&apos;re the one who shouldn&apos;t be trusted!&quot;</string>
<string name="99435">&quot;What do you mean? &lt;He/She&gt; saved me from becoming one of the Lost! I have something to live for again! Why can&apos;t you trust me?&quot;</string>
<string name="99436">&quot;I should ask the same of you but if you want my answer, here it is: You make it look a little too easy! A few empty words and suddenly you&apos;re born again!&quot;</string>
<string name="99437">&quot;I&apos;ve lived all my life on the knife edge, trying to figure out right from wrong, good from evil, and I&apos;m still on that knife edge! There is no resolution, no happily ever after! So why should there be for you?&quot;</string>
<string name="99438">&quot;This is my happily ever after? Cursed to wander a frozen hell in penance for my crimes, hounded by an arrogant drow who believes she&apos;s the only one who&apos;s ever suffered?&quot;</string>
<string name="99439">&quot;When the dawn comes, sure it comes all at once but that doesn&apos;t make the night before it any shorter! I&apos;ve had my night already. I lived through it, I died through it... Maybe you&apos;ll have to do the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="99440">&quot;Please, just leave me alone, all right?&quot;</string>
<string name="99441">&quot;I keep my own counsel, spirit, and recommend you do the same.&quot;</string>
<string name="99442">&quot;But I&apos;m curious, my sister... Who was this Val&apos;sharess you served?&quot;</string>
<string name="99443">&quot;She was the leader of the house I was sworn to protect.&quot;</string>
<string name="99444">&quot;And powerful, too, I hear...&quot;</string>
<string name="99445">&quot;She was greatly feared, yes... But in the end she was weak. Her power was not her own. She relied on a male&apos;s power, on Mephistopheles, and that is why she fell.&quot;</string>
<string name="99446">[PC IS FEMALE] &quot;Yes, it is a good thing that we are all women here. Men bring nothing but despair and the treachery of the heart.&quot;</string>

<string name="99450">&quot;You are still young, little sister. There will come a time when it will become clear to you that there is no one left worth serving.&quot;</string>
<string name="99451">&quot;Yes, Aribeth... I understand.&quot;</string>
<string name="99452">[PC IS MALE] &quot;Like you rely on &lt;FirstName&gt;?&quot;</string>
<string name="99453">&quot;I rely on nothing but the sharpness of my blades and my training as a Red Sister! Leave &lt;FirstName&gt; out of this!&quot;</string>
<string name="99454">&quot;But how, little sister? It is because of him that we are here, it is his quest we follow. In the end, who will be saved? Your precious Seer? My Neverwinter? Don&apos;t be a fool!&quot;</string>
<string name="99455">&quot;I didn&apos;t exactly ask to come to hell! It was thrust upon me, just as you were! That &lt;FirstName&gt; is trapped here as well has nothing to do with it!&quot;</string>
<string name="99456">&quot;Have you grown so used to not being seen that now you cannot see yourself? &lt;FirstName&gt; has everything to do with it! This is his story, can&apos;t you tell?&quot;</string>
<string name="99457">&quot;Then when I get the chance, I will make it my own!&quot;</string>
<string name="99458">&quot;As will I, little sister. As will I...&quot;</string>
<string name="99459">&quot;I keep hearing voices, m&apos;Lady. It is as if the very essence of this plane hunts me. And then the anger, it just builds and builds in me. Gah! I don&apos;t know how much longer I can contain it all.&quot;</string>
<string name="99460">&quot;Listen to my voice, then. Focus on my voice and tune all the others out. The outer planes live and breathe of their own accord. Devils are literally borne of Cania&apos;s essence, like fruit from a larger tree.&quot;</string>
<string name="99461">&quot;I cannot do it, m&apos;Lady! I will never make it home. I am a demon in Baator, it will never let me leave!&quot;</string>
<string name="99462">&quot;You must. I will help you. I was one of the Lost, remember? I was one with this plane but for a moment, like sap in the tree. It cannot hurt you, it cannot claim you. It can only take you if you give yourself to it.&quot;</string>
<string name="99463">&quot;Listen to my voice... Cania, it is I, the Lady Aribeth, the one who was Lost within you but then was Found. This man, Valen, is not your enemy. He will pass through you like the wind and then be gone...&quot;</string>
<string name="99464">&quot;Let him go. His blood is of the Tanar&apos;ri, of your enemies in the Abyss, but his heart is of the world of Toril which is not yours to claim. Listen to my voice, the voice of one who was Lost, and let him go...&quot;</string>
<string name="99465">&quot;It... It&apos;s receding. The voices... Thank you, m&apos;Lady. I dare not think what would have become of me had you not been here.&quot;</string>
<string name="99466">&quot;Don&apos;t thank me yet, Valen. Just pray it doesn&apos;t come back before we return home. If it does, it will want us both and it will be very, very mad... Come on, let&apos;s keep moving.&quot;</string>
<string name="99467">&quot;Why do you still haunt me, ghost? I am the one who grows stronger. If the demon in me grows, it is because it is but half of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99468">&quot;Or are you but half of it? Only half of your father&apos;s greatness, only half your father&apos;s power... Look at you grow, Valen. How long until your true nature eats a hole through this thin coat of righteousness?&quot;</string>
<string name="99469">&quot;You&apos;re just a spirit! You know nothing of my fate, of what will or will not be!&quot;</string>
<string name="99470">&quot;Do you really believe that, Valen? I am of the dead. I am one whose fate is long since spent. In a way, I am your destiny. I am what you will become. Mark my words: The demon in you grows and will soon consume you.&quot;</string>
<string name="99471">&quot;Lies! I would rather kill myself than be consumed!&quot;</string>
<string name="99472">&quot;Then it seems you have a decision to make, don&apos;t you, Valen...&quot;</string>
<string name="99473">&quot;I will take you with me if I go, devil!&quot;</string>
<string name="99474">&quot;Really? How romantic... Very well, you know where I sleep.&quot;</string>
<string name="99475">&quot;A little, Lady Aribeth. I anger more quickly here and it always feels as if something watches me... What of you?&quot;</string>
<string name="99476">&quot;Thanks to &lt;FirstName&gt;, I must admit that hell has not been the torment I had expected. I deserved far worse, that I know. In many ways, my soul is less troubled now than it had been in life.&quot;</string>
<string name="99477">&quot;Perhaps Cania does not affect me as much as it might some other tieflings. My father was a demon, after all, rather than a devil. He would only have come to Baator in times of battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="99478">&quot;The Blood War.&quot;</string>
<string name="99479">&quot;Yes, the war between evils. I admit that my yearning to paint my blade with Mephistopheles&apos; black blood stems from more than just vengeance or the cause of good. The demon in me wants it as well.&quot;</string>
<string name="99480">&quot;That is fair, as long as the human in you wants it as well. You may not think it but your mother&apos;s heritage is strong in you and far more vital in the end.&quot;</string>
<string name="99481">&quot;Thank you, Aribeth. Those are heartening words to hear in this cold place.&quot;</string>
<string name="99482">&quot;What do you mean, dead one...&quot;</string>
<string name="99483">&quot;You are in hell, now, tiefling. Does your fiendish blood boil here, bubble up to reach the surface? If ever there was a time to tap your father&apos;s heritage...&quot;</string>
<string name="99484">&quot;I chart my own course, witch. Neither my father&apos;s nor my mother&apos;s but one between. Besides, my father was a demon, not a devil. If his blood were to boil here, it would be of rage and the smell of battle.&quot;</string>
<string name="99485">&quot;Evil is evil, fool! It is the Blood War that holds us back! The forces of good are weak but at least they stand united. Meanwhile we children of evil prey upon each other, wasting all our strength and cunning!&quot;</string>
<string name="99486">&quot;Look, woman, I&apos;m no general and from what I hear, you weren&apos;t all that great a one yourself! I&apos;ve heard the story of Neverwinter... If you&apos;re so cunning, how come you&apos;re dead?&quot;</string>
<string name="99487">&quot;Enough!&quot;</string>
<string name="99488">&quot;You were captured and executed! You&apos;re nothing but a story now! A footnote! Nobody cares!&quot;</string>
<string name="99489">&quot;Enough...&quot;</string>
<string name="99490">&quot;Nobody cares... So either you work with me or you don&apos;t. I didn&apos;t pick this fight, all right? I&apos;m just here to do a job and get home again...&quot;</string>
<string name="99491">&quot;Deekin is cold all right but not too cold. He wears socks!&quot;</string>
<string name="99492">&quot;You wear socks? How delightful!&quot;</string>
<string name="99493">&quot;Wool socks. Deekin&apos;s grandma made them for him long ago. And mittens. &apos;Don&apos;t forget to sun on the rocks!&apos; she&apos;d always say. Or &apos;You&apos;ll catch your death of cold, you will!&apos; Then she&apos;d feed Deekin insects. The yummy ones.&quot;</string>
<string name="99494">&quot;It&apos;s strange to think back to Neverwinter and my days in the temple there. Everything seemed so black and white. I never would have known that a kobold could be so charming...&quot;</string>
<string name="99495">&quot;Of course, it&apos;s very hard to strum a lute with one&apos;s mittens on... Gloves would have been a lot more practical, Deekin thinks... Do you know how to knit, Miss Aribeth?&quot;</string>
<string name="99496">&quot;Ha! No, Deekin, I haven&apos;t a clue how to knit! I&apos;m afraid it was one of those things that just didn&apos;t seem important at the time... When we get home, maybe your grandma can teach me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99497">&quot;For you, anything, Miss Aribeth! She does talk your ear off, though. Something about snow being over her head and paths running uphill both ways. It never made any sense to Deekin.&quot;</string>
<string name="99498">&quot;Deekin wears socks!&quot;</string>
<string name="99499">&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;</string>
<string name="99500">&quot;Wool socks. Deekin&apos;s grandma made them for him long ago. And mittens. &apos;Don&apos;t forget to sun on the rocks!&apos; she&apos;d always say. Or &apos;You&apos;ll catch your death of cold, you will!&apos; Then she&apos;d feed Deekin insects. The yummy ones.&quot;</string>
<string name="99501">&quot;Forget I asked...&quot;</string>
<string name="99502">&quot;Of course, it&apos;s very hard to strum a lute with one&apos;s mittens on... Gloves would have been a lot more practical, Deekin thinks... Do you know how to knit? ...Miss Aribeth? ...Hello?&quot;</string>
<string name="99503">&quot;Deekin writes a new song for if... for when he goes back to his kobold home.&quot;</string>
<string name="99504">&quot;Don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ll get you home, little one. You have my word... In the meantime, maybe you could sing that song for me...&quot;</string>
<string name="99505">&quot;Deekin not finished yet but it go like this: &apos;The mighty wise kobold, Deekin the Green got sent to hell by aaaaccident. He did nothing wrong! Honest, it&apos;s true! He got sent to hell by aaaaccident...&apos;&quot;</string>
<string name="99506">&quot;There now, I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll understand. And it sounds like it will be a very nice song...&quot;</string>
<string name="99507">&quot;It rhymes better in kobold, of course...&quot;</string>
<string name="99508">&quot;I&apos;m sure it does, little one. I&apos;m sure it does.&quot;</string>
<string name="99509">&quot;Deekin not be underfoot! Your foot always be over Deekin! Bad foot! Bad!&quot;</string>
<string name="99510">&quot;Bad? Your little brain can&apos;t comprehend even half of what it means to be bad, lizard. Do you want me to show you what bad really is?&quot;</string>
<string name="99511">&quot;Umm... not really, evil lady.&quot;</string>
<string name="99512">&quot;Not really? You&apos;re like an insolent child... Call me by my name!&quot;</string>
<string name="99513">&quot;N-not really, M-miss Aribeth...&quot;</string>
<string name="99514">&quot;Good. Then stay out from underfoot as I commanded in the first place... And leave me alone...&quot;</string>
<string name="99515">&quot;He was devouring us, eating our very souls to build his army... I&apos;ll serve no army! Never again! I served Tyr, I served Lord Nasher, I served Morag and her Old Ones! All my life I&apos;ve worn their colors, waved their flags...&quot;</string>
<string name="99516">&quot;I&apos;ll not serve Mephistopheles now, after I&apos;ve gambled and lost so much! ...So yes, I challenged him. The other spirits thought I did it for them but they are fools. I serve only myself, now.&quot;</string>
<string name="99517">&quot;Mephistopheles found humor in my challenge and heard me out, listening patiently until I ran out of words to speak. There, in the silence, he gave voice to the one secret I have harbored within me for so long...&quot;</string>
<string name="99518">&quot;Fenthick Moss, cleric of Tyr, hung as a traitor, the man I was about to marry, the man I&apos;ve always said I loved... I never loved him... I never loved him and somehow Mephistopheles knew the truth.&quot;</string>
<string name="99519">&quot;Don&apos;t you see? When they hung him, I abandoned my church, my faith, my god. I led an army of evil against Neverwinter, my own city. I wrought destruction on the world and damned my soul to hell...&quot;</string>
<string name="99520">&quot;And to have not done that out of love, out of grief, out of righteous anger? My entire life has been a lie. A paladin of vanity, a blackguard of denial, they were equal poisons coursing through my veins.&quot;</string>
<string name="99521">&quot;Isn&apos;t there? Evil is a choice you make. That is the source of its power. Failing to do good is simply complacency, sloth. True evil is the wilful pursuit of corruption and villainy.&quot;</string>
<string name="99522">&quot;Evil for evil&apos;s sake... You present an argument I can&apos;t refute, firestarter. Very well, my hatred of the world has been fueled by your fire and hardened by this ice...&quot;</string>
<string name="99523">&quot;Hell... Cania... You present an argument I can&apos;t refute, firestarter. One can only fight one&apos;s destiny for so long. Very well, my hatred of the world has been fueled by your fire and hardened by this ice...&quot;</string>
<string name="99524">&quot;On this blade, on my names, both true and given, and on all the devils in the depths of hell, I commit all the days that remain to me to the pursuit of evil for evil&apos;s sake. May they learn to fear me!&quot;</string>
<string name="99525">&quot;Nonsense. I was wretched at it. Plagued by guilt, blinded by anger, filled with doubt... In life, I played at being evil, nothing more.&quot;</string>
<string name="99526">&quot;I have had my vengeance and while it lasted, it was sweet indeed. As for power, I have no taste for it. If I am to be evil, I will be evil for evil&apos;s sake itself. There is no evil more cold than that.&quot;</string>
<string name="99527">&quot;Yes, I do. I doubt everything, even myself. Gods can make mistakes, as can devils, as can ghosts, as can mortals. How could Tyr still want me after all I&apos;ve done?&quot; </string>
<string name="99528">&quot;I did, I truly did. It&apos;s true I did not love Fenthick but there was no justice in his hanging, just appeasement of a mob and the weakness of an aging ruler.&quot;</string>
<string name="99529">&quot;Justice... You present an argument I can&apos;t refute, firestarter. Perhaps my faith has been refined by your fire and strengthened by this ice. Very well, I shall do as you say...&quot;</string>
<string name="99530">&quot;Let Tyr decide... You present an argument I can&apos;t refute, firestarter. Perhaps my faith has been refined by your fire and strengthened by this ice. Very well, I shall do as you say...&quot;</string>
<string name="99531">&quot;No, but I acted all the same. Righteous is the one who does what&apos;s right when surrounded on all sides by evil.&quot;</string>
<string name="99532">&quot;Righteous... You present an argument I can&apos;t refute, firestarter. Perhaps my faith has been refined by your fire and strengthened by this ice. Very well, I shall do as you say...&quot;</string>
<string name="99533">&quot;On this blade, on my names, both true and given, and on all the good and evil I have done in life, I commit all the days that remain to me, for better or for worse, to Tyr and to his justice. Let it be so!&quot;</string>
<string name="99534">&quot;I don&apos;t see Tyr down here in the Hell&apos;s... I don&apos;t need some god to take responsibility for what I&apos;ve done. I made my actions knowingly and knowingly I pay the price.&quot;</string>
<string name="99535">&quot;As a paladin, I was loved, I was venerated, I was lifted up unto that narrow pedestal. In their eyes, I could do no wrong nor speak no ill. What would you have done in my place?&quot;</string>
<string name="99536">&quot;If you tell someone they are perfect, they will show you they are flawed... I sowed the seeds of my own destruction because I needed humbling. So did all those who made such high demands of me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99537">&quot;Then he has succeeded, for here I am in the middle of things, neither good nor evil, neither paladin nor blackguard, wanting nothing but to become nothing and meld my soul into the essence of Cania.&quot;</string>
<string name="99538">&quot;He was a well-intentioned fool but a fool nonetheless. But he was young and a priest of the Church I served. To marry him was to marry the Church. It all seemed too perfect to be wrong...&quot;</string>
<string name="99539">&quot;Then why do I know his words are true? I never loved Fenthick... I wish I had.&quot;</string>
<string name="99540">Lady Aribeth runs her ghostly fingers through her hair. You can feel her tension channeling through you, passing through your bones and dissipating.</string>
<string name="99541">&quot;What of it? I have seen evil done in a good man&apos;s name and nobility in a cause the good despised. Does that make me good? Does that make me evil? No, only cynical and jaded and weary of the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="99542">&quot;That&apos;s funny. I don&apos;t think I know myself anymore. I know my name, I know the facts and details, I know the story of my fall... I was once a paladin of Tyr, there was a plague, I loved a man...&quot;</string>
<string name="99543">&quot;All of it seems like some horrible fairy tale, like a story about someone else from long ago. Maybe that&apos;s all it was... Maybe that&apos;s how you knew it as well. I don&apos;t know... I try to forget those times.&quot;</string>
<string name="99544">&quot;Do you want the truth? What if I told you that I don&apos;t like who I was in life. I don&apos;t even know if I like who I am now. It seems better to become one of the Lost, numb even to memories.&quot;</string>
<string name="99545">&quot;I see that...&quot;</string>
<string name="99546">&quot;What do you care indeed, firestarter... So leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="99547">&quot;No, I don&apos;t think you do. Please, leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="99548">&quot;I do. Please, just leave me be.&quot;</string>
<string name="99549">&quot;Why did you light that fire?&quot;</string>
<string name="99550">&quot;Yes, but I was trying to be forgotten... I attacked you for your memory.&quot;</string>
<string name="99551">&quot;And I have answers I had no intention to give. I attacked you for your curiosity.&quot;</string>
<string name="99552">&quot;Maybe so but it was my mistake to make. I attacked you for your self-righteousness.&quot;</string>
<string name="99553">&quot;You know nothing of torture, of anguish, of pain! I attacked you for your ignorance.&quot;</string>
<string name="99554">&quot;Well I didn&apos;t need yours so I attacked you for your selfishness.&quot;</string>
<string name="99555">&quot;What makes you think I want your pity? I attacked you for your arrogance.&quot;</string>
<string name="99556">&quot;I&apos;m a traitor, will you trust me? I&apos;m dead, will you return me to life? I&apos;m hated, will you love me? I&apos;ve lost my innocence, will you help me find it? ...Save your breath. There are some things you can&apos;t get back.&quot;</string>
<string name="99557">&quot;You have &apos;saved&apos; me for a foolish question of faith? What makes you think I have the answers? Go beg the gods for your precious answers and may they spite you as they have me.&quot;</string>
<string name="99558">&quot;There&apos;s the rub, isn&apos;t it? Everyone wants answers and we&apos;ll travel to the ends of everything to find them, only to learn that they were never there to begin with.&quot;</string>
<string name="99559">&quot;I played the Sensei&apos;s little game, I learned her Five-Fold Precious Mysteries, and to what end? The dreams of the Sleeping Man are just that: dreams... They can be shattered like any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="99560">&quot;Must I? I played the Sensei&apos;s little game, I learned her Five-Fold Precious Mysteries, and to what end? The dreams of the Sleeping Man are just that: dreams... They can be shattered like any other.&quot;</string>
<string name="99561">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Failure]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;If it&apos;s so important to you, then you don&apos;t deserve to know. Perhaps that will teach not to disturb a Lady&apos;s rest...&quot;</string>
<string name="99562">&lt;StartCheck&gt;[Success]&lt;/Start&gt; &quot;You want to know the answer? The Fifth-Fold Mystery? &apos;She will find you by the Gates of Cania.&apos; That&apos;s your foolish answer. Make of it what you will, firestarter.&quot;</string>
<string name="99563">&quot;They made a corpse of the man I loved, a mockery of the justice I believed in, and a demon of the woman I became. You should have let me join the Lost for I have little else to keep me here.&quot;</string>
<string name="99564">&quot;And who are you to ask such a thing? Please, it is better that I forget him... It would be better yet to forget it all... Just leave me be.&quot;</string>

<string name="99682">&quot;No, I won&apos;t allow it.&quot;</string>
<string name="99683">&quot;Assuming you can leave Cania...&quot;</string>

<string name="99691">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="99692">&quot;Much as I expected, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="99693">&quot;It must be horrible for you!&quot;</string>
<string name="99694">&quot;It could be worse...&quot;</string>
<string name="99695">&quot;What exactly happened in Neverwinter, anyway?&quot;</string>
<string name="99696">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>

<string name="99807">&quot;What are you going to do when all this is over?&quot;</string>
<string name="99808">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>

<string name="99814">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="99815">&quot;I&apos;m glad I could help.&quot;</string>

<string name="99824">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="99825">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="99826">&quot;How did you die? How did you end up here?&quot;</string>
<string name="99827">&quot;Yet they defeated you...&quot;</string>
<string name="99828">&quot;But why? What drove you to such an end?&quot;</string>
<string name="99829">&quot;You didn&apos;t love Fenthick?&quot;</string>
<string name="99830">&quot;Whose army did you lead?&quot;</string>
<string name="99831">&quot;But before that. You lived there, didn&apos;t you?&quot;</string>
<string name="99832">&quot;What hypocrisy?&quot;</string>
<string name="99833">&quot;Not right now, Aribeth. Stay warm.&quot;</string>
<string name="99834">&quot;Yes, I&apos;d like you to travel with me again.&quot;</string>
<string name="99835">&quot;Not really. I just wanted to rub your nose in it a little.&quot;</string>
<string name="99836">&quot;Come along but keep your comments to yourself.&quot;</string>
<string name="99837">&quot;Sorry, not now. We&apos;ll talk about it later.&quot;</string>
<string name="99838">&quot;Yes, Aribeth?&quot;</string>
<string name="99839">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="99840">&quot;Well I have no time to hear your religious lectures.&quot;</string>

<string name="99843">&quot;The Hells are a little colder than I expected, that&apos;s for sure.&quot;</string>
<string name="99844">&quot;Back to my other questions.&quot;</string>
<string name="99845">&quot;Why ice and lava? It doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot;</string>
<string name="99846">&quot;Mephistopheles is coming back, isn&apos;t he?&quot;</string>
<string name="99847">&quot;Why would he just abandon this place?&quot;</string>

<string name="99849">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="99850">&quot;Keep them to yourself. I have no time to hear them.&quot;</string>

<string name="99853">&quot;Not happy memories, I assume?&quot;</string>
<string name="99854">&quot;Why would Lord Nasher have been scared?&quot;</string>
<string name="99855">&quot;Tell me of the hanging.&quot;</string>
<string name="99856">&quot;Tell me of Fenthick and Desther.&quot;</string>
<string name="99857">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="99858">&quot;That&apos;s a responsibility I&apos;ll shoulder, then.&quot;</string>
<string name="99859">&quot;Don&apos;t worry. All we want is the Gatekeeper&apos;s.&quot;</string>
<string name="99860">&quot;If that&apos;s what it takes to do good in the world.&quot;</string>
<string name="99861">&quot;Hold on, we need to free her first.&quot;</string>
<string name="99862">&quot;Stop lecturing me, all right? I can handle it!&quot;</string>
<string name="99863">&quot;What&apos;s the matter? Scared I might learn yours?&quot;</string>
<string name="99864">&quot;I&apos;ll keep it in mind.&quot;</string>
<string name="99865">&quot;You give sound advice, Aribeth. I will heed it well.&quot;</string>
<string name="99866">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="99867">&quot;Where do you recognize it from?&quot;</string>
<string name="99868">&quot;Innocent?&quot;</string>
<string name="99869">&quot;You thought you loved him.&quot;</string>
<string name="99870">&quot;You were young.&quot;</string>
<string name="99871">&quot;But you&apos;ve never been here before.&quot;</string>
<string name="99872">&quot;Where do you recognize the tree from?&quot;</string>

<string name="99874">&quot;Don&apos;t get your hopes up.&quot;</string>
<string name="99875">&quot;It&apos;s just any old tree.&quot;</string>
<string name="99876">&quot;What tree?&quot;</string>
<string name="99877">&quot;Goodbye.&quot;</string>
<string name="99878">&quot;Yes, I&apos;m plotting a painful demise for the little beast...&quot;</string>
<string name="99879">&quot;And I couldn&apos;t help see the look of interest on yours...&quot;</string>
<string name="99880">&quot;You&apos;d be shocked too. It&apos;s rather cold down here.&quot;</string>
<string name="99881">&quot;Keep you hands to yourself, ghost. I&apos;m not interested.&quot;</string>
<string name="99882">&quot;Hey now, I thought you were supposed to be good!&quot;</string>

<string name="99897">&quot;It serves you right, you traitor...&quot;</string>
<string name="99898">&quot;Good, I&apos;m glad I&apos;m not the only one.&quot;</string>
<string name="99899">&quot;I&apos;m sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to be so harsh.&quot;</string>
<string name="99900">&quot;Yes, I can. There&apos;s a happiness here.&quot;</string>
<string name="99901">&quot;All right, let&apos;s get down to business.&quot;</string>
<string name="99902">&quot;It&apos;s good to see you happy.&quot;</string>
<string name="99903">&quot;That&apos;s how you are, too, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</string>
<string name="99904">&quot;It&apos;s all in your head. Now stop your prancing around.&quot;</string>
<string name="99905">&quot;I just want to go home, Aribeth.&quot;</string>
<string name="99906">&quot;Fine, I can feel it! But you can&apos;t make me like it...&quot;</string>

<string name="99914">&quot;True, I must face Mephistopheles with no evil in my heart.&quot;</string>
